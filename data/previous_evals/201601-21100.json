   "comments": [
    "This class is a bit strange. The professor is obviously very knowledgable, but the content of the course meanders in a way that rarely matches with the assignments for the course. You learn about design of lots of things. You don't do any computer science. You complete assignments that involve you designing things. I kinda liked it, but it also felt like it could have been more rigorous. This class would have been much better as a seminar.",
    "Professor Gelernter is a strange mixture of bumbling idiot and eccentric genius. He invariably showed up to class late, disheveled and out of breath. His wardrobe appeared to consist solely of two shirts, two sport coats, and a pair of khakis that hang dangerously low, defying both gravitational law and anatomical convention. The course itself was extremely disorganized. Did Gelernter ever post anything to v2? Three times. Did he ever send an email to the class? Once. Did he cancel three lectures in a row with zero explanation? Yes. There appear to have been no substantive educational objectives. There was no assigned reading and no coherent framework. There was no work except for a brief quiz that consisted of sketching the Breuer Chair, the Barcelona Chair, and the Wells Strainer Arch; four slides; and two brief prototypes for a GUI. Over half the class skipped lecture consistently after the first few weeks. This course is not worth your time, even though it will consume very little of it. Im not sure how Yale College can approve courses like this while claiming to be an institution of higher education. The entire course could be condensed into an essay or two. That said, this counts as an Advanced CS elective. If youre choosing between 440 and 451, the latter is the better choice.",
    "Absolutely do not take this course. Prof. Gelernter is terrible at communicating with his students, and he is not a timely man. There are only five assignments, and they all suck. I did not learn ANYTHING about how to make a GUI. You're much better off taking Numerical Computation for a gut CS credit.",
    "The course has a lot of potential. Professor Gelernter is fascinating and the material is very interesting. Nonetheless, the course became very disorganized. We only made it through about half of the material on the syllabus and we spent a few months on one or two topics. The course would benefit from clearer lesson plans, focus on the topic at hand, and a commitment to moving at a steady pace. Ultimately, you'll learn about a few really interesting things and have a reasonable workload. However, you might also be confused and disengaged.",
    "This class is really bad. You barely learn anything and only have 4 small assignments, all of which are described very ambiguously but then graded very harshly. Gelernter is a bad lecturer, and didn't teach enough material to last a whole semester, so he repeats himself a lot. Also, we did not code once the entire semester.",
    "This class seems like it would, in theory, be good. It's a really interesting interdisciplinary topic. However, in practice, the course was poorly executed this year. Perhaps it was because this was the first year the class was offered, but it was disorganized and monotonous. There were very few assignments and they didn't require anything from class (so lecture attendance was very low). If you are interested in art, the best part of the class is the beginning, when we learn about classic art, architecture, and design. There were only a handful of simple assignments, but it was often unclear how they were being graded.",
    "! It's a gut. You don't need to go to lecture. The lecture topic is always whatever is on David Gelertner's mind. We didn't learn anything about design or UX besides Gelertner's opinions. We didn't learn general design principles or technical skills.",
    "This course has the potential to become fascinating. It is still in an early incarnation, and has changed from what it appeared to be at the beginning of the semester (it became a mid-sized lecture instead of a seminar). The course material was interesting, if somewhat disorganized. Many aspects of the course were somewhat unpredictable, but not in a way that made it difficult to complete course requirements. Depending on how this course changes for future terms, it could be great or it could be pretty average.",
    "Very little work and also very little learned.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. There is very little work required, but the assignments are so poorly described that many students did not end up doing well. Announcements were only made verbally throughout class, and Gelernter is not a very clear lecturer. The class is also graded entirely based on design, so it's more of an art class than a CS elective.",
    "In contrast to what I expect most reviews will say, I was pleased with this course and what I got out of it. I was looking for a gut and I felt like the effort the class put into me matched the amount of effort I put into the class. I was introduced to important figures in design and the professor was entertaining and interesting at times.",
    "The class is not much work (like, hardly any) and would be fine as a 5th but don't expect a life-changing experience. It's essentially a history of design course (as in, starting in ancient Rome) where the assignments happen to involve design projects and critiques. Those two features of the class sort of exist in different worlds. You won't learn how to use design programs or code up interaction features or anything even close to that. You're much better off as a student with art or design experience than an experienced coder or CSS fiend.",
    "The course was in its first iteration, so perhaps it will be better next year. The lectures seemed to never have anything to do with our assignments, or that much to do with user interfaces, really -- assignments were few and far between, but there was hardly anything in class that taught us how to do them. (A few design critiques, and making our own...though there never was any implementation)",
    "Interesting topic with tons of potential, but the prof got caught up in his new book release and didn't direct any effort towards the class.",
    "I would recommend the class in a couple of years. Once Gelernter established a more organized syllabus and idea of what he wants the class to be, the course will be good. The course has potential because there are not GUI classes in the Yale computer science department.",
    "Interesting, but more of a history of the UI rather than learning how to design UI ourselves. There were a couple UI projects where we designed things ourselves, but mostly we evaluated what makes a good design and learned how the modern UI came about. Lectures were not engaging but there were only a few assignments in the entire semester.",
    "It could have been a great class, but no one took it seriously so it turned out to kind of a joke. The grading was so arbitrary; I honestly have no clue what grade I got. The class often lost direction, and professor Gelernter sometimes gave undue attention to small errors like using it's instead of its. These little grammar lessons during class time were just absurd. That being said, Gelernter is obviously very knowledgeable and talented within the field of design, and when he was on topic, his lectures were informative and interesting. However, we were never tested on any of the material, so there wasn't much incentive to pay attention and so most people didn't.There should have been more design assignments and a faster feedback loop for them. There were only 4 really easy design assignments that could be done in a few hours each, give or take.",
    "I am both ashamed and thrilled that this thing exists",
    "I immensely regret taking this course; what a waste of a credit. The first few weeks of class were actually great; the professor had lecture slides and substance to what he said (granted, he is very opinionated). After the lecture slides disappeared, the course went downhill. I don't know if the professor actually prepared any lecture material. Homeworks and projects felt thrown together at the last minute, and it was difficult to find information about the assignments because the requirements were rarely posted online after being mentioned in class. There was also very little feedback in the course. I don't think I learned anything about user interface design.",
    "In fairness to Prof. Gelernter, this course was 1) meant to be a seminar but turned into a 75 minute lecture-type class because a high number of students showed interest, and 2) open to students of all experience levels with web design (including no experience--like me). This means that the course as it went this year likely did not meet anybody's expectations, including the professor's. I enjoyed the assignments, and got helpful feedback on the first few of them, but overall didn't find the lectures that helpful toward the end of the year. If you're considering shopping the course, I'd go in and see how the professor has planned to tweak or change it.",
    "the first few classes were really compelling; a CS professor speaking passionately about art history and its relation to design. but the prof went absent for weeks at a time, and classes became more ranting than structured. i never went to class after the powerpoints trailed off, but the assignments did force me to learn how to use Sketch. i would still recommend this course to someone if you want an easy courseload with projects that are not completely pointless. AKA the work I put into it resulted in personal growth, and there wasn't any busywork."
