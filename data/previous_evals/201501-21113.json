   "comments": [
    "The class which was presented as an experimental approach to exploring the Global Baroque proved to be an unbelievably exciting academic journey. The readings were extremely varied and while never particularly heavy reads always tried to take a different perspective or approach to the various themes were explored during each class. The class itself was extremely well taught and Professor Yiengpruksawan's unbelievably honest approach to everything really made it one of the best classes I have ever had the honor to take at Yale. Always upbeat and exited about the material she always got us thinking beyond the visual to the world that exists beyond the art, creating an environment that invited all students to actively engage with the art in a way that allowed us to capitalize on our unique backgrounds and explore further than any one student could have ever possibly done. What I would describe as an ideal seminar, her small 5 to 10 minute class breaks always let us get some rest from the intense academic discussions and then speak to each other about specific things we noticed or things that were said. Professor Yiengpruksawan was also clear that sometimes she wouldn't be completely sure but would always make an effort to learn and get back to us with the answers we needed or to take a look at a specific thing we were exploring. So unbelievably knowledgeable, every aspect of this seminar was handled perfectly and was by far best seminar that I have ever taken at Yale. Looking at the workload, Professor Yiengpruksawan is a very honest grader provides good feedback to the various projects carried out by students. This class, which depends a lot of class discussion, requires students to do the readings and be willing to discuss the material. The final paper or project, is what closes the course and allows the student to explore any topic that they found interesting more in depth, allowing students to tailor the class to their interests in a way that final projects or essays rarely do."
