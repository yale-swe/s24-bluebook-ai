    "This class was a disappointment. All the good reviews made me take it, and it ended up being a badly set up, disorganised and often boring class. Although the first 3 modules were fun\/informative, green engineering was totally unnecessary. The homeworks were also dumb: why did we have to spend 5 hours sketching things on solidworks? That set literally taught me nothing. Also, we did not have enough time to think about and work on the project, so most teams ended up not finishing on time (or at all, as some of them were literally impossible.) Although we expected help from the professors and the TAs on the project, we got minimal. Lab times on Friday are the worst idea in the world, plus they only give you like 5 days to complete the homework. Don't take this class unless you Cr\/d it for a 5th credit.",
    "ENAS 118 is a great class, and if you want to do things with your hands instead of sitting in a classroom all the time, TAKE THIS CLASS. This class is based on two parts: classes and related labs to teach you about different fields of engineering, and a project where you make or design something for a client with a specific problem. The labs take either no time or a lot of time depending on your experience with them, so go into each week with the mind that your workload might vary a lot. Sometimes class isn't actually very important, so if you miss a class or two it isn't a problem, as long as you actually go to lab. (sidenote: lab attendance is taken very seriously.) The best part of the class is the project. My team got to work for the Yale Farm, and other teams worked for clients like the Peabody, the Collection for Musical Instruments, and for hippo researchers. You will spend 6 weeks wrestling with ideas, development, and execution of something to give your clients. This means you will suddenly spend a lot more time on this class at the end of the semester. It was worth it to me (building a thing! yeah!) but if you have a lot of final papers, it might be a bit harder. tl;dr: take this class if you like physically doing things and not just learning facts.",
    "Great and fun intro to all the engineering fields at Yale. The class is a lot of fun. The final client projects can take up a lot of time, but it can be rewarding at the end. Would strongly recommended!",
    "I would most definitely take this class if you are looking to learn a few new skills and to meet some cool people that you will likely see again in your classes should you decide to be a STEM major. I can now say I can code, build things out of metal and wood, laser cut, 3D print and more. It was incredibly hands-on class that all my suite mates secretly wish they took with me! Definitely take this class if you can.",
    "Yes! A great class to help you decide whether or not engineering is for you.",
    "Basically a crash course on all of the CEID's offerings. No matter your field of study or your experience with engineering, you should take this class. The professors are very involved with each student, and the department clearly a lot of resources to making the course a great experience. If you ever wish you could get the first step on learning things like programming, 3D rendering, 3D printing, woodshop tools, laser cutting, or prototyping, this is your place to go. The workload varies a lot week to week. Sometimes just an hour or two, but some of the assignments were much more involved and took more. The final project can sneak up on you too if you fall behind.",
    "I would absolutely recommend 118 to any engineering majors! It's a great hands on survey engineering class, and provides a lot of direction for future study in engineering.",
    "A great class if you like the idea of making things, just be prepared to go in with some sort of existing skillset to contribute the group project as the class moves quickly and is unlikely to be transformative if you're starting from zero.",
    "Great course for anyone who wants or needs to learn about basic engineering skills. You learn enough about basic programming, electrical skills etc. to be able to start working on your own projects in the CEID. That said, its not a course for people with lots of technical skills. If you did lots of robotics or engineering clubs in highschool this is not the class for you.",
    "The class is very heavy at the beginning and then mellows out until spring break, then it picks up after spring break when you have to do the projects and I guarantee that will take up a ton of your time. Overall though, very interesting and fun course that I recommend taking no matter what your major.",
    "The class is a great exploration of each of the engineering majors. Just know that one week is spent on each topic and therefore it's not truly possible to come out of the class proficient in Processing, SolidWorks, or any of the other languages or programs used in the class. It will be a great introduction to them if that's what you're looking for. It was my favorite class of the entire year up until we starting working on group projects. The weekly labs and homeworks are engaging, cumulative, and fun and I can say I learned a lot. As the title of the class suggests, it's also a great introduction to the CEID itself. You can easily come out of this class certified to use almost everything in the building and feeling connected to the community that works there. The group projects were tedious as all group projects are. The workload for each project seems to vary and my team lucked out and had arguably the heaviest workload and it began to feel like Dufresne, Wilen, and our TA thought ENAS 118 was our only class and the project was the only thing we had to work on day in and day out which sucked during the build up to finals. This class is very necessary and better than any other major exploration class Yale has to offer so far.",
    "This is a really cool class! It is a fun introduction to engineering that steers well clear of intense math\/physics and instead focuses on hands-on building projects. That said, your experience in the class will depend heavily upon the project you are assigned for the second half of the course. Be aware that you will not be able to choose the project but will still be spending hours and hours on it every week after spring break!",
    "I think ENAS 118 is a great course if you have no experience with engineering and want to learn a little bit about different disciplines. I went into it with a decent amount of engineering knowledge and a set idea of the engineering field I wanted to go into, so I felt that this course was not necessarily the one for me.",
    "You learn about engineering during class and then put that knowledge to use during lab and the final project.",
    "ENAS 118 is a fantastic class for anyone interested in engineering. While the point of the class is supposed to be to help students narrow in a a particular field of engineering, I highly recommend it even to students who think they are set. It introduces you to technical abilities as well as resources available to Yale engineers. The 'course workload' might be slightly misleading. For the majority of the course there is a low workload - one assignment per week - but towards the end of the course the workload spikes up as you must work to complete the final project, which often requires many hours outside the regular class times. Still highly recommend the class!",
    "DEFINITELY take this class if you are thinking about engineering or even if you aren't, because it will show you why you SHOULD be. It is so low pressure but you learn so many cool, interesting, and useful things that you will not learn in any other class at Yale. ENAS 118 is so different from all other classes and really allows you to get hands on with new ideas without fear of failure or academic pressure. 100% recommend.",
    "Good course if you spend time after class to explore the topice by your self. Otherwise too vague.",
    "Awesome way to get into engineering. I came in with no experience what so ever. And as a junior, I wanted to experience engineering even though I am a bio major. I would totally recommend this course.",
    "This was a very cool course that gives you a great background in many different engineering disciplines. The weekly \"psets\" were quite difficult and very time consuming but the end of the semester project was fun.",
    "You learn lots of practical skills; definitely worth taking, but note that it's also a lot of work",
    "ENAS 118 is a great exposure to the different engineering disciplines. However, the assignments take an egregious amount of time for an essentially taster course and the class is graded very subjectively by the professors on their impression of the work you did and not necessarily on the actual work that was done.",
    "ENAS 118 introduces you to the different disciplines of engineering. It is a very valuable asset to have all the different perspectives and approaches of the various concentrations in engineering. The class also introduces you to the prospective engineers of your class. The final project requires a lot of dedication and time, and teaches you a lot about the real life client-engineer work process. Overall great course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in engineering , interested in learning more about the resources in the ceid, or to anyone who thinks they would enjoy it. It's more useful for people without prior experience with programming , building things, modeling things, etc, but also a lot more work. However the skills learned are useful, the professors and wonderful and very accessible. It was my favorite class this term.",
    "ENAS 118 gives a brief overview of the various engineering areas in an informational and hands-on setting. Students get to use knowledge gained from lectures in a practical setting culminating in a client project at the end of the semester. I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in getting a better sense of what different engineering majors consist. Note that the client project does take a lot of team participation and hard work, so students must be up to the challenge."
