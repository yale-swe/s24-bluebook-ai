    "I would recommend taking this class, but bear in mind that it's a bit of work. As long as you're willing to take the time to do the work, your French will improve immensely. Professor Lewis doesn't quiz you as much as other teachers- which is a good thing, and she makes up for it with discussions in French almost every day. You will constantly be speaking French.",
    "Yes I would. This particular section is an open and safe space to practice French, although there is the expectation that you participate and finish your work.",
    "Yes, definitely! Units\/readings\/films we watch are overall interesting and engaging, and the workload is manageable.",
    "I would recommend the class if you need to fulfill a distributional requirement and you like French. If you hate the language, take an easier class. That said, the amount of work is what you make it - it's definitely possible to get a relatively good grade without doing much work or studying, just not a great grade. Even though I didn't really want to take the class, I found it enjoyable, and I liked most of the movies\/books.",
    "I liked the class a lot, but I would only recommend it if the fellow student was ready to work very hard and had a lot of time on his or her hands."
