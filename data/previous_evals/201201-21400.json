    "I am glad I chose to begin German, even when I was able to satisfy the language requirement in one course with French. The German department is small and friendly, and it's hard to go wrong with its courses. There's a lot of grammar in a short time, which can get very confusing, but it's hard to deny that you learn a lot over the year. If you can, take it with Marc--he's kind of crazy, but hilarious. I have doubts about the amount of German I'll use in my life, but for now, it's great, and certainly an interesting new way to look at language (especially word order...).",
    "This is a course that you have to take in you German career- it is tedious and difficult at times. However, you can make the classes very approachable, and the instructor can make them really enjoyable.",
    "Reviews for L1\/L2 language courses are pointless, because everyone loves all of them except Arabic. If you took L1, you know what you're getting into. If you placed into L2, L1\/L2 language classes are awesome and you should take this.",
    "Great! Take it. No question necessary. It has everything you'd want.",
    "German 120 is a logical continuation of German 110. It teaches from the same book, although more outside sources (like movies and a book) are utilized. The class is enjoyable, and offers a solid foundation in German grammar."
