   "comments": [
    "Yes, this class was amazing. I learned so much as a scientist and thinker in this class. It was fun and interesting and stimulating.",
    "A critical understanding of papers and general concepts, especially general logic. It is important to be able to understand logic and specifics, talk clearly, and form new questions with logical reasons only if you can form logical hypothetical answers.",
    "I think this course is really great and mind stimulating to take a look at several aspects of how scientists target important problems in molecular biology, and also to get a sense of the multitude of applications for the techniques of molecular biology.",
    "Yes, this class is the most beneficial to future scientist.",
    "It is a discussion based class that focuses on experimental thinking and design. I would recommend this course for any student in BBS.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a fun class, where you learn some history, learn to really critique methodology, and have engaging discussions.",
    "It is good for you to know what kind of techniques you can use facing a specific biological problems and how classic experiments have been done. Great help for graduate students.",
    "Wonderful discussion course learning methods in molecular biology drawing on each others background but became deficient in discussion since many of the papers have no relavence or overlap in any of our backgrounds.",
    "Methods and logic allows students to understand the research logic necessary to be a successful biochemistry or biophysics students my understanding the logic of key papers on key topics in the field. Whether this is due to a success or a notorious example, students are provided with stark and educational examples that should improve the quality of their research.I would encourage other students to take this course.",
    "Yes. See question 1.",
    "I would recommend this course. For students without a strong background in molecular biology, I would also recommend that the professors tell students about Ausubel et al. or similar protocol books in the syllabus\/first day of class. This is helpful in understanding the papers."

   "comments": [
    "This class helped me learn how to critically read research papers and also how to think about and plan experiments. I now have a better understanding of the right kinds of questions to ask when I want to solve a problem in science. I also learned about techniques in a lot of fields that I didn't know much about before. This class was amazing.",
    "I felt that the material was very biased towards yeast genetics. If these papers were approached with a focus on the logic of their experimental design, and less on the specifics, then it would not be biased towards students that have a very strong genetic background.",
    "It exposed me to several interesting topics, of which provided me with an excellent background and insight into the applications of molecular biological techniques, and also how to really look at a paper and analyze it in every perspective.",
    "It gave a real behind the scenes look at a lot of these historical moments since many of the professors knew the authors.",
    "I readmany very important papers in the field. It's helpful.",
    "Great course to help you with reference reading. Good introduce of all classic methods paper.",
    "wonderful, amazing and very helpful. lots of learning",
    "I now get science. See question 1.",
    "This course prepared me nicely for the protein expression work I need to do. Also, I think this is also a great course prior to the advanced eukaryotic genetics we have to take in the Spring."
