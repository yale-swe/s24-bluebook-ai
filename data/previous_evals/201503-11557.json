   "comments": [
    "Take this class only if you are interested in biosensing and bioimaging. Some of the material is dense, and would be more enjoyable if you were actually interested in the subject matter. Either way, the material is doable, you just have to get through it.",
    "Good BME elective, but take it with a friend so you guys can work on the PSets together. Lectures are kind of dry so it won't be the most exciting to go to, Not very difficult and Professor Rothman is incredibly helpful. Overall good, low-stress course.",
    "Yes absolutely -- the class is relatively easy because it has take home exams (the information is still challenging though) and the weekly psets are very doable. Professor Rothman is one of my favorite professors at Yale -- he is incredibly kind and is very helpful during problem set help sessions. Take this class if you need an elective!",
    "BENG 410 is a decent choice for a BME elective. The workload is very manageable. I will say, however, if you are not interested in imaging it is doubtful that you will come out of the semester with a newfound interest. Can be a bit dry.",
    "Ok BENG 410 is boring, but easy. If you take this class, you must do two things: 1. Take it with a friend. You will need someone to get you through the lectures and the problem sets. 2. Attend the problem sessions. I can't emphasize this enough. You will save tons of hours and get close to Professor Rothman. Professor Rothman is an amazing mentor and resource to have - so definitely do that. He will save your life. It's one problem set a week, a take-home midterm and a take-home final, and a paper. The paper is super easy. The problem sets take between 3-5 hours (less if you go to a problem set session). The take-homes are about the length of two problem sets - but not any harder than the problem sets."
