   "comments": [
    "Yes, they were available.",
    "Yes.",
    "Resources were available however, mill machines were constantly malfunctioning.",
    "Yes.",
    "Resources were appropriate for the course but it would be nice if the ta's were more available. I remember trying to ask simple questions about fabrication software but no ta's could be found and I continually got the run around.",
    "yes",
    "Excellent.",
    "The resources available were adequate, though of course a larger budget for the final project would be nice.",
    "Yes.",
    "Fine.",
    "the resources were adequate.",
    "The labs and supplied equipment proved more than acceptable for the tasks we were given. I never felt restricted or limited due to the school\u0092s facilities.",
    "Yes, the necessary resources were adequate.",
    "Yes.",
    "Good resources.",
    "Resources were by in large always available, however there were occasional bottlenecks on milling equipment just before assignments were due.",
    "yes.",
    "The resources were fantastic, I just wish there was an opportunity to use more of them.",
    "The resources were adequate, though I will say it helped greatly that my partner and I always were careful to reserved mill and laser cutter time early on - I think that was the biggest limitation for everyone.",
    "Overall yes, but it was a struggle at times to find enough mill time.",
    "Yes, the resources were great.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "At the end of the semester the CNC mill was very difficult to access, as so many courses use it for final projects. Furthermore, the large format mill was broken the weekend prior to our final. This made it difficult to complete the work except late at night, because it was fully booked. I hope that the software and the mills themselves can be improved in the coming years.",
    "Yes, the resources were adequate.",
    "sure",
    "yes"
