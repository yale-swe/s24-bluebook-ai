   "comments": [
    "I enthusiastically recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in classical music, of any period or genre, and wants to learn more about the motivations behind several great works. This course deepened my understanding of several of my favorite works and I will always be grateful for that.",
    "Only take this course if you are passionate about the subject. Although the workload is very very light on a weekly basis, you will not enjoy the long classes unless you are engaged with the material. Additionally, you will get what you put in: you can either leave the course having learned a lot or feel as if you haven't learned much at all.",
    "Really fun class. Professor Parkes is fantastic and the workload is not too intense (about an hour of listening and two hours of reading a week plus two papers.) The class is very discussion based, and the music is almost entirely classical, but as long as you enjoy listening to varied classical music it's a really great choice.",
    "MUSI 030 is an amazing introduction or survey of the development of Western music told through the lens of religion-inspired pieces. I would absolutely recommend this to another student. If he\/she is very familiar or an expert on Western music, then it is great opportunity to hear other perspectives on the most famous pieces. If he\/she is new to classical music, then it is a great way for him\/her to learn how and why the tradition developed as it did and to gain a great appreciation for it.",
    "MUSI 030 01 is a great freshman seminar for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of the meanings and motives behind some of the most famous musical works in the history of Western music. It presents a wide range of information, deep discussion, and does not require a large amount of prior knowledge. The class created great discussions and provided students with a large amount of musical and historical knowledge. I would most certainly recommend it to any student."
