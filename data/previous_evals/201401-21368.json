    "Not econ related at all, very law based",
    "I came into this class expecting a combination of law and economics; instead, it was virtually entirely law, which was not what interested me most in the class.",
    "Great class. Very little econ, and the economics was not connected to the rest of the class. But I learned a lot about con law and the readings were short and interesting.",
    "Yes! Professor Jaynes is awesome. He has such interesting stories from personal experience that really enhance the class. The material is interesting and the workload is pretty light. Overall great Econ seminar to take.",
    "Yes",
    "As an econ seminar, the workload for this course was very light. There's weekly readings (of court cases and decisions, not econ papers), a group presentation, and a 10 page max final paper. The work is light, and if you';re familiar already with con law and race theory, the concepts will also fall into place. If not, then take the class and learn something! In all, it was a welcome break from the typical econ class (no psets), and Professor Jaynes himself makes the class well worth your time. Take it and get to know him during office hours and after class!"
