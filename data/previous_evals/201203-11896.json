   "comments": [
    "Finding the American Epic through a broad reading of great literature written by Americans: you will discover ties throughout the American experience that are truly amazing. It's phenomenal. Take it.",
    "This course is much more than a survey of American classics; it is an approach to history and politics, an approach to literature, and a mind-enlarging experience that is utterly well worth taking. Each text included in the course's syllabus is well worth reading, and connecting the dots as you go along is an enriching experience.Professor Hill is a wonderful teacher in the best classical sense of the term: he teaches one not what to think, but how to think. He teaches a sound foundational framework with which to view both the American canon and the process of academic learning in general. Both of these are invaluable, as is the experience of reading the textsin this course with his guidance.",
    "Charles Hill is one of Yale's very best professors, possibly the absolute best, for this reason: whereas other professors accept the fragmentation of the academy into specialized fields with little to say to each other, Hill is constantly aware of the unity of human knowledge and experience. This literature class covered everything from intellectual and American history to geography and architecture. The readings were outstandingly chosen and had more to say about America and about each other than I would have thought possible. A simply fabulous course.",
    "AMAZING reading list, but class itself was, at times, frustrating. Two students led each class discussion, starting off with a presentation on the book that usually lasted 30-45 mins. Then they would lead class discussion, often with mixed results \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0everyone was so eager to make their point that often there was no continuity to the discussions. Then Professor Hill would start talking and basically just lecture for the last half hour of class. Overall, take it for the reading list and Professor Hill's insights, but be aware the discussion may fall flat at times.",
    "It's a lot of work - expect a full novel every week - but definitely worth it if you have the time to devote to it. The reading list is excellent, the discussions very interesting, and the professor is great at drawing both literary analysis and larger political\/philosophical\/American themes out of the text. One of the courses I enjoyed most this semester for sure.",
    "I would recommend this class if it will be offered best year. It is essential for everyone to read these books and to take a class with Professor Hill before graduation!",
    "If you want an American Lit course and you're willing to keep up with (most of) the reading, it's definitely worth it! Hill's approach to literature was very different than what I've seen in other courses, and it shed a completely different light on many of the books. Some people might say that some of the things that he proposes in class is a bit of a stretch, but I think his basic theory that these are works of fiction that had specific visions of America that influenced American society.",
    "If this course is offered again, take it! Whether you have a strong background in American literature or almost no background at all, this is a great place not only to get a sense of how the American canon fits together but also to delve into wider themes of American literature. The advantage of this class over an English class where you might have a similar reading list is that the discussions are heavily interdisciplinary, tying politics, philosophy, literary criticism, and history into a literary discussion. Professor Hill deftly allows each student to determine whether his thesis that all these works fit into one strategic American fiction is correct for himself. In picking apart that idea in class discussions, I probably learned more in this class than I have in any other at Yale.",
    "Yes absolutely. Why wouldn't you want to read Gatsby for credit, then hear Professor Hill find connections to the realm of intellectual and political leadership?",
    "Don't waste your time. I found this class disappointing. Perhaps better advice is: Only take it if you know what you are getting yourself into. If you like concrete ideas, this class is not for you. If you are not prepared to discuss \"consciousness\" for hours, this class is not for you. If you want to take a class with Charles Hill, then this is it. This is his forte: a bunch of philosophical students with large strategic ideas. He's very smart and poses interesting but unanswerable questions to the class. Then he sits back and lets the students take over, chiming in every so often to make a few comments. Since it's very much a discussion-based seminar, it depends on your peers and the class dynamic.",
    "Yes!"
