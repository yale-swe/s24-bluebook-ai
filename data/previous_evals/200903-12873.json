    "I would recommend the course, but with a different instructor.",

    "Take this course credit\/d\/fail, and take L5 Spanish for a grade\/distributional foreign language requirement. This class is a lot harder than you think it will be.",
    "I would only take this class if you need to fill a distribution requirement or are trying to get into more interesting L5 classes. Otherwise Yale offers better classes that one could take.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Very unenjoyable class.",
    "I would recommend taking it, but it was much harder than other levels of Spanish that I have taken; I feel like they expect you to be alot more comfortable with things than you already are.",

    "I would recommend this class to any students looking to further their knowledge of Spanish grammar and their ability to speak fluently in Spanish.There is a lot of work since it's a daily class, but most of the assignments are relatively easy."
