   "comments": [
    "A ton of work. Not worth the time commitment of you are not serious about completing the architecture major. That being said, this class is a crucial induction into the world of studio. There's a reason this class is a prerequisite.",
    "If you want to major in Architecture you'll have to take the class. If you are not, there is absolutely no reason to take the class as it's a preparation for the Junior Studio. It's a lot of work so you should be ready to pull some all-nighters to do well in the class. However, working in the studio is a lot of fun and if you like architecture and design you'll enjoy the class. I'd recommend leaning how to use Rhino (at leasts how to draw in 2D) and maybe Photoshop before taking the class. It would save you some time and sleep.",
    "You are assigned a building at the beginning of the semester, which you then analyze until the end. Lots and lots of work, and almost impossible to take shortcuts - the work you put or don't put in will clearly show. That being said, take the class only if you are serious about architecture (it's a prereq for the major), because the group dynamic and overall level of dedication can push the whole class very far. Befriend your TFs, as they will be the ones mostly discussing models and ideas with you throughout the semester.",
    "Good course if you are very interested in architecture. A lot of work but also very rewarding.",
    "A great preparing class if you want to be an architecture major.",
    "Analytic Model is an introduction to the analysis of buildings, and more broadly, to some of the conventions of architectural thinking. The meat of the course is the semester-long investigation of a single project. Each student is assigned a project at random and then studies the project through four different lenses. This varies by semester, but the four we did were geometry\/spatial organization, tectonics, atmosphere, and program. Each study leads to a final model that unpacks the project through that particular lens. To add to this, there is some work on diagramming your project, as well as readings on architectural theory. It is quite a lot to cover in one semester, and the course was fascinating at times, while also sometimes feely a bit disjointed. The volume of work would be tolerable on its own, but in combination with the drawing assignments (which for me were even more time-consuming) it became hard to handle. I did not pull a single all-nighter, but I often went for many days on 6 or less hours of sleep a night, which was draining. I learned a lot and felt quite challenged by the class, but it is a lifestyle that I did not feel I could sustain for more than a semester."
