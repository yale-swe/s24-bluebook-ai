   "comments": [
    "Yes. Great opportunity to take a deeper and more nuanced look into a significant topic that is overlooked by most other courses here. At the very least, it's worth taking the course for Shapiro.",
    "Yes--amazing syllabus, and a privilege to work with a scholar such as Shapiro.",
    "Prof. Shapiro has a brilliant mind -- don't miss this opportunity.",
    "The class covers an interesting approach in political theory that tries to build on non-domination to break through sterile positive\/negative liberty debates and flesh out a more coherent vision for the role of the state. The reading list is good and varied. Professor Shapiro is intimately familiar with the works and does a good job presenting and balancing criticism of them. At times, the discussion became a little listless, and it helps to come in with some of your own energy for the material.",
    "I would recommend this course with a few reservations. I feel that class discussion was sometimes poor because of low participation. However, in another year the class could be much stronger and make for a great experience."
