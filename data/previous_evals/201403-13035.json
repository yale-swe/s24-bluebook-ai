   "comments": [
    "This was a very interesting and informative class, and I would recommend it to those interested in the health professions.",
    "I don't recommend taking this class. It does not fulfill any distributional requirements but I still took it because I thought I would learn something. Everything we did in the class can be done by yourself at home; we read articles about health controversies and that's about it.",
    "This class is a great class for both pre-med students and aspiring journalists. The scientific content of the course is relatively basic and easy for anyone to understand. Also, the work is primarily just reading and a few papers so it's nothing too difficult.",
    "The topics taught during this course are very interesting, but the course itself fails to be engaging. There is also a lot of reading involved.",
    "HLTH 081 is a interesting seminar that introduces you to a wide range of currently debated health issues, as well as allows to you to think about how the media and journalism plays a role in how the public perceives different health issues. In addition, you gain experience in reading scientific manuscripts and learning how to check their validity. I recommend this course as it gives you a greater breadth of knowledge on current health issues and makes you more literate in terms of reading medical journals.",
    "This class is a highly interactive seminar where students can look at different representations of health and science issues in media to not only understand these issues, but also to learn effective communication. I would recommend this class because it provides a unique opportunity for freshmen to have small group conversations with various subjects.",
    "I recommend the class! The readings are extremely interesting; it opened my eyes to a lot of recent\/contemporary public health issues, such as lyme disease. There are easy quizzes on the readings and the midterm and final papers are fun because you can write about any topic discussed in class. The discussions were a little dry sometimes, but it is cool how Professor Bazell invites guest speakers who are experts in their field to talk about what we are learning in class and to answer our questions. Worthy class overall.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Work is very light. Readings are a little long sometimes, but very enjoyable. Only a midterm paper and a final paper! Mini quizzes are super easy if you do the readings.",
    "The course looks into various controversies in public health. I would recommend the course because I entered not knowing much about public health but am now leaving with a much better understanding and more importantly an ability to find reliable public health information and research and the confidence to make educated, informed public health analysis."
