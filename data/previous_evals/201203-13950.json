   "comments": [
    "It's a good class! Might be too easy for statistics students but perfect for me. I'd suggest that in the next years the professor can assign one or two additional hard questions in every problem set for biostatistics students only.",
    "Feel happy during study.",
    "Based on what I've heard this course was a major major improvement over last year. It was straightforward and well organized, not demanding in terms of workload. I was able to learn the material well.",
    "Pretty useful, helpful and interesting",
    "I thought this course was very well taught. Dr. Wang did an excellent job in lecture. Her lectures were very clearly organized, she included very clear examples of the concepts she was illustrating and she complemented the lecture slides nicely with the information she would write on the blackboard during class.The homework assignments were very fair and really helped me understand the material. In fact I used the materials from this class and what I learned in lecture to help me in two other courses I was taking this semester.I also appreciated the fact that there wasn't a midterm or final exam. I know some students thought there should be, but I disagree. It really allowed me to focus on learning the material rather than cramming for an exam. The labs and TA sessions were also really helpful. Greg did a great job.",
    "The course was well structured. Lecture slides were thorough and provided useful examples. Overall, the course provided an adequate level of understanding of the important concepts in categorical data analysis and their practical application.",
    "This course is a very basic and highy useful course in stat by instructing basic knowledge about categorical data analysis. Besides theoretical development and practical methods, we also learned to use SAS to perform categorical data modelling on real data. I think the course is pretty well-instructed.",
    "good",
    "This course covered a range of useful topics in categorical data analysis and provided me with a better understanding of what goes on behind the data analysis I already conduct and also some tools for improving the way I approach analysis. The book for the most part was clearly written and the homework assignments were useful to work through the concepts from the reading.For some of the topics I would have appreciated a more in-depth treatment, both in terms of theory and in model building and diagnostic strategies.",
    "Weakness no test",
    "I like the structure of the course overall.",
    "Strengths: good lecture notes, lab session notes, good textbook. These things allow for self-study to suffice.Weaknesses: the instructor is not the best public speaker. I can see that she tries, but her teaching still needs work.",
    "there should be exams and more work",
    "good",
    "The course can be added more contents and learn more knowledge.",
    "The course was good. I learned a lot.",
    "This course was ok. I learned mostly from the labs and the homework assignments. The lecture was not that helpful.",
    "This was a good course for learning categorical data analysis. You learn chi-square tests, logistic regression, and log-linear models in depth. The classes are hard to understand, but the slides are well put-together so you can follow them on your own. The homework assignments are really helpful for learning categorical data analysis, and the lab session were fantastic. So although the classes themselves are poorly taught, the other aspects of the course make up for it.",
    "Lectures were well organized.",
    "The class was very helpful and informatvie.",
    "good",
    "The course did not have a lot of workload, however, I cannot learn a lot from the course either.",
    "I liked the design of this course, namely that our grade was based on homework assignments (very applied) that was directly related to what we learned in class and lab. I think ultimately I learned a lot.",
    "this course provides some basic concepts and methods in statistical analysis, which are frequently used during the research. It is good to know those things.The bad thing might be that there are a lot of students there and student are lack of chance to interact with the professor during the class.",
    "Long homeworks. Good class overall but wish there was other assignments raided the homework.",
    "strengths: course materials are pretty useful. The instructor or grader could ususally provide feedback pretty quickly.",
    "Strength: straightforward lecture slides, reasonable amount of assignmentsWeakness: Exam could be useful to check students' understanding of the material. Thought the course was not in depth enough for biostatistics students.",
    "Good course. A lot of over lap with the Epi studies course. Good book. Teacher was good. Lab helped complete the homework.",
    "The material covered was appropriate, and powerpoint slides for each lecture were well-organized, and the book was helpful. However, the lectures were very difficult to hear and understand. The TA did a wonderful job explaining the concepts during labs and office hours, but I gained very little from sitting through the lectures. Exceptions were when the instructor wrote examples on the board."

    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr Wang is very nice and helpful. I went to her office hour once or twice and I think she is better at explaining things for a small group instead of a big class.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Class is very clear. Very nice and helpful professor!",

Thank you Dr. Wang!My only suggestion is to speak louder in class or wear a microphone! When I sat at the back of the class I could barely hear.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang was well prepared for lectures. Her slides were informative and greatly augmented the oral presentation, which was sometimes difficult to hear.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Prof. Wang instructs the course in a very clear way that beginners can understand and follow quite easily. The lecture notes are well-written so it's easy to study and review after class, too. In limited lecture time, Prof. Wang puts emphasis on the main ideas and methods in this area properly so we can grasp the most important and fundamental knowledge in categorical data analysis.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Professor Wang provided clear handouts that were well-organized summaries of the book. In the first half of the course, she mainly read from the slides without deviating, which was not ideal, but toward the end of the course she used the blackboard more and went \"off-script\" more, which was more useful. She always answered questions clearly. Overall the teaching could be improved by making lectures more interactive, using the blackboard more, and trying to provide added conceptual clarity to what was provided in the book (and present connections between topics) rather than summarizing the book.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang was good instructor, we just had difficulty hearing her at times.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She has outlined the course very well and made good lecture notes for us to use. Material-wise, the notes and textbook provided all that we needed to learn the course topics. However, she needs to work on speaking up and being more assertive. It is hard to understand her mumbling, and she sometimes speaks into the chalkboard.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The slides are right to the point, great summations of the knowledge we need to learn. And she is very patient and great in answering students' questions after class! everyone loves her!",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor makes everything much more clearly, which makes us have a better understanding of the class.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She was a good instructor.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0I think that the lecture was the weakest component of the class. The professor was quiet which made it hard to hear her. I also had some trouble understanding her.I appreciate that she was not completely ties to the lecture slides, and did some examples on the chalkboard, but these sometimes used different notations than he slides.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang was very receptive to students and provided good feedback. Her teaching was hard to understand at times because she did not speak very loudly and did not go into depth with some of the concepts, but she clearly put time and effort into making the slides for the course. It was a good course overall.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The slides the professor created helped students understand and absorb material in a much easier way. She was available for extra help and showed a lot of effort in order to help the students.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Her English is poor, and sometimes, when she wrote on the blackboard, she did not seem to teach, but to talk to herself.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0I think that the lectures\/notes were helpful, but I would often get lost when the professor would write out an example on the board. I'm sure this method was helpful for some people, but I generally just zoned out because I couldn't understand\/follow. Otherwise, I found that she was incredibly helpful answering our questions and her notes\/lectures were clear and easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor could explain the concepts clearly. It will be better if those concepts could be taught in a more interesting way.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Notes were organized. Bit softspoken, but was able to understand most of the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Great professor! A little quiet during lectures but very nice.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Weakness: Course instructor. Her English drives me crazy...I suspect if she has truly stayed in the States for five years...",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She explains concepts well.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Decent teacher. Power point slides were good.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Strengths: Excellent organization of the material and grasp of all concepts. Ready to help students who came to office hours with a question.Weaknesses: Lectures were inaudible and often hard to understand when audible. A microphone would be a simple solution to this very central weakness. Communication is key to making a course like this excellent. Also, the instructor was not responsive to student requests."

The TA was able to quickly and knowledgably answer questions on the material, was very response to student requests, and seemed to care about students. I would strongly recommend this TA to teach any stats course in the department.Weaknesses: Lab handouts were sometimes slightly disorganized, but generally very useful."

Homework was the only standard for grading. Homework was fairly graded and tested understanding of the material covered in course materials. There was no cumulative project or exam, which may be an plus or minus depending on who you ask.",

    "great course",
    "This class is good to take if you want a survey of a few methods in categorical data analysis, although it is not significantly better than self-studying with the well-written Agresti textbook. The workload is light compared to other biostatistics classes at this level, but the assignments are generally useful and practical. I would recommend it to a student looking for a follow-up to the first year biostatistics sequence but not for someone looking for a rigorous treatment of statistical methods.",
    "A fair and reasonable amount of work...taught in a way that is easy to follow and learn from.",
    "Good topic to understand, but will probably be entirely self-taught through lecture notes and textbook. I would recommend it based on that alone.",
    "yes i would recommend it, it's a great class",
    "this course is helpful to those who want to be a statistician, it provided sufficient background knowledge, so i would recommend it to others.",
    "good",
    "I would recommend this class for other students due to its practical application.",
    "I would recommended.",
    "This was an ok class. 90% of the material was review for me, having taken similar classes before, but I was required to retake this class forYale. The only new material came at the end, and I don't think it was taught that well. I can't really recommend this class.",
    "This is a great course to take if you want to learn about categorical data analysis. Although most of the learning occurs outside of class in lab sessions, by rereading the slides, and by doing the homework, it is a well structured course with important concepts. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "It's very helpful for learning about categorical data analysis.",
    "Recommend.",
    "Yes, I would recommend other students to take this class if they would like to get exposed to categorical analysis.",

    "No. This course does not have much workload, but I did not learn a lot from it either.",
    "I would recommend this class to doctoral and second-year masters students, especially those interested in pursing a job in research or data analysis. It is a good overview of categorical data analysis, and I think the book is a great reference and the methods we learned are applicable to many research settings.",
    "This course is worth learning, since most of the concepts are widely used especially in the area of public health. If you are doing research in the area of public health, you will encounter and use them a lot during your research.",
    "Good class. Home works are sometimes long.",
    "Very useful topic",
    "Good introduction to categorical analysis",
    "Good course. Yes, I would recommend it. Maybe focus on areas no covered in Epi studies.",
    "I highly recommend this course based on the fact that the material is quite useful. I chose to take the course because my thesis deals with categorical data, and I find that I am already applying the lessons I learned in this course towards my thesis. However, students should be advised to arrive at class early and sit in the very front row if they wish to gain from the lecture. The instructor is difficult to understand."
