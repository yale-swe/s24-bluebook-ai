    "This class was extremely helpful in teaching me about America in the context of race throughout its history (and helped me draw parallels and links across that history.) I loved just about every book we read, and all of them were very new to me.",
    "My first time really delving into the world of African-American literature to the extent that we did in this class. Really eye-opening look at literature. Very glad I was able to enjoy the experience.",
    "This was an amazing class! I feel like I learned so much about literature and American history that I had never been introduced to in high school. I also became a much better writer and thinker over the course of the semester.",
    "I gained historical insight on African American culture from the very beginning of the twentieth century to modern times and how it connects to the current civil rights movements.",
    "I learned a lot about the different types of Black literature in conjunction with the contemporary political movements at that time.",
    "Tim's class shifted the way I think about racism and antiracist politics in literature. Tim is a tough but very helpful grader and each class was intellectually stimulating. I think that I am a much better writer for having taken the class.",
    "My writing skills greatly improved as the professor challenged me to go one step further than my initial reasoning and develop my argument. I learned how to make sure that I led the reader through my reasoning without missing any important steps of logic. I also gained a larger range of knowledge on past black authors and insight into past black life.",
    "I have a better awareness of not only racial injustices but also the plight that authors of color must endure when writing and publishing their works. I also have acquired a greater knowledge of and appreciation for African American literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course! The teaching was great, and really facilitated a good class dynamic. I think if anything (and I hate suggesting more work) but the in-class presentations worked well. I think maybe another of them earlier in the term would be a good idea.",
    "Can't think of any ways it can be improved. The workload was very manageable and the readings really enabled significant learning. I feel as though I am a much better writer as well.",
    "All the readings that we did were fascinating and very well selected. I was actually a little sad that we didn't get to everything on the syllabus because it all looked so interesting. I also feel that at times we didn't get to spend as much time on the literature as I would have liked.",
    "I think the course overall was very good and extremely engaging to the students. We were able to create an active relationship with the texts and readings and debate with each other as peers",
    "The strength of the course is that the material is interesting and current. The class is also very engaging, however there is no real deep analysis of anything. The material discussed in the class was much less than the assigned homework. There was no opportunity to gain enough feedback from the professor on an assignment so it felt a little like walking in the dark on my own.",
    "The reading list and discussion for this course was excellent. Writing skills were less emphasized.",
    "The material is well picked and well taught and class discussion was very interesting. Expectations were not always entirely clear, but I suspect that's a product of the class being all first semester students and not the actual nature of the class.",
    "The strength of this course was that it engaged with material no usually taught in high school courses and it focused on improving my essay writing. The weakness was that it was new so there were some hiccups in organization but those should be ironed out eventually.",
    "strengths: great reading selections and discussions weaknesses: none"

    "YES! a great class. A great teacher. A relevant, urgent, and important topic. Excellent readings. Take this class!",
    "Definitely recommend 115 if you love reading books and writing about them. I feel this is much better than either 114 or 120. Books open a whole new world. Don't think it will be too much work!!",
    "Yes, take this class! Professor Kreiner is an amazing teacher and you will learn so much. It's also a great way to get yourself acclimated to college writing. I highly recommend you take this as your intro writing class because it really feels more like a literature class and you will be introduced to many fabulous works.",
    "Yes the topic of my class was extremely interesting and engaging and daily discussions were thoughtful.",
    "Yes, the material is interesting because it goes beyond literature to include history and politics as well.",
    "Definitely. You will think about the black experience in American literature very differently after having taken the course.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. The literature that we read and discussed was so relevant and engaging.",
    "Absolutely. It has greatly improved my writing and teaches a part of literature not usually explored by conventional courses.",
    "This was a great course! It's a broad, general introduction to Black Literature and Black History. Even if you don't appreciate literature, this class could honestly pass for a history course given the historical contexts explored. If you are interested in African American life from slavery to the modern era, and the various economic, social, political issues regarding African American life - take this course! The papers, while focused on literature, do require you to draw on historical contexts. I think it's a great way to develop more complex arguments regarding literature.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to all students. It is enjoyable, challenging, and engaging."
