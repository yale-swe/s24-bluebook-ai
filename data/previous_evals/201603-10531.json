   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the iOS development framework. I learned how to build an app from the ground up, how to synchronize with a backend.",
    "New type of coding I hadn't much explored.",
    "I'll preface this with the fact that I had Dan Spielman as an adviser, which I would highly recommend. He pushed me to meet with him *every* week, which meant I actually worked on my thesis *every* week. Because of this constant engagement, I was able to deeply engage with my project. I enjoyed doing research for the first time, and it helped me better understand what it would be like to do graduate work in the field.",
    "Final project -- great capstone to CS at Yale, and allows you to set your own direction. Learnt a ton of machine learning.",
    "This semester I learned a ton about developing for hardware (specifically a robot in my case). I learned how to account for real world error in code, and I also learned plenty about ROS and the Baxter robot.",
    "I learned how to develop and conduct an independent research project.",
    "I got to work on an individual project with the guidance of a professor. It was a valuable experience since I got to learn real life skills and apply what I had learned in class to a project that interested me.",
    "What CS concepts you learn from this opportunity is 100% based on the project you choose. Regardless of the project chosen though, you'll learn how to manage a large project and to work with an adviser and grad students!"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very good. I like the wide-open structure of 490.",
    "I think it depends almost entirely on your advisor and project",
    "I think the course could ask more of us -- we are not required to present our research to anyone, nor are we required to do more than submit an approved project at the end of the term. This anonymity and lack of accountability encourages people to do menial projects, and I think we're the poorer for it.",
    "Depends largely on your supervisor. The basic requirements and overall structure in place is very good, allows lots of freedom.",
    "Fundamentally, this course accomplishes its goal (independent research for senior computer science majors), but it would be better if it could be more structured like humanities and even some science thesis courses. It would foster a community, allow students to learn about other students' research, and allow students to benchmark their progress against peers'.",
    "It's a great opportunity to learn more about an area of CS you're interested in exploring. The structure of the course is decided between student and adviser and thus I cannot comment on how a given project will go."

   "comments": [
    "There are two approaches to 490: Research project and implementation project. I took the implementation route, and thought it was pretty great. If you do an implementation project, start early and learn a framework that you really use and admire. The project will only go well if you're excited by the technical challenges that come up, and the new skills you're getting.",
    "Well ya gotta take it if you're a CS major so just try to find an adviser who gives good advice and has reasonable expectations for you.",
    "I mean, you'll have no choice. That being said, get an adviser who will meet with you as often as possible. That will push you to do better work, and you will be able to get more out of the experience. Dan Spielman is the man.",
    "Required senior project -- your experience depends on your project and advisor!",
    "This is mandatory for computer science majors, but even if you are not planning on going into research (or even computer science) in the future, definitely try to engage in a meaningful project in a topic that is important to you. It might take some extra work to find a PI and a project, but it'll be worth it (and consider doing a 2 semester thesis if you need to).",
    "It was great to work on an independent project that was interesting to me, but was still really challenging.",
    "The senior project is 100% what you make of it. Make sure to choose an adviser with whom you work well, a project that is interesting, and to carefully plan out how you'll address the goals you set out to achieve. If you do so, the project can be a lot of fun! It's a great opportunity to pursue an area of CS you're interested in."
