    "This is a really interesting course topic, but I don't feel like I got very much out of it. The class is formatted as a discussion which can be interesting but sometimes it just felt like unfounded opinions. The Professor is a nice guy but he doesn't really give any real lecture or anything. All of the information comes from the books. Weekly reading responses based off two articles and then a \"midterm\" that was an in class essay and a final paper.",
    "Ron Eyreman is Awesome, But in a BIG seminar doens't shine through as much. I wanted this class to focus much more on learning about different movements and then using them to learn about the principals of Social Movements, but it is really not a history class. you pretty much exclusively talk theory. Don't take it if its a big size, we had about 28 people in our class, and was a bit awkwardly large. Mediocre class. GREAT readings though and Great structure, Reading responses, midterm and final paper.",
    "Take it if you are interested in sociology. Warning--it is not a history class about social movements; it is a sociology class about their formation and practices. If this interests you, and you enjoy seminars, you will like the class. If you are expecting history, stories, and movies, this isn't the class for you.",
    "Awesome course. Great for networking with other activists on campus. Definitely take it if the other people in your seminar are smart.",
    "YES! Some of the most interesting and stimulating discussions I've had at Yale, often left class with thoughts buzzing in my head. Eyerman is wonderful--a leading scholar in the field and very willing to engage with students. The readings were fascinating, and often felt like a pleasure rather than requirement. The class also attracted a great group of politically-active students, who had a lot to contribute from personal experience and knowledge.",
    "Take it! The textbook reading can be a little boring, but it's a great class.",
    "This class is ok-- it's pretty theoretical and you don't get to know the details of any particular social movements.",
    "This class was a bit disappointing for me. As a seminar, conversation regularly got off topic and took directions that weren't constructive. The book is HORRIBLE, but the other readings are incredibly interesting. I feel like a better acedemic\/citizen\/activist after taking this course, which counts for something, but it definitely wasn't what I was expecting.",
    "Sociology 216 is NOT a comparative history class. It is very theory based and the people whotake it seem to be into that theory and really specific \"underground\" social movements. We did not spend as much time talking about major social movements (Civil Rights, Women's, GLTB, Environmental movement) as much as ideas around social movements and what they mean\/are enacted. Major text was very boring, but had some good insights. The small article readings were much better.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in social movements--you will not regret it!",
    "EP&E 267 is a decent course -- it's not too hard, though the weekly reading responses are annoying, but you won't learn a lot either, mainly because class discussion is very disorganized.",
    "I would definitely recommend - this was one of my favorite classes all year. Great discussion and great topic.",
    "This class relies on seminar discussion to propel the course. That being said, you'll like this class if you end up with interesting classmates who are engaged enough in the subject of social movements to speak up in class. I'm pretty sure this class always draws an interesting mix, especially since it's cross-listed with multiple departments, and this semester's discussion was fairly engaging, though it did drag occasionally. There's roughly 70 pages of reading per weekly discussion, but the textbook by Della Porta and Diani is truly awful-- even Professor Eyerman admits it, but he continues to assign it. Other than that shortcoming, Professor Eyerman is great, genuinely cares about his students, and offers a really laid-back seminar atmosphere. BUT don't expect to get in deep studying the history of certain social movements: this class is about theory. Worth a shop.",
    "It was very interesting to read and think about social movements and the sociological theory behind them. However, the course suffered from a poor textbook and some bad discussions. However, much of the class discussion was interesting and worthwhile. It is a bit of a pain to have to write a reading response before every seminar meeting.",
    "A great course in an important sociological phenomenon-- anyone interested in collective action should consider taking this course. The reading is fun and the workload isn't terrible.",
    "I would definitely recommend Social Movements to another student. Sociology is an overall very very interesting and relevant field, and even as an economics major, I found this particular seminar very engaging and excellent in organization and execution. It is not too difficult, and the readings are very interesting every week. I looked forward to every meeting because in every discussion, two hours went by in no time. Great questions and great insight are shared. Professor Eyerman is excellent; he is approachable, knowledgeable, reasonable, engaging, encouraging and nurturing. He developed the course very well and the readings were obviously chosen with care. It was great that thecourse had weekly reading responses because it enhanced each discussion so much-- Professor Eyerman's comments were also very helpful. One of the best professors at Yale! I loved it!",
    "I would recommend this course. It was great to discuss concepts like protest, identities, inter networks, etc. and apply them to social movements and also aspects of our times.",
    "This course needs no summarization. JUST TAKE IT. There were about 100 people shopping the course and I was one of the lucky few to get in. Do everything you can to make sure you are one of the lucky few."
