    "Easily my favorite course at Yale. I learned an incredible amount about something I really care about, and also came out of class a better student and writer. Professor Barraclough really knows what she's doing. Professor Barraclough is invested in all of our projects, and is always willing to help as much as she can. She made you feel as if everything you had to say was important, and it really added to the class dynamic. Everyone rallied around her goals for the class and really reflected on the readings and the topics at hand. She really knows how to build a family out of a group of students. A model professor, and a model class.",
    "Great introduction to what geography really means - more than just map interpreting (also hegemony, urban planning and reorganizing, commodity fetishism, cultural appropriation - all that fun stuff). Once a week seminar with readings; 3 short papers and a longer final paper. Super good class, and pretty low key.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Thinking spatially is fascinating. This is definitely a class that focuses more on framework for viewing the world than facts or details. We spent the four papers analyzing different aspects of our home, whatever we deem that to be, which was alternately engrossing and a little redundant. Professor Barraclough is very sweet and personable, and I enjoyed spending time with her. Take it if the rest of the class seems cool and into the topic.",
    "I would if you are an American Studies major who likes abstract concepts. Other majors will need lots of extra help.",
    "AMST 348 is a introductory geography seminar. In the seminar, students look at three geographic concepts space, place, and landscape. students will look at how they are created vis-a-vis social relations and larger economic systems. The class has three papers 5-8 papers about a geographic place that you call home. At the end of the semester. students have to produce a 15-20 page research paper compiling the work they have done all semester. The class includes mandatory lunch talks by visitng lecturers, walking tours of New Haven, a visit to the maps library, and a visit to the YUAG. Barraclough is insightful, interesting, and funny. TAKE THE COURSE.",
    "An amazing class, one of the most rewarding I've taken. The course mainly emphasized different methods of understanding and examining place, focusing on the processes through which places and our experiences in\/of them are formed. The assignments (four papers, usually a mix between personal essay and academic\/research paper) asked us to apply these concepts to an examination of our chosen \"home.\" I really loved these assignments, and found them both very challenging and also extremely rewarding, as they allowed me to really investigate my chosen place and my experiences of it. Professor Barraclough was also fantastic, very dedicated both to the subject and to her students.",
    "A junior American Studies Seminar that meets once a week to discuss readings, and go on field trips with clear relevance to the course material.",
    "Overall, this course was instrumental in allowing me to explore new aspects of my own life and it changed my entire perspective in how I approach the world around me. I wish I had had more time to fully understand and completely grasp all of the texts because much of the reading was quite interesting and important, but also dense. Professor Barraclough has done some amazing work, so this was a great opportunity to explore the work she's done and the methods she uses. We also attended several guest speakers, one of which was conducting beautiful and powerful research\/mapping. Really great--I almost wish I could take it a second time if there wasn't such little time to cover the great expanse of classes Yale has to offer.",
    "I really enjoyed the assignments in this class, and got a lot out of the independent work involved. I struggled with the class time itself, as discussions became at times repetitive and jargony. I think a lot depends on who is in the class with you. I also think that the cut-off size should be smaller, and that this would help the quality of the discussion. If you are interested in a class where you get to really explore a place that you call home through a series of essays that build upon each other throughout the semester, this is a great class. I think you need to be really enthusiastic about the independent work part of this class to really enjoy it."
