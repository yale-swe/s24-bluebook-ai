    "This is a math-light class and the subject material has the potential to be really interesting, covering social networks as well as conceptual math networks. Professor Rabin is not always the most clear professor, but she's nice, and the workload isn't too heavy, with psets about every other week, a midterm presentation, and a final.",
    "Would recommend. Somewhat unorganized, but relatively interesting and comparatively painless way to pick up a QR.",
    "take it.",
    "interesting material? = yesEasy QR? = yesHave to attend class? = noGood teaching? = noWill you learn a lot = no",
    "Take it with rabin!",
    "If you are not a math person, but need a QR, take this class. It's the most interesting and do-able QR I've found at Yale (though don't forget: you actually have to keep up with the PSets to do well on the final.)",
    "yes so easy do it",
    "yes!",
    "Yea",
    "No.",
    "neta is hilarious! sometimes confusing during lecture, but what she doesnt explain u can learn in a second from the book :) also u dont nee to buy the bok cuz she'll give you an online link to it!",
    "Good course if you need a QR because it's pretty easy, the midterm is a presentation, and the final is a cumulative exam of the material but it's really not that hard. I enjoyed the class alot and actually felt like I learned from it.",
    "No. Look for another QR that has a more clear structure.",
    "A moderately interesting and very relevant way to get a QR credit. Not much work, easy material to grasp if you have a vague understanding of probability and game theory. Overall it was relatively painless. If you're actually interested in this material in more than a surface level way I recommend you take the classes to major in Applied math and take a real course on this subject. If you need a QR and you think this could be interesting in a logic\/reasoning kind of way I could recommend it.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who has a comfortable background in game theory and math as well as self-teaching. The lectures themselves will probably do little for you, but I hope otherwise.",
    "I would recommend it only if they are prepared to study hard for the final and do all the homeworks (which you may or may nor understand). It's difficult to understand the concepts with the way it's currently taught, and the guest lectures are not necessary really, at least in terms of understanding the coursework.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. It has some interesting elements, but one could just as easily study the course material on there own. There's a lot of overlap with game theory and microeconomics, both of which have more structure.",
    "Take it for a QR!",
    "Structure of Networks will give you a very basic introduction to networks and game theory. I recommend this class if you are looking for an easy QR and are truly swamped with other classes. But--come on--take the harder class! You'll learn more.",
    "not too mathy! i was expecting it to have more math"
