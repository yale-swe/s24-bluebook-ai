    "Having a topic each week for students to present and the presenters and discuss are would come up with questions. It wasn't clear how much people who weren't discussants were to chip into the discussion but I think we ended up jumping in when we had a comment or question. Some weeks had much more reading than other weeks.",
    "The class format was conducive to good discussion every week while ensuring that the students were not over burdened with readings.",
    "A lot of reading = unrealistic to read everything for every class. Was sometimes unclear what was expected of students re: what to read. Would recommend limiting number of papers assigned every week to a maximum of 4. Otherwise, interesting material, good introduction to dendritic cells \/ ag processing and presentation."
