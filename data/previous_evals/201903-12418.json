    "After spending a semester abroad in Madrid immediately prior to taking this class, I found the information from this course to really help in contextualizing all of the experiences I felt as a minority in Spain in the context of immigration and multicultural migration. The topicality of this course cannot be understated as I learned about the history of immigration in Spain and how the country has arrived at its current state. The introduction of different types of media in this course as lenses of analysis gave me a great chance to learn how to approach foreign literature and film in a meaningful way that I hope to be able to continue in the future.",
    "I gained an understanding of the history of migration to Spain as well as the literature and film that has resulted from that migration.",
    "I learned a lot about multiculturalism in modern day Spain and the dynamics of migration. This course also touched on a lot of more tangentially related topics, such as gender, sexuality, race, urban studies, and sociology. My written Spanish also improved throughout the semester. I also got more practice at analyzing films and literature in Spanish.",
    "Historical background about migration (immigration and emigration) related to Spain and perspectives from films, autobiographies, and fictional works.",
    "I learned about race and migration in Spain, which is something I did not know much about before. Basically, Spain is super racist.",
    "I learned all about (im)migration in Spain and topics of race, gender, stereotypes. I learned how to better read and articulate my thoughts in Spanish. Classes touched upon the history of immigration in Spain, African\/Asian\/Women\/Middle East\/European\/Latin and South American immigration, belonging as a second (+) generation individual, belonging as a woman immigrant, internal migration from countryside to city, etc.",
    "In the course, I gained a lot of perspective about the difficulties migrants face in Spain. The course is literature-based, so we read a lot of works relating to migration by immigrants living in Spain as well as native Spaniards. This was my first time learning specifically about this topic, so I learned about the flow of immigrants and emigrants into and out of Spain throughout time. A lot of the works focused on challenging the Spanish narrative of heterogeneity and dealt with questions of identity. It's worth noting that immigration is the focus of the majority of the course (which often hosts the least-often heard voices) rather than Spanish emigration.",
    "My ability to study literature and film advanced greatly, as did my appreciation of studies of literature in general. I was also shown many new facets of immigration in Spain.",
    "Insight into history of migration and immigration in Spain, first-hand stories and perspectives, theoretical frameworks for critiquing and analyzing films around immigration",
    "This course helped improve my conversational Spanish, academic vocabulary, and knowledge of Spanish contemporary culture in the wake of globalization and throughout history. The class teaches you how to think critically in Spanish about race, sex, gender, class identity etc., and it gives you the opportunity to reflect and discuss theory and literature in a small group setting. I was honestly very impressed with the level of discussion the seminar had amongst ourselves.",
    "I learned a lot about spain and multiculturalism through both a historic and modern culture lens",
    "Developed some analytical skills for Spanish films and written works.",
    "my Spanish got much better, and I now think Spain is so much more interesting!"

   "comments": [
    "I found this course to overall be a very positive experience in the engagement we got in class throughout the course of the semester and in terms of the great cinema and literature it highlighted. I think the seminar really pushed students to be involved in class and had great interwoven moments of lecturing to guide us in our analyses. In terms of weaknesses, the amount of reading some classes required hindered class discussion at times because it was difficult to analyze so much on more than just a superficial glance in one class meeting. I really enjoyed the presentations that students were required to give at during most class meetings, however.",
    "The class itself covers a variety of works by authors of color that are rarely discussed in Spanish classes and provides a rare opportunity to analyze these texts in an academic setting. The course content itself is very interesting and covers a variety of immigrant experiences within modern day Spain. The class also contains a variety of works including not just written text, but film as well. Discussion itself during class did often times feel a bit shallow, often times being spent summarizing the readings, and excessively structured. I would also suggest replacing the two exams with small papers in order to provide more opportunities to engage critically with the readings.",
    "This course was really great because of Prof. Harkema. She knew how to lead class discussions and took students' feedback to heart. The reading list was diverse, interesting, and manageable. There were lots of opportunities for participation and practice built into the class. The papers were really worthwhile assignments, and the format of having students present on readings worked well. The exams, however, weren't that well suited to engagement with the course material, in my opinion. I felt like I could have written interesting essays based on the prompts if I had had more time.",
    "strengths: the chosen works are engaging and provide interesting discussions weaknesses: there is not always a guided discussion and participation is crucial, so sometimes it is difficult to develop a well-elaborated comment.",
    "Professor Harkema is super cool! She is very accessible to students and receptive to feedback. She was also really open to and understanding of people coming from all different levels of fluency, which is something you don't always see in a L5 course. The readings and the movies we watched were generally really good. I appreciate that Professor Harkema didn't want to cap the course, but the class discussions could have definitely been improved just by making the class smaller. Also, there were SO MANY readings, and some of them were LONG. I really wanted to be able to do all of them, because they were usually interesting, but I found it really hard to actually read\/watch them thoroughly. If you have a lot of readings in all your other classes, you are just not going to be able to read an entire book in Spanish in 2 weeks. Also, there was a final exam AND a final paper, and I really think it would have been better to just have one of those.",
    "Strengths of the course included the cooperation between students and professor in revising the syllabus as deemed fit and providing\/implementing useful feedback. Organization of syllabus and professor's teaching skills are another plus. Speaking was not only seminar-style, but also in small groups giving everybody a chance to voice opinions. The midterms were essays and fairly graded. Assignments included a nice mix of media (reading, listening, watching). There were not really weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: The course material overall was pretty strong. There was a variety of mediums we explored, including memoirs, creative short stories, novels, academic papers, movies, and plays. There were a variety of perspectives included (though it is impossible, of course, to represent the many different experiences different migrants have). Actually reading and experiencing the first-hand accounts of immigrants in Spain was incredibly powerful. I believe this was the first time this class was offered, and I'm really glad it was, because these were voices and a topic that it would be easy to not engage with, but it's incredibly important. Professor Harkema clearly cared about the course and our thoughts as students in a way I have never had another professor seem to do. Weaknesses: Class discussions generally tended to stay relatively surface level and we often weren't very critical of the works themselves (with a few key exceptions). Due to the pacing of the course, we only ever were able to spend one class period on a given reading section, and often we needed to spend some time going over the work itself simply to ensure comprehension. For me, this was often really helpful, though maybe not the best way of hearing different perspectives on the work. Other students were sometimes not very patient with students who were unable to express themselves as fully or clearly in the language. As someone who is a non-heritage nor non-native speaker, this was pretty discouraging at times. Potential Improvements: There were a couple works where Professor Harkema gave us reading guide questions. I feel like it would have been helpful to have those for some of the other denser works as well. That way, we could go through the important comprehension points, then dive into deeper analysis. I know this was a literature class, but I think another potential addition could be some works on the theoretical ideas and concepts surrounding migration, hybrid identity, etc. We read an excerpt from Said's Orientalism, and I think other similar works could provide a good framework for us to base our discussions off of.",
    "Strengths: We experienced a wide variety of art, from graphic novels to epistolary films to one-woman plays; we looked at recent, authentic Spanish works; we got historical context through academic (though sometimes pretty dry) secondary sources; we saw works from a variety of minority artists (POCs in general, POC women, and LGBTQ+ artists). Weaknesses: The class actually ran pretty well. Most concerns, like the fact that the class was too big, have been discussed in class already. One new suggestion is to make the second exam a take-home exam. I thought that the topics for it were very broad, so broad that they were hard to write about during the allotted exam time but would have made for an extremely fun take-home exam. In the future, it might also be nice to encourage this seminar class to include more student-to-student discussion. Whenever we had discussions as a class, it never felt like students were talking to each other, but rather like each student was talking to the professor privately, and then the professor shared the thought with the rest of the class. I think a more free-flowing, student-to-student class style would help take this class to the next level of greatness.",
    "Fantastic course!! Loved Prof. Harkema's teaching style and low-stakes approach to discussions. I felt much more comfortable speaking in the small groups, so definitely loved the mix of size of discussions! Please don't change a thing",
    "The course is very well structured. Modules are organized by topic, and a lot of the primary readings we do are supplemented by interesting secondary analyses which I really liked hearing about. Class discussions were usually initated by Prof. Harkema, but she did a great job of making sure everyone was contributing and that discussions were fruitful and impactul. I also liked the student led presentations we did. I might say that the tests were a slightly stressful and not indicative of what we had gotten out of the course, I liked the papers more than them.",
    "The selection of literature and film was thorough and provided a range of crucial perspectives. Guiding questions were provided for a few, but not all of the assigned selections, and they were very helpful when provided.",
    "class was a little too big, but professor very nice and very engaging\/interesting material",
    "Some of the analytical papers we read did not relate that well to the material. There were few works which I thought were worthwhile. The conversations revolved a lot around summary rather than analysis. Grading is also not uniform. People who participated a lot in class received the same 9\/10 as others who only participated once or twice dueling the semester. The intimate setting for the class really made it comfortable to participate in. Some works were very well chosen and interesting.",
    "Professor Harkema put a great deal of work into this class. I felt that she gave good feedback and offered clear methods for improvement. I would love to have the chance to work in small groups more often in the class. Speaking regularly was sometimes difficult."

   "comments": [
    "I would really recommend this course to a student trying to apply their Spanish knowledge after completing L4 Spanish. I don't think the readings or discussions were too technical as to turn away those just beginning to get comfortable using Spanish in an academic setting and I think the content of the course was super interesting, relevant, and easy to interact with.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, particularly those interested in Ethnicity, Race, and Migration. The class itself is unlike most others offered in the Spanish department and provides a unique opportunity to engage with texts and topics often times glossed over in academia. The workload itself isn't excessive, and distributed fairly evenly throughout the semester. It is important to note that critical engagement with the class is largely left to the student.",
    "Yes, I would! Take this course for Prof. Harkema -- she's a really knowledgeable, invested, and understanding professor.",
    "Yes, this is a pretty doable L5 Spanish course with interesting subject matter. The books and movies we watch are usually really enjoyable, and the Professor is very nice.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anybody wishing to take an L5 Spanish. I learned so much about immigration in a foreign country. Despite the topics relating to Spain, there were many parallels to the United States as well. It was an intriguing course.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course on the strength of the syllabus alone. The works we read were by authors I probably never would have been exposed to otherwise, and it's really important to hear these voices. Professor Harkema is also great. What you get out of this course really depends on how you engage with it, as well as the discussions with your classmates. As with the majority of discussion-based classes, your experience will depend greatly on who you are in class with. As a non-native nor non-heritage speaker who has not studied abroad, I was pretty intimidated by the discussion aspect, but if you just go for it, the professor and students are generally supportive, even when you make mistakes.",
    "Absolutely! Its a great higher-level course in the Spanish department that really goes deeper than other courses.",
    "YES - incredible course for anyone to take. Eye-opening and relevant information for everyone regardless of major or career pursuits",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to others. I took this as my L5 language credit (I am a fluent Spanish speaker) and it has made me consider going for the language certificate. The content of the course is extremely engaging and you engage with a very wide breadth of authors of many backgrounds. The class discussions critically analyze Spanish society and underlying structures that lead to the stories we discuss in class. Not only were the discussions rewarding, but being able to discuss racism, sexism, migration, multiculturalism, and many other topics in Spanish was both challenging but also rewarding. I have to say the other students in the class really made this class engaging, and Prof. harkema did a good job of leading discussions and allowing for ample student contribution. Prof. Harkema definitely cares a lot about making the course accessible and engaging, and all the readings were interesting in my opinion. This is a class that you should not pass up.",
    "yes reading was a lot but interesting and a very sweet professor",
    "It was okay, though the material seems at first to b e very engaging, the discussion and some of the chosen works did not lead to a very insightful analysis.",
    "Yes ! I think with a strong foundation in Spanish, or heritage speaking ability, this class is a real gem. I sometimes struggled to express myself with my limited Spanish grammar, but I felt very encouraged to improve and understand the material better."
