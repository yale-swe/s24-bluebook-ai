    "I learned about the themes and literary styles of the major literary works of the latter half of the western canon.",
    "I greatly developed my close reading skills as well as the ability to contextualize small pieces of text in a work as a whole.",
    "I was introduced to a new variety of modern and post-modern literature that I had previously only heard of but never read, and learned how to more accurately analyze and understand texts which utilize complex words and verse structures.",
    "Literary analysis, making connections between texts, close reading and really understanding the text rather than imposing your own argument on it",
    "Good writing, critical thinking, contextualization, and literary analysis",
    "I learned how to read literature beyond the narrative. We engaged with each work's literary style, the author's life, their political ramifications, their relationship to previous works, and their effects on the Western tradition. I can read literature much faster now, and I have a much better idea about what makes for a classic.",
    "I became a much better writer, especially stylistically. I also was exposed to some of the best books I have ever read and that are very important in our culture."

   "comments": [
    "The course provides a comprehensive overview of the texts on the syllabus. However, because the entire books are assigned, instead of selections, it is difficult to prepare adequately for seminar discussion. More focused selections from the texts would greatly improve this course.",
    "The syllabus is wonderful. I personally did nearly all of the reading, but many of my classmates didn't and I think that the consistent participation of only four or five students out of a class of 12 hurt the depth of discussion.",
    "I think this course (along with the other DS courses) is well executed in having two seminars a week to go over more specific topics within each book, while lectures cover the book, its author, and its impact on the canon in more broad terms.",
    "Generally good, maybe more discussion is the wider DS context of the books",
    "Most of the works we read are absolutely wonderful: Don Quixote, Madame Bovary, To The Lighthouse, Hadji Murat, and most others: all good. I did not enjoy Paradise Lost. I think we need more strategies for how to tackle this nightmare of a book. Also, the smaller class sizes of second semester were a huge improvement, they should really consider making another section entirely for first semester to distribute students. I found it extremely difficult to participate last semester because it was new and there were very many students in my class that kept talking so I didn't have to. This semester, as a DS veteran in much smaller classes, it was easy to. It might be helpful to make it more personal in the fall.",
    "I thought everything was very well structured with good content and good teachers."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you are interested in post-Medieval literature, this course will provide a great overview and will enable you to make more informed choices about other literature courses later in your academic career.",
    "In a word, yes! The syllabus is great and every student should have the chance to read and discuss these works.",
    "Yes, any student interested in engaging with the literary canon would enjoy this class, but obviously it's only suited for students who have taken DS first semester.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. Though it is a lot of reading, this reading is the most enjoyable reading of DS. It is the easiest and at times the most rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. First, it is part of DS, which has been just awesome in the friends I have made and the discussions I have had. Second, the books are excellentyour \"homework\" is really more like relaxation if you like reading at all. Third, you become so much more of a person and more well-versed in our culture. Your viewpoint is expanded and your writing skills improve drastically. They have to."
