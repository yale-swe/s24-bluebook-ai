    "Awesome class. The readings were beautiful. The discussions were interesting and well-led. The coursework is definitely manageable. And above all, Professor Chang is one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale: she's passionate, inspiring, kind, caring--the professor everyone dreams of having! What more could you ask for?",
    "Chinese 200 is a survey course of Classical Chinese poetry (and some non-poetic literature), especially in the context of man's relationship with nature. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this course; with a truly amazing and unique professor, an unending and complex literary cannon, and an eclectic array of students, this course is bound to be successful for anyone willing to put in a basic amount of time and energy. Overall, a fantastic class!",
    "A good survey course of Chinese literature. It was very chill and relaxed, and I'm glad that I was exposed to a lot of Chinese poetry. The workload is low (two 6-page papers, a class presentation, a response paper that isn't graded, and participation) and it was overall a pretty easy class.However, the poetry itself could be repetitive at times, and it was also limited to the theme of man and nature. As a result, though the reading was excellent in small doses, reading a lot of poetry could be kind of a drag.",
    "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great class that gets you thinking in new perspectives without overwhelming you with readings and assignments. The assignments include: readings for each class (not too much though), one 1-2 page response essay, two at least 6 page papers (1 midterm, 1 final), and a 5 minute oral presentation on the readings of and on a day of your choosing.The readings and lectures during class present Taoist, Buddhist, and Confucian thoughts along with Chinese history and culture, and Professor Chang is extremely knowledgeable on the subject. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great professor with a lot of experience in the subject and in teaching the subject.",
    "Amazing course. Professor Chang is an absolute genius and the works you read are so gorgeous. Pretty light workload (2 papers) and you don't really have to keep up with the reading all the time. Take it!",
    "I would totally recommend this class if you need a chill humanities credit!",
    "I recommend it to those who are actually interested in learning about the relationship between man and nature in Chinese literature. You could gain an enriched understanding of the Chinese literature and culture by taking the class, but you have to commit to the readings and participate in class. This is also the recipe for a good grade in the class.",
    "Yes! It is especially great for people who want some introductory exposure to Eastern literature.",
    "If you want to get some rough ideas of Chinese Literature, this would be a good course. The readings are all in English and Chinese is not necessary. Professor Chang is a very approachable and helpful professor. She is probably one of the best Chinese teachers I have ever met.",
    "Decent class. The material becomes somewhat similar after a the first few authors but I think that's just the nature of Chinese poetry. Professor Chang is great though\u00e2\u0080\u0094 she's truly a legend in the field. It was an honor to take her class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Classical Chinese Literature. Even though the course is in translation, previous knowledge of Mandarin (if not Classical Chinese) comes in handy as Professor Chang frequently makes reference to the original text. My experience was of being in a class where most people seemed to have a pretty good grasp of Chinese, so that someone who doesn't know anything about the language might be a little lost. I was taking my third year of Chinese together with this course, and that helped my a lot despite the fact that I couldn't actually read most of the material in the original. The written assignments are quite reasonable, and I only regret that I haven't dedicated as much time I was wanted to the readings, which are fascinating. Professor Chang is an amazing person to get to know, and the way she explains things is just mesmerizing. Definitely a must-take class for those who want to know more about East Asia."
