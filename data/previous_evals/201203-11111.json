   "comments": [
    "It's not the kind of class that an undergraduate without the background in the area would expect from a class called 'Belief', but that's no bad thing. It functions well as a kind of more advanced (than the intro class) epistemology class, with less focus on knowledge. If that kind of thing appeals to you I recommend it. Not recommended without taking Epistemology or something else similar first. But that's not a criticism - upper level seminars can legitimately require background.",
    "I would recommend it to students. However, I would also suggest they have a good background in epistemology already and make time to approach the instructors about questions and issues they're having with the material.",
    "I would recommend the Philosophy 625 to students who already have significant exposure to contemporary debates in epistemology. The class is geared towards people already well versed in these debates. I would not recommend the course to a student who has had minimum exposure to these debates. He or she does not have the background knowledge or grasp of relevant terminology to participate fully and informedly in class discussion."

    "This is useful material to be aware of, but it obviously depends on what you're working on.",
    "Most importantly it gave a good panoramic view. The issues I wrote my two papers on I feel I have a relatively good grasp of. The other topics I feel I at least have a good feel for. This is pretty much exactly what I wanted, because now I feel I can better place other articles and ideas in the bigger picture of the current discusion.",
    "It exposed me to the more technical side of contemporary epistemology, which will be useful as I decide whether to pursue an interest in religious epistemology."
