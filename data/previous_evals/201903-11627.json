    "I, of course, learned much about the theories of political economy. My favorite lectures were those on the competitive market equilibrium, the Nash bargaining theory, and equality of opportunity. But perhaps more importantly, I feel that learned something about how to think like a political economist. I learned how to use simplified models to visualize and explain complex ideas and concepts. And I learned that if you delved deep enough, even the simplest of social and political phenomena can have fascinating implications.",

    "I really enjoyed the take-home format of the exams. It gave me a chance to thoroughly think about some concepts\/problems. The lecture notes online are also helpful. It would be more helpful if some concepts appeared in the problem sets can be discussed in class first.",
    "There are no weaknesses I would like to report. In terms of the strengths of the course, I felt there was a balanced mix of theoretical and practical elements, and just the right amount of mathematical work. The problem sets were generally thought-provoking, and were quite effective in reinforcing what we learned in class. The take-home exams, I thought, were an excellent ideathough I spent much more time on them than I would have spent studying for an in-class exam. I realized that it was one thing to learn about different models and theories in class; it was an entirely different challenge to put all that knowledge together and address specific social\/political problems."
