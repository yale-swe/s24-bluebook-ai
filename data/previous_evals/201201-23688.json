    "Question 1: There were no textbooks, cases, or other materials aside from our client work.Question 8: What i liked so much about the class was that it was very real-world, hands-on based. I think having the opportunity to work on actual client projects and to hear from companies every week in class about environmental management issues is invaluable experience, and a nice break from the more theoretical aspects of so many of our other classes.",

It also gave me good exposure to working on a client project in a group setting, which is something I know I will have to do in the future. It also would have been way too much work for just one person.",
