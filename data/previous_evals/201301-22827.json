    "Yes! Unfortunately I don't know if it will ever be taught again. This class was just a wonderful, sometimes quirky, exploration of some of the coolest arts from the late medieval period. Everyone in the class was super excited about the material, which made discussions enjoyable, fast-paced, and inclusive. This class avoided the usual problem of one person talking too much without saying anything, which is honestly a delightful change. The class tends a little bit more towards lecturing than seminar, but most people don't know as much as Greg and Jackie about altarpieces so that's really for the best. I would definitely take this class again, as it was fun, entertaining, and informative. The final paper was a lot of fun because we just got to write about something that we were really interested in; it seemed like everyone was obsessed with the altarpiece they ended up writing about. I wish more art history classes were as passionate about the material as this one was.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to a fellow students. Both Professor Jung and Greg are incredibly knowledgeable of the material and they are just very fun instructors. This class was a pleasure."
