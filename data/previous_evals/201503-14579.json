    "If you are looking for incredibly lively class conversation, I would not take this class. However, that also depends on who is in the class. If you genuinely want to learn more about ethnic and religious minorities in this region, you will learn a lot from the readings and the assignments are somewhat self-directed, so you can choose an area to delve more deeply into. I would not recommend taking this class if you have no familiarity with the region, because there often isn't a ton of historical or cultural context for the readings.",
    "This is not a hard class in terms of assignments or workload. In fact perhaps easier than many; that said, the history and sociology itself is very complicated indeed and you'll get more out of it if you're prepared to dedicate a good bit of time to the (sometimes pretty dense) readings. You could conceivably go through this class with a good grade and not much learning but I wouldn't recommend that you do as not many classes offer such a comprehensive study of so much important stuff. Very enjoyable and Prof Sardeghian is a wonderful person. Weekly presentations on the reading by a different student each week are a good way of summarizing usually the most difficult piece of the week. The final research project is wide open and really, really interesting if you choose a good topic, and having regular check-ins keeps you honest. Take it if you want a better understanding of how exactly the intricate world of tribes, creeds, social groups and historical changes works in the Middle East. Great films too.",
    "Absolutely! I loved this course with professor Sadeghian. She is an absolute joy as a professor and is intensely knowledgeable on her topics. She brings in much personal experience to the course and makes it enjoyable, despite the time-slot that can become nearly unbearable at time. This class did have a ton of work, there is no denying that. However, professor Sadeghian approaches it at a way in which you are really learning. She does the best of her ability to make sure that each student fully understands what is going on which makes the course an absolute must. The course did focus largely on tribal relations, which is something I had not quite expected, but it was interesting nonetheless due to the teaching style of professor Sadeghian.",
    "It is a lot of work, and the readings can be very complex, so be willing to put the work in. Additionally, the final paper is hard, long, and has multiple requirements so start on it ahead of time.",
    "MMES 339 is a great class for those interested in learning about lesser-studied groups in the Middle East and Afghanistan. While it isn't necessary that you have taken a Middle Eastern history course before this course, it would be very helpful to have done so. It's a great class!"
