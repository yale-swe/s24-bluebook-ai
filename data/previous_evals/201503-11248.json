    "Primate Behavior is interesting, even for those not looking into Anthropology. The class has weekly readings and polls but Fernandez is flexible and understands that they will not be done every time. Take this class if you need a social science credit and want to learn about anthropology and how it is applied to other species. Be prepared for questions and discussions.",
    "I would not recommend ANTH 182 to another student. It was a frustrating class. The instructor was bad and the content was irrelevant to most members of the class. If you're interested in primatology or animal behavior, I would recommend a different course in perhaps Psych or EEB.",
    "Decent course if you are interested in primates and their evolution",
    "ANTH 182 01, is a great course to take if you want an introduction to primate behavior and ecology. It covers all areas of primate behavior from what they eat to their social structures. In this course you will learn about all primates and their lives. I really enjoyed this class because the material was very interesting and fun to learn about.",
    "It's a good class IF you are ALREADY interested in anthropology. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and work outside of class, the lectures only cover the main topics while the tests ask about the nitty gritty details."
