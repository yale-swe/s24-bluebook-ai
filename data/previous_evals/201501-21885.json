    "No. It sucked the professor can't teach and you learn nothing.",
    "It would be worth taking if there's an interest in macroeconomics or the need to fill the major requirement. I personally enjoyed the small size of the class and would prefer this to the large lecture class.",
    "what you see is what you get work wise and skill wise. this is a freshmen intro course to macroeconomics. this teacher can be a little hard to understand and was historically the weaker of the two teachers of freshman into macro this means the class size is really small which is nice to get contact with the teacher. if you are a freshman and looking to take intro macro take the seminar just so you can easily go to the teacher with help and so you can tailor the class to what you want."
