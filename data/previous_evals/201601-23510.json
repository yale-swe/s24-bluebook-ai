   "comments": [
    "I like Joan, and she truly cares about her class. Even though I get frustrated with the class content is so broad and elementary, I still think that she is a good teacher. I just wish it could be more structured.",
    "Strength: Classes always had a very conversational tone, which I really like because it fosters learning. Weakness: Dr. Monin always seems like she was rather scared of us, which made me feel sad for her and was distracting. The group assignments were ineffective. We didnt have enough time to talk about the articles in depth when we were doing 4 per week, but it was better with 2 per week. I still liked the sections where we did response papers the best though. On those weeks the conversations flowed better because you knew everyone had spent time reading all the papers and thinking critically about them. Also, it felt like every week was almost the same lecture. It felt like Dr. Monin often taught the material through the lens of her area of interest. For students who are not in the SBS department I think there was a lot they did not get to learn.",
    "Strengths: -Good overview of intersection between clinical psychology and public health -Deep dive into interpersonal relationships and the many ways in which they can influence health (for better or for worse) -Good effort was made to include discussion of LBGTQ, socioeconomic status, race\/ethnicity, and cultural differences in the context of interpersonal dynamics -After some tweaking, reached a good balance of discussion of theories with discussion of interventions & policy implications Improvements: -The balance we reached by the end of the semester in terms of weekly assignments with regard to readings was good. This meant that 2 articles (out of 4) were focused on in section, and as a student you were either assigned to summarize or critique one of the articles. The prior set-up where you had to summarize and critique 2 articles and all 4 articles were focused on each week felt like a lot of busy work and didn't substantially contribute to the richness of section discussion. -Coverage of some racially charged topics I don't think were covered appropriately (specifically remember Broken Windows theory being glossed over, and problematic components of the theory were not portrayed to students). I think its important for these theories to be raised & adequately critiqued with a racial justice lens in class, and I encourage more of this discussion to happen in the future.",
    "I felt like this course was lacking a great deal and definitely does not warrant as a requirement. The subject of this course, social interpersonal influences on health, is something that I was excited to learn about, as it interests me a great deal, but I really felt like I barely learned anything. I don't think I learned anything that I could not have read in a magazine article. I feel that this course needs to be changed in the way it is executed, almost completely, in order to be considered a graduate level course. Unfortunately, this is the only class I have had so far that I felt was a waste of money and time.",
    "Honestly did not really know what I learned. Lectures were not too helpful. Readings were interesting and section was good. However, there were a lot of topics discussed each lecture, but I wasn't sure what Dr. Monin was teaching.",
    "The strength is that the professor is very receptive to student feedback, and she encourages discussions during class. The weakness is that the lecture content seems to be repetitive of the assigned readings and tends to drag on.",
    "I loved the section, but was not that compelled by the course.",
    "I appreciated the material taught in the course and Dr. Monin was a great teacher. My only issue though is that HPM students were told this course was, in part, designed for us and that was not the case, which unfortunately did impact my course experience.",
    "Strengths: - good foundation for anyone with no background in the field - Interesting topics covered Weaknesses: - Too discussion based, I would have liked it to be more instructional so I can learn something from the professor and not base most my learning on other students' opinions. - Since the topics are too soft, I would have liked to see more emphasis on current theories and literature. - The reading material for every class was too much and was not explained well during section.",
    "Overall, I thought Dr. Monin's course added an interesting perspective on social relationships and their effect on health, and one that I would not have received in any other of my of policy courses. Dr. Monin gave us a very comprehensive overview of the literature, and I feel as if I can call upon such literature in the future to explore other related topics in my own coursework. However, I did feel like we tried to cover a very wide topic area and I think the course could have been a little bit more narrow and structured. The weekly readings were really helpful in getting background about the topic at hand, but sometimes I felt the reflection questions were vague and added little insight into the readings themselves. I wish that the assignments had been more structured. Instead of a weekly group presentations, I wish we had a midterm policy brief or presentation on a topic area from lecture in addition to the final review paper.",
    "I really like the topic that the course is focused on--I hadn't really thought about health in the context of relationships before. I also like the focus on understanding the methodology behind studies, because it forced me to think carefully about how studies arrive at the findings the report, and how I would design a study to answer a question that I'm interested in. However, I feel like the discussion section was a bit redundant. I understand that the class was intended to be a large lecture course, in which case section would have been necessary to understand the concepts. But with how small the course became, we often discussed many of the same topics in section that we discussed in class the day before. Also, the group summaries each week were a decent amount of work. I appreciate that Joan listened to our feedback and split them up amongst the groups for the remainder of the semester.",
    "Not a good introductory class to SBS, unfair for HPM students who were actually interested in understanding the social behavioral determinants of health. Based of this course, HPM (Policy and Management) students will leave YSPH with no SBS core competency Title of class is a misnomer, should be called \"Social Support Theory\"",
    "Many topics covered which was a good exposure to the breadth of this subject",
    "It's too much work and I don't feel that I learned that much in the readings and the discussion.",
    "The beginning of the class was a little complicated. I was not very happy with it until I really got to know the professor. She was very flexible, passionate and teach us the importance of the class and how to integrate it to our specific concentrations. In my case: policy.",
    "I don't think the assignments are appropriate. Summarizing papers and critiquing them is not challenging enough.",
    "This was an interesting course. The material was very interesting and I felt that it was really applicable to what I hope to pursue as a public health professional. I did feel that the class dragged a bit. Meaning that I felt that there was definitely an opportunity for the lectures to just be an hour. There was a lot of repetition which got a little less interesting.",
    "Joan did a great job and tailoring the course to our needs. The final paper was fun!!",
    "This class was not particularly good. Class discussions were poor and did not really add much to the learning. Discussion sessions were better, and if you did the readings carefully you did end up learning quite a bit. I think what would help this class would be focussing on a few readings \/studies and discuss those in detail, get deeper and understand how they were done and how that research is being currently used in current intervention and policy discussions. We spent too much time speculating how we thought the studies could be relevant, or talking about our personal experiences. But ultimately as public health professionals I feel like we needed to go beyond personal speculations and focus more on broader implications and real life applications",
    "This course was very interesting, and I thought the material was very relevant to what I hope to pursue in the future. I did feel like the class dragged a bit. I fundamentally believe that there was not enough material to fill out 2 hour lectures, and this could have been condensed to remove the discussion, or eliminate the section and keep the 2 hour lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She is a great professor, I like her.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0I'd really like the class to branch out into other aspects of SBS in future iterations, like nutrition, stigma and health, etc. I also would like a component of the class that connects SBS to the other departments in a way that fosters collaboration.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Strengths: -Fun person, I liked that each class started with a song, and appreciated the personal anecdotes Joan was willing to share with us. -Responded diligently to feedback and made good improvements to the course mid-semester -Expert in caregiving - cool to have that perspective. Improvements: -Joan ends a lot of her sentences with an upward inflection as if its a question (\"up-talking\"). At the beginning of the semester, I think this maybe undermined her image as an expert on the content to some students. I'm not sure if she is aware of this verbal habit, but it may be something to work on in order to portray a more confident image to new students.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Dr. Monin seems to be very knowledgeable in this area, however, I felt like this course was a list of sources siting main ideas on subjects and that usually level of discussion is good, but people ended up just talking about personal stories. I felt like everything she taught was pretty obvious to anyone remotely educated.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She is okay. The class is not taught in a good format. She should make sure to drive home the main points after lecture.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Professor Monin is a very knowledgeable professor who is very receptive to student feedback. She was very approachable as well.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is very nice and gives great feedback. However, the lectures are not engaging nor very informative.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Great professor, who was always open to hearing your thoughts. She promoted great discussion and started each class off on the right note with a YouTube video that pertained to the course.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Dr. Monin was very responsive, personable, and willing to hear from students. Her ability to engage students in discussion was one of the strong points of the course. However, I did feel like sometimes we lost direction and got off topic because of the focus on discussion over lecture.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is amazing. She creates a great environment for discussion, is so kind and obviously cares about her work and her students. She also makes the content very interesting but also wants to hear our feedback about what is most interesting to us.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Needs a lot of work in learning how to teach students Core material was too repetitive week upon week Receptive to feedback",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Very intelligent and clearly an expert in the field.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0The professor is a nice person who responds to students' need quickly.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0I liked that the professor adjusted the subject to the expectations and interests of the class. She also changed the class to a smaller classroom which promoted participation and more integration of the group. The sections were very useful to express our opinions and was a good way to know more about my classmates too.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0I really enjoyed her teaching style and how much she encouraged class participation. I also admire how she adapted the course to the decreasing class size and how she professionally handled the strong criticism she faced at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Professor Monin is very kind and I found that she was interesting and engaging in lecture. She is also very understanding and takes feedback very well.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Great discussion leader",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She is very nice, loving and respectful. I am confident she is an amazing person but teaching might not be her strongest attribute. Classes were boring and not engaging enough, and a lot of people dropped the class. Of those who stayed, a good number never bothered to attend class, and of those who did attend class sometimes just did other things on their laptops. I really cannot blame them because to be completely honest, one could easily follow the class while doing other things, and attending class did not necessarily add much to your mastery of the subject matter. Maybe she could make attendance mandatory and ban laptops, but that alone won't solve much. I think more engagement and getting people excited by what is happening in class can go a long way to improve this class",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She was clearly interested in what the class thought of the course which I found extremely admirable. She is very sweet and clearly knowledgeable."

   "comments": [
    "I'd summarize this as a deep dive into different mechanisms that explain the relationship between interpersonal dynamics and health outcomes. Definitely relevant to people going into healthcare, though not sure it's worth an entire semester if its not something you have a general interest in.",
    "I would not recommend this to anyone studying at the graduate level. I hope they take this off the requirement list for everyone else's sake. This is by far the worst class I have taken at Yale, so far, which is a shame because I was very much looking forward to the subject and social interpersonal influences on health is something that interests me a great deal.",
    "You learn about social and interpersonal influences. Not recommended though. Need more structure in the course.",
    "This course was not very interesting. I felt like we spent most of the time learning about things we already knew. However, I loved the section.",
    "It is an interesting course about relationships in regards to all kinds of different topics.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. It is very soft and too discussion based and lacks good foundation.",
    "Though as a policy student, I found this course a little out of my comfort area I still think it was worth taking. It introduced me to a literature and topic area that I find has allowed me to broaden my perspective in public health.",
    "Even though the topic may seem boring\/obvious to you, come into the class with an open mind because you will definitely learn a lot of really interesting new things, and will also become a better public health student by developing your analytical skills.",
    "TERRIBLE COURSE - needs to be revamped significantly. Do not take unless interested in social support.",
    "I would reccomend this class to someone who appreciates the social sciences or is wilingto learn about these topics; i would ot make this a mandatory class for concentrations like HP or HCM",
    "If you are not required to take it, don't take it.",
    "yes, I think that this class is a good element of the core courses. Perhaps I would recommend that this would be a first-semester class.",
    "I would recommend this class if they make some of the suggestions that students have put forward.",
    "Only take this class if you are absolutely required to take it"
