    "I know he tried, but it would be great if Dan Esty actually implemented the five-second rule. Some people need to think to process things before just blurting out the answer, and we ended up with a small handful of people participating when very few others did. Also, the TFs were both great.",
    "I can't stress how incredibly helpful this course was to my professional and academic development. It is A LOT of material, for sure, but Professor Esty does a fantastic job of building on top of concepts throughout the semester. He is also a really tremendous lecturer. I was nervous at first that his no-visual approach would make for a dry class, but I couldn't have been more wrong. It was a fantastic class and I'm thrilled I took it.",
    "Dan is a great lecturer and full of valuable insight and personal stories that help flesh out the concepts in the class and give strong context. The pace is fast (as he readily acknowledges) and some of the reading materials feel less relevant than others (especially when they are as long as they are at times). Very valuable - if I retain even half of what was covered, I'll feel like I learned a ton about Environmental Law.",
    "The reading load is very heavy - I would split it up with a group.",
    "This was by far my favorite class at FES. Dan did a great job of encouraging student participation and validating student input. He is easily the best professor here not only for his outstanding teaching but also for his approachable and kind personality.",
    "question 2: The policy memos were beneficial in that they encouraged deeper study in select course material, yet were a little harshly graded and unclearly assigned with regard to topic and focus.",
    "I did not like this course. I found the course to essentially be a form of neoliberal indoctrination. Professor Esty sets up a trope throughout the class where he talks about 20th century law and 21st century law. In his mind, 21st century law should be predicated on market mechanisms, information disclosure, and technological innovation. He repeats these three things almost every class, without going into much depth about any one of them. He does not problematize them in any way, but merely presents them as sacrosanct. Students are essentially invited to uncritically embrace his neoliberal thinking. This class is not a place to ask deep questions about environmental (in)justice, private property, or other central tenets of American law, for that matter. The most important thing I learned from this class is that American law is built off of English law and therein lies its love of private property. I learned that business, law, and science are all married to one another so as to progress a modernist, neoliberal agenda.",
    "Course is relevant and is likely at a turning point as environmental space is beginning to see a lot of shifts from what has been known. Need to create a space for leaning the drivers of the changing environmental policy landscape and how this will change the path of the course."

    "Dan Esty speaks and you just learn...it's incredible. I also liked how he tied the class material into current events to keep it relevant.",
    "Lectures. Professor Esty's knowledge is vast and his experience shows through without being overbearing. He is approachable and answers questions clearly.",
    "Professor Esty is a fantastic lecturer and brought in current events and their legal\/policy implications quite well. Critical foundational knowledge for anyone interfacing with legal\/policy issues in the U.S. context. Challenging and engaging, very interesting subject matter and implications.",
    "memo's were really useful to understanding the topic.",
    "Dan is an incredible lecturer, and we covered an impressive amount of material.",
    "The lectures were really great and helped to take the readings (of which there was a lot) into perspective.",
    "The lectures were my favorite part of the course. He is an excellent lecturer, and brings in lots of experiences from his life working for the government.",
    "Again - Dan's ability to explain concepts, cases, and laws. He's got an invaluable, first-hand library of experiences from within the EPA and CT government that gives precise concept to anything we're discussing. Classes were at their best when we had conversations between students picking Dan's brain for specific insights and explanations.",
    "Excellent overview of US enviro law and policy",
    "Dan is an incredible lecturer. Take advantage of his office hours.",
    "Dan's teaching was amazing, his personal anecdotes were also incredibly insightful.",
    "Exposure to environmental law and insights from Esty about his experiences working with these issues",
    "lots of cases",
    "This class provided an essential exposure to American environmental law and policy. Dan Esty's lecture style drew the class through the material in a way that was informative, intense, personal, and accessible. The text, though dense, delivered the material in a clear and thorough manner. Professor Esty guided me to a better understanding of the inner workings of our government through the lens of environmental law and policy.",
    "The textbook readings are pretty good.",
    "Understanding how Global environmental governance is needs to change and be driven by innovative approaches by businesses and other relevant players beyond government."

   "comments": [
    "We seem to do a light look at a lot of different statutes\/policy concerns. It would be more useful if this class were broken into two classes and allowed for a deeper dive into some of these questions. That casebook was a bit dense, and it often contradicted what Dan Esty said. In a way that's good, because you get multiple perspectives, but it also seemed a little hard to justify, given that Esty claimed the authors didn't know anything about CERCLA. Then why assign the reading? There's already too much reading.",
    "The policy memos were tough. It would be nice to get more practice thinking and writing freely, but the rigor of grading for the memos made them so time consuming, it would be difficult to add more.",
    "Professor Esty articulates his vision for the future of environmental law\/policy incredibly well; it would be helpful to have a broader range of visions\/proposals to consider and weight against each other- the course could benefit from having at least some slightly more diverse voices on left and right.",
    "too much reading! also would be valuable to have more opportunities to work on memos. Esty said it was the most useful skill to leave the class knowing how to do but we only had the opportunity to practice memo writing 2-3 times",
    "The writing assignments - while helpful and a good part of the course - were difficult to complete within the given timeframe since they required students to do readings in advance, which was often difficult due to the pace of the course and the heaving reading load.",
    "The amount of reading is unrealistic. I would rather the readings be more focused, and to more closely mirror the material covered in class.",
    "All the readings that Esty assigns are very interesting; however, the amount that are assigned is very discouraging. I think the course would feel more manageable if a little less reading was assigned.",
    "Assign less reading to make it a bit more manageable and feasible for completion",
    "The reading load is too heavy.",
    "Some sort of visual would be helpful especially for visual learners. At a minimum some slides with spelling of key vocabulary or cases would be helpful",
    "lower course load for students",
    "I think that including a midterm into the course would be beneficial. A midterm would have forced review of the material midway through the course. I have mixed feelings about the policy memos. I felt that they were graded in a way that might have been appropriate for law students, but not for environmental studies students. Perhaps an option can be given for a report\/research style paper in addition to the policy memo.",
    "I'm sure this will be a common theme in the course evaluations, but there needs to be less reading. One of the reasons to take a course like this is because the professor has theoretically done the intellectual work of curating a good list of readings for the students. Assigning, hundreds of pages each week (much of which is never covered in class or in the exams) shows a lack of discrimination by the professor. It also results in the students not doing the readings. There is a point where students will just stop doing the readings altogether. For example, students may be willing to read or skim 30-50 pages a week, but if 60-80 pages are assigned, they might not do any of the readings. This is something to consider."

However, I'm interested in a career in policy, so this course was an invaluable opportunity to expand my coursework outside of the regular technical classes for career development.

If you want to contribute in class, look up summaries of the cases online before class. But even as Dan Esty says, skimming is key. Don't actually read the casebook in depth, it's not worth it.",

    "Keep up with the reading, skim and prioritize based on your interests as needed. Get the policy memos done early in the semester given the heavy weight of the exam later. Start prepping for the exam early and work with a study group to keep you on track and have folks with whom to bound ideas around. Ask good questions to go beyond lectures during office hours or class- Professor Esty has such rich experience to draw from that it's great to get his take, while appreciating he has a certain perspective\/biases\/values that may or may not align with your ultimate conclusions.",
    "highly recommend - very useful information if you're willing to put in the time to do all the reading",
    "There's a lot of reading, but do as many of them as you can. The exam is a lot of the grade but its bark is worse than its bite. The class gives a very comprehensive overview of American environmental law, and Professor Esty is very responsive to questions in class. Don't feel afraid to speak up during lectures.",

While the format of the class was sometimes challenging (because it was just 100% lecture), there was a lot of information shared and overall this course was useful.",
    "The readings, there are a LOT, are not necessary but can help if you learn better through reading",

    "Take advantage of this opportunity to learn under a great professor. Professor Esty's background and knowledge are a good fit for the material. His oratory teaching style (without power point) is not to be missed. The reading load is heavy, but it is important to take the time to work through the textbook and become familiar cases and legal language. The knowledge gained from taking this class is essential to every environmental studies student.",

Don't take the course because you think you \"should.\" Think about what you will get out of a survey class like this one. You won't go in-depth into any one topic. Also, don't take the course because of Professor Esty. Yes, he has a lot of \"professional experience.\" I did not find this all that useful for my learning.
