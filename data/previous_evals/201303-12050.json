   "comments": [
    "If you need this course for your major, don't fear it. You'll learn a lot. The first few weeks are a bit rough as you learn your way around, but you really do get better as the term goes on. I was surprised by how much I knew on the final.Don't take this course to fill out an extra half-credit on your schedule if you don't need it for your major. It'snot a light workload, and you will spend more time than you like thinking about lab reports.",
    "I would STRONGLY suggest avoiding this class at all costs. It required more work, energy, and time than my actual chemistry class, and it was only half a credit! The classes were very unnecessarily stressful, and it seemed at times as if the grading rubric was set up so to try to make students lose as many points as possible. There was a lab report every single week, while most other introductory labs had intermittent reports (e.g. CHEM 119L, freshman orgo lab, intro Physics labs). There is no curve, and the letter grades conversions are very high (an A is a 95-100) so getting an A is virtually impossible. I wish that I had taken a different lab, maybe 119. If you are taking CHEM 115 and have to take a lab, see if you can get into 119L; you will NOT regret it.",
    "I would recommend this course -- though the workload is very extensive and sometimes frustrating, in all, I have grown in my ability to write labs and understand experimental procedures.",
    "CHEM 117L is a very hard course. There are weekly quizzes and full lab reports are required for every experiment. The experiments themselves are interesting, but trying to keep a pristine lab notebook while performing them can sometimes prove a bit stressful. If you have a good TA, the course can be enjoyable and manageable. However, it is possible that with an incompetent TA, the course could prove overwhelming. It is a good accompaniment to CHEM 115, so I would recommend it to anyone taking CHEM 115. However, I would not recommend taking it alone or just for fun.",
    "Chem 117L is a class that you generally take because you have to, but definitely don't let what some people say about it scare you away!The grading for the class can be frustrating, but overall, you do learn so much about how to actually do science. I think this class may have overall been what I learned the most in this semester. And your grades do improve gradually.Just make sure to study for those quizzes, because they are actually awful.But the actual work you in lab, which can actually be a good break from worrying about the rest of your classes, and the lab buddies you bond with make the class worth it.A final warning: write out your procedure ahead of time for the first day. It's a pressure cooker.But overall, you get out of 117L what you put into it. You can handle this, trust me.",
    "I would only take this class if it was required for graduation. It is a lot of work(not hard, but time consuming).",
    "Chemistry 117L 01 was clearly a \"weed out\" course. Although it wasn't my favorite course, the lab improved over the semester.",
    "I would advise them to stay away from it if they can.",
    "This could be a much more enjoyable class if you are one of the people who is always super prepared prior to coming in and not looking for clarification. Dr. G is generally very approachable for help, but only on your own time. If you ask for help, you'll get it and will have a marginally better time in the lab.",
    "I would suggest that a student only take this lab if necessary for further studies in a major or pre-professional track. Its large workload is not worth a half-credit if a student is only taking this class to fulfill half a credit.",
    "A basic chemistry lab. I would recommend it if you have the time.",
    "Heavy workload--I probably wouldn't take this if I didn't need to.",
    "Very hard but learn a lot",
    "Not too bad as long as you do the labs over the weekend and ahead of time.",
    "This lab is very tedious and requires a lot of time to prepare beforehand for weekly quizzes& lab itself, and then to write up the lab reports. My Professor Dr. G is a very strict and harsh grader, so prepare mentally to spend a lot of time on lab reports. I felt that I learned a lot in the lab overall. I would recommend this lab to another student, and first tell him\/her that students tend to have low morale during lab, so the challenge is to actually enjoy his\/her lab experience.",
    "Lab is a lot of work, some of it is not even reasonable. If you are pre-med, take it because you have to, if you are not, try to avoid is as best as you can.As I said, the workload is way to much for half a credit and it is four hours a week. Also the quizz every week and the lab-report will easily take another 10 hours of your time-schedule and many times I asked myself what this is going to teach me or why I have to do this.",
    "I think your performance in this class is mainly dependent on your own preparation. I would recommend this class to another student, but I would caution them to be as efficient with their work as possible. Study for the quizzes ahead of time, right down the procedure before class, and do your lab as soon as you can--that way, you'll get it out of the way and have enough time to ask for help if you need it.",
    "Take it if you need it for pre reqs.",
    "The course effectively teaches you the skills you need to operate in a laboratory setting. It also teaches you skills you don't need in an actual laboratory, such as how to make use of archaic equipment like an old-fashioned manual bulb syringe (use of which involves rapidly taking the bulb off of the syringe and placing your thumb over the top of a quickly-emptying tube of falling liquid.)I spent a summer in a laboratory before this. I wasn't prepared to rewrite my lab procedure while doing the experiment, nor was I prepared to do the lab reports. You might be, but that's not automatic. If it had been allowed to write down the lab procedure beforehand and merely mark where specifically I have deviated, things might have been different. In any case, I promise you that if you're slow at writing neatly, you're gonna have a bad time.I don't recommend taking Chem117L unless you have to. You probably have to, so instead I just recommend memorizing by rote and heart the multiple pages of rules of how Professor G wants things done. It'll help.",
    "If you have a solid background in chemistry and want to do something with it, take this course. It's really really challenging, and it will make you want to drop it at some point or another. BUT\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's totally worth it. You'll finish the semester feeling like a champ.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Though it is a lot of work, it is worth it and the experiments can even be fun.",
    "Chem 117L is manageable. If you're considering taking this class, it's most likely because of a major requirement, so you're going to have to do it anyway. Just take it - really it's not that bad. If you have to put it off a semester though, don't worry. I took Chem 117L the fall after taking Chem 115 because I really didn't want to do it, and the work was still fine. It actually may be better because I don't think the topics in Chem 117 lab match up really with the topics in Chem 115.",
    "Lots of busywork, unnecessarily rigid, frustrating instructor. The lab write ups require more time than thought.It's unlikely that anyone would take this lab if it weren't required to for their major, so a recommendation is probably pointless. If you have other options though, take them.",
    "Chem 117 is helpful to take alongside Chem 115l; therefore I would recommend it to a fellow student."
