    "Cool class, but grading is volatile. You learn about cool stuff, but it moves a bit slow. Professor Ramirez is one of the most caring professors I've met at Yale. She's really fantastic and really wants students to learn in a non-threatening environment. That said, it sometimes feels like a bit of a middle school science class. The composition of the students is odd too: it spans class years, levels of athleticism, and actual interest in the topic. Some students were totally checked out and did the bare minimum. Be careful on your video project, and the final midterm was a tricky. Take lots of notes. Ask questions. Consider what you want to get out of the class. We didn't get through the syllabus in entirety, but I did learn a lot about materials engineering.",
    "Take it! you learn a lot and the professor is very patient and dedicated to explaining things to students. You'll have lots of fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any one who is interested in science but doesn't have that strong background in Physics or Chemistry. I learn a lot from this - not only science but also about how to look at current daily life issues taking into account the importance of materials in our life. Though it's at9AM, I always look forward to being in class!",
    "Take the course if you have a chance.",
    "Great, great class. HIGHLY recommend to anyone and everyone.",
    "Highly recommend. Definitely take if you're interested at all in material science and how things work.",
    "This class is DEFINITELY for non-science majors. It moves pretty slowly and grading and p-sets are very laid back. The topic is interesting, but there's often not enough demonstrations, etc. to emphasize this. At times, it also feels like being a non-science major learning science qualifies you to be taught like an 8th grader. This being said, I really did enjoy the topic and learned a lot of essentials about materials around me. Now I know exactly how samurai swords and CD players work!",
    "This is such a fun and interesting class. Definitely very eye-opening and engaging and worth your time.",
    "Simply put, it's an easy fifth class.",
    "This is basically a gut-level course on a really interesting, fresh topic. Materials science and engineering is actually really fascinating because it applies so relevantly to daily life. Ainissa Ramirez is at the fore of this kind of research, and she leads a wonderful class. She's warm and accommodating. The only problem is that it's early -- but it's worth waking up for. Workload consists of a weekly problem set (they each take about an hour, very painless), a single take-home midterm, a take-home final, a video project (again, far simpler than it sounds), and a short paper. Really not stressful. And I learned a lot. This is a great way to get your Sc credit.",
    "Survey of material science with a very engaging teaching style."
