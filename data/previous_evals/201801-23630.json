    "This course gave me amazing insight into the way the Romans conceptualized their own mythical and historical foundations. While translation was an important feature of the course, emphasis was also placed on thematic development. The course studied the formative events in the early (mythological) history of Rome, quite literally tracing out the city's development, from Aeneas to Romulus, through the lens of several authors, including Livy, Vergil, Ovid, Propertius, Sallust, and Cicero. This is an excellent course for anyone interested in Latin, Classical Civilization, or History. The course is a perfect extension and development of the Vergilian narrative, and is well suited to individuals who have studied the Advanced Placement Latin curriculum or individuals who are similarly prepared. This was one of the first Latin courses I've taken where emphasis was placed in interpreting and studying the texts for their meaning. Rather than just translating for translation's sake, this course sought to learn something from the texts. Translation is, of course, a critical tool in this journey, but translation alone is just the first step. For any aspiring classicist this ought to be exciting! (Though of course, you don't need to love classics, per se, before entering the classroom: you'll learn to love the subject by the time you leave.)",
    "Scansion skills, ability to translate without writing out the translation beforehand, connecting historical events to modern ones, comparing\/contrasting different authors & texts",
    "This was the best Latin course I've ever taken. I learned how to read twice as fast as I had the previous semester",
    "I gained knowledge of the foundation of Rome through reading texts from notable Roman writers."

   "comments": [
    "One of the greatest features of the course is the consonance of thematic analysis and textual translation. Discussion and translation of the texts was the main business of the course, and this is precisely as it should be. The handouts on Roman social, cultural, and political development provided insightful supplementary materials to the course. The secondary readings were very engaging, as well, from a mythological and philosophical perspective. The course is excellently structured: regular translation assignments and periodic quizzes ensure that you keep track of the minutiae of the course readings. The final paper, midterm and final exam ensure that you don't lose sight of the overarching thematic development, as described in the syllabus. It's a very manageable workload, though there is a decent amount of translation to keep track of. This is an L5 course.",
    "Maybe some more days like the Propertius book 2 one - less translating and more analyzing. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it.",
    "Strengths: engaging, organized, intense, prepares you well",
    "The class size was small facilitating seminar like in class discussion, analyzing texts and including personal commentaries."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in studying Latin at the college level. This is a great introduction to the world of university classics, and the syllabus was very approachable, though rigorous. If you're interested in classical civilization, poetry, classical civilization, archaeology or antiquity in general, this course will provide some item of concrete interest for you. (Make sure to let the instructor know what your particular interest is.) The Yale classics department, moreover, is very likely the best in the world. In taking this course, you are momentarily joining into that tradition of preeminence and excellence. It's a great course, and definitely one oriented towards people who haven't seen too much advanced or graduate-level Latin.",
    "Yes, it's really interesting, even for people who aren't classics majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was a very collaborative learning experience",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in Classics and wanting to translate mythical and interesting works."
