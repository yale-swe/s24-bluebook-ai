   "comments": [
    "Professor Ramos-Ruano was incredible. She is very helpful and always entertaining. She has somehow managed to teach me more in one semester than I learned in all of high school.",
    "A great course in Spanish, I have learnt a lot without previous knowledge of Spanish.",
    "Prof. Ramos-Ruano is great! She's hilarious and super enthusiastic about everything. Very nice and forgiving - take her!",
    "Moves very fast compared to high school language classes. It is important to stay up on all the material and do the extra activities.",
    "Definitely. The professor is great! The class is not very hard. There is not a lot of homework and you actually learn spanish!",
    "I would definitely recommend this section. Taking a language class is never very pleasant, but this one isn't too bad. Juliana is a great Spanish teacher.",
    "Exactly what you would expect from an Intro Spanish class, but I was actually quite impressed by how \"fluent\" I was at the end of the semester after a very reasonable amount of work. Juliana Ramos-Ruana is an awesome teacher and I would say she really made the class for me- the whole dynamic of language classes is hugely dependent on how well the teacher makes things mesh and makes people comfortable trying to talk. She's very funny, engaging, and fair.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who wants to learn Spanish.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class--the Spanish department is very experienced, and the curriculum seems very well-established. The class is difficult but immerses you in the language so that it isn't too hard to pick it up.",
    "You learn a lot in a short space of time. At first it doesn't feel like much work at all, but the pace at which you cover the material means that it can be overwhelming down the line if you didn't put in the time and effort at the beginning. It is a great start to the language and if you do the small amount of work and studying everyday then it is easy and fun.",
    "Good class, you learn a lot of Spanish. Workload is not bad, but make sure you prepare for class participation.",
    "It definitely requires time and effort to gain the most from the class, but it is very worthwhile and enjoyable."
