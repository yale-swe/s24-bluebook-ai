    "The course was a good overview of basic immunology. I just wish there was a more chronological way to teach the subject, as it often felt like piecing together bits and pieces of different lectures in order to get the big picture, and that got really confusing. It was easy to memorize small details of different processes but harder to figure out how one process relates to another. I was also not a big fan of the guest lectures at the end. Lecturers often reiterated basic immunology concepts that we had already been going over for weeks. Would have been better if they were briefed on concepts we had already covered so that they did not end up saying the same things we had already learned in lecture and they could get into more detail about more specific topics.",
    "A lot of material was covered in a short period of time. I found it very difficult to follow what was happening during lecture because everything was covered so quickly.",
    "Good overview of immunology, and I really learned the basics. Liked the book a lot!",
    "I was exempt from this course, but I still had to fill out this form.",
    "I think it is a good introduction to immunology, but the slides are dense, long, and convoluted. I think connecting all the broader concepts would have helped with studying for the exams.",
    "The course was a good overview of immunology. Some strengths were the comprehensiveness of the slides. However, the last part of the course consisting of mostly guest lecturers did not seem to fit with the heavy emphasis on molecular immunology at the beginning.",
    "I learned an enormous amount in this class. The discussions sections felt a little like a \"why not\" approach though where it was really difficult to glean exactly what the point of having them was. I think it should be defined early on exactly a specific goal to accomplish for the discussion sections and have each one build towards that. A lot of the work for the discussions felt like busy work that I didn't really learn a lot from.",
    "Course is interesting, but you basically have to teach yourself everything.",
    "I learned a lot! The guest lectures were great. It would be helpful to have more review of main concepts throughout the class, as having new info thrown at me week after week without some time for synthesis and review was a little overwhelming...but I did my best!",
    "A lot of memorization, which is not needed for non-immunology public health professionals. One exam could have been sufficient if you really have to test memorization skills.",
    "good course but class schedule could be more appropriately arranged. give more time to learning basic immunology prior to switching more towards the epi side\/\/guest lectures.",
    "Great basics of immunology. I actually feel counter to most of my classmates I believe, that more lectures in basic immunology would have been even better and there was enough epidemiology for an introductory course. I would make it a year long course.",
    "Dr. Krause was a really good professor. However, I don't need to go to lecture to read slides. I can do it at home. This teaching method needs to change.",
    "I think that this is an important class for EMD students to take in order to better understand dynamics of infectious diseases in terms of the human immune response. However, this class seems more strictly an immunology class than one for epidemiologists. Having this be the case, I feel like the structure of the class could be re-formatted to have the material last longer (instead of finishing in March), and have relevant examples integrated throughout (instead of putting applied examples and guest lectures at the end of the course). The material and the teaching of the course went so fast that it was hard to keep up during class. I also don't think that the discussion sections added that much more to the class. Michelle was a wonderful and talented TA, so this is in no way any reflection on her, but the format of the sections seemed like they were more of a filler than learning that much during them. If this is to be a class that looks at the epidemiology of immunology, I think these sections should more directly address this topic, instead of trying to have examples that seem like a stretch or tangentially relevant to the course. Essentially, I think that the course should either be taught just as an immunology class noting the applicability to ID, or should be more directly connected to epidemiology. Having it in this limbo makes it difficult to know where to focus in the class and is ultimately a little distracting and takes away from the overall course.",
    "The course material is not difficult to understand, but it does involve a certain level of memorization. Dr. Krause uses a lot of visuals in his slides, which is good. Perhaps instead of listing all the steps in a slide before the picture, it could be made more congruent. The picture could be split up and a small description of the step is on the same slide as the picture itself. A little more detail about vaccines would be nice, especially since we talk about it so much in other classes.",
    "Great course but a lot of info is squeezed into a short amount of time. Slides are dense. But I learned a LOT and really enjoyed the material.",
    "This course is a good introduction to immunology. It is fundamentally a biomedical course, not an epidemiology or public health course. However, the material that is presented is very important in understanding infectious disease and the research that is being done in that field. Then, I think it's a very important component of the EMD curriculum.",
    "I don't think this course should be required and it should be optional. For me this course was not something that I find at all useful to my degree, interests, or future career. In this course I memorized facts for the test and there were minimal connections to public health and epidemiology.",
    "Strengths: really enjoyed the material and hearing some epidemiological considerations of immunology; also thought having a final paper versus a final exam was a GREAT way to explore a topic more in depth and apply what was learned in class Improvements: Not sure how useful the discussion sections were. Would be useful to let the students know the competencies that are expected to be gained from the discussion section presentations"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was very kind and easy to get along with. He was always excited about a subject that can tend to get tedious and boring when trying to focus on so many small details. I do have a complaint about the exams, though - I don't think True\/False questions should be worth 5 points each. The 50\/50 odds make it really easy to kill your grade with only a few questions.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable, very friendly, really cares about all of his students! Does go through lectures a little too fast.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very fair, and genuinely wants his students to succeed. His grading looked for an understanding, and didn't try to trap you.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very nice and funny instructor.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0He's an affable and insightful instructor, but his mustache is too small to be taken seriously. It really should be larger and bushier for a man of his stature.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is a great professor who is very receptive to feedback and considerate of his students.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0I liked Dr. Krause a lot. I thought he was very engaging and fun.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Great guy, but I think he should talk a little slower. Also, the Monday class never ended on time, so I'm not sure if he knew the ending time.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Presented the information knowledgeably and did his best to answer all questions.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause makes excellent slides. He has limited knowledge on advanced immunology but he teaches effectively.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0very helpful outside of class, but tends to talk incredibly fast and just read off of his slides",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Kind and considerate to students. Made the material straightforward and fostered our retention.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Really good professor. Just needs to slowdown and teach using interesting examples illustrated by diseases or stories from science instead of reading the slides.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is concerned about his students and a great resource. During the class though, he needs to slow down the pace of material.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is a very good teacher. Sometimes the \"story\" in the lecture could be pieced together a bit better so that the lecture logically flows from one point to another. In the summary slides, maybe it could be listed out what happens from a to b. Sometimes Dr. Krause could speak a little slower, but overall the class was great!",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is very knowledgeable, great with students and very responsive to student needs. Always willing to meet with students and talk about anything. He could try slowing down during lessons and making slides less wordy.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was very approachable and seemed to genuinely care about student feedback.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Although I dislike the topic, Dr. Krause was such a friendly, nice, and helpful teacher. I disliked, however, that the lectures always seemed rushed.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Enjoyed Dr. Krause very much. Thoughtful, informative, willing to say when he didn't know something, and covered a lot of material."

   "comments": [
    "Can get boring, but necessary. Important for someone who has never taken an immunology course before, but redundant for those who have been previously exposed to the subject. Good overview of general concepts without being too detail-oriented.",
    "Great introduction to immunology!",
    "It's a survey course about human immunology. The first 2\/3 works through the textbook, and you learn about the innate and adaptive immune systems. The last 1\/3 takes that information and applies it to a number of real-world situations and diseases.",
    "This class is a good overview of immunology.",
    "I would recommend this course b\/c a background on immuno is really helpful!",
    "I actually did learn much out of it, even though I was not pleased that I have to do a lot of memorization in grad school.",
    "required course. useful if EMD but might need to retake a real immunology course if you want true understanding.",
    "This is a course all students studying infectious diseases must take. This made bigger concepts in infectious and epidemiology much more clear by affording a basic background of the immune system.",
    "This course is pretty basic. What you get out of it is largely determined by what you put into it during outside readings.",
    "The presentation styles after the first midterm were much better and more engaging than having us read the articles. The course was good overall. It's an interesting class, that isn't too work heavy.",
    "It's a lot of memorization, but I learned a lot in this course. Really enjoyed the second half where guest speakers came in and showed us how immunology can be applied to medicine, public health, etc. The paper was a good chance for us to delve deeper into an immunology-related topic of interest. Really enjoyed this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you have a strong interest in immunology.",
    "Really great opportunity to get an overview of immunology. Really fun class to learn about this aspect of the body's response to infection, allergens, and self-tissue."
