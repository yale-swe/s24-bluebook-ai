    "I've learned many topics on Earth science. It's strongly recommended.",
    "This course is geared towards the faculty. They all discuss things in half sentences around you, and interrupting these conversations is hard since you often don't know what they are talking about at all. One positive is that there is very little work involved except the week you will be presenting. However, if one of the faculty just decides they aren't going to agree with huge parts of your project that week can be quite disheartening.I would not recommend this course to other students unless the tone of the course is drastically changed. The main positive is that there is very little work involved, but if you aren't going to get much out of the class anyway it seem like a waste of time."

    "It helps to broaden the knowledge of geophysics and build up a solid foundation for future research.",
    "Although this course has the potential to deepen your knowledge of the geophysics discipline, due to its structure it is hard to get much out of it. I presented work I had done for my dissertation, but the course itself did not contribute to my dissertation. I did get one very good piece of advice on my work at the end of my presentation, but the semester I spent attending the talks and the hour presentation I gave where I basically spent the entire hour arguing, getting confused, and becoming quite disheartened hardly made this course seem worth it.",
    "It broadened my perspective on the various aspects of solid earth research."
