    "If you simply want to fulfill your language credit requirement and do not want to learn Japanese, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. If you want a great mental workout and the incredible opportunity to a) learn Japanese and b) possibly go to Japan for free to learn more Japanese, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! The faculty is incredible, the class is well structured, and I love my classmates and all that I've learned this semester. It is definitely 1.5 credit's worth of work - in terms of workload it was my most demanding class this semester. But it is immensely rewarding and just, just take this class. Take it.",
    "If you are looking to learn Japanese, then take this course. It is very effective, and class is always fun, but if you are looking for an easy language, you should not take this course."
