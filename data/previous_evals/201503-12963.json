    "Take this course. It is a performance and a final. Weekly class.",
    "A very enjoyable class component to the Yale Collegium Musicum. The expectations are clear and simple: rehearse with Grant and the ensemble, do the (light) readings, and do what you can to make the semester's performance(s) the best it\/they can be. This course is what one makes of it: I imagine that one could go through the motions with very little effort and still complete the course, gaining very little from the experience, but I know that a student who is an active and enthusiastic member of the ensemble will have a great time, learn a lot about an earlier era of music than what most theory and performance courses cover, and never be stressed out over having this class in their schedule. I would recommend this class highly to any student musicians who have any interest in historical performance (or are just especially interested in performance in general).",
    "A great class for anyone with a musical background. The course is part of the Collegium at Yale, so it mostly involves preparing for that semester's concert. You practice a variety of pieces relevant to the theme, and learn about music theory and history at the same time. As long as you pay attention to the theme and learn your music, it's a really fun and straightforward class. I loved it!",
    "It's just wonderful. It is bliss and hapiness and all that is rainbows. Please take it. Audition for Grant. It'll be painless.",
    "A terrific class on performance of early-period music that you otherwise may not ever get a chance to do again, this class was truly awesome and changed the way I viewed music history! There was a good balance between rehearsals for every class period versus the amount of history we learned detailing how the ancient people first founded what we now know as the Western way of describing music and composing music. (An interesting example: Do you know how Do Re Mi Fa So La came from? Take the class to find out!!) This class was very chill and I learned a lot. What more could you want? TAKE IT (unless you're tone deaf. Then I'm sorry)",
    "Take this course if you want to play really great old music and learn some interesting history too!",
    "Course in sightreading and learning old music that is super chill and fun if you're into this sort of stuff. Take it take it if you can sightread! Very easy credit and rehearsal is great! Grant is a wonderful and kind man.",
    "Basically an ensemble that you get credit for. There's a bit of reading and maybe a few words of writing, but it's pretty manageable. If you play an instrument, you can probably borrow an early version of your instrument to play in the ensemble, which is awesome."
