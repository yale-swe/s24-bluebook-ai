   "comments": [
    "This course was incredibly inaccessible. Even after taking (and doing well in) MUSI 110, the course ostracizes new musicians and moves at a pace incongruous with the course's goals. As someone with rather extensive training as a vocalist, but minimal engagement with music theory, I was completely left out to dry. The issue is that the course requires a huge amount of practice and drilling time outside of class for success, yet it's only worth half a credit. In juggling five other courses and extracurriculars, you will likely not perform well if you don't already feel confident in your music theory skills. Unfortunately, I leave the class feeling the same, if not worse, in my skills as a musician.",
    "Definitely improved my hearing as a musician",
    "I put more names to musical structures I already knew about. I trained my ear a little bit more.",
    "This course improved my chord identification, dictation, sight singing (mostly in step-wise motion), and rhythm-reading skills. The piano lab really helped me develop my grand staff reading skills and my overall ability on piano, which I had never really played before.",
    "Ear training, chords, intervals, dictation, rhythm.",
    "Ear training: intervals, chords (three part and sevenths), and dictations. Singing: sight reading and scales Rhythms Major and minor Figured bass in keyboard",
    "This class teaches basic ear training and sight singing skills.",
    "Kind of learned to sing solfege, identify chords, play piano with chord notations."

   "comments": [
    "I would split the class into two levels, as this one is simply inaccessible to new musicians having just finished MUSI 110. It should have moved slower, and more time should have been spent making sure every student was on the same page and comfortable with the material. The goals of the course should be adjusted as well, leaving more room for actual growth instead of flying by those who may be struggling. I find the problem to be larger and resting with the Music department as a whole; if a student comes to Yale from an underprivileged background, not having had access to the same resources in musicianship as others, they're made to feel unwelcome.",
    "More time spent explaining Tritones.",
    "The exercises we did during class were very helpful, but having more exercises to prepare outside of class would have made me practice sight singing more.",
    "Lots of opportunities for practicing the skills that were tested. Pretty dry though.",
    "The course is weak in that it is difficult for someone to teach you these skills in a lecture setting rather than 1-on-1 lessons. Nearly all of the work to learn the skills of this class must be done on your own. The course is structured well, though, and the skills do build on top of one another.",
    "It's just fun. Maybe they could have paired up people with similar piano abilities better."

   "comments": [
    "No. The sad fact is that MUSI 218 pretends to be a class that bridges lower level musicians with the higher level ones at Yale, but it's simply too inaccessible to be effective.",
    "Definitely! If you have any musical interest, take it. Not too much work at all and also challenging",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone who really wants to train their ear or who has a rudimentary understanding of music theory and musicianship. I only took this class because I had to take them alongside voice lessons for credit, and it ultimately felt like a huge waste of time.",
    "Yes. It creates a great foundation for advanced aural skills.",
    "Yes, but mostly because it lets you get credit for lessons.",
    "Yes! Its fun and you learn a lot about musicianship in a pretty structured format.",
    "This is a fun class to take if you're a musician with a weak ear. It's also required for many other music courses.",
    "Yeah take it."
