   "comments": [
    "if you're reading this, you probably have to take the course. this year, it was taught at way too high a level and the topics (afriat's theorem and ambiguity) were not particularly interesting. the reviews from previous years made the course sound really easy, but the majority of the class didn't understand most of the material. also, we had to write a ten page paper with original math research which was incredibly difficult. you don't have to do much work for this class though.",
    "One 45 minute lecture and a 10-page final research paper. A great senior seminar that combines learning with researching.",
    "If you're an Econ& Math major you best take the section intended for Econ& Math majors unless you've taken enough math to basically be a math major (in which case why aren't you?). The second half of the course was about optimal decision making and covered topics including Ellsberg's Paradox and prospect theory. This half was very interesting and the seminar style made the course way better than the first half with its endless lectures was. The key thing is to pick a seminar with an interesting topic.",
    "At first, I was very nervous about taking the course. The workload in the syllabus increased drastically compared to that from previous years. However, Professor Brown and Professor Luli do a great job in making sure we keep up and do well. The professors have high expectations for us, and that's the way it should be.The course was divided into two halves. For the first half of the semester, every student presented an assigned research paper to the class. About three students presented each week, and each student had roughly an hour to present. We spent the second half of the semester reading and discussing chapters from an assigned book. The professors led the discussions, and sometimes the class erupted in heated debates. Those were the most interesting. Lastly, we had to submit a research paper. We were able to work in groups, which made the task less daunting.Overall, I would recommend the course."
