   "comments": [
    "This was an interesting class and I'm really glad that I took it. I learned a lot about why we have inequality in the U.S. and why it plays out the way it does. Discussions were generally interesting. Professor Weaver was an entertaining teacher and had plenty of stories to tell. The readings were sometimes long and intense but worth doing. Not a great class if you don't like to speak up. Overall I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This was a very interesting and enjoyable course. It does have a very heavy reading load, and it takes a fairly liberal stand on the issues discussed (welfare, in particular). Discussions were engaging and Professor Weaver was very knowledgeable and helpful. Would definitely recommend.",
    "This class delves into topics of racial inequality, gender inequality, and class divisions. An important theme was how policy shapes inequality in America, sometimes unintentionally.",
    "Take it if you want to know your shit.",
    "Sure, take it. It's definitely not the worse class at Yale. It's also refreshing that you don't have to do weekly responses.",
    "Great class. I recommend it a lot if you're Poli Sci, Af Am, WGSS, American Studies, Sociology, etc., or if you're just interested in progressive issues and inequality more broadly. It will likely attract a great group of students, and Prof. Weaver is brilliant.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in understanding inequality from a fresher, richer perspective. However, read the syllabus carefully. While the workload is manageable throughout the year, having a research proposal, an op-ed, and a research project due all in the last month can be overwhelming. Visit her office hours, e-mail her, and demonstrate that you are passionate about the subject.",
    "US Inequality covers really fascinating material, but the workload, especially at the end, is not to be sneezed at. Rather than writing a research design, your final paper (~15 pages) needs to make an original argument based on research you've done, which is difficult to do in a week or so when you've got other papers and tests to juggle at the same time. Perhaps Professor Weaver will tweak deadlines or assignments in the future, but if not, be aware of what you're signing up for. I personally loved the material - the chance to read and then talk about American poverty, incarceration etc. - basically various causes of and solutions to areas where the American Dream has failed.",
    "Take it.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It's hard - I did the least well in it out of all my courses, even though I liked it the best and worked the hardest for it - but in the end very satisfying and I came out feeling like I had a working knowledge of the subject as well as a great desire to learn more.",
    "Prof. Weaver is obviously a great scholar in her field but the course needs more development.",
    "The topics covered and the readings were super interesting, although towards the end of the term the discussions in class often seemed to circle around back to the same issues.Assignments: Midterm Paper, Research Design (for Final Paper), and Final Paper.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are deeply interested in the subject or if you have not taken others like it. Because the material is almost exclusively book-\/academic study-based, it can get repetitive, and many of the weeks seemed simply to reaffirm what had been long-held convictions for many students. This being said, it the readings were carefully chosen, and discussions engaging."
