    "General building block knowledge about the development of the Industrial Revolution and its consequences on the economies of the surrounding nations.",
    "Broad understanding of economic development, especially in Great Britain, over the \"long 18th-century\" (late 17th to early 19th century).",
    "If you want to learn the meaning of truth, take this class. Was the Industrial Revolution REALLY a revolution? Nothing could be further from the truth. This class teaches you how to question many of the events that happened in Economic History. You get a broad brush of some of the most important and contentious debates. Each class is exactly like a different episode of a series, but I promise you by the end you will be able to formulate a very coherent picture. TAKE IT!",
    "Learned a lot about European economic history",
    "I gained a lot of information regarding European Economic history and learned a lot about the cross section between Economics and History in a way my previous economics classes haven't done.",
    "The approach to understanding economic history and the analysis of evidence and primary sources"

   "comments": [
    "Good variation in coursework, manageable and interesting reading",
    "Strengths: 1) Prof. Guinnane is a phenomenal lecturer, 2) the readings were fascinating, 3) I enjoyed the 3-page short papers because they require us to summarize a longer academic paper, which is a useful writing skill to practice.",
    "You learn a lot of interesting facts in this class. From the Industrial Revolution to the Poor and Corn Laws, you get a grip on whether British development was exceptional and how that compared to countries in Continental Europe. You also learn the importance of counterfactuals. Would things have been very different had the UK not engaged in imperialism? Would things have been different if the UK didn't participate in the Slave Trade? If you are curious about the natural trajectory of history, this is the class for you. Just remember that we only lived through one realization!",
    "Overall very strong class. A good improvement would be allowing students to choose the topic of the last class. I feel like there was very little space for students to challenge the material that was presented, so it would have been nice to be able to pick a paper to write on for the last essay that countered some of the ideas we were presented. I find it helpful to test the arguments I'm studying by looking at the opposing argument, and there wasn't much of that in this class.",
    "Very good course",
    "I think the biggest strength was the way the content was delivered, I found the lectures very interesting. The weakness would probably be that the problem sets only approached the content broadly.",
    "Very strong in classroom engagement and teaching. Yet leaves a lot of direction to syllabus and requires a lot of individual planning.",
    "The course materials are well organized and interesting. It focused a lot on England and briefly on the Continent, and painted a rather comprehensive picture evolving around agriculture, industrial revolution and technological changes. I definitely obtained fresh perspectives towards economic history after taking this course."

   "comments": [
    "Very strongly would recommend. Prof. Guinnane is a good teacher and the course is very engaging",
    "100% would recommend. Possibly the best course I've taken at Yale (I'm a sophomore, so take that into consideration). The course was so wide-ranging, covering topics from agriculture to demography to capital markets to welfare policy to transportation to trade, etc. In terms of sheer volume and memorable-ness, the knowledge I learned more in this course surpasses that of any other course.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn the importance of Britain in European History. The class is really centered on British development, during the eighteenth and nineteenth century, but it gives you the chance to question a lot of the events which happened. If you are curious why Britain was the first country in this world to industrialize, you will find this course enthralling. Even though it is a lecture, it is taught in a very seminar-esque fashion where the Professor asks a lot of questions. I am yet to learn as much from a course I took at Yale.",
    "I definitely recommend this course! Most ECON lectures are dry and poorly organized, while Professor Guinnane came to class with the best lecture plans I have ever seen in an Econ lecture. The subject may seem uninteresting, but Professor Guinnane teaches you a framework to analyze economic arguments at large, so even if you're not super engaged in England in the 1700s, you'll still get a lot out of the class.",
    "Yes, very interesting course. Very good class for an economics elective",
    "Maybe. Depends on how much they are interested in the content.",
    "Yes; incredibly interesting topic taught exceptionally well. Just make sure to read the syllabus thoroughly and often.",
    "Yes. Quite engaging and interesting, can get away with doing few readings and paying attention to lecture but the readings are quite interesting in themselves"
