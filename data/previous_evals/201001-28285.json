    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is interesting and the work load is manageable.",
    "It's a good class for someone interested in inter-disciplinary studies. In this case, the course covered both economic and environmental topics. I would recommend the class - the instructor was very good, and the course material was very engaging.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to other students particularly to those with economic background. The fact that we were able to work on our own project of interest allowed us to apply class knowledge better.",
    "The class is an introduction to the major issues in environment and development. There are many topics that no doubt have been touched upon in other classes, but this class will give you a more in-depth understanding of them: the environmental kuznets curve, climate change, conservation and development etc. I would recommend this class to another student because it is a good overview of topics that are very relevant to current issues and Prof. Gollin provides a way to understand many of the academic papers on the subject.",
    "RECOMMENDED FOR INTRO LEVEL STUDENTS WITHOUT PRIOR INTERNATIONAL FIELD WORK",
    "I would recommend the course to other students as a course that provides a useful blend of practical and theoretical work and bridges the gap between economic theory and policy."

    "The course fulfilled my interest in environmental economics and should be helpful in my future career.",
