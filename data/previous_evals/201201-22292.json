    "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS! you learn SO MUCH and it's SO FUN. you get to watch bollywood movies...and the books are a breeze to read. the workload is very manageable and what you get out of this class is worth it. if you're interested in pop culture..or india...at all...TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "Considering this is a themed class, it actually ended up being reasonably substantive. It's also a lot of fun - you meet great people through watching the movies.",
    "Take it definitely! It's a great window into popular culture in India. You'll never look at a Bollywood film the same way again. You do need to put the work into the class though. Do the reading and watch the movies to get the most out of it.",
    "Yes! Take this course, it's a lot of fun and I learned a lot.",
    "This class was very good. We learned about Indian popular culture and the context of many of the trends in Indian cinema and novels in the post-colonial era. Professor Chanda is quite knowledgeable, but sometimes I wish she tried to find out if the reading load was too much\/too little. Perhaps, next time, she may consider adding an anonymous rating system to find out if the readings were too long so she can adjust accordingly. Sometimes, I felt like I couldn't really read everything. That being said, Professor Chanda is a wonderful professor who is really dedicated to her field of study and really cares about her students. She is willing to both critique your arguments while still accepting a different opinion as long as you can back it up.",
    "its a good writing credit, especially if youve seen all the movies, its not too time consuming.",
    "I definitely learned more about Indian culture by taking this class. There is not too much work assigned every week, and the class discussions and presentations are pretty engaging.",
    "This course is a great course in terms of the material covered, but is by no means easy. If you keep up with your reading, you'll be fine! Participate often in class!",
    "Take it if you need, but overall not worth it.",
    "The class was a diverse mix of students which made discussions interesting. You learn a lot about Indian culture and the diaspora, a subject where information isn't very well known. I definitely recommend the class to anyone who wants to understand Indian culture better.",
    "YES. great class. good amount of reading and moves are long (usually between 2.5 and 3 hours), so be sure you have the time for it, because the classes are focused on BOTH the readings and the movies.",
    "This class is definitely more than just a class on Bollywood; it is very much an analysis of how different forms of popular culture can construct an image of a nation or a culture. The concepts discussed in class were very interesting, though discussion in class did lag sometimes but that's something to expect in almost every seminar-style class. It was a bit difficult to understand what exactly Professor Chanda was looking for each week, which might be why some consider her a hard grader. However, if the subject matter greatly interests you, I would say definitely take the course for the course's sake.",
    "Not a gut class. It was surprisingly rigorous, and covered a serious depth and breadth of media. Definitely the sort of class you get out what you put in.There is a large women's studies component - as that's a driving issue in Indian media. Not a problem unless you find that particularly boring, but definitely something to expect.",
    "If you looooooove watching Bollywood movies every week and debating Indian people about what these movies say about being Indian, then you'll looooove this class. It's a lot of fun, Chanda is a wonderful professor and woman. She has strong opinions but she's always willing to listen."
