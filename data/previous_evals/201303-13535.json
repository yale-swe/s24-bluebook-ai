    "Perfect survey course of river processes.",
    "Jim and Jenn are an awesome team. The only reason my comments on the field trips were a bit more neutral was that I could not attend all of them.Jim is one of those lecturers whose practical experience in the field makes him so on-point, and totally in command of the material. He is so much fun to take classes with I really respect him. He collaborates with students and makes an effort to explain complicated concepts clearly and provide opportunities to reinforce learning with field experience. THe last couple of classes he made new slides to respond to specific subjects of student interest. Just great. This could be a really straightforward course and he chooses to elevate it. Thanks, Jim!",
    "We grappled with a lot of material in the course, and the instructor presented a breadth of material in a very clear and approachable manner. The professor and the TF have a great enthusiasm for the subject and it shows.",
    "Jim MacBroom's energy, enthusiasm, and thoughtfulness are on display every day. I cannot even guess how many days he must have spent outside of class, taking students on field trips, visiting project sites. He must be the hardest working, most committed professor at FES. He spent almost 4 hours with me, one-on-one at my field site. We had a great time and I learned a lot.",
    "Jim's teaching is awesome! He made the class feel small and welcoming. I enjoyed all aspects of the course. Jenn is also amazing and was so helpful with questions!",
    "Limit class size",
    "The class is very practical and applied.",
    "1. The readings for the class are especially useful as reference materials, but they are not the kinds of readings that warrant reading straight through (the 450-page Army Corps of Engineers Channel Restoration Design Manual, for instance).9. The field trips were very successful in demonstrating concepts from the class. The instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extensive knowledge about (and enthusiasm for) Connecticut\u00e2\u0080\u0099s streams made them all the more worthwhile.10. The instructor was good at explaining the material, but it would have been helpful to have more problem sets along the way; it also would have been helpful to have a class in the computer lab, where we could work together to learn how to use some of the software that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently utilized in river planning and restoration (USGS StreamStats, HEC-RAS, etc.).14. I think the class is valuable to students with similar interests as mine. Even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an MF candidate, I think this class was extremely valuable. Water quality is an important goal of a lot of forest management, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great to better understand the determinants of water quality, in addition to the factors affecting the physical and biological nature of streams.",
    "This course was interesting, well-organized, and relevant to many other courses offered at FES. Jim and Jenn's commitment to the students was impressive, and much appreciated. Overall, excellent!"

    "The field trips were invaluable for learning! The assignments corresponded appropriately with the field trips, and were graded fairly.The group project was useful. At first I was not pleased that it was real-world vs. literature research, but I learned a lot from the data collection& analysis!",
    "Great prof., TF, and course.",
    "See above",
    "The combination of lectures, field trips, projects and problem sets, which allowed us to tackle both analytical and conceptual problems and apply our new skills to real world client-based projects.",
    "Jim's enthusiasm and his experience as a practitioner.",
    "I really appreciated the field trips. They were well designed, illustrated the topics we covered in class, and they were fun!Jim's powerpoint slides are also quite good.",
    "Jim's responsiveness to questions and sharing his depth of experience. Also, the story about Jim attaching himself to a railing during a hurricane just so he could monitor tide gates on his own time was incredible. A story I will never forget. :)",
    "It is applied.",
    "Professor MacBroom's enthusiasm for river restoration is contagious and his knowledge on the topic is extensive. The field trips were a great way to apply and visualize what we were learning in class.",
    "The fact that Jim has been working in this field for many years makes for a much more interesting lecture. His ability to add personal experience and stories to the subject matter make for a dynamic and compelling class.",
    "Jim's expertise and most of the restoration projects he talked about he actually worked on.",
    "The group project and field trips provide great hands-on learning opportunities and glimpses into real-world problem solving.",
    "The field trips were extremely helpful in solidifying the information we read about and learned in class. Jim was an excellent instructor, especially in the field.",
    "Field trips! They were really helpful to learn and apply what was discussed in the classroom.",
    "One of the best aspects of the course is that the instructor is an experienced practitioner who has planned and designed a great variety of stream restoration projects. This course strikes a good balance between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of river assessments and analysis. It is also useful to learn how streams are classified and to become familiar with the two prominent river classification systems. Lastly,the instructor is hilarious and incredibly engaging!",

That said, Jenn worked tirelessly to make the semester work as well as it did with the numbers.Also, I think that incorporating in-class discussions or in-class problem solving\/problem sets would be beneficial to drive home important concepts. 3 hour lectures are tough for anybody to sit through!",
    "The power point slides are difficult to follow sometimes, and the updated slides are not always posted on Classes v2The channelization paper assignment was kind of vague - I wasn't sure how much general channelization information to include rather than just addressing the river channelization from the field trip",
    "I think a larger section on land use impacts on river process would be very good- we essentially just look at the river itself, not the surrounding hydrology.",
    "I think the final project was a bit unclearMaybe we could do a couple more case studies - like they could give us a stream - hydrological data - dimensions - history - and we could provide recommendations",
    "I appreciated the flexibility of the lecture structure during the last third of the semester, but also think that the format could be improved, possibly by providing additional readings or arranging more formal class discussions.",
    "Three hours is a long time to pay attention!",
    "I would like to see more lectures like the last few of the course, where specific issues or regions are discussed in detail.",

    "Stagger the work load more evenly through the semester.",
    "Back half of the course needs more structure\/content\/accountability. The course really lost steam by the end.",
    "I don't really have much to add here.",
    "The midterm exam material seemed to be disconnected from the way the course was taught and material that was covered. It would be great to have Jim's textbook earlier on in the course (earlier than the day before the exam) since several of the exam questions seemed to come from this text.",
    "I thought that the course worked well as is. It was a bit difficult having a 3 hour 20 minute long course, but it worked fine.",
    "The weakest part of this class, I think, is the exams (and I'm not usually one to complain about exams). Thank goodness there were previous years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exams to look over, because most of the questions were either (1) very ambiguous or (2) often unrelated to the material we covered. Otherwise, I thought the class itself was excellent!",

    "Yes, the course was just scientific enough that it satisfied my desire for depth but it did not get bogged down in equations and tables.The course scratches the surface of many aspects of rivers and management and Jim is so knowledgeable that he can direct you to deeper knowledge source (or give you a lecture on it himself)",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes",
    "No, I had expected to be more competent and confident in my ability to make river assessments and that I would have acquired a higher level of technical skills.",
    "Yes. Again, the course is practical and applied and I feel like I left with useful skills in watershed management plan development and river classification and assessment.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "It would be great to see more of the computer modeling in the course, otherwise it seemed to be a good overview of stream restoration, classification, and processes.",
    "Yes. I did not know what to expect when I started the class but after taking it I feel like I have a good understanding of how a river changes over time, how it impacts a landscape, and how to improve a waterway with management.",
    "Yes, the knowledge and skills I gained in this class met and exceeded my expectations.",
    "I learned a lot from this course. It definitely met my expectations.",
    "I am hoping to learn more in the future.",
    "Yes, and far surpassed my expectations.",
    "Yes.",
    "Course exceeded my expectations."

   "comments": [
    "The major benefit of group work is the opportunity for learning from classmates. I enjoyed working as a team despite the frustrations of seemingly slower progress on assignments. While I had several classmates in my group, I was able to take the most away from the student who had previous experience in the field and for that I was grateful.",
    "I understand that group work is essential in this field, but it seemed difficult to do group work in this course because of hectic schedules, differing levels of experience, and different levels of engagement with the field site. We are currently trying to put our group presentation together and it is difficult to reach team members to develop a cohesive product. Some students have been working on their forest management projects at the site and seemed to transpose their field work from that project onto this project.",
    "Advantage was that we could delve into our interests. Disadvantage was the difficulty of defining what our project was and how to do it.",
    "Advantages were not doing data collection and analysis independently.Disadvantages were nothing unusual--compromising ideas, and scheduling\/getting everyone to work at the same time.It was a good project!",
    "Scheduling. Otherwise great to do teamwork.",
    "Usual group work dynamics. Fine.",
    "Advantages: you learn from expertise of others, get outsideDisadvantages: coordination and typical tragedy of the commons challenges",
    "Advantages: balancing skill sets and collaborating with peers in a way that is more reflective of how river restoration projects are carried out in the fieldDisadvantages: having to compensate for other students who don't put forth equivalent effort.",
    "Discussions were useful to fill gaps\/ clarify topics from class and field trips.",
    "Allowed me to meet new people and learn how others from different backgrounds approach problems and apply their skills\/knowledge toward the project. Scheduling is always a challenge as everyone has various demands on their time.",
    "Sharing work and observations. For this project, it was very helpful to have other people to work with and compare notes on observations.",
    "It was extremely challenging to get one of our group members to contribute, despite giving numerous opportunities and \"assignments\" (although they did finally mention that they were facing health problems). I think we suffered from having too many people in our group and a little case of free-riding. I know its tough to have a huge number of groups given the size of the class, but perhaps limiting the size of groups to 3 could reduce some of the problems we had.In Coastal Governance, Prof. Burroughs had us rate team members in terms of participation, timeliness, etc. with a (Qualitrics?) survey before and after our group project. The survey beforehand was a good reminder of how to be good group workers, and results from the survey as part of our grade gave us extra incentive to perform well.",
    "For our final project we were put into groups to write a report on a watershed or river of our choice. This was a great project because we had to apply all of the knowledge from class to writing a potentially useful management plan.",
    "Group work was really useful during the site assessment part of our final project, in particular because the workload was too much for one person. Organizing a big group was somehow difficult and some team members worked more than others.",
    "N\/A",
    "I found the group work to be one of the best parts of the course. I liked how applicable our projects were to the course work. We got to practice the field methods that we had learned about in class. I learned a lot from working with the group.",
    "n\/a"

    "Select a project that really interests you but has clear goals that you can accomplish within the scope of the class.",
    "Take it!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "The readings are fascinating. Read what they give you and go seek out more on your own that pertain to issues or regions that you might be interested in studying.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it! You don't want to miss this course with Jim MacBroom. And the student project is a great way to get practical experience on your resume.",
    "Do it. Spend as much time with Jim and Jenn as possible.",
    "If you have any interest in rivers, take this class.",
    "Take it.",
    "Jim has a wealth of knowledge and when he talks about a subject he really likes he can get very excited. Great class!",
    "I would definitely suggest this course to anyone who is interested in working outdoors. Waterways are an important part of any landscape and Jim puts a lot of effort into making the class applicable to students' interests and backgrounds.",
    "I strongly advise you to take this class, purchase the Rosgen field guide, and go on all of the field trips. For someone looking for a class that is conceptual but also very practical and applied, this is a great option. The instructor is terrific and the final project is very useful. There is also plenty of flexibility to take the concepts learned in the class and apply them in a way that is relevant to your particular interests.",
    "a lot of learning depends on the student - how much deeper to go into each topic. interact with jim - he is awesome!",
    "Take this course!",
    "Take the course. You'll be glad you did.",
    "Great class. Jim is extremely knowledgeable, dedicated and well respected in the field. This course was a major factor in my decision to enroll in FES."
