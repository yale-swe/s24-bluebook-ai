   "comments": [
    "Excellent suvey course on middle eastern history from 1800 to present day.",
    "Yes, excellent way to learn about the Middle East.",
    "Modern Middle East Studies 441 is great for students looking for a solid foundation in the modern Middle East, but the professor - and sometimes the material - can be dry. Ultimately, the class will be defined by the reading teaching assistant. The reading was interesting, but it was copious. My teaching assistant was great, but that's a risk future students will take with the class since the teaching assistants will change.",
    "The history of the modern Middle East is an important and interesting topic, and a lot of the reading is very good, but unfortunately Professor Amanat is not a good lecturer. He is a very interesting person to talk to, and his books are great, but his lectures are terribly boring. Either resign yourself to skipping a lot or just not paying attention. If Victor McFarland is a TA, go to his section - he's great.",
    "Pretty standard history lecture. If you've done this before, you can pretend you way to a satisfactory grade.",
    "I would steer clear of this one.",
    "This is an interesting class that gives you all the historical information to understand the Middle East as it is today. There is a lot of course reading but you can get by with some combination of selective reading each week.The professor can be long winded on some topics which can be boring but all the subject matter of the course is really interesting.The sections are small which is great for interesting discussion, but its also high pressure.",
    "If you are enthusiastic about history in the Middle East, this is the course for you. If you are taking it for any other reason, it will be a lot of work, and quite difficult to enjoy."
