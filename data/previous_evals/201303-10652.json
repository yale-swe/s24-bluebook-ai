    "Introduction to the theory of music for musicians and beginners alike.I do not see any reason not to recommend the course to another student.",
    "YES! Take it, you'll enjoy the class!",
    "This class was really great and I encourage anyone who might have any interest in music or learning music theory to take it! The class ran a bit slow at times, but it was fun. It's a small class (I think there were 10 students in my section), so you get to know the other students and your teacher well. If you have a bit of music experience, it will start slow since you start at the VERY beginning of music theory (like learning about whole notes and the music staff). However, it picks up speed then goes quickly. The homework assignments took a surprisingly long time -- I would spend 2 hours\/assignment by the end (and we had an assignment for each class.) Overall, great course! I started it Credit\/D but switched once I realized the only way to do poorly was to not do work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student wishing to gain a very basic understanding of music theory. It isn't too difficult and the workload is nothing that is too difficult to handle. The grading is very fair and nothing is ridiculous!",
    "Depending on your musical background, this course may be easy or difficult to keep up with at first because the first couple of weeks cover the very basics of music--rhythm, pitch, meter, pulse, etc.--at a rapid pace. Still, it will help anyone who wants to learn music theory and eventually continue on to learning composition and analysis of musical pieces (which is briefly introduced in this course). I would recommend this course to anyone who is genuinely interested in music theory.",
    "A basic introduction to music from reading music to harmonic analysis. You go from not knowing anything about music to being able to analyze a complex piece.",
    "This class definitely helped me round out my knowledge of music theory. I already knew many of the basics (dynamics, time signature, notes of the treble clef, etc.), but having played violin for most of my life, there were big holes in my musical background (i.e. I knew nothing at all about the bass clef). This class definitely helped to fill those holes. Whether you want to brush up on existing knowledge, or you know nothing about music at all, this class will help you immensely. This is in no small measure due to Prof. Tahirih Motazedian, who is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about the material. A great class for any person of any major who enjoys music.",
    "A fast-paced intro music theory course that covers a great deal beyond just the basics, with a great foundation in the basics. I would absolutely recommend 110. It filled in a lot of gaps for those with prior musical background, and it is definitely a great course for anyone."
