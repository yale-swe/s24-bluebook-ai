   "comments": [
    "Metrics and materiality",
    "This course was not what I expected. I expected it to give me hands on skills of how to actually define, create, and implement CR plans in businesses, but I did not get any of that from this course. Most of the lessons were just confusing scrawls on the whiteboard or disorganized slide presentations, full of acronyms, and very unclear. The assignments were all incredibly vague, and left us interpreting the assignment for 1.5 hours before beginning work on it.",
    "The standards for CSR reports The metrics idea to evaluate Corpresponsibility Many practice and real case study",
    "Learned about different tools, resources, and concepts for understanding corporate sustainability metrics and indicators",
    "Basic understanding of reporting frameworks and the landscape of CSR in 2019.",
    "Biggest takeaway was understanding the framework of materiality and how stakeholder engagement is key to understanding how businesses understand and evaluate their sustainability challenges.",
    "I learned about the various metrics and tools used by corporations to document ESG progress.",
    "I think what I took away most was how conducting materiality assessments (and the boundaries with which we draw them) is incredibly wishy-washy and stakeholder informed - which means that reporting that caters to stakeholers on material issues varies greatly from company to company.",
    "A solid introduction to corporate responsibility work. Very practical if you plan to work in this field.",
    "great overview of metrics needed in a CSR career",
    "Great overview of the metrics approaches and methods. I feel more confident about talking on multiple topics related to CSR metrics.",
    "I took home a big-picture understanding of: 1) Why a company chooses to evaluate certain metrics 2) Who it evaluates for 3) The process of declaring something material to a company 4) External standards for quality of evaluation 5) External standards for quality of progress in a given company. I also appreciated the case studies Todd offered to further our learning--reading real-life sustainability, ESG, and annual reports provided a level of comparison and understanding between companies. I left understanding what Todd means when he describes reporting as both an \"art\" and a \"science\"--there is a certain amount of subjectivity that goes into a company's choices on a given topic.",
    "I gained a superficial view of metrics around corporate sustainability."

   "comments": [
    "Expectedly",
    "As above - I expected a lot more from this class, and left feeling as though I haven't learned any applicable skills.",
    "Help me form a deeper understanding on key issues on CSR reports such as inclusivity and materiability. Learn the standards for making a CSR report.",
    "Very well! I felt much more knowledgeable about the different considerations in CSR, from the history of CSR to the challenges companies face today. I feel much equipped in many of the key terms and resources used by professionals in this field",
    "Fairly well",
    "Very applicable and a good overview of the current status of corporate sustainability and where the industry is heading.",
    "Absolutely loved i!",
    "Very well - Todd is an exceptionally clear and near encyclopedic lecturer on this topic.",
    "I felt it covered the skills and material I was expecting. Definitely focused on environmental sustainability more so than other human rights issues, but that made sense to me since it's a larger portion of the field.",
    "very well",
    "I found the course to be helpful in learning about the approaches to metrics. I am glad I also took Sustainable Finance too. The knowledge gained helped me talk with confidence about materiality, metrics and CSR.",
    "I thought it would be a more hands-on class. For example, we discussed the materiality graph but none of the assignments were related to this. The same thing happened with the \"tornado chart\": we discussed it in class, but we did not have to do one by ourselves. Therefore, at this point, although I kind of know how these tools are created I do not believe that I could create it by myself because I never had the chance to practice it."

   "comments": [
    "Weakness: there are no slides provided on canvas so it is sometimes difficult to catch up with the logic of the professor.",
    "This course could benefit from much more organization during each lecture. In particular, lecture slides could be used to guide todd in his thinking and help us understand where he is going with his thoughts. It was very unclear what he wanted us to get out of each lecture.",
    "Strength: case practice and guest speakers",
    "Strength: how much ground was covered, Todd's high level of knowledge Weakness: might be nice to have more hands-on, or perhaps technical assignments or activities",
    "Strengths: interesting case studies, enjoyed the group work. Weaknesses: could have presented more in-class cases rather than dealing in theory. Wish the expectation\/norm that readings were optional had not been set - lowered engagement with the class right from the start.",
    "Professor Cort is an engaging and organized lecturer and systematically breaks down corporate sustainability into distinct, cogent units. I also really appreciated him leveraging his professional connections to bring in practicioners to discuss how they are viewing sustainability today. The group assignments were well designed and Professor Cort always provided useful feedback on our deliverables.",
    "Only negative was that we focused on a wide variety of metrics, and I wish we just focused on 2\/3 main ones and did a deep dive.",
    "I believe it could be improved with A) aligning the Van Oord project with the client visit, and having some sort of toolkit that we build on and are forced to recall for assignments in a more structured way. Todd also gives the most straightforward and timely feedback of any professor I've had.",
    "I found the projects to be quite interesting, loved the teamwork component. Wished we could also review some of the case studies of corporate sustainability. The speaker from GE was amazing!",
    "I appreciated the hands-on evaluation of real companies. I also liked the day we played the board game--I thought that (quickly) showed how execs interact in the process of materiality assessments. It would have been ideal for the Van Oord presenters to come later in the semester when we had more context, but I understand that their schedule was likely very busy. I would have liked Todd's honest opinion on companies to shine through more given his extensive experience (i.e. \"these are the companies that do it really well, and here are qualities of their reporting that are especially great, versus the companies that lack transparency or wash over details\"). Todd is funny and likeable and the best days were those when he had most fun as a professor and shared stories from hi s work.",
    "S: guest speakers and final project W: the assignments were not practical and the prompts were not clear most of the times."

    "Carefully cultivate your group project team! They are a big determinant of how much you will enjoy work outside of class",
    "It does not offer a very practical approach, but it helps gain a general view of metrics."
