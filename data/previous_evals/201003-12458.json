   "comments": [
    "No papers - just map quizzes, a midterm and a final. Interesting readings, fantastic professor, and a great way to get a rest-of-the-world credit. Take it.",
    "A must-take class. You learn so much despite (because of?) the light workload. A great survey that makes you want to learn more about African history. I would love to take a class just on the Yoruba Wars or really on any of the topics that Prof. Harms covered.",
    "It's a great history class for those who want to learn more about an interesting time or for people who want a good ROW credit",
    "Take it",
    "Africa in the Era of the Slave Trade was a great overview of the early history of the kingdoms of West Africa. There is no other class like it at Yale so I appreciated the perspective it gave. I would most definitely recommend the course for any other student.",
    "Absolutely. I never had much experience in courses related to Africa, and this has absolutely peaked my interest to explore African history further. It will make you re-think every stereotype you ever had about slavery and Africa. It is very well-structured and not too challenging of a course, but is extremely rewarding.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. It covers a perspective about the transatlantic slave trade that is wholly absent from the discourse on slavery and race in America. The work is completely manageable, and even though it can be fact-intensive at times, section time really helps to piece together both individual narratives and overall themes. Take this class!",
    "I took this to satisfy the history major's non-US\/European requirement and got A LOT more out of it than I anticipated. You learn some really interesting stuff in this course. Reading load isn't too much either and exams were fair.",
    "For those interested in African history, this class will force you to reconsider many of the assumptions you might hold about the slave trade",
    "Africa in the Era of the Slave Trade is a real gem of a course, one of the best Rest of the World Courses currently offered by the Yale History department. It is a shame that Robert Harms is now the only Africanist at Yale; this being the case, however, you would be remiss to pass on this class. The course does a terrific job of blending microhistories in reading with broader thematic trends in lecture. I learned a ton about Africa in this formative era. Some of the assessments are strange -- manageable, although often complex, readings, no paper, only a midterm and a final. I would have liked to have seen some writing, as that really is how history is best done. Nonetheless, a great lecture that I would definitely recommend.",
    "I took this course to fill a distribution requirement, but I came to enjoy the material intrinsically. Professor Harms is an excellent lecturer, the readings are manageable and accessible, and not having to write a paper was great, but the course themes and narrative are interesting enough to merit taking this course.",
    "I would recommend it as a way to fulfill the history distribution requirements and as an introduction to the pre-industrial history of Africa.",
    "A good lecture choice for your rest-of-the-world requirement. Demonstrates that African history is not all about Europeans taking over--some native Africans had a lot of agency, and it was not the slave trade that directly led to colonization. Exams are straight-forward. Remember to create outlines and study guides for all of the less-than-familiar names and places. The 9:20 AM time did not bother me too much.",
    "Africa in the Era of Slave Trade is a good lecture course that presents a comprehensive view of the African societies that were affected by slave trade with Europeans. Professor Harms does a good job of addressing the controversies of the slave trade and of explaining the structure of African societies that had indigenous traditions of slavery. The workload is not too heavy and the readings are pretty entertaining. However, the lectures are occasionally disorganized or repetitive. Overall, a solid course.",
    "Yes - interesting course with a course load that is easy to manage",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the subject, with or without background on the time period--if you know the European side, it will help you a lot with the chronology, but the material is all about Africa. I am an English\/IS major and I took this class to fulfill a requirement for IS. The reading was relatively light and mostly primary sources. Lecture was interesting but a little hard to follow--Prof. Harms is far more knowledgeable and creative than he is organized. The exams weren't difficult, but it's definitely necessary to do lecture (more for the essays and the reading (more for the IDs) in order to do well. Section was (dare I say?) fun, including group analysis of readings, review games, and sometimes other fun activities."
