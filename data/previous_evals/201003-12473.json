    "I really enjoyed this class. Much of what we learned was extremely interesting and very applicable. It really depends on who is teaching though.",
    "This class goes over a bunch of different specific techniques in data analysis. I isn't really a survey of the field. More of a sampling of different techniques\/areas of the field to get you better at statistical programming (in R) and to teach you about some cool stuff. I think it was definately worth taking. Also - no tests or exams. Just 4 homework assignments that were pretty time consuming by totally doable.",
    "I definitely recomend this class to everybody who is interested in applied mathematics and statistics. The class will teach you how to approach different real life problems from multiple fields. Professor Zhang is very passionate about the class and the lectures are well organized. The homework is doable (but takes some time) and it feels very satisfying to finish the problem sets."
