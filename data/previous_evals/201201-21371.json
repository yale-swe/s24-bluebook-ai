    "Only take it if you have to; if you're reading this evaluation, it's because you've already taken CHEM116L. Basically, it's a continuation of that - more mindless titrations, longer lab reports. Terribly structured; a complete waste of time.",
    "You're taking this because you're premed or a future chem major. There's no getting around it. Here's my advice: Don't take lab on Friday (it ruins the end of the week). Don't take night lab (it screws with your eating and work habits). Study the example lecture quizzes that are sent out ahead of time. Excel is your friend (the graphs for the lab reports can be killer).",
    "it was the worst experience, and i dreaded it every week. i would NOT recommend this course to anyone but most people that are looking into it have to take it anyways so... it doesn't really matter.",
    "It is harder than Chem 116.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is very helpful for doing well in Chem 115 and you also learn interesting experiments that occur in daily life.",
    "Way too much work for a half-credit course, but you know that you have to take it. It is more about mastering massive amounts of mindless work than about gaining a better understanding of experimental methods in chemistry, but if you choose to read the background sections\/listen in pre-lab, you might be better off than before. Make sure you havea working knowledge of excel and be prepared for a stressful final practical exam.",
    "I'd recommend Chem 117L to another student. It's intense (definitely deserves more than 0.5 credits), but the lessons you learn are invaluable.",
    "I'm not really sure why you would take this if it is not a pre-requisite . It is very straight forward and thus the material is not always very interesting. Not a bad class, just not one that I would take for fun.",
    "Only take this course if you are pre-med or VERY interested in chemistry.",
    "only take it if you have to",
    "It's more interesting than 116L, but focuses a lot on spectrophotometry rather than titrations. You learn a lot more in this lab than in the last one, and it actually helps with the lecture class as well. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone taking the lecture.",
    "It's not terrible--- if you have to take it, just do it.",
    "If you take time to read his instructions, Dr. G always makes what you have to do very clear. He's always available to help you if you are confused, you just have to take advantage of the help he can offer and approach him. If you stay on top of he lap reports and read the lab well beforehand, the work is manageable.",
    "The course it fine, but never never never sign up for night lab. It is especially difficult to focus on experiments and enjoy them after dinner. Also, you really don't want to be on science hill after dark. There is a shuttle that goes back down to cross campus, but it is still an undesirable situation. Something about the night puts everyone in lab in a bad mood. Just don't do it.",
    "Not unless you have to take it.",
    "If you are not pre-med, I have no idea why you would ever. But if you are, it could be way worse!",
    "Chem 117L, if you're looking at these evaluations, is a necessary evil. You're probably taking it to fulfill a pre-med requirement. My suggestion is to try to spend one day a week on the lab. Go to lab, do the lab, and go immediately write the lab report. This will allow you to spend much less time slaving over reports 4 days later once you've forgotten about the lab.",
    "It's a good class! Take it if you need it.",
    "The only annoying parts of this lab are the weekly lab reports. The lab reports take a lot of time and can get quite lengthy. When the lab matches up with what you are learning in whatever lecture course you may be taking, it is great for reinforcing knowledge before a test. This course was okay.",
    "I would summarize this course as one that is difficult and challenging but rewarding and well worth the effort. I would recommend it to a fellow student, as along as they are dedicated and willing to put in the workand effort. As long as students can put forth the effort to prepare for the lab and complete the lab reports, they will do fine and this will be a fun, interesting, and challenging course for them.",
    "NAH BRO",
    "It's a cool course if you have to take it.",
    "Much harder than Chem 116 L, the quizzes are a pain and you actually have to study for them. The lab reports are also graded much harsher. The in-lab work is the easiest part.",
    "I would not recommend 117L to someone who didn't need it. If someone did need to take it, they would not require my recommendation.",
    "Take it if you need it as a prereq or requirement, otherwise the work is way more than it should be to only get half of a credit.",
    "If you're thinking about taking it, you probably have to. So go ahead and take it. If you can, try out a few different TAs before totally settling in a section. It makes a big difference.Basically, this is a class that will give you certain skills and understandings. It will be immensely frustrating and a huge time commitment. Enjoy!",
    "A typical introductory level lab course. Lots of tedious work and long reports, but necessary for many science majors\/premed.",
    "The lab reports can be up to 20 pages, and they are tedious and repetitive. Do not take this class if you don't have to.",
    "I would only recommend this if you need to take the lab.",
    "If you're taking Chem 115, then you should definitely take the lab. It's a good amount of work for a half credit, but it helps with understanding the lecture course. In general, chemistry lab skills are a useful asset to have as well.",
    "Chem lab is a necessary evil. General Chemistry labis notoriously the most boring and hardest lab of them all...good luck! Just stay on top of lab reports and write them as soon as possible! I saw many of my friends fail at this and pay dearly for their procrastination!",
    "Chem 117 is more work-intensive than 116 for sure. However, if you take Dr. G's advice and start your lab reports on the same day as you finish the lab, you will be fine. If you don't do that, you'll probably be miserable. Also, learn how to use Excel because you will be using it a lot this semester. Labs are more diverse and interesting this time around and it's possible to finish up before 4 hours are up if you work efficiently. The final is also fair and you have lots of time to do all the tasks.",
    "Chem 117 is very similar to Chem 116. It's taught by Dr. G again, and you do a fairly tedious lab that includes a pre-lab quiz and a post-lab writeup. Studying for the quiz and preparing the lab reports does enhance your understanding of chemistry, though, so they are helpful in the long run even though they can be super annoying. I would recommend it to anyone who is currently taking Chem 115.",
    "This course is more work than Chem 115, and it's only half a credit.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. A lot of work for very little credit.",
    "if you need it for pre-med, it's not so bad",
    "Chem 117 is a lot more work than 116. The quizzes are harder, the lab reports are longer, and I found that I really had to put a lot of time into the work in order to be prepared for lab and to turn in good lab reports. It does not quite feel like a 0.5 credit level of work, but if you're taking it I assume it is because you must, and you could do a lot worse. Dr. G is great and the labs are more interesting than 116, even if they do take a lot more time to execute and write up.",
    "It is a very rigorous lab class. I would recommend it if you have to take a lab class, but not for fun.",
    "The labs in CHEM117 were similar to those of 116, although they were slightly more challengingand fewer titrations were done.I took CHEM115 lecture and CHEM117L was a great complement to that course. The material taught in lecture was nicely reinforced in lab. I would recommend taking this course in conjunction with the lecture course (either 115 or 113). Otherwise, I don't think it would be as impactful.",
    "Only take it if you need it.",
    "Chemistry 177L was lots of fun. The lab reports can be long (lots of graphs) but the actual experiments are fun.",
    "Chem 117 is just like Chem 116 but with much heavier data analysis. Some labs this semester took up to 10 hours to finish! It was really tedious, but it had to be done. If you're considering this class, it's probably for your major.",
    "This is a good chem lab course. Be sure to be thorough in your pre-lab preparation, but the labs are fair and the final is a good representation of what was learned throughout the semester. Be prepared for a few killer labs.",
    "A solid lab class. Dr. G is awesome and he makes the material very interesting. Don't fear taking this class because you have to! Its very manageable if you just keep up with the work.",
    "CHEM 117L was a little more work than CHEM 116L, but otherwise very similar. Dr. G is awesome, so the class was great.",
    "Again, take only if you have to.",
    "Take it, Dr G is great! Be warned though that its more work than 1\/2 a credit ought to be.",
    "A good supplement to the lecture class, fun to but theories learned in lecture into practice.",
    "Very similar to Chem 116L. The course requires more work\/time than its 0.5 credits suggests.",
    "The second semester of Chemistry lab is more challenging but also more interesting than the first.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "This is a fun experience and gives you a way to apply your chemistry knowledge",
    "This lab is a lot of work and requires lots of prelab prep. I'ts a big step up from the previous lab, and won't be as easy.",
    "Yes definitely if you are taking chem 115",
    "It's a chem lab, very straightforward and formulaic. Lab report each week, quiz before lab that's usually pretty simple. Labs maybe get a little more complicated this semester, but there's still a lot of repetition. The worst part is the busywork; copying over verbatim what's in the manual into the lab notebook and lab report is ridiculous. But it's a gen chem lab so it's kind of what you expect. As long as you do the work, it's not too hard at all. It makes it a lot easier to prep before class: go over what will be on the quiz briefly, write everything into your lab notebook leaving space for all the results so that you don't have to waste the time writing paragraphs during lab, etc.",
    "Be prepared to follow all directions and make lab reports as thorough as possible. Always prepare for pre-lab quizzes thoroughly, because they can be very tricky.",
    "A lab where you practice out the things that you learn about in lecture.",
    "Chem lab was very difficult and a lot of work but I needed to take it for premed.",
    "Don't take it if you're not required to",
    "Chemistry 117 is not necessarily fun but it is necessary for pre-med students. The lab writing can sometimes be tedious because of the thoroughness and precision involved, but it is certainly not too difficult.",
    "Only take it if you have to",
    "I would recommend this class to any other student who enjoys lab work.",
    "It's an okay class. There is a lot of busy work and it takes up a lot of time. However, it goes well with Chem115.",
    "If you want a good general chem lab, you're probably going to end up taking this class.",
    "If you don't need to take it I wouldn't recommend just because it's alot of work for only half a credit.",
    "Yes, it was a good learning experience and helps you understand topics in lecture more.",
    "CHEM 117L introduced a lot of new lab techniques and also paired well with what was being taught in CHEM 113. The weekly pre-lab quizzes were kind of tedious, and they didn't seem to add anything to the course. It's honestly a class that you take because you need to for your major or because you're pre-med.",
    "The course is a lot of work, so I wouldn't take it unless its required.",
    "If you are taking this, I am guessing it is because you have to. The only good thing about it is Dr. G's prelab lectures (I found them to be more informative than the CHEM 115 ones). Otherwise, the labs are extremely tedious (much more than first semester chem lab) and not all that meaningful. Don't worry too much, it will be over soon enough.",
    "Chem 117 Lab is definitely harder than 116. That being said, the material corresponds pretty well with what is learned in lecture. If you don't need this class for some sort of requirement I wouldn't recommend it. While it was somewhat enjoyable, it was a lot more work than a half credit class should be.",
    "It's a lab. If you're taking a chem lab, you probably have no other choice. Just pick your TA wisely.",
    "Chem 117 is basically an extension of Chem 116. Many of the same techniques are carried over. I would recommend it to another student!",
    "You are probably taking this course because you are pre-med. Though the lack of a grading curve is harsh the material itself is not difficult.",
    "Only take it if it is required for your major and\/or if you are pre-med, but it is not that bad. Just tedious. Be ready to do a pretty large amount of work for just a half credit, but it is definitely a manageable class.",
    "Chem 117 is a good intro lab course. I recommend taking it if you are taking Chem 115, as it gives you a chance to do experiments relevant to what you're learning. It is however a lot of work.",
    "This is a pretty basic lab course. The labs themselves are nothing special, but it's taught very well and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Only if necessary for your major.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "If you're pre-med or need this lab fora requirement, take it. If not, there's no reason for you to be going through all of the work and preparation for this class.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to, and be prepared for at least 1.5 credits worth of stressful tedious work that will only earn you half of a credit.",
    "Definitely not a fun course, and a lot of work for half a credit. The lab reports can get really long and difficult. Only take it if you have to. If you work hard, though, you can probably do well.",
    "Yes. It is a good lab, just be ready to stand all day.",
    "I would only take it if you have to. It was too time-consuming for the half credit you get from taking it.",
    "Most people take General Chemistry lab to fulfill a requirement. If you are not one of these people, I wouldn't recommend for you to take the course just for the fun of it. That is not to say that the course was not enjoyable, it was sometimes, but it was also exhausting and tedious at times.",
    "Take it if you need it for a requirement for a major or pre-med. Not for a QR. Avoid if at all possible. It's tedious and really tiring. Lab reports are not fun at all.",
    "This course was a good course to take after 116L. It was nice that most labs were completed with a partner, since most labs first semester were done individually. By the time you get to the second semester, you already have some confidence in the lab to do stuff on your own, so it's fun to hone your skills of working with a partner and to get to know others in your course. You do some really cool labs this semester, so try to understand what you're doing! Definitely take the time to prepare for labs. I didn't do this this semester as much as I had last semester, and I would have been much better off for both pre-lab quizzes and during labs if I had prepared better. I can't emphasize this enough - PREPARE, PREPARE, PREPARE! It will make a huge difference in your experience and in your grade. (Of course, since you work with a partner and Dr. G explains everything in the pre-lab lecture it's not the end of the world if you have to show up to lab completely unprepared).A lot of tasks for 117L felt like very menial and pointless time-wasters, such as typing in many, many numbers when a lot of data was collected (for example the acid-base titration lab for which I spent hours just typing numbers into excel from my lab notebook). It would be better if more time for the course was spent learning the chemistry and analyzing the data rather than just mindlessly copying data.Dr. G was great! He was friendly and approachable, but also maintained a well-structured and professional lab atmosphere. Students were free to ask him questions, and he did a great job of explaining each day's lab in the pre-lab lecture.Also don't hesitate to ask your TF questions, they canbe really helpful. I had Gregory Manley, and he was non-intrusive but always interested and helpful.",
    "This course was a good continuation\/overall introduction to general chem lab. It was heavy on titrations in my opinion, but overall a good course. Lab reports take a while but are fine if you start ahead.",
    "An intensive lab course with a lot of work.",
    "I probably would not recommend this class to another student because I don't feel that it was very effective in strengthening my understanding of the concepts studied in the lecture course.",
    "Chem 117L is a pretty standard lab course. It's often dull, but it complements 115 nicely, and I would recommend taking them together because you will get a better overall understanding of the chemistry being taught.",
    "I would recommend only if a student has to take it.",
    "I wouldn't say 'take it' if you don't have to, but if you do,it's not so bad."
