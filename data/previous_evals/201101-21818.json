    "Great introduction to Latin American literature. I think the grade breakdown was too severe, 40% of a final grade for one paper is really extreme. I wish we didn't have to respond every night beforehand to every single story. It becomes exhausting and when it comes to the class no one says anything because they've already said it online. Paulo is an amazing professor and an interesting person but can go on forever, and most of us would have liked to be able to talk more in class. Still worth it! Take it for sure if it's not in the morning next semester.",
    "Read around 40 pages of short stories for each class, write at least two responses in the reading response forum, and 3 papers. Very formulaic. It was a great introduction to the Latin American short story genre and the teacher is great. The only problem was that the class discussion could get really slow, so the teacher had to do most of the talking, perhaps because it was a 9am class. Still worth taking, though.",
    "It was a pretty good class. It's a good overview of the most influential Latin American authors, and the workload was pretty light. Paulo is a very accomodating professor.",
    "I would recommend this as a fun class. You'll read a lot of good short stories, but ultimately what you take away will be the effort you put in to reading and thinking about the text.",
    "introduces u to the literature, make sure you read closely.",
    "If you have ever wanted to read Latin American short fiction I would recommend this class. It is not that much work, and the professor is often flexible and understanding when conflicts arise. The material is interesting and the class is relaxed.",
    "There's a lot of reading in this course, but most of the stories are interesting and fairly short. If you've never taken a class in (or have background knowledge of) Latin American history, culture, or literature, this is a good intro to all those disciplines. If you have, however, this class would most likely be dull, as Professor Moreira tends to talk and explain a lot more than enable discussion. Additionally, if you really want to discuss the literature, this isn't exactly the place. The professor lectures more than anything, which I personally found interesting and informative, even though it's not what I (or most people) expected out of the course.",
    "I truly enjoyed the course and the material, and I feel like I've been given a unique window into the nuances of Latin American Culture. The professor was simply great, and the material intriguing. Also, despite the large body of reading required, the workload was managable. Deffinitely take the course if you're at all interested!My only wish was that more students participated in the discussions in class, but I suppose it only took 4-5 passionate people to make it really interesting."
