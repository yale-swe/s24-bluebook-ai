   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:The book is great and really supplements the course well. The PPT slides are also informative and helpful. Friday sessions are extremely helpful. Very good homework assignments that help firm up key concepts.Weakness:Many of the test questions are written in a confusing way, leading to resentment of the course overall. The additional assigned readings outside of the book(e.g. examples of studies) are not particularly helpful.",
    "The weekly homework assignments and mandatory discussion groups was reminiscent of high school. I found that the home work assignments were unnecessary and distracted me from my other courses and commitments.The lectures were well structured and clear.",
    "The workload is very manageable. Doing the homework isn't too intensive and you get a chance to refine your answers during discussion (that's one of the best things about this class - you don't have to freak out about homework because you can talk about it with the TA!). The short-answers and calculations on the quiz are always pretty straightforward - however, the multiple choice and true-false questions are generally worded strangely, and it's hard to know what Niccolai thinks is the right answer, no matter how much you know the material.",
    "Class size too large, Lots of busy work, Class should be taught more from a practical public health department framework (more applied than theoretical)",
    "I feel that people will be overly critical of Dr. Nicholai. Comments throughout this semester have been harsh, particularly from female students. I'll just comment that Dr. Nicholai is a good lecturer and really spent a lot of time in preparing for this course.She really put together a great class and really explained things quite well.",
    "clear test questions. improved over the 3 quizes.",
    "The course is really well taught and immediately applicable to \"real life\" at YSPH.",
    "The questions on the tests and homework are poorly worded and therefore grades do not reflect the inherent ability of the students.",
    "I love the material. very interesting.",
    "great course.",
    "Very good course- I definitely learned a lot! I think it will be helpful to me in the future. Thanks!",
    "Strengths: The class is well-outlined. The textbook is good. The weekly homeworks provided good practice for the skills learned. There was ample accessibility to TAs and the professor. The lectures got better after midterm. There was less reading of the slides and more examples.Weaknesses: The TA sessions often felt like a waste of time. I did not like to spend class time going over homework or quizzes, unless there were questions.Many of the homework and quiz problems seemed to deal with the exceptions to the rules and that's fine if those more atypical situations are in addition to the typical, not the only problem on that topic. We didn't get enough practice with situations that are supposed to be more common. For example, one of the first quantitative homework problems we had dealt with an exposure that had a protective effect. It was confusing to be doing this type of problem for the first time and have to interpret the results backwards. I like the challenge, but it would be good to have that thrown in after we had some practice with the way it was taught in class. I wouldn't mention this except it seemed to happen a lot, like being tricked was more important than the learning on homeworks and quizzes.The guest lecturer did not add much to the course.",
    "I think a lot of the material can be confusing, and the exam questions were not clear in some regards. Since this is my first epi course, I am not sure if it is the material, the instructor or just me! but a lot of us were confused most of the time. something that might be helpful is to not use examples from the text in lecture; I find the more examples I have, the better I understand things so if there is less overlap from the readings and the lecture, it might help understanding.",
    "Decent overview to epidemiology, something I had no idea about prior to school. Nothing too mind blowing. I found it frustrating at times but I think that was more due to the subject matter than the course itself.",
    "Strengths: good introductory courseWeaknesses: sometimes I felt that the quizzes tested our test-taking ability more than our knowledge, but overall they were fair. It would be helpful to have true false and multiple choice on our homework for practice.",
    "This course is ok. I think it covers a lot of material in a short time. However, I wish that this course was a bit more interactive in lecture - such as problems on the board etc. I believe that for quantitative courses powerpoint is one of the worst teaching tools as you gloss through topics too quickly and don't explain the process well.The main overall weakness in this course is the length of the quizzes. They are too long and assess students knowledge of the \"tricks\" in the material vs their knowledge of the material itself. Multiple choice questions should never be used at the Masters level as they test on the person's ability to take a test rather than their knowledge of the information. Tests should be 3-4 multi-part questions that evaluate a student's ability to understand the information and do calculations and analyses on their own. That's what we need to know for the long-run anyways.",
    "Dr. Niccolai can be confusing and unclear in what she asks on HWs and tests. She may say one thing in lecture, but then it be contradicted on the test. But i learned alot for sure!",
    "The course was OK. A lot of material was covered but in the same sense, every class felt rushed.",
    "The course did what it professed to - it teaches the basic concepts of epidemiology and public health. Not too much else to say - it's fine as is.",
    "Having read the EPI text before, and observed Harvard EPI coursework, i felt well-prepared for this course. Instead, I found myself in the bottom 1\/3rd of the class with more confusion. The material was presented in lecture was generalized, the main points rushed, and examples were never used in tests. If quizzes, homework and tests are mainly epi word-problems, i suggest that one lecture be dedicated just to problem solving.",
    "Great and interesting class!",
    "I thought it was a very thorough introduction; however, students would have benefitted if the teacher had chosen to discuss more topics not already covered in the textbook.",
    "Hey YSPH powers that be, wake up!You need to consider the Boston Univ model and break up intro to Epi by MPH track -- so that you don't end up with this Epi in a Box course for the masses taught by someone who in all honesty would do best as a guest lecturer on chlamydia, STDs, and public health surveillance (her clear passions) but is not a compelling, Yale-quality guide to introductory epidemiology.As it now is, this course could be covered in a correspondence summer course, with TAs on call to e-mail with.",
    "The course provides a basic, straightforward information on epidemiology and public health. The major strength of the course were the clear, coherent lectures - a product of the primary instructor and her slides. The one weakness was the guest lecturer for surveillance (although, it really highlighted the skill of the primary instructor at bringing to life the material and making the class exciting).",
    "It was obviously essential, and have no problem with it.",
    "I learned more in this course than in all my other courses combined.Strengths: Niccolai is a great professor, slides are always clear and do a strong job of transferring and portraying ideas and concepts. Really appreciated the in class problem working. The homework guides you through the concepts and the quizes and test were mostly fair.Weaknesses: On occasion, awkward wording of a problem on a test or quiz would prohibit a correct answer.",
    "The course is very well organized and fair. There were some issues with unclear wording of questions on problem sets, but that did not carry through to the exams, and it sounded like overall the course was tremendously improved over last year. The best part about the course was when we were studying for the final and realized that, unlike a lot of classes, we did not have to go back and memorize a lot of facts and equations, because we had actually learned the material and incorporated it into our knowledge base.",
    "The tests need to be worded more clearly, especially the first two. There are lots of concepts that are not articulated clearly in lecture (and certainly not clarified well by the TAs), which are problematic on exams. Professor Niccolai is very resistant to giving credit for concepts that were ambiguously worded, which feels unfair. There is a big mismatch between our understanding of the material and our test scores.",
    "I found the quiz and homework questions confusing at first. If the course is all about testing epi concepts, then it's best if the questions could be framed unambiguously to test your knowledge and grasp of concepts instead of it being a test of english grammar and sentence syntax.",
    "Good course. A lot of material to go through- but the format (with quizes and homeworks thorughout) ensured that I keep up.",
    "Strength: The course provides basic overview of the field and equips the students with key vocabularies needed to operate in the field.",
    "It was a very interesting course. I felt like it was a very comprehensive introduction to Epidemiology - something that we all need as public health professionals.",
    "Important introduction of epi",
    "I did not like the course set up. i wish there was more hands on learning.",
    "I thought the course was a good introduction to the topics of epidemiology. I think that advanced pursuit of many topics was prevented frankly by the students of the class who had a penchant for whining and asking stupid questions (in this case, there is a such a stupid question, bc many were answered in the assigned reading) I think it would be better improved by making the tests much harder and more quantitative. It would force people to better learn the material.",
    "I loved this class. I am a phD student that didn't have time in my schedule last year for this course...I LOVED IT! I wish I had had time last year because it would have made the progession of my courses much more natural! This course was fantastic. I loved it. I attended every day (except for when I was sick with the flu), sat in the front, and got so much out of it. I think the text was great, the teacher was great, my TA (Rashele) was great...even the homeworks were helpful.",
    "Strengths:1.) We knew what was expected of us from the beginning.2.) There was a lot of work, but it only enhances our knowledge.3.) The professor is open to questions and a very-skilled epidemiologist.4.) The quizzes and exam were all fair.5.) The course and v2 were very well-organized.Weaknesses:1.) We were given a practice quiz to get a feel for the first quiz... the real one turned out to be much longer and tougher than the practice quiz.",
    "Having never taken an epi class before, I can honestly say that this class helped me to start thinking of disease in a new way.",
    "This was an excellent preparatory course for future classes and general work in public health. The content of the course is foundational for any field in public health, and the course provides students with the skills to design future research and critically assess epidemiological studies.",
    "This was a very helpful class. I feel like I have a decent grasp of epidemiological concepts. Unfortunately, I do not enjoy powerpoint presentations, and so I find it hard to follow lectures in this format. This class relied heavily on powerpoint with the instructor adding very little detail to what the slide said, which did not make for a very engaging situation.",
    "I enjoyed this course. It started out being very difficult (and felt like learning a new language) but by the end of the semester I felt like I was starting to think like an epidemiologist.",
    "For an introductory course in Epidemiology, one would think that basic concepts should be taught and mastered by students first, before issues that are still debated in this field are examined. This was a very difficult course, not because of the material, but due to the constant need for students to double think what the professor would accept as a legitimate response to her examination questions. The time wasted in this pursuit was excessive to say the least. For such a critical course to the study of Public Health,one would have thought that a more qualified professor would be utilized.",
    "The class overall is very good, there was more readings than I was able to do. The textbook was really great.",
    "I enjoyed the course and, though the professor could use more practice, I think that she was very good overall.",
    "The course would be improved if it was taught by multiple professors. Also a good opportunity to get to know some of the faculty in EPH.The homework assignments were really long every week",
    "Only class I felt like I actually learned something in all semester",
    "I find it hilarious that there is no \"average\" rating in the MC questions above, because I feel no word in the English, or any other language describes this course better. I feel the main strength of the course is the readability and understandability of the PowerPoint presentations. The professor was also fairly responsible in answering students' questions. However, I want to know why that this and most other courses test us on knowledge that we will never, ever use outside the classroom? I believe the best \"trained\" workers in any profession are self-taught. Why make students spend time memorizing useless details when their time could be better spent on more fulfilling activities (which includes time spent doing absolute nothing)?",
    "Strengths: weekly homeworks and quizzes were great tools for learning the material (much better than having two large exams). Discussion sections were well-run.Weaknesses: wording of quizzes was often confusing. For instance, on the first 2 quizzes, I felt very confident in the material and concepts, yet my score did not reflect this. However, the 3rd quiz and final were more straightforward.",
    "The course slides are clear and straight-forward. It was easy to study from the course slides and use them to prepare for exams. They were really helpful as references. I thought in general that the course was helpful and that I learned a great deal.",
    "I thought the course was organized very well. I didn't feel like the readings we were assigned were extremely important to the course or that the textbook was really helpful. Lots of examples were used to explain the epidemiology principles, which helped clarify concepts. Some of the questions on the exam seemed to be intentionally tricky, but overall, I felt the assesments were pretty fair.",
    "Strengths: The way Dr. Niccolai organized the course is a major strength - it's very logical and flows well. Dr. Niccolai is also great about using examples in the powerpoints which are really helpful. Great to have the powerpoints posted online. Dr. Niccolai is also a good lecturer and she's clear about what's important in epidemiology and what isn't as important, particularly for her class. Regular homeworks are fair and helpful. Great to have an opportunity to correct them because you can learn from your mistakes!Weaknesses: Occasionally had too many readings assigned to get the same basic points across in a single week. Sometimes homework and test questions can be worded awkwardly which leads you to the wrong answer.",
    "The professor's exams often did not reflect the course lectures or book reading. Also, Prof. Niccolai's unique problem-solving logic did not help students understand the practical basis for the course material. The TA's were the saving grace of the course.",
    "Epi was rough. I felt that the course was not really what it should be. I was frustrated by how poorly I did on all the quizzes despite regular attendance, homework, study, preparation, etc. I always went in thinking I REALLY knew stuff, and then did horribly on quizzes which were poorly worded, confusing, too long for the allotted time (really just the first one, but still!), and showed me how much I really DIDN'T know. I feel like I should take this whole class over again from a different professor.Also, I didn't like the choice of textbook. It has many typos and errors.",
    "The course is good overall review of epidemiology. The course was designed so the material really built on to everything that came before it. It was nice to be able to fit lectures into the big picture. The weekly homeworks were helpful in understanding the material but were redundant. This meant less time could be devoted to general review during discussion sections with the TAs - we were often rushed. I think these assignments could be shorter while still getting the point across.",
    "I found the class powerpoint slides to be very helpful as a resource for studying the class text was not as useful at times. The homework assignments were very comprehensive in nature and great study guides for quizzes and exams.",
    "The material was boring, convoluted, and repetitive (same material discussed in slightly different ways in a number of lectures). However, since this is an introductory survey course, some of these problems are inevitable.",
    "homeworks were good practice, but the exams were a bit more difficult t prepare and study for since they were not as straight forward as the homeworks",
    "One of the strengths was having an assignment every week--it was very hard to get behind. One of the weaknesses perhaps was that I wished we had spaced out certain lectures (confounding, effect modification) over the two week span rather than have lectures one week and review session the next.",
    "fair exams.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "Strengths- I had a great TA, the weekly homework provided constant feedback, lecture slides available on the internetWeaknesses- the professor, poorly written\/worded examination questions",
    "It's a great course, very useful for public health students.",
    "Good overall, format was fine.",
    "The professor is impatient, irritable, has a poor understanding of not only how to communicate the information to the students and their level of understanding, but also what is imperative information that we can use in the future. The course has very little content that is spread over a very long time period.",
    "The information in this course was pretty simple, however, the way in which it was taught made it much more complicated than it needed to be. One strength of this course is that it was very helpful in reading research papers from other courses. A weakness of this course were the weekly homework problems. The homework problems were not really tested on the quizzes, making it very frustrating to do the homework each week.",
    "Worst course I've ever had."

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Her lecture notes are very helpful in understanding the book, and the examples and interpretations she puts in the notes are always the ones I understand the best.The biggest weakness of Dr. Niccolai is when students ask questions in class. I think sometimes she doesn't understand entirely what the student is asking, so her answers to their questions don't actually address what's being asked.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Ok - don't really agree with teaching style",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Weaknesses1. Linda explains things well, but then overexplains, and overexplains, and overexplains. She loses a lot of people in the process.2. Linda has a sassy way of talking down to people. Asking a question can sometimes merit some condescending comment like \"ohh it's you asking again\"Strengths1. Linda is really well aware of the class material. She knows her stuff really well.2. Linda is also a really sincere person. She has a heart for students and it shows more outside of class.3. Linda is really resilient in dealing with harsh comments\/challenges made from students, usually males, in the class that are overly critical of a smart, relatively young woman being an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0very accessible and personable. made the course fun.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Niccolai explains things really well and is very available for feedback and extra help outside of class. She is a very good instructor and uses student feedback to shape the class. Sometimes her attention to detail in writing HW and quiz problems isn't perfect, and the quizzes are hard, but everything is very fair and the class is really good.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very good one-on-one outside of class; not as effective in the lecture hall.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I dont understand what she's saying in class. She needs to break things down alittle more.",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She did an excellent job presenting the material, and I really appreciated all of the extra review sessions she held. Very helpful!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was excellent. Her lectures were very clear and well-composed. The weekly assignments corresponded to lecture which made the topics easier to understand.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was well-prepared for class, accessible, and enthusiastic. I wish she would have managed the class better when students went off on tangents. The class often went over the time limit and the material could have been covered in the following class instead of keeping us late.Overall, I liked the teaching style, especially in the second half of the course when there was less reading of slides and more examples.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Sometimes issues with ambiguity and wording of questions; often felt that the multiple choice questions on tests were \"trick\" questions and do not appreciate this. However, overall I think this is probably a hard course to teach and I think the instructor did a good job.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0It's very obvious that Dr. Niccolai is smart and knowledgeable, but I think that there are some aspects of teaching the course that will improve with time (I think this is her second year teaching?) The format\/structure\/content of the homework and exam questions felt very different, and it would be helpful if they were more similar. Some of the questions also contained maybe unnecessary information that led to confusion, so maybe having less elaboration would be better. There were also some things that might be a matter of personal preference (eg having a protective exposure classified as \"not exposed\") that also led to confusion- I think that consistency is something that should be taken into account. I do feel like I learned a lot, and understand the basic concepts of epidemiology but I think that more actual examples from the literature might be helpful rather than using abstract examples or imaginary studies.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Niccolai was so-so as a survey course instructor. She obviously has knowledge of the subject matter but I feel like she hadn't reviewed intro epi in a while and was just kind of going off the top of her head. She got mixed up a few times and I had a lot of questions but couldn't really ask them in the large lecture class setting.",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a new instructor who tries very hard. She puts a lot of time into the class and into the teaching the material. She is very available for students during scheduled and unscheduled office hours and is will to work through even the most minute of questions.However, her \"newness\" shows in the usually over-zealous length of the powerpoints and the quizzes. There is no need to cram so much onto tests in such a short period of time. The material builds on itself - if you can't do the calculations from the beginning of the course - you're not going to be able to answer the questions from the end of the course eiter. Also, Dr. Niccolai can be a bit \"snippy\" in some of her comments both in class and in office hours. Personally, I find this entertaining and am not the least bit offended because I enjoy when people call it like it is but I have heard some students whining that she is unkind or \"talks down to them.\" I think it may just be the result of cultural differences.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very interesting lectures, great sense of humor, receptive to feedback.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very effective in identifying important concepts. Also was very receptive to concerns or problems. Sometimes the test questions seemed unnecessarily tricky. I really liked how the course information built on itself throughout the semester.",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think her tests were way too hard and did not reflect the way she taught the course or the practice problems. At times she was not sensitive to students questions and the way she responded to the seemed rude.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was a decent lecturer and covered the material thoroughly - some issues with answering questions on the spot during lecture, but overall good lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0visibly anxious, easily flustered by questions and seemed to have difficulty answering questions on her feet.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The only weakness is that the instructor seemed, at times, reluctant to accept answers from students (especially on tests), even though they correctly answered the question she was asking.Everything else was great!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was quite charming and illustrative.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I understand that Dr Niccolai is an operational wiz with the TAs and all (even checking her answer key when you go to her office to ask her about a quiz answer having 1 or 2 points taken off), but the person who stands up and teaches first-year, first-semester Epi I needs to be someone who's not just covering the operational bases and distributing the grades around a mean of 85.0, but someone who by example embodies the compelling inside and outside of epi, including clinical science, in theory andin practice.Regrettably, Dr Niccolai is not this person.Most of the class time is spent having slides read to you.A few brief points that Dr N made this semester during lecture that she might reconsider:1. She said of the Women\u0092s Health Study \u0085 \"nothing wrong with design.\"Question: How about the RCT that disproved its conclusions \u0096 as Dr Bracken teaches in Evidence-Based Medicine course? Isn't that epidemiology?2. Also, she said, \"When the endpoint is death, you don\u0092t need to blind.\" Many published studies disprove this.3. Also, she said, \"These days, investigators don\u0092t use anything but pills for placebo \u0085 because of potential harm.\"Many published studies disprove this.4. Also, she said that you could randomize cancer patients to chemotherapy or saline solution -- yes in the 21st century. And even when a student pointed out that this wouldn't be permitted today unless it were an adjuvant therapy, she replied, \"You could.\"5. It is not that there are alternatives to the simple formula in the textbook on page 291, \u0093Magnitude of confounding = (RR crude \u0096 RR adjusted)\/RR adjusted\u0094 \u0096 it is that Dr Niccolai wrote it incorrectly in her lecture slides and then on the board in the practice-review session in the first week of November.6. She would not accept as an answer as an answer to Quiz 2 question \"Could non-compliance have occurred in this study?\" that \"yes\" non-compliance from follow-up visits not being met by study participant. Why? Because, she said, that's not how she taught it.Honestly, I wouldn\u0092t care about this sort of thing if I weren\u0092t spending so much time and effort on my other 4 classes and then on top of it had to have the added obstacle course of Epi I.I hope next year's Epi I won't be a \u0093slide\u0094 dog-and-pony class where the professor\u0092s goal seems to be to breeze through her slide deck and then play \u0093stump the chump\u0094 on the quizzes. At times, this can be distressing to students.And one pet peeve, the professor says \u0093cry-tear-ee ON\" for the word 'criterion.' Singular yes, but it's not pronounced that way in any dictionary.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0See above. Moreover, Dr. Niccolai is incredibly affable and helpful outside of the classroom; she was more than willing to accomodate me and other students during her office hours and beyond to address epidemiological questions as well as general life-related concerns.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is very intelligent and understanding. She cares about making sure she explains everything to the point where the only problem is sometimes she spends too much time on a pedantic nuance for a small group of individuals and class time suffers. But again, that is only because she want to make sure we completely understand it.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is excellent. Smart, approachable, invested in her students and willing to work with people to help them understand. Overall, an excellent professor and a joy to be in a class with. She also has a clear handle on how to teach a new subject like epi to adults who have no experience with the material.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai did a great job with a huge lecture class. She was effective and organized for the most part, but did not have a problem interrupting herself to answer questions. As this was only her 2nd year teaching the class, I imagine it will only improve from here.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Her slides are fantastic - very clear, explanatory, with lots of examples. Her lecturing style is spare but informative. I wish she were more willing to see this course from our eyes--how we struggle to get adequate feedback, how we might (mis)interpret test questions, what we need from the TAs, etc.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths:She's good at taking feedback from students, and I can see that she tried very hard to get all of us to understand the lecture points.Weaknesses:The textbook was not very helpful. At times, it was skimpy on certain parts and seemed to contradict with what was taught in lectures. I found that I was referring to internet resources more as the semester progressed instead of my textbook or the lecture notes.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is very nice",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great teacher presented the material in an understanding way.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I like how she provides us with examples for each topic we're studying and I think she's a good lecturer, but the questions she wrote in her tests \/ quizes and homeworks are confusing. Often times, the questions do not test how well we understand the concept but how well we can interpret her questions \/ avoid her tricks.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was an excellent professor. She was very helpful and approachable. Her slides were very helpful and addressed all of the material that was necessary for quizzes and for the final exam.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0passionate",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think she is still a new professor and is still learning. I felt she did not explain things well.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0There were several instances, including a review session right before a quiz, that Professor Niccolai presented incorrect formulas and calculations in her slides. This was incredibly frustrating as I had to spend extra time trying to figure out the correct way to set up the formulas.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0strengths: good use of powerpoint (and didnt over rely on it)genuinely cares about teachingcovered all major intro topicsweaknesses: disproportionate testing of PH surveillance on final given that it was one lecturelectures about confounding and effect modification were very confusing and it took the TAs a lot of time to explain in sectionpoor choice of textbook",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think that Prof Niccolai did a pretty good job, given that it was a big lecture class filled with whiny immature students. I know that some of them may complained, but they were usually the ones who didn't do the work until the night before the test. I would have liked to cover some more advanced and nuanced topics. I think that the tests became increasingly easier during the year, probably placating the average student.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Niccolai is a super model dressed in epidemiologist's clothing! She is great. I really liked interacting with her. She was really accomodating and helpful when I came back from being sick. Also, she seemed to be really excited about epi -- which made it fun. WONDERFUL! I am sad I won't ever work with her again (I am biostat)...!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda is a lively instructor, making lecture more interesting. She told us what was expected of us in the beginning and made herself available both during class and during office hours for questions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was amazing in every thing. She was good at lecture and she cleared every point that we found difficult. Even though we all complain about the assignments but it was so helpful practice for the quizez. I liked her way of teaching. She was so accessable and she made herself available to all students. She was excellent",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Kind, helpful, and dedicated.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The instructor's lectures were clear and well-organized. In-class examples were helpful in better understanding the material. The instructor was very approachable outside of class and was always willing to answer questions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The instructor was good. I think she should have tried to add more to her presentations and rely less on the powerpoints.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was great. I think sometimes she didn't pose questions in the best way, but she was always very quick to clarify something if there was a problem.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0It should be noted that Professor Niccolai was very helpful during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was pretty good but seemed to get a little flustered when asked a question that she was unable to answer. She could probably also work on making her homework and test questions clearer.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think that she obviously did a lot and spent a lot of time to make the material as clear as possible and worked very hard to provide feedback, respond to questions, etc... I liked her very much.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0While she is very knowledgeable, Professor Niccolai is not a very good teacher. She doesn't articulate herself well in lecture, and she gets frustrated with students when they ask too many questions or don't understand the way she is explaining something. Her exams are challenging and require that you know understand the underlying concepts, however, the way she words her multiple choice questions is confusing because again, she doesn't articulate herself well. Consistently there were issues with test questions that were thrown out because they didn't make sense and were misinterpreted by a large majority of students. Furthermore, there were a few occasions where the TA also had trouble figuring out what she was asking.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Niccolai was a good instructor. Sometimes her quiz questions were a little tricky, but she got better as the semester progressed. I liked her teaching style and actually felt like the class was reflective of what one might expect of a graduate level course- not the same for all other classes I took this semester.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai does a reasonably good job presenting the material in a manner that (at least for me) could be easily digested. I'm told that she is also fairly responsive to students' questions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The instructor is very personable and takes a great interest in students' learning. She made herself available to her students and seemed to have great rapport in class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai did a good job teaching the class and responding to questions. She pulled a lot of examples from her own work which showed her passion for the field of epidemiology and gave real-world examples. I have already taken an undergraduate epidemiology course, so I had the basics, but I could tell that during some of the classes, those without that background were a bit confused.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0It would be more helpful to go through more examples instead of just reading off the powerpoint slides.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a good lecturer. She's usually very clear about her expectations, what's important to know for the class and for epidemiology in general, etc. Her powerpoints are very clear and easy to understand even if you miss a class. She is also pretty approachable and seemsfun\/nice.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I found that to get through her exams, I had to think like Prof. N (which is unique to the textbook and other epi books) and overcome her grammar errors. The one improvement she made during the course of the semester was to begin doing problems on the board, which helped students get an understanding of how she thought through problems. Hopefully, this is something she will continue to do if she teaches this class again.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Yikes. This class was rough. It pains me to have to say it, but the quality of the lectures really made me say to myself, \"really? Yale? Thirty grand a year and THIS is the quality of the teaching?\" Overall, pretty disappointing. I didn't have a lot of faith in her knowledge of the subject matter because of the manner in which she lectured. The problem with that is when things are confusing, it's hard to know whether that is due to thefact that they are being taught wrong or just in a confusing way.As with comments above, the testing was always a problem. The disconnect between thinking I know it and performing badly on a quiz was a constant problem in this class, and not one I'm used to.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I thought Dr. Niccolai was a good lecturer but she really excels at teaching in smaller settings. If you don't understand the material, go to office hours! And although she can be a harsh grader, I felt like she really cared about her students - she was very approachable!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was good at presenting the basic terminology and working historical examples of study designs and outcomes into the class lectures. Some times quiz and exam questions could be clearer and even more concise.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths+Sense of humor in lecture+Cares about students+Uses articles to illustrate the real life purpose of CDE+Used a PowerPoint slide that tied in many of the key concepts overand over so we could see how it all fits togetherWeaknesses-Openness to other methods of solving the problem.There are 110+ student in the auditorium. Only 35 are going to be epidemiologists when they grow up. If people ask \"Couldn't we also try to solve it with...\" the answer should be \"Ding dong, you are wrong.\" This is a standardized class that everyone has to take, and we should stick to learning ONE method for direct adjustment, CIP, CMH, etc.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She did a fair job of presenting the material in the second half of the course (the qualitative material), and did a poorer job as a lecturer during the first half of the course (the quantitative material). I am not sure if she was uncomfortable explaining the quantitative material or if it is just difficult to explain it to introductory students. She seemed nervous and defensive at times, especially during the first part of the course, but both of these behaviors diminished during the second part of the course. I think she tried really hard and wanted to do a good job, and I give her credit for that.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is encouraging and great to speak and work with one-on-one.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Niccolai was nice, though it might have been nice if her office hours would have been at a better time?",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was great. She was articulate and presented the material well.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Sometimes seemed like she didn't know exactly what she was talking about, wasn't extremely helpful when a question was asked (then again, I never went to office hours), appeared somewhat condescending at times",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0very nice and clear instructed.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very good",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0a great instructor and she always made herself available for further assistance.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I have only interacted with her a few times and she is not understanding of students and their situation or their level of comprehension. I am surprised that Yale would actually hire a woman liker her to teach and represent Yale faculty. She is very short tempered and makes the information much harder to understand than it has to be, She directly insulted a student in front of the entire class and she acts unapproachable. Possible the worst teacher I have ever had. I even went in to talk to Dr. Niccolai about my ta and she told me that the ta mist be a level above me if I dont understand, Well, that is great except this is an intro to epi class and I am paying a lot and therefore she should challenge me and teach me, not ridicule and belittle.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I would say a real weakness of the instructor is student\/teacher interactions. In class when a student would ask a question, she would often respond in an abrupt, condescending manner in front of the whole class. However, one-on-one Dr. Niccolai paints a different picture. I don't know if she is nervous in front of the whole class or something else causes here mannerisms to change, but for me, it was a noticeable change. A strength of Dr. Niccolai is that she is truly very knowledgeable about the subject. However, most beginner students do not have the knowledge base that sheexpects students to have, especially when we are only in our first semester.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Instructor is very sweet but is not a good lecturer."

    "Anita SungIf the sessions were less dependent on the homework and covered more concepts in depth with more prepared examples, it would have been better.",
    "Rashele Cross was my TA. She is an EXCELLENT TA. I am so happy I was assigned to her section; there was one occasion that I had to attend another TA's section and I was appalled at the TA's teaching style, presentation, and ability to confuse the issues; this helped me appreciate what a terrific job Rashele does. Responsive to questions over email, willing to admit she's not sure and will get back to us (she always does), and good, positive energy are among her strengths.",
    "Alison Laufer- Good TA, she was enthuiastic and made discussion fun.",
    "TA's were the best part of the course. The smaller sections made discussion actually possible and cleared up a lot of the weird things we got in lecture.",
    "Corey was a great TA. I found that she was very good at explaining things clearly if there was a concept from lecture that we were unsure about.",
    "My experience with the TAs was varied and a bit disjointed. I started in Kyle's section, then he ran into some personal difficulties, and we were all reassigned. After that point, I worked with a few of the other TAs so I'll evaluate each below.Kyle:Kyle was a good TA and was always prepared for section. He knew the material well. My only criticism is that because he knew the material so well, he had trouble breaking it down and explaining it at what I call a \"simple human\" level.Corey:Corey was in my opinion the best TA in the course. She could have been teaching kindergarten through PhD level students and she would have held the classes attention, increased participation, and explained the topics well. She is able to break down the information in multiple ways. If you did not understand it with one explaination, don't worry Corey usually has at least 4-5 other ways to explain it until you understood.Anita:Anita has the potential to be a great instructor. She is kind and genuinely cares about her class. My one critique is that she seems to doubt herself and her knowledge and is therefore not as forward as she could be with corrections and debates.",

    "Corey Pilver did a decent job as a TA - she went over the problem sets thoroughly (perhaps even too thoroughly at times such that it felt like it was dragging on forever, although that may have been due to other members of the section having trouble with the material), and did a decent job fielding questions.",
    "I often used other TA's powerpoints to study and correct my homework. Other TA groups recieved equation cheat sheets and final exam practice problems, and homework answers written in complete sentences - we did not. The TA sessions could be improved if correct answers are presented by the TA (not students) and the students can ask questions where more explanation is needed.",
    "Corey was always very helpful and straightforward!",
    "Rashele was an excellent, professional, and knowledgable TA.",
    "Sessions very helpful.",
    "The TAs were excellent, but a bit robotic-ized in their Friday furry correcting of the quizzes.But then if you went to ask Dr Niccolai about points taken off, it was pretty obnoxious stonewalling, all in the name of \"fairness.\"But then why did she need to refer to the \"answer key\" when deciding if she'd give you 2 points back?No other teacher I've had would need to check the answer key of a test they administered to me to know whether an answer was right or wrong.",
    "Kyle Walsh is a great TA. Her was incredibly effective at clarifying any confusion that may have arisen from lecture. In addition to his obvious command of the material, he counteredsometimes stressful sections with patience and humor.",
    "She was rude and made me not want to ask questions for fear of being chastised.",
    "Rashele Yarbourgh:Excellent. Very kindand willing to help our session through whatever problems we had with the homework. She was enthusiastic and encouraging and a great help to my overall understanding of the subject.",
    "My TA was Alison Laufer. I thought she did a great job explaining the homework problems and was very nice, and very positive, on top of that.",
    "My TA was Anita Sung. She was extremely difficult to work with. She's sweet, kind, and has great intentions, but is utterly incapableof giving us an adequate explanation for any concept. When one of us gives an incorrect answer, she says, \"Well... um... that's not what... is on the answer key.\" Instead, what we need is \"I see where you're coming from, but this why that answer is not what we're looking for. Here's what you should have done.\" No. Anita absolutely cannot do this. It makes section frustrating, fruitless, and is more confusing that not coming to section at all.",

    "My TA ,Anita Sung, was not the best. She did not have a command on the material. I asked her some questions and she used to refer me to other TAs to get the answers.

    "Corey was a pretty good TA. At times she was confused, and confused us, but she was well-intentioned, patient, and fair.",
    "Corey does a great job explaining the material and answering questions. Even though I have never emailed her, I'm sure she is quite responsive in that regard as well. However, I really do believe one and a half hours is too long just to go over HW, especially since all the answers are well-explained on the web.",
    "My TA was wonderful. She was very enthusiatic about the material and was effective in engaging students. She explained material clearly and always cleared up points of confusion. She also made herself readily available outside of class and went the extra distance to help us learn (i.e. she would make up additional practice quizzes and formula summary sheets).",
    "My TA, Allison, was great. She was very helpful cheerful in class. She was always well-prepared and made a great effort to get all our questions answered and help us succeed in class.",
    "Alison Laufer was really great. Very friendly and easy to work with. She was very helpful and explained things very well.",
    "Corey Pilver was a good TA. I felt like she didn't always respond directly to questions and tried to show more of her expertise in epidemiology by giving a complicated answer. I think she could have explained the concepts better, especially since some people in my section didn't seem to understand them when we reviewed the homeworks.",
    "Anita:She was a really good TA, responsive to answers and concerns and provided really good explanations in class. Often managed to clarify issues that were not presented well in class. Good job!",
    "Molly was an awesome TA! She made great efforts to get us to understand difficult material. She always had good examples for us and when Dr. Niccolai wasn't 100% clear about something in class or on the homework or about the test Molly could clear it up.",
    "My TA was Rashele, but I also received help from Allison and Corey. All of the TAs were extremely helpful.",
    "CoreyWas on the whole decent; I felt she really knew what she was talking about, and that makes a difference. She was able to explain things effectively.However, I did have one conversation with the TA that upset me. I was expressing some frustration with my poor performance on a quiz, and trying to explain the disconnect I felt between learning the material and doing well on the quiz. Her response to me was that, as someone in the policy track, I was \"never going to need to use this stuff anyway\" and that I shouldn't worry about it. I realize that she was probably trying to encourage me (I had had some tears that day), but instead I was more upset that this was the kind of attitude being presented: don't worry, grades don't matter, you don't need to know this stuff. I REALLY disagree. I am here BECAUSE I want to know this stuff. To me this just felt really low quality.",
    "Corey Pilver was very helpful in discussion sections. She consistently found new creative ways of explaining the material - I understood the course material significantly better after her reviews.",

    "This class is required, so I would recommend taking it in order to graduate from the program...The concepts learned in epi are paramount to our graduate training, and Niccolai does a good job showing us which are important to know and gives us ample opportunity to practice. While the class can be frustrating, all in all I actually learned quite a bit.",
    "Core course - study hard and a lot of work",
    "Definately recommed the class. The material is so relevant to all other classes and it somehow permeates one's conversation on anything regarding public health. for some strange reason, you start citing things like prevalence, incidence, bias, error, and types of studies when you talk about anything.",
    "You will work hard, but it immediately plays off in the ways you understand your readings for other courses better.",
    "A good introduction to an essential public health course.",
    "You have to do it. Period!",
    "I would recommend this class because it gives you the overall explanation for public health research.",
    "I would recommend this course- great job!",
    "Yes. It's a lot of work, but you will learn a solid understanding of the basic concepts of epi.",
    "Fair amount of work, but work is helpful to understand the topics. Not a particularly fun course to take, and significant memorization involved, but imperative for reading public health studies and understanding and interpreting them. Overall content of course is valuable.",
    "Though the topic matter was interesting, I really didn't enjoy the class as much as I thought I would. I think part of it might be the structure, but once we moved past study design into bias, confounding, validity etc I really had trouble focusing. Between homeworks and \"quizzes\" there is a lot of work, but I would recommend since I feel like I have a good foundation of the concepts.",
    "Decent course, nothing amazing.",
    "A requirement",
    "This course is required and is of fundamental importance to public health research.",
    "This is a good course but you may often feel overwhelmed with the amount of graded work. It's run a bit more like a highschool course with continuous assessments than a Masters level course that assumes you will learn the material without assigning busy work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course simply because it is interesting subject matter.",
    "Required course with a lot of material. Make sure to get the basics down and really do all the work possible.I would recommend this course but only in the sense that it is hard and frustrating and a rude awakening, especially if you aren't coming straight out of college.",
    "Required class - it's a decent course, so be happy",
    "buy an epi \"practice\" workbook, all of the exams\/quizzes depend on applied knowledge which you will have a hard time doing based on Niccolai lectures. the textbook chapter questions are sometimes helpful in applying concepts.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to a fellow student. It gives you the basic information you need to understand basic elements.",
    "Well, it is mandatory, but worthwhile nonetheless.",
    "Unfortunately, a work in progress that the school requires you to take while they hope for the best.",
    "The course provides a great informational foundation on which other courses build. Epidemiology spans all courses, so this was particularly helpful in elucidating many concepts in other courses. The course was also particularly helpful for formulating a research project for the summer internship.",
    "One of the fundamental classes you need to take.",
    "Excellent! Take it...even if you have epi experience this is a necessary summary course of concepts you will use through out your career. It's a hard course for sure, but one that can certainly be mastered with a little bit of work.",
    "If you are an MPH student, you will have to take this course, but don't worry, it's not bad at all. Dr. Niccolai is great and so are most of the TAs. There are weekly problems sets and 3 quizzes (a misnomer, really they are tests) in addition to the final.",
    "You have to take this course",
    "Good class. Pretty heavy with material.",
    "It's a core course -- this question is irrelevant.",
    "A comprehensive introduction to Epidemiology. I would definitely recommend this course, taught by Dr. Niccolai, to any other students.",
    "I think you need to invest a lot of time outside of class to learn the material. lecture is confusing.",
    "Yes, it was a good overview of epidemiology in a fair amount of depth. It was overall well taught and I feel I learned all of the basic concepts well.",
    "Introduction to the basics of epidemiology and the study of diseases within populations. It is a requirement, so I think my recommendation is a moot point.",
    "TAKE IT! WORTH IT! :)",
    "This course is demanding. The material is tough at times, but it is definitely doable if you work hard (even with no epidemiology background). Keep up with the homeworks, read the supplemental material on v2, and don't cram for the quizzes. Don't skip sections, as they are very helpful. Also, don't hesitate to ask questions.",
    "It is important, informative, fun and critical",
    "This course is essential for any student starting in public health, since it provides the necessary vocabulary, study design knowledge, and critical assessment skills. I would highly recommend it, as it was one of my favorite courses this semester.",
    "Introduction to epidemiological concepts which will help you understand and analyze literature in the field.",
    "This class will teach you to think like an epidemiologist. If you've never taken a course like this before it will probably require a fair amount of work and the class' frequent homework and exams means that you will have to devote a decent amount of time to it. I would recommend it, though it is a required classfor EPH so we all have to take it anyway.",
    "I would not recommend that any student take Professor Niccolai for Epidemiology I.",
    "This class is required but also a very important cornerstone of the curriculum. I learned a lot.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Highly recommended. Even for non-EPH people, a good introduction to the field of epi, how it's useful, and why it's important",
    "Like the Biostat course, all the information presented (and then some) can be found in the text and elsewhere. Why pay an extravagent amount for a rigid schedule of courses that teach you stuff you will never ever use when you can teach youself more efficiently?",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It serves as a good foundation to epidemiology.",
    "This course teaches you a great deal about Epidemiology and changes the basic way you think and approach problems. I would recommend this course to another student because I took a great deal from it and can see myself applying what I've learned in my career.",
    "This is a core course, so every first-year student has to take it, but I thought it provided a good base for study in the field of public health. I would recommend attending office hours if you don't understand certain concepts, because things build off of each other a lot. Plus, you can attend office hours of other TAs if you have a hard time with the teaching style of your particular TA.",
    "Strengths: The way Dr. Niccolai organized the course is a major strength - it's very logical and flows well. Dr. Niccolai is also great about using examples in the powerpoints which are really helpful. Great to have the powerpoints posted online. Dr. Niccolai is also a good lecturer and she's clear about what's important in epidemiology and what isn't as important, particularly for her class. Regular homeworks are fair and helpful. Great to have an opportunity to correct them because you can learn from your mistakes!Weaknesses: Occasionally had too many readings assigned to get the same basic points across in a single week. Sometimes homework and test questions can be worded awkwardly which leads you to the wrong answer.Would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "Even though all students are required to take this course, I hope there is a different professor teaching this course next time.",
    "It's required... Brace yourself and keep your expectations low.",
    "Good overview of the basic concepts in epidemiology - at the very least you should be able to understand epidemiological research articles after taking this course. Although Dr. Niccolai posts her lectures online, I would go to class. She covers a lot that isn't on the slides and studying from lecture notes seemed to be much more helpful for quizzes than studying from the book. Go to office hours if you don't understand something - she is very helpful in smaller settings.",
    "The course provides an excellent foundation for the study of epidemiology and the applications to public health.",
    "-This course is very demanding because many of the problems we must perform are very similiar in composition and formula.-The course is very difficult and requires lots of practice.",
    "This course was not a fun course to take. The material was not very interesting and was not stimulating or thought-provoking. The concepts and terminology were often convoluted. Not a great course, but it's required, so we all just have to get through it one way or another!",
    "Good overview of basic essential concepts for epidemiology.",
    "It's a required course",
    "yes. It's a very informative course.",
    "An overview of epi concepts. Ties in great with BIS505a.",
    "The material that the professor taught could have been taught in less than a month if it was not purposefully made confusing.",
    "Avoid this course if you've had epi."
