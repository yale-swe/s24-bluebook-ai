   "comments": [
    "A wonderful and very applied class that takes you step by step through how to create a grant proposal. The peer review session at the end was an incredibly useful exercise in how an actual review process would happen and the feedback was really useful.",
    "Good course to help you proposal writing. Need to incorporate more examples of real life proposals.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to grant writing. Strengths include the instructors organization and approach to the topic; the periodic deadlines; the peer review process at the end; the availability of the instructor and the feedback she provided.Weaknesses include the focus on the R01 and other grant funding mechanisms that are not appropriate for investigators at our stage of career. The course could have been better organized around the different funding mechanisms more suitable to our career stage such as F-31, K awards or smaller grant mechanisms.",
    "Strengths: Very thorough and detail-oriented approach to grant writing. I appreciated the timeline- so that by the end of the course I have a grant ready for NIH submission! I also loved the peer review process- both giving and receiving feedback. I found it very useful.Weaknesses: Geared to someone with little to no grant-writing experience",
    "good course. Subject matter is very boring and meticulous. But informative in the sense that it helps apply for future grants.",
    "The course was very helpful in gaining a better understanding of the process of applying for grants and how to improve one's proposal as well as common mistakes to avoid. The assignments were well spread out over the course of the semester and the peer review process was very insightful.",
    "I learned a lot from this course..A must take course. However there was no adequate feedback. And I could see that from the \"Reviews\" that I did.",
    "Strengths: introduction to very useful statistical analysis techniques; practical assessments that will serve as templates for analysis in the future; excellent instructor that is extremely sensitive to the needs of her students and has put a huge amount of effort into the course.Weaknesses: none",
    "Strengths:Great topic that needs to be covered. You learn a lot about the grant submission and review process.Weekly homework assignments keep you on task throughout the term, so that the final project is not too bad.Weakness:Little to no feedback on the weekly assignments means you can feel kind of lost throughout the course.",
    "It was important to receive detailed guidelines and reviewers perspectives on research proposals. Reach sources provided and the structure of the course was very helpful. It is a little hard to finalize the final task within the given timeline, but his might be an individual, not a course problem.",
    "really good.",
    "I really enjoyed the process of drafting an NIH research protocol and appreciated the small group nature of the course. This is a course for self-motivated individuals, which required substantial work outside of class. Without my research group, I feel that I would have struggled to write many sections of the protocol because I was unable to find examples of well-written protocols.Furthermore, it would be nice to have a presentation class to garner feedback on our topics mid-way into the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0A great instructor with considerable experience that allows her to teach effectively about how best to write and submit grants.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Excellent presentation skills, helpful and responsive!",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Dr. Ettinger is very knowledgeable and makes herself available to her students both in-person and over email. She clearly has a lot of experience with grant writing which adds to the quality of the course. I think one thing that could be improved with this course (as mentioned earlier) is to organize the writing around grant mechanisms that are more applicable to investigators at our stage of career rather than the R01.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Very approachable, flexible, and receptive to questions. Personalized the course to make it useful for a group of studnets with a wide range of backgrounds and interests. I only wish we could have received feedback from Dr. Ettinger on an ongoing basis- rather than just at the beginning and end of the process.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Great professor and always responds to emails promptly!",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Dr. Ettinger's feedback and support was very helpful, in particular during the one-on-one meetings. Her strict deadlines and approach to writing the grant proposal one section at a time were helpful in staying on track and become more comfortable and competent in writing a grant proposal.The lectures were somewhat repetitive at times, going back and forth between various aspects of the process of applying for grants.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0would have been nice if professor takes more time explaining powerpoint slides rather than assume students know all details of the content; be more available to meet with students",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0she is genuine and cares about students.HOWEVER.... there was NO ADEQUATE FEEDBACK on ASSIGNMENTS.....I prefer to get graded assignments back every week,especially when the next assignment depends on the feedback from the previous one.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable regarding the course content; very sensitive to students' needs and responsive to questions; has developed excellent notes and SAS templates\/macros.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Dr. Ettinger often seemed like she did not want to be in class. We received very little feedback on the weekly assignments after the first two weeks. There were two optional meetings to discuss assignments. I attended the first, but was basically just told \"It's good\" with little discussion of how to actually improve the project, so I did not feel that attending the second was worthwhile.For several of the assignments it was unclear what exactly was being asked for, and there were not good examples to follow. This was particularly true for the budget, research strategy outline, sample size calculations and human subjects.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0The instructor is intended to help and provide students with as much resources and advises, as possible. It would be interesting to see more of the multidisciplinary research in the est of examples.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Course Materials (PPT slides etc) and lectures are really good for understanding.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Dr. Ettinger provided critical feedback on my protocol and I enjoyed her lectures; my only criticism was that there were numerous (2-3 I think) course cancellations, which l felt were unacceptable given the relatively low ratio of in class to out of class work."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class as a very applied and practical intro to grant writing that leaves you with a mostly finished grant as a product.",
    "Useful if you are preparing a grant",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students who have a strong idea of a topic they would like to investigate and write a proposal for.",
    "This course is essentially a grant-writing workshop that walks you through the steps of preparing an NIH-style grant application, culminating in a peer review. Reviews the basic details of each section so useful for those who have never ventured to write a grant before, and also challenges you to write your own grant- great for those of us trying to submit one!",
    "yes",
    "Very helpful course for everyone who might need or want to apply for grants in the future. Simply going through the process in a class setting and receiving feedback along the way has given me a better sense of the grant application process, my strengths and weaknesses and how to approach writing a good application.",
    "take the course if you really want to learn grant writing, very good exercise in those regards",
    "A good course. Although it could be improved.",
    "Excellent introduction to useful analytic techniques that are increasingly being utilized in public health. Extremely good instructor.",
    "More feedback needed throughout the term.",
    "You go through the whole process of writing a grant. It's a really good exercise, especially if you have a grant in mind to start. Unfortunately, the specifics of the teacher mean that I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone who is not required to take it.",
    "This course is absolutely must take if someone is interested in a scientific carrier. Even for very young scientists who are not intended to apply anywhere it is very important to understand what kind of work is behind the proposal writing and the structure of research application."
