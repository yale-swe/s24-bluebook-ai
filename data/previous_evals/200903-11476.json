   "comments": [
    "You will definitely learn interesting material in this class, but be ready to learn a lot. There is always a lot to study for and review before each test and the textbook itself is the biggest one I've ever had to purchase here at Yale. It's pretty interesting to learn about the different ways the body operates right down to the cellular level, so if you are interested in the body, esp. if you are premed, I definitely recommend the course. Just be ready to work hard.",
    "It's a tough but very interesting course that covers the biology most relevant for pre-med students. I definitely recommend it!",
    "PLEASE TAKE, serge is an amazing TA, the material is captivating and just makes logical sense, not a bad class at all",
    "The closest you will get to medical school as an undergrad. This course goes through a quick overview of the circulatory, respiratory, reproductive, renal, digestive, auditory, visual, gustatory, vestibular, and nervous systems in an enjoyable and definitely manageable way. I highly recommend this course to all aspiring medical students to see if this is what you are really interested in studying at med school.",
    "Physio is great if you're interested in the material. It's a lot to learn, but I enjoyed learning it. I also liked the level of the class - it's tough and there are a lot of grad students in it, but I really liked that everyone knew what they were doing and wanted to learn the material. The textbook is absurdly detailed, but for every lecture, there are slides and notes posted, as well as study guides, and all of this makes preparing for tests manageable, although they are still hard. Hard but fair. This is a very good course.",
    "Very hard and dense course that taught about the different organ systems in the body. I would onlyrecommend it to students who are serious about biomedical engineering or any related major.",
    "I would recommend it a a student who needs to take it for their major or who is pre-med and is interested in physiology.",
    "The course is an overview of the major organ systems in the body. Although the exams are difficult, the course is a great way to integrate previous pre-med coursework. It's really interesting and the professors are very engaging. Definitely go to lecture if you take this class.",
    "Essential overview of how the body works. The most relevant course I've taken as a pre-med that relates to medicine. The exams, while difficult, are fair and not tricky. TAs were enthusiastic and helpful. This was also great preparation for the MCAT.",
    "Horrible class. But it will definitely help for medical school though. So take it only if you're pre-med or you want to get a PhD in physiology. If you're not one of those two, then it's not very wise to take this class. Period.",
    "It took me awhile to like this course. The amount of equations and physics concepts was a bit overwhelming, but that's really only because I suck at physics. I wish I had done better on the tests, but they're pretty fair.",
    "I would summarize it as a course that goes over all the basics of human physiology, concentrating on different systems like the endocrine system and the renal system. I would recommend it to anyone who is considering med school.",
    "I would recommend it only if the student is enthusiastic about the material and is willing to put in the work.",
    "I definitely recommend it! The material is very interesting and useful for medical school.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I really enjoyed it. But, be prepared to keep up with the reading and notes and quizzes because there is too much material to risk getting behind. Take advantage of the TAs and study material that is generously provided!",
    "Highly recommended. Hard course, but worth the effort.",
    "This is like the human physiology system which is typically supposed to be covered in at least two semesters, compressed into one semester. Therefore it is tough and it is fast, but it is worth it because u end up learning a lot from this class. It is also a beautiful complement to other classes like BENG 351.",
    "This class covers all the physiolgical systems in detail. The material is not difficult to understand, but it is A LOT of material. You get over 150 pages of reading per week.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student deeply interested in physiology or biology, and who is willing to put in the time and effort needed to learn all course material. There is alot of information in the course, and I feel it is challenging. But there is alot to be learned and the course greatly prepares students interested in the study of medicine or physiology.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is pre-med.",
    "A wonderful class - you learn a LOT about how the human body works on a detailed level, but the expectations on the exam (all multiple choice and true-false!) are very reasonable. All of the lecturers are very good; Saltzman and Nitabach's lectures are especially intriguing. The TA's are a great resource and (hint hint) a great help in preparing for the exams. This class made me rethink switching out of the bio major.",
    "highly recommended; difficult to wrap head around all material and tests are difficult, but well worth it",
    "This class is hard, but it teaches you so much about physiology, it's worth it. It's the most pre-med class I've ever taken.",
    "Solid course for both BME majors and pre-med folk. Fun and interesting but hard. Take it if you're at all interested in the human body.",
    "Really interesting class with lots of great, knowledgeable lecturers. Yes, I suppose it's useful for medical school, but even on its own I learned so much about the body. Definitely take it. Also, if Saltzman doesn't know your (my) name, it's kind of depressing (since he'll address everyone else...). Also, the final was much more cumulative than I expected, and there were a lot of questions on my least favorite unit. So beware.",
    "Physiological Systems was a wonderful class that I would definitely recommend taking. I have never learned so much interesting information from one class, and the professors are some of the best I have had at Yale. I really enjoyed it.",
    "Sort of a survey of all of the systems in the body: cardiovascular, kidneys, GI tract, somatosensory stuff, endocrine, and respiratory systems. It was AWESOME. the best course i've taken so far. Had interesting material, lecturers were great, my TA, Serge was the BEST TA EVER, and overall a really great class. Different from the other biology classes I've taken with more of a focus on the whole system, which was really nice. TAKE IT! (hopefully serge will TA again- he was sUPER helpful)",
    "one of the best science classes at yale, if you are thinking premed, take this class, worth the work...also the book is dense, but actually really good if you use it",
    "A good class to take Credit D if you don't want to kill yourself. Tons of information. The reading is definitely not necessary unless you really really want to get an A. And even then you'll have to memorize the text because the tests tend to be ridiculously detailed-- multiple choice and true\/false so they test your ability to remember a single sentence in the book versus your overall understanding of the material. The info is very very interesting but the lectures are horribly boring and early. The weekly quizzes are a pain but all the questions can be Googled, which kind of ruins the point. If you just want to learn the info, take it credit D.",
    "yes I would, it is a very interesting subject and a great prep for the MCAT.",
    "it was very interesting. the lecturers were all good. lots of information but straightforward.",
    "This class is awesome. Take it. The class covers the physiology of several of the body's major systems. It is well taught and TA'd, well organized and challenging. It's the perfect class if you're interested in the human body, medicine, or just animal biology in general.",
    "Physio was great, definitely one of my favorite classes. All the professors were great at discussing their topic and relating it to the students. The class was certainly a challenge, especially the first or so lectures in the areas where I had no previous experience (like the heart or lungs). Many of the other students in the class did already know the basics and so I feel like those were sometimes brushed over rather quickly, but having Serge as a TA made it easy to catch up. I really loved this class. Each subject was very interesting, and I loved having experts in each field explain the subjects. I loved every topic and every professor, but get Serge as a TA if you want to do well.",
    "This was a great biology course, and probably my favorite science course taken at Yale. The team teaching approach was good, as all the professors taught their specialties and most were very good, although the styles were very inconsistent. There is a lot of information to know and concepts to understand, but the material is very relevant and interesting and well taught. The tests are difficult, and the format is silly: half multiple choice and half true\/false. The online quizzes (homework) each week is sometimes quite difficult and often not covered in lecture (and sometimes not in the book, either). The textbook (B&B) is HORRIBLE and at times incomprehensible. The figures in the book seem are the most confusing things ever. The textbook should be changed, for sure. A standard physiology review book was a good friend during the second half of the semester. It would be nice to make teaching styles more consistent, or if not, make the expectations of what to know very clear, as this was difficult to gauge. All in all, a great class, and I benefitted very much from having taken it. The T.A. Serge is incredible.",
    "This is a hard course, so take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is so fulfilling to learn so much material. They should realized, however, that it requires a lot of work."
