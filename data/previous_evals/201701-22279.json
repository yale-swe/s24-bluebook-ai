   "comments": [
    "I gained a great deal of confidence in using a mill and lathe to machine aluminum and brass materials into precision parts. I also learned how to drill and tap holes, thread a bolt, polish parts, work with many different shapes and sizes of raw material, and use a computer guided mill. Most of all, this course gave me insight into how to properly draft a part for machining if either I wanted to machine a part or pass the draft onto another machinist.",
    "When starting this course, I knew nothing about machining. Over this semester I have learned how to use the mill and lathes and I feel prepared to machine parts needed for my lab group. I also feel I have a better understanding of how things in the world around me, in general, are made.",
    "Learned how to operate basic machinery safely, a bit about part design, and how to sit back and enjoy a good cup of coffee.",
    "So many practical machining skills- absolutely incredible & amazingly helpful instructors"

   "comments": [
    "This is, in my opinion, one of the best courses I have here at Yale. Very friendly lecturer, best partners ever, gained a lot. Built confidence in machining.",
    "This course is extremely well organized with clear goals and a low stress environment. Honestly one of the best ways I could have imagined learning how to machine.",
    "I really like the fact that we end the course with a working model steam engine. There isn't anything I would change about the course.",
    "Course is well designed. Provides a good environment to introduce machining scientific instrumentation. Literally was the highlight of my week. Doesn't have any apparent weaknesses.",
    "Personal guidance and clear commitment from instructors make it one of the best classes I've taken at Yale"

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Best course. I don't usually give feedback like this but this is indeed the best course I have here at Yale (apart from the course I had with Mark Johnson).",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you would like to learn how to machine, or even if you just want one afternoon of your week to be a focused time for catharsis. I also looked forward to attending and am extremely pleased with the final product I was able to make.",
    "Yes, it is an extremely useful course for any experimental physicist, and I have already recommended to at least 5 of my friends.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students interested in machining their own parts or suspecting that their research might need custom made parts. Even if a student doesn't machine parts, it helps to understand the limitations and technicalities of making the parts using common machine tools.",
    "Very practical- helps you learn skills that will help you apply otherwise theoretical knowledge you acquire from other courses"
