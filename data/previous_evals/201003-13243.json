   "comments": [
    "This class is a survey of early race relations in America. It provided an unbiased view of the growth of America, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a clearer view on history and the start of our country.",
    "Great introduction to colonial history. You dig into the racial and cultural conflicts that arose throughout this time period, and how it shapes the formation of American society. The literature ranges from informative\/didactic background literature to renowned narrative literature like Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. Art museum visits are also a plus and a nice mix-up to the usual routine of class discussions. Workload is relatively light, four short papers throughout the semester.",
    "This was a great class! I never though colonial history could be so relevant to modern day America, but looking at racial issues and their foundation in history is really eye opening. I would totally recommend it to a fellow student, to cover the colonial requirement or just for a seminar. The reading was a little heavy, but manageable. And the papers were not difficult to write, and Gabrielle was very helpful with the writing process.",
    "It's a junior seminar for American Studies that focuses on how race plays out in early America, from first contact through the early 1800's. You go to the YCBA and YUAG to look at some special exhibits and do a combination of primary and secondary readings. Professor is awesome, and it makes you look at race in America in a whole new light.",
    "Great course- enables you to engage deeply with the issue of race in early America because of the variety of sources (paintings, household objects, personal narratives, novels, poetry, secondary sources). You won't come out of the course having learned very much about specific historical events, but you'll have a better thematic understanding of how ideas about race developed. Greatest weakness (as with most seminars) is that the reading load ebbs and flows, but is often pretty heavy, so people come unprepared to class and the discussion is lacking.",
    "This junior seminar with Gabrielle is great. The readings are pretty good and the workload isn't too heavy. Gabrielle provides lots of support and guidance along the way, and is always open to discuss things outside of class, as well as during class.",
    "Overall an interesting and worthwhile selection of reading and a different way of thinking about the colonial period. Most of the readings were great but it wasn't really necessary to read everything to complete the assignments or to get through class. This was great if you didn't have the time, but not so great for the class environment - discussion was pretty slow at times. I enjoyed the readings but wish I could pinpoint more conclusive things I learned - common problem in Yale seminars. Recommend if you need a junior seminar and are interested in talking about race, whether or not you are interested in the colonial period.",
    "great class and I would recommend it",
    "Take this class with Professor Guise! The workload is very manageable for a seminar and the topics are really interesting."
