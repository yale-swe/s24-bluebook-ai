    "I learned a lot about fashion history, mainly in London and Paris. I also learned a whole lot about the photographers I researched for the two short papers: Jeanloup Sieff and Horst P. Horst. I learned how to use ProQuest and Yale's Orbis catalogue.",
    "I learnt how to write extended research papers as i was not skilled in this area. On top of that i learnt how to do class presentations and how to lead a discussion.",
    "The ability to analyze how fashion history intercepts with other historical movements, such as the industrial revolution, in both London and France.",

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course lay in Prof. Conekin's choices of readings and the small seminar nature of the course.",
    "This class gives you what you put into it. The readings are, like other class readings, long and difficult to stay focused on, however they are essential to having a productive discussion in class. This class was great and I enjoyed it however there were a few days where it was clear people hadn't done all of the reading and it was a little awkward.",
    "The ability to all lead discussion sections was a plus.",
    "This was an extremely engaging course."

    "Prof. Becky Conekin really knows her stuff about fashion history and chooses readings that really showcase her vast knowledge of the field. All the readings are incredibly interesting and enjoyable; there is a decent amount of reading and it must be done for the intimate class discussion. The papers are relatively easy to write and you are given almost complete freedom as to what topics (relating to fashion in London and Paris, of course) you write about. It is necessary to have a decent background in writing history papers as there is no hand-holding when it comes to the papers (no drafts\/thesis statements are due, only the two 4-6 page papers and 12-15 page research paper). We had visits from awesome speakers from Vogue and got to delve deep into Yale's historical archives for primary sources and objects that we viewed in person at the British Art Center. Really cool.",
    "yes i would recommend this course. this is because it allows you to learn how to write, but then has a very interesting topic.",
    "Yes, it is on a subject we can rarely learn about and we learned about it in depth.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. This was an amazing course."
