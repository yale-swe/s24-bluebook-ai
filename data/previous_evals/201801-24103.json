    "I learned about the relationship between humans and wilderness and the ways in which American perceptions of wilderness changed over time.",
    "Beyond expanding my knowledge of wilderness topics, this course really helped to develop the construction of my thoughts and central arguments. I found the seminar to be challenging but never overwhelming. I learned so much from the readings, my peers, and Adrin's instruction, and I am immensely thankful for the opportunity to be in the course.",
    "I gained a general understanding of various views of nature. In engaging critically with American literature, art, and other mediums, the course tied together the intellectual, cultural, and political forces at play.",
    "I learned a lot about the tradition of wilderness thought. It was a great blend of philosophy and application."

   "comments": [
    "Wonderful field trips, engaging readings, and caring professor! Class discussions sometimes lagged, and Lerner-Patrn could sometimes slip into dominating the conversation. Discussions could be improved by allowing students to speak more, and by encouraging students to build off of each others comments.",
    "This course was great! The reading load was pretty heavy but always interesting. Discussions were good. I think I wish it had included more thinking about a active management and how we should do things not only how other people approached these problems.",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar! The class definitely benefits from being a small discussion seminar, but I do wish it were broken up into smaller meeting times instead of the large afternoon block (although I know this is typical for capped seminars). Sitting still for two hours can become tedious, and I think splitting the course into more frequent, smaller times could maybe be beneficial. Just my two cents!",
    "No computers in a seminar, people were on facebook and imessage all the time.",
    "The course is well organized and engaging; however, some weeks were more enjoyable than others. That being said, those duller weeks were still important steps in the trajectory of the course topics.",
    "I really appreciated how this course was formatted. The readings were interesting and very relevant, the class discussions were incredibly engaging, the field trips were super helpful for applying the material, and the papers taught me a lot. I also appreciated how dynamic the class was, each week we discussed a new facet of wilderness thought, and it was not just focused on the white, male transcendentalists."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, for the fun field trips and readings! Class discussions could be improved a bit though.",
    "Yes. It was really interesting and Adrin was great!",
    "Yes, but only if the student is explicitly interested in the topic of wilderness. The reading load is heavy, and you really have to be invested in the course's material in order to enjoy it. However, I liked it and would definitely recommend it to students within the environmental humanities discipline.",
    "The readings are great and the professor changes every very year. Adrin is a great guy and did a solid job running the class. A lot of how much you get out of the class is about how dedicated and willing to discuss thoughtfully the other students are and I think our group was lacking in that respect. Not much to do on that front, but i known that this class could have been a lot better if the other students had cared more.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the environment and enjoys literature. If you do not like writing and reading, this is probably not the course for you.",
    "Absolutely!"
