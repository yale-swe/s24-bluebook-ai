    "Lots of work but worth it",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. I think that after 110\/120 it will seem a lot easier but you will still be learning. The teachers are great and the structure of the classes keeps you interested and practicing.",
    "Take it, but be warned it involves a lot of studying outside of the class. Lots of rote memorization.",
    "If you're taking Chinese obviously you have to take this class. It gets really repetitive but I learned a crazy amount more than I did in high school Mandarin.",
    "Chinese 130 is a very solid, straightforward class that is not too challenging or unmanageable. I would highly recommend it.",
    "imprves your chinese tremendouly work every day but awesome - profs are amazing",
    "definitely take this class if you took L1 and L2 chinese. you will learn a lot (although L3 is taught much differently than L1-2). the first week of class seems really hard because the class is taught at a faster pace and the instant repetition method takes a few weeks to get used to. overall, very good class!",
    "Awesome class, its a little different from L1 in that the various backgrounds of different students are a little more spread out, as some people took Chinese in high school or lived abroad. However I think that each individual gets whatever they put into this class.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course because it really improved my Chinese.",
    "Yes, this is the inevitable second step towards language proficiency",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning Chinese!",
    "I have absolutely nothing positive to say about Chinese 130. I spent at least 20 hours each week on the class (between homework and class-time), and in the end have learned absolutely nothing.This class ruined my semester in more ways than one. It has brought down my grades in every single one of my classes. Even though I spent more than 20 hours per week I do not expect anything better than a C in this class. The only way to do well in this class is if you are already fluent in Chinese.Class itself is just horrible. You learn absolutely nothing in class and have to teach yourself the entire semester's material. The professors only have one teaching style and it is entirely ineffective. They use powerpoint andnothing else. Every day you sit in class and they put up powerpoint slides with chinese sentences on them. The professors have the students read the slides aloud repeatedly. Then they cover the projector and have the class recite the exact sentence again from memory. They then change the slide and repeat. Imagine doing this for an hour a day, every day for a semester, it is absolute torture and worthless.I cannot recommend this class to any other student. If you are a freshman who placed into chinese L3, do not take this class, it will be a horrible start to your freshman year.If you are an upperclassman who took L1-L2 last year, I strongly urge you to consider taking a new language rather than taking this one class. Three more semester of language is a far better choice than this class.",
    "Through relatively engaging texts, students learn and practice vocab and grammar structures. During every lesson (about 4 class meetings), we'd have three in-class quizzes (including a dictation), three nights of graded homework submitted online, and a short written essay. Over the course of the semester we also had three written tests and three oral tests. During class, Mu Laoshi\/Chen Laoshi drill you on the texts and vocab; there's a lot of vocal repetition, giving your own example, talking with a partner, skits, etc. It's a great balance of interactive and not interactive components. I would recommend this class to a student who wants to continue with their Chinese, and is willing to put in constant amounts of effort (not overwhelming amounts, but just constant effort) into a course that meets every day. It becomes part of your routine. My Chinese definitely improved and I amvery satisfied with the course. However, I think every student should have an experience studying Chinese in an immersion setting in China, and while this does not compare with that experience, it definitely prepares you to go to China and gets you well on your way to having more proficient Chinese across skill sets (writing, reading, listening, speaking).",
    "This is an intensive language course that will help you progress a lot. It requires a lot of work, though, and sometimes can be a bit confusing. If you want to learn the language, though, it's a good course.",
    "I would summarize Chinese 130 as a class that relies completely on the textbook for all of its structure and flow. There is not much flexibility in the classroom or chances to apply what you have learned. However, you do learn a lot of grammar and vocabulary, both of which are crucial to eventually reaching an advanced level of Chinese. I would definitely recommend Chinese 130 as a sort of stepping-stone between beginner Chinese and a more fluent level of Chinese.",
    "Overall this is a great class. Expectations are pretty clear, nothing was ungraspable, and Chinese is amazing :)The constant flow of work was a lot though, but you should expect that from Chinese at Yale ;DChinese L3 is more frustrating that L1 or L2. The teachers have to accommodate people who started at Yale and who started elsewhere, so they can't assume a common set of known words between students. So you have to learn that it's important to 'catch up' with each other, and develop a system of learning catchup words.Everything is actually more serious than you think. The first time you read a lesson or listen to a dialogue, you should not only be able to understand the entire thing, but be able to repeat the entire dialogue back when prompted the next day. The first oral exam was a huge surprise, and I didn't understand how to study for it (and how early to start studying) until the third and final one.Neither teacher was quite as in-sync with the students as were the L1\/2 teachers, but that's partially because the students have varied backgrounds in Chinese.Chinese teachers provide motivation that out brains need to fuel our memorization.They want to push you to learn more. Every student should learn a little faster than they're comfortable doing. Try to meet their highest expectations on the first try, and you'll do quite well in the class.",
    "if you are really invested in Chinese than yes take it. its a lot of work but it rewarding slash you sort of have to if you already took L1 and L2",
    "Lots of work, very difficult but satisfying",
    "It's everything you'd expect in a Chinese class. Definitely take it.",
    "Chinese 130 is a continuation of Chinese L1 and L2 at Yale. I believe it was harder than L1 and L2, but it could have just been because the newness\/excitement of learning Chinese had worn off. Take it if you are planning on doing the Light Fellowship or if you need to complete your language requirement, but other than that, it will probably just lower your GPA.The schedule is very uniform. Listening, reading, and grammar exercises for each chapter. Quizzes for each chapter. Mini essays for each chapter. Textbook and oral exams. Section. Lots of skits toward the end.If you are going to take this class, brush up on all of your L1 and L2 character recognition and writing skills. You are expected to use these as your foundation.",
    "It's a lot of work, but if you've gotten to this point you're probably going for the language requirement and have no choice. Even if you don't learn Chinese, you will learn humility.",
    "A lot of work, but improvement is certainly noticeable.",
    "I would recommend taking this course to anyone who wants to continue their Chinese language studies. If you're not sure how committed you are to the language, at least start out by taking it Cr\/D\/Fail and see how it goes for the first few weeks.",
    "give yourself to the zhongwen machine; do not resist; embrace hell",
    "Chinese 130 01 requires an average of an hour or two a day for each class. This is the amount of time required outside of class time to perform well. I would definitely recommend this course, because we cover critical topics for basic living in China.",
    "If you want to learn Chinese, then you are going to take this course. However, know that it is very repetitive and there is a lot of work involved because it is a difficult language to learn. There are a lot of quizzes and the homework is mainly done online, so even the homework has the feel of a quiz. In-class learning mainly consists of repeating aloud sentences from the text in the book or the online book. The class is very structured and the schedule for the entire semester is laid out completely on the class website. The focus of the course is mostly on listening and speaking.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, although the grading is a bit harsh in comparison with the workload.",
    "I liked Ch 130 and felt Ilearned a lot from it. Personally, I think if you're serious about Chinese, nothing compares to studying in China (so, doing a Light Fellowship or, what I did, starting off in Chinese with Yale-PKU)--I say this because if you haven't already, you definitely should, and if you have, then (for better or worse) Ch 130 will obviously feel slower, easier, and less consuming than a course you took abroad.I think it's actually easy to do \"ok\" in this class, but it's designed in a way that people who are really motivated and want to push themselves can learn a lot. It's easy to just memorize the pertinent lesson for the quiz\/test in front of you, but to really retain what you've learned, you'll have to push yourself and review beyond what is assigned\/expected. Nightly homework won't take that long, but something like the voice recordings or the essay are a matter of deciding how much work you want to put in."
