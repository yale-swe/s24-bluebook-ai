    "De La O is a gem. She's so kind and fosters a great, open environment in the class. Grading is pretty easy and I would say this class is very accessible to people from all backgrounds. It's mostly group work, so if you don't like that then steer clear.",
    "Yes.",
    "Very discussion-oriented with occassional friendly arguments coming out. Weekly readings can take a while, so it's necessary to plan your time accordingly. Group projects helped us learn about individual countries and the real world effects of what we were learning, which was a great aspect of the class. There is a lot of pressure s=to speak in class though, so if you have some anxiety when it comes to speaking in a seminar, this class could be a bit difficult.",
    "EP&E 243 is a great course if you are interested in poverty in the world. Class is fun, and there is plenty of opportunity to discuss the readings with your classmates. Be prepared: there is a lot of group work. A very enjoyable experience!",
    "This class was interesting but seemed more appropriate for Sophomores and Freshmen than Seniors and Juniors. Professor De La O Torres made an effort to have a wide variety of students in the class but I think it brought down the level of discussion. The class is pretty low work (3 group 3-page memos, a take-home midterm and one final paper). However, I came out of it feeling like I didn't really gain any concrete knowledge. Overall tho, the topics covered were interesting and Professor De La O Torres seems very knowledgeable about the material.",
    "A great class and cool opportunity to take a course on poverty alleviation with one of Yale's most important experts in this field. Prof. De La O really wants you to succeed and helps you throughout the class both get as much as you can out of the material and also mold the class to address your specific interests. You do work in groups, which takes a bunch of time, but really is a better learning experience and you get to make new friends. Classroom discussions are not intimidating, as Prof De La O really does try to make sure everyone's voice is heard and respected. She also tried really hard to get a diverse class, so if you're not a poli sci \/ ep&e major, still try to get in..she also had a few people from each grade, including freshman, so definitely try to get in as a freshman even. I'd highly recommend. The 20 page final paper was a lot, but you get almost complete freedom about your topic, so I really enjoyed writing mine. Good mix of tangible \/ practical info as well as more philosophical discussions.",
    "This course is a survey of problems and strategies in the political economy of poverty alleviation. You will cover units on human capital development (health and education), welfare states, micro-finance, corruption, political systems & poverty, institutions and history, etc. While much of what you learn is pretty intuitive and might not surprise you if you've had any exposure to courses in development, global health, etc., it's definitely nice to take this course, read key papers in international development, and have a forum for discussion. If you've already taken a lot of other classes in this field, I wouldn't go out of my way to take this class. It's definitely a survey course and it's not totally life changing. If you're really into the syllabus but don't have time to take the course but are really interested in reading the papers, nothing is stopping you from skimming them on your own time. The 20 page final paper can also be really rough if you don't start early! The group presentations were surprisingly enjoyable if you end up in a good group. Pretty good course overall, but nothing incredibly transformative.",
    "Good introduction to poverty, the politics of poverty alleviation, and different methods amd policies employed to combat it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in global affairs, development, or poverty alleviation.",
    "Great course, definitely take it if you are interested in development and poverty alleviation. It is an introductory course in development and is well structured and organized."
