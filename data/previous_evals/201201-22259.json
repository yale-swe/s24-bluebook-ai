   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it because of the books you get to read.",
    "I would, because it's a required part of DS",
    "I fully recommend this class. Professor Sussman is as about as much angelic as a person can get--the class is warm, friendly, academic, and everything is wonderful! You will have your best experience in a class in the entirety of your time at Yale--I assure you of this. The reading is great, the company great, and you will be stretched and challenged as a learner and as a person. Professor Sussman introduces literary criticism that is sometimes obscure, sometimes utterly perspective-changing. You can choose to zone out, but to take this class it really to engage in your ability to understand theory and interpretation that goes way beyond the norm.",
    "The DS lit syllabus is truly wonderful, and the class is 100 percent worthwhile if you do the reading. Henry Sussman is a great professor and always enjoyable to listen to. Very work-intensive -- there are literally thousands of pages assigned (1200+ for War and Peace, 800+ for Don Quixote, plus all the other books in the course). But every book is well worth reading and reading well.",
    "Take DS if you liked DS last semester and if Sussman is teaching, get into his section; he is a great human being.",
    "Undoubtedly, everyone would want to make some change to the syllabus - some would like to include The Wasteland or perhaps have at least one female writer - Virginia Woolf, perhaps while some would like to do Hamlet instead of King Lear. But that being said, there will always be more than we can possibly cover in a great books course such as this one. The course is designed to allow each student to establish a very personal relationship not simply with the professor and her fellow students but above all, with the text. Writing about three papers for each of the three courses is a particularly rewarding experience as it allows one to immerse oneself in a particular area of focus. This course has changed the way I read and approach a text and I believe that it is one of the best ways to begin an education at Yale. Professor Sussman is often eccentric. That, however, is no disqualification. His ability to instantly relate a text we are reading to 20th century literary criticism or perhaps 19th century German philosophy has introduced me to an academic realm I would love to explore further. He is certainly a kind grader but I will mention that I found his comments and remarks very helpful and insightful. I would most certainly recommend Professor Sussman to a fellow student. He is always successful in creating a warm and friendly atmosphere in class and is always excited to meet with students and discuss course-work or anything else, for that matter, at length.",
    "The Literature portion of Directed Studies is definitely the most accessible and the most worthwhile part of the entire curriculum. These more modern novels are great reference points for any literary analysis you could ever make. Sussmann is particularly a great teacher--not only does he demonstrate a profound knowledge of the texts and guide you through them, but he also is a great, funny, and slightly wacky man. He's been my favorite DS professor so far, so if you have any doubts about continuing with second semester DS, I think it's worth it just for Sussman. I recommend the class for anyone who loves literature and an enjoyable yet deep approach to it.",
