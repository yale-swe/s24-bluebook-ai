   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you are at all interested in French or you want to improve your spoken French.",
    "It's a lot of work at times. I would recommend it if you would really like to improve your French. You will learn a ton about a wide variety of things in the French culture. I really loved it.",
    "It was a good intro to French culture that had several interesting films and a lot of busy work. I was taking it for an easy French credit and it was more work than I expected.",
    "The first few weeks seem tough but hw starts to go way faster after that. Great way to practice speaking, class is enjoyable and the movies are pretty good. Not an easy class- don't underestimate language classes- but manageable.",
    "Overall, I'd recommend this class. It's a lot of work, but if you're willing to work consistently, and really work to improve your language skills, it's worth the time and effort.",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for a moderately intense class to improve your spoken and written french.",
    "This is a great course -- fun, interesting and fairly rigorous. Class discussions and assigned readings focus on the politics, economics and society of contemporary France; we discussed everything from abortion to environmental policy. All the media associated with the course (including emails from the professor) are in French, and it is expected that students will speak comfortably and intelligently (if not necessarily fluently). Take it -- your vocabulary will increase dramatically, as will your ability to speak naturally and knowledgeably. All the conversation practice makes this an especially great course for freshmen who received 5's on their APs but haven't used their French since, or for upperclassmen whose skills have begun to get a little rusty.",
    "French 160 is a great class after taking AP French and having a strong foundation for French grammar and vocabulary. This class basically focuses on class discussions about different topics in French life and culture, ranging from politics to the environment. Our homework was substantial, with readings from the course Tyco packet, news clips online with questions, and a few movies throughout the semester (all great btw!). We would also have a list of vocab relevant to every unit, which wouldbe the basis of our four tests. It was a great class by itself, and taking it with Madame Schneider made it the best. She has a great personality and is really a great teacher. take this!",
    "This was a LOT of work. However, it taught me a tremendous amount of French culture and immensely improved my listening and speaking skills. I can't think of any weaknesses of the course, other than the fact that it was a lot of work. I felt like I was doing French 24\/7; initially, the homework took 5-6 hours every other day. The clips take 3 hours by themselves initially and eventually you are able to do them in 1-2 hours.Getting a good grade is reflective of how much time and effort you put into the assignments.Take this if you want to improve the fluidity of your speaking and ability to listen. During the first few weeks of the class, I could glean 80% of what Mme was saying. By the middle\/end, I could understand all of it."
