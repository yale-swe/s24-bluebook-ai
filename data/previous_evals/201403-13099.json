   "comments": [
    "A class that is really more like a crash course on educational philosophy than anything. I wasn't terribly interested in the course materials but I did learn a lot about educational ideologies, and I really enjoyed writing the research paper. If you take this, be prepared for lots of dense readings and discussions on this material every class.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is simple, fairly easy, and very intriguing. It is a great way to see where you are at in terms of your wiring abilities and your preparedness for college writing.",
    "ENGL 114 is a very helpful course for those looking to improve their academic writing, which is a skill that is essential in college. I would suggest taking it during freshman year itself, preferably fall semester, as it also counts as a writing credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all freshmen who have yet to write a college paper and to any upperclassmen who just want to improve their techniques and style. The reading isn't a lot and the papers are evenly spaced out. Overall, this was a really enjoyable class and I've learned a lot of new information that I can use in future classes (both writing and discussion based).",
    "If you have any interest in education and the readings of some of the greatest social critics, take the class.",
    "Very informative and engaging introductory writing course. I definitely recommend to students who want to get a feel for writing\/research at the collegiate level.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are looking to improve your academic writing skills. If you feel you have already mastered how to write a scholarly paper, this class might be a bit too structured for your taste."
