   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Math 115 for another student, with the warning that it is a lot of work and not to be undertaken with an already-burdened courseload.",
    "In this course, you watch videos that explain the next topic before class and answer a few (3-4) questions on the topic. Then, in class the professor reviews the video and the prep problems and goes into more depth on the topic with more example problems, sometimes on the blackboard and sometimes on a site called learning catlytics (students ring their own devices with internet access). There is a problem set due every week, 2 midterms and a final.",
    "The structure of this math course was unlike any other mathematics class that I have taken. There is a little bit more work than a traditional math class, and a lot of the work is done online. In total, this was a really great class, and it is set up in a way that makes it very difficult to fall behind. If you are taking Math 115, definitely take it with Professor Rolf!",
    "Tough course you have to work hard",
    "I would not recommend this class. If I hadn't taken Calculus BC in high school, it would have been very difficult to succeed. The professor did not teach very well and the material was rushed through, making the class not enjoyable.",
    "It was a good amount of work but managable",
    "I think most Yale students have to take math 115. It's an okay course. Take it if you have to. If you're really into math and calculus, you might enjoy it. I personally thought that it was an average math class, not too good, not too bad. Professor Rolf is great, though.",
    "I would recommend it, I enjoyed this class much better than Math 112 last semester.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 if one takes the class with one of the professors using the video technique. The videos made the class much more engaging and made the material far easier to grasp.",
    "Basically BC calc",
    "I'm not sure if I'd recommend it unless you absolutely need to take it because this class is no walk in the park. But with that said, the class has gotten a LOT better than in past years--especially if you have Rolf and your class is participating in the video lectures. Also, the practice tests are really helpful so use those to study for exams!",
    "MATH 115 is the continuation of calculus equivalent to Calc II, or AP Calc BC. It was a pretty challenging course as the material is not taught super well. Instructors tend to introduce very difficult concepts poorly, not outlining the necessary rules and facts that students need to understand in order to do well. In one word, the teaching could be described as VAGUE. The only reason I survived was by reading the textbook, which I didn't even catch onto doing until after the first midterm. To those looking to take this course, look to have a professor that can speak English and be prepared to self study. Understand the basic material backwards and forwards and you will be fine."
