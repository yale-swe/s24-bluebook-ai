    "French 140 is a good intermediate french class. I would recommend it if you've taken AP in high school but want to brush up on your grammar\/ speaking skills. The stories you read are not the most interesting, but they are fine. If you take advantage of the class and speak as much as possible, you will probably feel very comfortable with your language skills and go on to take advanced courses.",
    "Do not be afraid to take this class. It does mean work everyday, but should be very manageable. Just don't fall behind. Actually do the oral programs as they're very helpful. Taking it at 9:20 in the morning may actually be a good experience; it helps to get you up and going, but it can be rough.",
    "yes- improved my french",
    "Yes. Definitely worth it.",
    "take it with professor koundi",
    "French L4 is definitely less work than L3, and focuses more on class conversations than worksheets and handouts.",
    "Daily morning French grammar and exercises. That's pretty much it. The exams are always very easy and straightforward. If you stay on top of your work, you should do fine.",
    "A very hard and time consuming class. If you take it, take it with Koundi. She's really the best."
