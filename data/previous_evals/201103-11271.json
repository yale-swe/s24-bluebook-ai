   "comments": [
    "If we can form study group it will be much helpful. Professor may highly require students to do that.",
    "3. The out of class assignments were helpful, but needed to be clarified ahead of time. Professor Clark often added new exercises, which is fine, but she mentioned them briefly in passing during class and then did not sufficiently clarify to us what we needed to do and by when it was to be done.4. The journals were a lot of work. But, they were very valuable exercises.9. The guest lectures were invaluable- listening to practitioners discuss their work provided wonderful examples and also wonderful time to ask detailed questions.",
    "Outside speakers added a great deal of value to this course.",
    "It takes a long time to understand the course material, and more class discussion (versus lecture) would have helped. I give the course a 2 for being relevant and excellent because at the very end of the course, I really understood why the material was so valuable and meaningful. But it took the whole semester to understand that, and I wish I'd been able to appreciate the material more all along. Maybe more discussion or case studies might have helped? Also - it was veyr hard to move forward in the course without any specific feedback about our journals.",
    "Question 5: How responsive to student comments was the instructor? One-on-one, Prof. clark is extraordinarily responsive to student comments, questions, and concerns. The value of this responsiveness to students cannot be understated and is extremely rare. However, in class discussions, Prof. Clark is very different. I sensed that many students felt discouraged from speaking up in class because Prof. Clark did not provide enough time\/space for students to explain their thinking, before jumping in.",
    "The ratings are for the method of instruction, not the class so much itself. The course material by its very nature is difficult to clearly explain in a traditional classroom setting. However, it still could be more clearly taught.",
    "Susan is a great instructor with lots of experience and valuable advice. her course was a wonderful introduction to the policy science and its application in the real world. Both books used in class were very clear and easy to read. The additional readings every week were also very helpful to put the class material into context.One thing that I think could make the class topics clearer is more discussion in class. Susan could maybe expand a bit more on each aspect of the policy science to reinforce each week's readings, especially the decision making process.Jonathan is a Great TF always willing to help students and very knowledgeable as well. His great friendly attitude makes him very approachable and helpful."

   "comments": [
    "getting to write about a case i actually care about. the creativity we were given to apply the policy science framework to something we are really interested in.",
    "Susan's openness to having students drop in on her to talk. It's so nice to have a professor who tries her best to make herself available.",
    "The framework we learned in this class was the most valuable aspect of it. I enjoyed the class guests, especially Dave Mattson. The atmosphere in the class was also good; I liked getting to know some of the other students.",
    "1. Professor Clark is an engaging lecturer and she always asked pointed, well-thought-out questions that force you to think.2. The two textbooks were helpful and perfectly instep with the in class material.3. Researching my case was a very valuable experience and put me into contact with wonderful people who are doing great work.4. Hearing other students' presentations was very helpful and just downright fun as well- it is encouraging to hear other students' work.",
    "The discussions in class were very valuable.",
    "Very cool to take a course from the author of the course text. Susan has developed a framework that is really helpful for thinking about policy issues.",
    "I cannot think of a theoretical framework that will be more useful to me in my professional career than the policy sciences. This may be the best, most practical class I've taken in terms of a professional-oriented skill set.",
    "The best thing about this course was the inspiration students received to think carefully and critically about they way they view the world and how natural resource policy and management actually play out in the real world. A second strong element of this course was its immediate practicality and applicability to analyzing and solving real world problems.",
    "The outside speakers followed closely by student presentations.",
    "Introduction to the frameworj",
    "Readings and lectures really pushed the boundaries of my own knowledge and experience. Through this course, I feel like I have genuinely improved my analytical skills and my intellectual foundation.",
    "Provides a unique viewpoint that many people may find useful in their career and that would be hard to go through in another class.The book(s) are well written and addresses numerous relevant topics.",
    "Hard to pick but I really enjoyed the guests speakers.",
    "The best thing about this course was the overall takeaway of the Policy Process which I'll continue to use throughout my time at FES. Also, the chance to have speakers in to demonstrate how they use the Policy Process was very helpful and even inspirational."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "the \"exercises\" that susan gave out were very scattered and hard to discern from the jumble of other thoughts and \"things to consider\" that we were given each week. at the end of the course, when we were asked to hand them all in, i really had no idea whether i had done them or which of the things i had done were considered \"exercises.\" it was like trying to define that which has no definition.",
    "A little more student-student discussion might make the course work better. I was expecting a seminar style class and it was much more like a small lecture. This isn't necessarily bad, but some more moderated discussion would have added to the course, I believe. The room wasn't very set up for that, however.",
    "1. Clarification of expectations in terms of assignments. Professor Clark needs to better clarify what she expects and when she expects it. for example, in the last week of classes we were unexpectedly asked to put together a number of documents. They were easy to do, but i would have appreciated forewarning.2. It would be nice to require a draft of the final paper, perhaps before thanksgiving break. This would allow for some structured feedback. I felt that we did not get much in terms of written feedback on our work during the course of the course.3. The structure of class discussion- occasionally, the comments from one or two students were allowed to dominate the session.I thought that they were often inappropriate and I would have appreciated more active guidance of the discussion ( ie- what is and what is not appropriate) during the discussions.",
    "The readings and assignments were reasonable, but often they didn't run on time with what we were doing in class. I think it would either be better to have fewer assignments and be able to touch on them in class, or to make sure that we have time to cover everything that we need to cover. With that said, having time for class discussion is valuable, and was probably the reason for the overrun most of the time.",
    "The professor could give more personalized feedback on journals and assignments throughout the term.",
    "The course started off great, but in the latter half sort of crumbled under the weight of its own ambition. I felt like it tried to do a little too much, from looking the basics behind the policy sciences, too the psychology\/philosophy behind it, and then to applying it. Ideally, this class could be broken down into several semesters, where the philosophy is first taught, followed by the framework and then application.",
    "The class asked a lot of good questions, but the readings+assignments+Susan did not provide any adequate answers. The material was too idealistic and too fluffy and it was incredibly repetitive. This class lacks true substance.",
    "The linkages between the assignments and the course readings and lectures could be made more concrete.",
    "Written feedback from the instructor (the open invitation to see the instructor\/TA was great, but written feedback would also be helpful).",
    "In class discussions need to be more open and inclusive. Readings need to be trimmed down a bit and then actually discussed in detail in class--more like a seminar.",
    "The pace could have been a bit quicker, and it would have helped if homework assignments were discussed more in class.",
    "I have several suggestions, each listed as a separate paragraph:Consider having only a few of the case studies as a required reading PDF, instead of requiring students to buy the second, case studies, book.Use a more detailed syllabus and put all assignments in the syllabus (some were assigned throughout the semester and were not listed in the syllabus).More organization in general: e.g. instead of asking for a list of all the exercises that have been completed by students, a list of all exercises could be given and we could fill out a description under the ones actually completed.Unsure of the details, but consider reorganizing all class lectures. Currently they seem very disorganized (more of conversation than presenting information). This makes sense considering the nature of the subject, but also made it difficult to get much out of the class time as it lacked focus. Again, the book was good, but the teaching style was hard to follow.Use classes v2 for uploads of journals. I found it hard to organize materials when receiving an email every week and having to send another email back. It seems easier to have everything uploaded on Classes v2.",
    "More discussion on the decision making process.",
    "I think this course could use a little improvement on its organization. There was some confusion on what was actually an assignment at time rather than a recommendation. Also, some feedback on journals would be helpful to help the development of our thought."

   "comments": [
    "susan is an amazingly available professor. i met with her fairly regularly to talk about my research paper and presentation, and each time she was willing to spend at least an hour chatting about it. she was also very responsive to journal entries that we submitted, and was happy to meet to talk about what we had written or to talk about things we were having trouble understanding.",
    "I contacted the instructor for help, and she was extremely available and able. If I asked to meet, she almost always could within a week and many times within a day. She was willing to spend significant amounts of time working through my project and always very helpful. The most accessible professor I've had here.",
    "Both were extremely helpful and always available. Jon was especially available and helpful.",
    "Susan and Jon were very clear about encouraging us to speak with them outside of class, which was appreciated.",
    "Professor and TA were available to meet. Assistance from the professor was often vague, but that is her style as she likes to let students work through their own knowledge gaps.",
    "Awesome. Susan and Jon were the most helpful team I worked with this semester. Susan is one of the most invested professors in students that I've seen at Yale.",
    "Both the instructor and the TA were always available for help whenever I needed it and constantly welcomed any comments or feedback.",
    "Both were extremely available and provided excellent guidance.",
    "Very available and high quality.",
    "Susan Clark went far above and beyond to meet with students, about the class or just about questions and comments in general. Meeting with her one on one made a huge difference and probably was the biggest impact of taking the course. The TA was available when needed.",
    "It was difficult to meet with the instructor at times due to her busy schedule. However, she generally was able to make time within one week. One on one help was very useful from both the instructor and TA.One suggestion is for less interruptions. I found the instructor to frequently interject in guest lectures or students' discussions. Also, more feedback on journal entries and other assignments would be useful to students.Instructor is good one on one. However, she needs to focus on her teaching style and presentation. Taking this class was not so much frustrating due to the new material, but rather the presentation style and lack of organization.",
    "EXCELLENT! Susan's open door policy is amazing. I always felt very comfortable talking to her about anything class related and other.Similarly with Jonathan. Both Susan and Jon were always happy to answer questions and guide you in the right direction."

    "my work will necessarily involve interfacing with lots of different people, and susan teaches people how to deal with that kind of work effectively.",
    "My concentration is natural resource policy, so this course fit perfectly into it. It taught me a new strategy for approaching resource problems. Previously I had a sampling of many different disciplines, and this one brought things all together. Great as a capstone class.",
    "This course provides an excellent framework for analyzing policy issues- especially with regard to the people involved. As a future natural resource manager, i appreciate this class immensely and wish I had taken it my first year.",
    "This was a different kind of social sciences course than what I had taken in the past, and no other course talked about policy sciences or thinking critically about problem solving. I think it would work well as a regular foundations course.",
    "The material covered in this course is useful to people in most fields.",
    "It does not fit into my overall program; I did not gain anything from this class.",
    "I feel this course will play a very central role in my overall program by establishing a framework to guide my critical thinking and problem solving endeavors.",
    "Learning about interdisciplinarity through the policy science is a key aspect of my studies at F&ES. I would like pursue a career in environmental policy and governance taking an interdisciplinary approach to hopefully have a comprehensive understanding of the issues. Susan's course definitely introduces this notion well."

    "I wanted exposure to the policy sciences framework and I wanted the opportunity to work specifically on a case for a long time. I really enjoyed working slowly and methodically on my cases and having time to really reflect and chew on things for a while.",
    "This course was very different from all the courses offered this semester. I appreciated that Susan consistently made an effort to get to know students, it wasn't only about the course, but also about personal development. I also appreciated the problem-solving\/policy sciences aspect of it because I was looking for real \"tools\" for environmental management.",
    "The policy sciences seemed like a really interesting subject, but I took nothing useful away from the class.",
    "I took this course because I found strictly science-based approaches to be lacking as problem solving tools and I wanted to learn a more integrated and interdisciplinary approach for understanding the myriad messy and socially-rooted environmental problems that exist.",

    "Be honest and open-minded.",
    "Just be aware that Susan doesn't teach in a linear fashion. She gives you a bunch of information, handouts, and readings, but if you're a linear process thinker, it takes some work to put it all together. You can feel like the same thing has been given to you in four different ways, which can be good is difficult for thinkers like me. Talk to Susan about it, though; she helped me figure out a way to approach my project in a way that worked for me.",
    "Go visit with Susan as much as possible- she is a wonderful and insightful resource. She asks tough questions, but they are always to the point and reflect a lot of thinking on her part.",
    "If you are a social sciences person, or if you are used to abstract, philosophical or theory based thinking, this class will be comfortable for you. If you are more of a natural sciences person, it will be a more radical departure from what you are used to. With that said, I think anyone can benefit from the course regardless of their background. It is the kind of course that you have to put a lot in to get a lot out. Some people were very \"into it\" during class, and other people sat in the back and barely contributed.",

However, the class as it currently is hard to follow. Taking this class was not so much frustrating due to the new material, but rather the presentation style and lack of organization. I would recommend sitting in on the first classes and see if it fits your learning style. If not, buy the book and read it instead of taking the class.",
    "Start your paper early- Throughout November if possible. Definitely do your readings every week specially the handbook and at least a few of the papers assigned. Talk to Susan throughout the semester about your paper topic, the class, and in general your experience at Yale."
