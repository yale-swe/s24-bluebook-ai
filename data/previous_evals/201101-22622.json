    "French 160 gives you a chance to improve your conversational skills (and actually, also your writing skills, since you usually turn in a short written assignment per class) while learning about and discussing interesting aspects of life in contemporary France. The course is organized around various units: from the different regions and languages\/dialects of France to the education system to work and the family to immigration to the environment. I found these units all fascinating and the material we read drew from both a textbook and newspaper articles and film clips. Our class was only 5 people this year, which was especially good from the standpoint of having to participate and gain confidence in speaking \u0097 I'm not sure if I would have gotten as much out of it if we'd had more people. There is a fair amount of work expected of you, and you have to do all the readings to be prepared for class discussion, but it never felt like a burden. I genuinely enjoyed going to this class each MWF, and I'm sad that it's over!",
    "Really good course concerning contemporary topics in France. You learn about cultural things such as religion, family\/homosexuality, education and work, insurance, the environment, immigration. The emphasis is on improving conversation and acquiring new vocabulary but there is a lot of audio clip-related writing and appx 700 word \"essays.\" There is an oral and an audio exam as your \"final\" as well as an oral class presentation.This course was very very useful and interesting. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class (and take it with Mme Schneider)! You meet three times a week to discuss interesting readings andmovies about contemporary French culture, government, and society. Every week you will have short writing assignments, be it writing short essays using new vocab or answering short questions about video clips. There are four vocab quizzes in which you must memorize 40 words from a larger list and then use them in 2 in class essays. You also will have two oral exams on topics that are given both in advance and on the spot. You also will do a presentation on a topic relating to contemporary French society. The work is challenging, but the topics you study are legitimately interesting and your French will improve tremendously. Class discussion is a lot of fun and Mme Schneider does a great job of making sure that everyone speaks and that no one dominates class time. Overall, one of the most fun classes I've taken at Yale and I am now extremely confident about my French.",
    "The little assignments every week get to be a bit annoying, but the material is always interesting.",
    "Yes, this course was very helpful and greatly improved my speaking. Since there were only four other students in the class, we all had to speak a great deal. Schneider was great \u0096 a dynamic discussion leader and very invested in the progress of her students. The topic of the course \u0096 French culture \u0096 was also very interesting."
