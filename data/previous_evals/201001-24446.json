   "comments": [
    "Make sure you like 18th c literature, which is a very certain type of novels--but it makes a good pre-1800 and is a useful introduction to the foundations of the novel tradition. Plus, Miller is great.",
    "A solid (but not extraordinary) class that primarily covers novels, with a small amount of poetry sprinkled in as an afterthought. Heavy on reading workloads, though lighter on actual written work, if you like eighteenth-century literature I would recommend this class - but if you don't, trying to force your way through the hundreds of pages for each class isn't worth it.",
    "This is a wonderful seminar. I really enjoyed the material. I would take it again in a heartbeat.Take it if you are interested in, well, reading a lot of eighteenth-century British fiction. I thought it was all worthwhile. I especially enjoyed Pamela, somewhat to my surprise.",
    "Well, Professor Miller is leaving, so this question is somewhat irrelevant. I wish it weren't.",
    "The class looks at different novels over the course of the 18th century with some contemporary poetry thrown in. Not much time is spent on poetry. I would definitely recommend this to another student, especially an English major who does not want to take Shakespeare for a pre-1800.",
    "A solid course. Some of the novels are a slog, but many of them are really strange and wonderful. Possibly one of the best ways to fulfill a pre-1800 requirement.",
    "It's pretty much what the course title says. You read a bunch of eighteenth century British novels and a few poems and discuss them.",
    "Surprisingly funny, enjoyable books that I am very glad to have read."
