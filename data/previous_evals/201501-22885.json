    "Professor Rolf is quite good, sort of how I'd imagine Michael Herbert's dad. Very engaging. Franco Munoz gave students courteous, helpful, and charitable engagements with the mathematics questions they posed. He kept students at ease, which appeared to help for the subject. His humorous readings of comments each class helped motivate a few of us to overcome tiredness and morning-practice fatigue for 9am class.",
    "This class really sucks. Don't take it unless you have to and if you do take it try to take easy classes in the same semester. Tests are hard though they post previous semesters' tests that are very similar to the midterms. There's homework for every class that is pretty frustrating on some nights.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to do the work outside of class necessary to succeed. P sets generally have two or three problems that are very challenging, and it is critical that you actually READ THE TEXTBOOK. Each section in the book is not that long, and it is really where you will learn the material. I saw a vast improvement in my understanding when I started reading it halfway through the semester. Also, students in the class have a range of background knowledge. I hadn't done much integral calc before and was scared at first when I realized that there were kids who had taken BC Calc junior year of high school. If you are willing to stay the course, it is doable, and ultimately worth it.",
    "Great math class, especially with Franco. Many may want to take Rolfe, but Franco is just as good if not better. The integration of the video lessons made it a point to understand the material before coming to class, so the overall understanding of material was not hard to achieve. Must take for math majors obviously, but this was by far better taught and interesting than 112.",
    "I would summarize Math 115 as a very difficult experience that I wouldn't recommend to another student. This class doesn't seem to me to be suited for non-STEM students. I thought that the material itself was fine it was just that the instructors unwisely chose to choose problems based on the material that were simply too difficult (especially on the problem sets). I also detested the addition of the prep problems, which just provided me with additional work and didn't aid my overall understanding.",
    "I came in having done the equivalent of 112 in High School - two and a half years ago. Math was never my strong point. You catch up pretty quickly though. But expect to be putting in 6+ hours a week into it if you're coming without a fresh 112 background, esp. near the beginning of the course. The class moves very quickly and is relentless with its flip classroom model, but it works - you do learn more because it forces you to be in contact with the material at least a few times a week. No chance to slack off. It's intense but it's good. If you're looking for proof based, this is not it. It's very mechanical doing problems based.",
    "Extremely disappointing in my opinion. It was horribly difficult to learn the material in the flipped classroom setting, and I've already learned this material in Calc ABC in high school. Despite that, I was still completely lost on several concepts The emphasis on memorization of formulas and theories, rather than application, seems wrong. Several times during the midterms I was completely lost on how to go at a question because I just couldn't remember the exact formula. I knew how to go at a question, sure, but that was useless to me since I couldn't remember the formula. Outside of midterms, in the real world, we will never be without the ability to look up the exact notation of an equation - that's not the focus. The important skill is the *application* of the equation and how to manipulate it to fit various real-world settings. I felt like the manipulation aspect was severely lacking from this course. Overall, I certainly cannot say that I would recommend this to anyone. Seriously. If you don't need to take this course, don't. Take intro to stats: a much more useful math course for most STEM, Econ, or Poly Sci majors. Until they revise the flipped classroom format, I can't see anyone benefiting from this class.",
    "Math 115 is a solid intro calculus course (the equivalent of BC calc in high school). The class is taught in an inverted way, meaning that all the students watch a video and do online prep problems before coming to class. I was a fan of the system because I really enjoyed being able to watch\/replay the videos at my own pace. It kept me up to speed so that I didn't fall behind on the material. I would recommend it to anybody looking to round out their understanding of single-variable calculus.",
    "For a class that most people take only because they have to, its not that bad. The classroom is flipped, so that new material is introduced with online videos, and practice problems are done in class. This is more work, but it really helped me, because it made me think about math 6 days a week, and because I could pause the videos, or watch them again later.",
    "Take only if required.",
    "In comparison to MATH 112 (if previously taken), MATH 115 is far more self-driven. You will have to put in quite a good deal of time learning the information yourself and using outside resources such as going to reviews, office hours, and possibly using a tutor if that helps you. Otherwise, it will be a very difficult semester for you.",
    "I would not recommend the course to a student unless s\/he needs the course as a part of a major.",
    "The course is set up with video lectures and prep problems due before class and questions answered in class, a sort of backwards classroom. The material is equivalent to a BC Calc course. Occasionally the problem sets and exam questions are more difficult than the material presented in class, which can be a bit of a headache to figure out. The basic concepts are taught well, but problem sets usually require further applications of the material. There are many options for extra tutoring help and I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in mathematics, especially integrals and series."
