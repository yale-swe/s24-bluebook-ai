    "AMAZING",
    "TAKE THIS! I absolutely loved this course. Gaddis was great, my T.A. was awesome, the lectures were fascinating, I learned a lot, and the work load wasn't horrible.",
    "Not worth it. Just read Gaddis's book and watch the documentary.",
    "AMAZING CLASS. TAKE IT NOW.",
    "I would!! I believe that the Cold War history is significant for anyone to understand our world as it is today, and this class provides a comprehensive syllabus for it.",
    "Amazing class with an amazing professor. One of the classes you must take at Yale. Some people complain that there are too many videos, and that is true for some lectures, but anytime Gaddis opens his mouth, he has a great anecdote to share bringing laughter to the class and many of his lecture ended with a clapping audience.",
    "Its an interesing class but not \"a must take\", like I read. If you need a HU credit and aren't a humanities person its a good option.",
    "I went into this course under the impression that it was one of the must-takes at Yale; I was not disappointed. Although at times I did wish the course was based less off of the videos and more with Gaddis's lectures, it was still an enjoyable and engaging lecture. The workload is manageable, but it is essential that you read the assigned readings for section and the tests.",
    "Incredible class. It truly lived up to the hype, Gaddis in particular. A shame it's not being taught next year. One problem is that there was so much reading that I barely bothered to do it, and I would be more inclined to do it if it was a more managable amount. Still a must take course before you graduate.",
    "Yes. A MUST take class.",
    "good class. take it credit D unless you plan on reading tons, or have good notes on the readings as the tests are hard and a lot is from the readings. papers graded pretty favorably though.",
    "I would clearly say that this, with Civil War, is a class that you have to take at Yale. Not only are you surrounded by hundreds of eager students in lecture every week, but it is an interesting topic and is pertinent to today's society as well. Definitely take this class with Intro to International Relations, as the Cold War is an awesome way to see the theories of IR played out.",
    "YES!!",
    "Didn't live up to the hype.",
    "Basically, you watch the documentary Gaddis worked on (though he does do some independent lecturing), and you're supposed to read about 1900 pages worth of books.Don't bother taking the class, you'd get the same experience by watching the documentary and reading his book on your own time. Don't waste one of your classes at Yale with this one.",
    "I would definitely recommend Cold War to another student. A must-take class at Yale. Great lectures and interesting material.",
    "I would recommend it if prof. gaddis is teaching it.",
    "Best part of the semester: when we talked about Stalin's death. Apparently he purged his own medical staff, claiming they were jews and saboteurs. Weeks later he suffered a stroke and, guess what, nobody could treat him. So he died.Then Gaddis offered an alternative explanation: they found rat poison in his stomach, which was \"clearly something he was not supposed to be eating.\"If you don't take this class, you are a fool.",
    "This class will teach you everything you ever wanted to know about the Cold War, which affected way more than you'd think between 1945-1989. A lot of reading, but worth it. TAKE IT.",
    "The most interesting class I took this semester. It sounds like just another dull history class, but as I'm sure you'll all know by reading these reviews, Professor Gaddis makes it a really enjoyable experience. He is one of the top Cold War historians, and he knows every little interesting detail to share with students. Hands down the best lecture I've taken here, absolutely recommended.",
    "Essential before you graduate. Be prepared to work hard, but well worth it. Probably the most I've ever taken away from a single course.",
    "Great course on the cold war, take it.",
    "Great class, test are not easy, but are doable",
    "you have to take it. it's a classic",
    "OVERRATED CLASS. not a must-take at all. only the \"IR-crowd\" (i.e. annoying people) dig this class. learnt no \"big ideas\" i didn't know from before. gaddis has remarkably few original comments, and few interesting claims to make in class--",
    "Yes highly!",
    "Uh, it\u0092s Gaddis. Perhaps it\u0092ll be less militant after his sabbatical? I doubt it. I\u0092m sure this class was much more fun when the Pundits came, but class is entirely a script and over 64% videos. There\u0092s also a ton of reading that isn\u0092t particularly enchanting.",
    "This is a must-take class, enough said.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone - history major or not. This class is a great overview of the conflict and an engaging way to learn about this extremely important event in US history.",
    "Yeah, overall it's pretty good.",
    "Great class. Gaddis is a true expert, and his insight is very impressive.",
    "I would recommend it, but just know that the course has a strong emphasis on the political history of the Cold War (US foreign policy mainly), but not much on other issues...It is inevitable I guess in an American school, but the history is from an American perspective, which may anger some students at some points in the course..Lectures are great, well-done, but the videos take up about ~80% of the time. Doc is fun to watch, but it might have been better if doc watching was assigned as homework (like reading), and if Gaddis could deliver more of analysis and thought provoking issues during the class....Because lectures were devoted mainly to watching documentary, I feel like the course did not exploit the fact that the professor is such a famous name in the field...I don't feel like the course was in any way \"special,\" \"must-take\" Yale experience.... I think (and I surely hope) that there are more mind blowing history courses at Yale....",
    "Classic Yale course. The topic is fascinating, but Gaddis uses far too many videos.",
    "Take this class. I know you read that a lot, and I've taken my fair share of disappointing must-takes, but Cold War really is an incredible class. Between Gaddis's lectures and the film clips that he shows, class is always interesting. There is a lot of reading, but make a study group and you'll be fine. Other than that there is one paper, a midterm, and a final. More work than some other history classes, but definitely worth it.",
    "Gaddis is not God's greatest gift to lecturers, but he seems to know it, and he usually does well at maintaining his flow as he integrates clips from a documentary he helped produce. (Warning: take notes with pen and paper. If you bring a laptop, the combination of computer screen and documentary will put you to sleep.) The books covered satisfyingly different areas of the Cold War (but avoid reading L\u00fcthi; you'll get nothing out of it), Suri's dissertation on the sixties is particularly coherent and actually enjoyable. You probably won't findthis comprehensive a course on the Cold War anywhere else.",
    "A very interesting course if you like this part of world history. Gaddis is a very interesting lecturer and gives his own unique point of view on the Cold War. There is not a whole lot of work but you have to keep up on all the work because the exams and paper are not easy.",
    "Its a really really interesting subject. Lectures are definitely interesting to go to. There is a lot of reading (sometimes 300 pages a week)but it is very interesting. If you are interested at all in any topic possibly included in the Cold War, definitely think about taking this class!! I loved it.",
    "Yes.",
    "This course is a mixed bag. The video footage is phenomenal, the material essential and poignant. That said, it's administratively awful. First, you get very little John Gaddis bang for your buck-- shopping lectures regardless, the course is basically video-watching narrated by Gaddis. Second, there's so much more reading than anyone can do that it makes the whole class into a joke. But the videos will make shivers run through your spine. This is essential history, history leading up to the doorstep of your own lifetime.",
    "Gaddis won't be teaching this next year, but if you get a chance TAKE IT. One of the actually good legendary courses. Gaddis is a great lecturer and you leave with a thorough knowledge of the Cold War, which shapes your world in ways you don't even realize. Lots of reading, lots of video clips, low stress.",
    "Great classic Yale course, too bad Gaddis isn't teaching it next year.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot in Cold War. Gaddis shows interesting clips of his documentary during lecture, and I think that both helps you learn and maintain interest through the hour+.That said, the class covers the big events and trends of the era, and doesn't go into a lot of detail about any particular topic; so if you know this stuff, look for another course.There is a lot of reading, but honestly you don't need to do all of it. Just skim over it to learn the terms before exams (Gaddis takes almost all the IDs from the reading) and you'll be fine. The essay portion of the exams is really straightforward as long as you've been going to class.",
    "A great class for those looking for an introduction to history at Yale. Would recommend it to those majoring in anything, one of the must take classes here.",
    "Very good course. Heavy on the reading if you do all of it, but who does, honestly? If you know how to read what's important and skip what's not, this course is perfect. If you don't, this might be a good chance to learn how. Lectures are amazing, and the videos really add to the classes. Very important, relevant, and downright interesting material. Why not take this class?",
    "Cold War is a fascinating class that everyone should take, really important as well. I was a bit disappointed that Gaddis relied so much on videos given how good a lecturer he is but still well worth it. Definitely take advantage of his \"ask him to lunch\" opportunity, I didn't and should have- fascinating guy.",
    "You can't take Cold War next year, but take it the year after if you can.",
    "Yes. It's not an easy course and studying for the midterm\/final will be really time-consuming. But it's worth it for all the incredibly important information that you will learn and for Gaddis' lectures.",
    "Good class. the CW shaped the 21st century so for anyone who wants a good world understanding (should be everyone) you should take this class",
    "Worth taking, but not a really great class.",
    "YES! This course is unbelievable, especially if you do the reading and go to lecture!",
    "I would recommend this course -if you're a senior take it Credit\/D, it's a fun course",
    "A great course - incredible professor, fascinating course material and you come out feeling you've learned alot!",
    "Cold War is as good as the hype. Excellent lectures, great TAs, interesting paper topics. The reading is, however, pretty lengthy. Take it if you get the chance.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Truly interesting and exciting. I wanted to go to class every day.",
    "You really shouldn't take this unless you have a particular interest in the Cold War and also don't know anything about it. The history presented in lecture is not particularly enthralling or dense. And the video thing is a real problem. I understand that Gaddis was involved in the making of these videos, but there were times when it seemed like he barely spoke other than to introduce clips that often said the same thing he could have but in an English accent. It is nice to hear his slightly more conservative than the average professorperspective, but even that isn't really developed beyond a passionate love for Ronald Reagan. Basically, if you want to really learn about the Cold War, read Gaddis' book about strategy and take a class or two on modern Eastern Europe or perhaps China. But this class is undeserving of all the hype.",
    "A comprehensive and full history of United States foreign policy during the 20th century. I would very highly recommend it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN. Gaddis is amazing. He is such a riveting lecturer and he gets so much information across in such a small amount of time. I looked forward to going to lecture every week. It really is a shame that he might not teach this class again. This has been by far my favorite class at Yale. It is a lot of reading, but other than that there is only one paper, one midterm, and one exam. They are all extremely manageable if you put in the effort. And you will want to b\/c the material covered is so interesting!",
    "Good class. Gaddis is a good lecturer. Good for filling in gaps in your knowledge of late 20th century international history.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "a must take while you're at yale",
    "If J Gad teaches this again, take it.",
    "Great class - everyone, even non history majors should take this class. you learn so much",
    "You learn everything there is to know about the cold war. its a lot of reading but the course is worth it if you have any interest in history, the cold war, or current international relations",
    "i would. but only if you have time for the reading.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Cold War. It is one of the best classes at Yale, if not the best. Professor Gaddis has one of the most effective lecturing methods, utilizing videos and images to provide a fascinating portrayal of the Cold War. It's a lot of reading, but it's more than worth it. You won't be unsatisfied.",
    "This course provides an excellent understanding of both the intricate details of the Cold War as well as our current international system. It essentially consists of a huge lecture with a very engaging professor and lots of movies, a ton of reading that is oftentimes dense and difficult to get through, and section. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Cold War is a fast, in depth look at relations between the Soviet Union and the United State during the Cold War. I would absolutely recommend the class because if you're interested in history, you'll find it fascinating and you'll learn a lot.",
    "It is Cold War history. I would recommend it if you are going to be a history major--it is great. Keep in mind, though, for the IDs on the midterm and final--they tend to be a bit obscure. They are not the main IDs that you would think are more important. He makes sure you know even little important things.",
    "Very good class. Be warned that the exams will test you on obscure events from the readings which is annoying in one sense but good in making you do the readings.",
    "It is a history of the Cold War, relying on documentary video and Professor Gaddis's expertise. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "The history of the world, especially the US, the USSR, and China, following World War II. Yes I would recommend this course. It just covers so much interesting and important world history.",
    "It doesn't matter who you are or what major you're studying - take. this. class. Fifty years from now, this is one of the few courses I'll still remember. Gaddis is just incredible; lectures are fascinating and engaging, each and every week. He truly knows how to make history come alive.",
    "This was a good class, but only take it if you're interested in the material. You are not going to miss some fundamental Yale experience if you don't take this class, unless you are definitely going to get a kick out of a whole lot of history, and a lot of reading.",
    "There are so many amazing history classes at Yale that taking Cold War is just a waste.",
    "It's pretty good. Slightly over hyped. If you're into history, I'd say there are better lectures.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT. Cold War is among the best classes at Yale. Gaddis is wonderful and the history is so important and relevant. Exams can be a bit tricky--Gaddis picks pretttttyyyy obscure IDs.",
    "Definitely take it, the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "From my understanding, it won't be offered again in the near future.However, if you ever do get the chance, shop it, and take it.Although heavily video-based, this lecture is sure to be one of the best classics offered at Yale, coming from a preeminent expert.Workload:-Mandatory section, may have reading responses each week depending on TA-One paper (not that bad at all)-Midterm + Final; about 5 IDs of key players and events, and a general essay.-Reading assignments are not 'light,' but they are very interesting.",
    "An essential Yale course. Don't graduate without it. It will help fit together all the pieces of everything else you've learned or will learn about the 20th century. Plus, everyone loves movie clips.",
    "Cold War is a must-take class at Yale. To understand contemporary society and politics, for major or pleasure, understanding the Cold War is imperative. And there is no better person to learn from than John Gaddis. The readings can be heavy, be most are interesting.",
    "Although they are not going to offer Cold War next year, the class was very interesting and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the time period or just history generally. The lecture was very based on videos, so do not take the class just to hear Professor Gaddis.",
    "COLD WAR IS AWESOME. Make sure you take this class before you graduate.",
    "Take this class if you want to understand the modern world.",
    "I recommend this course only if you are already into the Cold War. Very boring if uninterested in the political machinations of old, often dead, white men. Lecture is good, but the readings are awful and there is rather a lot to get through.",
    "THIS CLASS IS NOT WORTH THE HYPE. It should be in the Film Studies department, because you end up spending upwards of 50 minute of some classes watching the CNN Cold War documentary while Gaddis makes a few quick comments in between video clips. There is a ridiculous amount of reading which no one does and the identifications on the tests are very obscure and the tests are excruciatingly painful to prepare for. AVOID!",
    "yes, every American should take",
    "YES!! Phenomenal class. I took it Cr\/D\/F, which wasn't even really necessary, as the tests\/paper are not all that hard. Even if you aren't going to do all the reading (I certainly didn't) do yourself a favor and go to all the lectures. Gaddis is a phenomenal lecturer. I always really appreciated Gaddis' organization, and the way that he transitionted throughout his lectures. I actually really enjoyed watching the movies as well - I thought they were a nice addition to a 1hr 15 min lecture. I also really loved when he brought up personal experiences - it was a reminder that heis truly integrated in the history that he is telling. You MUST take this class before you graduate. Best lecture I've taken at Yale.",
    "This class is a must. If you can take it, take it. First off, Gaddis is the most amazing professor you will ever have at Yale or anywhere else. His lectures are incredibly engaging, and his use of video to supplement his lectures is awesome. Second, the material is awesome. The Cold War is such an interesting subject. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Yes, definitely take this course!!",
    "I would take it. It's a fascinating topic taught by one of the leading Cold War experts in the world. It is true that there is perhaps an over-reliance on videos in class, but the pros of the class definitely outweigh the cons.",
    "Take this class if you are even remotely interested in this topic - it will be worth your while.",
    "I would summarize it as the perfect way to get a background on world events after WWII, not just in the US an USSR. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Must take class. Gaddis is incredible.",
    "This course is not close to as good as people say it is. Feel free to shop it, but don't take it just because everyone else seems to. I took it because I am a history major who never took a course on diplomatic history. As far as my feelings of the course: It is a triumphalist one which glorifies the United States during a period of time in which it was just as terrible as the USSR in committing or sanctioning atrocities in the Third World. Yet, this course rarely discusses the US's problems and mistakes in the Third World and instead discusses those of the Soviet Union. When Prof. Gaddis does discuss the US and the Third World, he more often than not apologizes for the heinous crimes committed by brutal U.S.-backed dictators (such as implying that Chile is better off because of Pinochet). Moreover, the course makes moralistic determinations which compromise learning. For instance, how can one adequately learn about Mao when the professor is constantly calling all of his decisions childish and evil. There is more to history than that. If the course is truly a diplomatic history course (which it is supposed to be) then Prof. Gaddis should not make such moralistic determinations. Also, keep in mind that the professor only lectures for about 20-30 minutes a class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It was easily the best class I've ever taken at Yale. Gaddis is incredibly interesting, the workload is not terrible, and the books are actually interesting. Anybody remotely interested in either history or political science should consider taking this course.",
    "Cold War was an awesome class, really interesting take on the time period. I'd recommend it for sure.",
    "It was a lot of work, but totally worth it because of Gaddis and I had never taken a class on the Cold War, so I came away with a great understanding of what happened during that 45 year time period.",
    "it's a really great course. i would recommend it to everyone who is thinking about it. there's a ton of reading, really too much to be done, but you can get by without doing all of it as long as you've got notes. the material is fascinating and really relevant, and reviewing for the final made me really glad to know this material.",
    "It is a great overview of an interesting era.",
    "It's a good lecture course, but it's not the spectacular, life-changing class that its reputation claims it to be. If you're interested in this part of history, take it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The impact of Cold War is still in current politics and people's everyday life.",
    "YES but way too much reading. Actually you don't really need to read all of it.",
    "Yes, take it if you're interested at all in the history of the world in the second half of the 20th century!I am wiser for having taken it.",
    "Take it. Gaddis is wonderful, and he'll make a very complicated time much clearer than you would expect. Don't worry about doing all of the reading (or even doing a fraction of it) - the lectures give you what you need to know. Pay attention in class and you'll be all set, and you'll have the privilege of learning about the Cold War from the man who knows as much about it as anyone, alive or dead.",
    "Definitely - if Professor Gaddis teaches it again. This is a classic Yale course and one of the best that I've taken here.",
    "Great lectures, but a lot of dense reading, some of which even the TFs won't touch . Huge insecurity over exams. Take it c\/d\/f or audit it.",
    "great. take it",
    "Take it!",
    "YES! Take it as long as Gaddis is still teaching it.",
    "Yes! Although it's not being taught. Prof Gaddis is a great lecturer, and his book is really well-written and fascinating. Watch out for the influence of his politics, though---his political leanings enter the course very slightly but certainly have their effect.",
    "Take it. Gaddis is the man. Go to lecture and try to do the reading at some point. You'll feel like you're getting your money's worth out of your tuition.",
    "Overall a great class. The course manages to combine local details with general themes in an unusually effective manner. Class is almost never boring, even though it is about something that most of the students are fairly familiar with.",
    "The course is fantastic. It is fun and thorough, and one that you will look forward to attending. Professor Gaddis is brilliant, funny and helpful. Accept his offers for lunch and make use of his office hours. The course's strengths are that it reinforces the narrative of lectures and readings with the interesting and informative narrative of videos; that it covers a wide variety of events -- the Space Race, Civil Rights Movement, Hippy Movement, the arms race, strategy, leadership and appearances -- as fascinating causes\/consequences of the Cold War; and that it is taught by the 'Dean of Cold War studies.'Take it! It will help you no matter what your major is.",
    "Cold War is an excellent class. If anything, it helps you understand what your parents have been talking about for the past twenty years. The lectures are almost entirely composed of video, but the documentary was made by Gaddis so I guess it works. Pretty heavy reading but other work not too bad.",
    "If it's offered again, definitely take it. the material is incredibly relevant to the world today, and every lecture was fascinating. I took it credit D, so i can't complain about the workload at all, but it really didn't seem too bad.",
    "Cold War is not as great as its supposed to be. This class has been on my MUST TAKE list since coming to Yale and it was disappointed. The course should really be called \"THE HISTORY OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD BETWEEN 1945-1991\" because that's exactly what it is. The topic is way too broad, the reading load is way too heavy and the lectures are wayyyyy too video heavy. Take it if you love the topic, but if you're just taking it because its a \"MUST TAKE,\" I'd pass.",
    "Absolutely take it. I have little to add that haven't already been discussed ad nauseum in previous years' evaluations, but very quickly: it is fantastic to have a professor who was so heavily involved in unearthing\/shaping the history that he now teaches, and I have never had a lecturer who would get sporadic applause at the end of random classes, just because he was such a tour-de-force every week.",
    "Take it! Really tough but really rewarding.",
    "Cold War is undoubtedly the best class I have taken at Yale. Don't be scared by the size; the sections really break it down and are led by excellent TAs. Gaddis is a great lecturer who weaves his commentary with that of two documentaries, and as the foremost Cold War historian, has much to bring to each class meeting that you will find in no reading or other source. A note of warning: there is a lot of reading each week, and be prepared to do it all. But each book fulfills its niche in the class's analysis of the Cold War; I loved each and every one of them. It is hard to not be sucked into enjoying and learning a lot in this class.",
    "Interesting lectures and very thoughtful for a survey course, with good TAs. It's difficult to keep on top of the readings for a week, but go to every lecture and you'll be fine with a couple hours of skimming and familiarization. If you let it slide completely, it will be hard to catch back up. Exams are mostly fair, though some terms may trip you up.",
    "I recommend it. But not as intensely as some. It's a solid course. But it is a lot of material to cover. The exam is pretty stressful, not because it is actually that difficult, but because there are so many possible ids Gaddis could choose. You don't have to do much of the reading during the course but by exam time you wish you had.",
    "Yes I would. My only apology is that this might be too late as the professor is taking a year off. I hope he might return to continue teaching in the future.",
    "you should probably take this class because there are literally hundreds of documents from past years, and Gaddis never changes his lectures.",
    "Yes, it taught me a lot about an area that I had thought I knew about, but had truly only known a small amount about. Taken in conjunction with Europe in the Age of Total War, I gained a very detailed perspective on how modern Europe turned out the way it did.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is interested in history. But I would let them know that the grading is unfortunately very harsh and that Gaddis's ID's are very obscure.",
    "Cold War is traditionally one of the classes that people consider a \u0093must-take\u0094 at Yale. It was, I think, the second biggest class this past term, with a little over 350 students. Prof. Gaddis is a pre-eminent historian on the Cold War and known to be a good lecturer. The course teaches you a really impressive depth and breadth of material in a pretty organized and cohesive way. There are a few complaints though: the first is that the reading load is massive. Like most Yale History\/Humanities classes, very few people actually do all the reading, but the 200 to 250 pages per week from 5 dense books gets quite unmanageable with any real courseload, and it\u0092s impossible to catch up once you fall behind. The second is that, because the reading load is huge, section can be awkward and stilted. The third is that much of the lecture is comprised of video clips from the CNN documentary that Gaddis worked on, and Gaddis at times feels a bit supplementary to the lecture. Lastly, Gaddis reads from a pre-written script when he lectures, and consequently the lectures have a really rehearsed but non-enthusiastic and flat vibe to them. However, his perspective on the Cold War is very interesting and obviously well informed, and you will learn a great deal. The exams are quite reasonable, as is the paper, especially if you get your hands on some decent study guides for the exams.",
    "This class provides a great overview of the Cold War that I found very interesting. Don\u0092t expect much intellectual stimulation from discussions or Professor Gaddis\u0092s lectures. In fact, don\u0092t even expect the professor to really lecture. He relies heavily on videos during his lecture which upset a lot of people, but to be honest I didn\u0092t care. I thought the documentaries were very interesting, and the reading for the most part was great as well (though extensive). The class for the most part is not hard, but the final was a little tricky. If you are looking for an enjoyable, low-stress class I would definitely recommend Cold War.",
    "This course has given me a good overview of major events and American foreign policies during the Cold War. I found the readings simply not manageable but I really enjoyed the lectures. I would reccommend this course to other students, only if they are prepared to read a lot.",
    "You need to take this. Understanding the Cold War is critical to understanding the world and I couldn't think of a better way to understand the Cold War than with Professor Gaddis.",
    "It's not nearly as great as everyone else says it is by virtue of the fact that Gaddis just doesn't teach- he reads the same notes he's been reading for decades. You could get a lot of the value of the course just by watching the BBC documentary on the Cold War- since you'll spend about 80% of total class time doing that anyway...",
    "I would definitely recommend it, saying that it was a great course by a tremendous professor with lots of visual aide (the documentary clips) to keep it interesting.",
    "Take it Credit\/D. The material's interesting, and the lectures are okay, but mostly video footage. The reading, however, is both heavy and excruciatingly boring.If you like political history and are conservative, you will love this class.",
    "Overall, I'd say this class is great for students whose high school history curricula did not cover much post-WWII global history. If yours did, a lot of this will be a review (though it's always good to freshen up on this subject matter). I actually thought the lectures were a bit disappointing; Gaddis reads from a script (which he does well, so it's not monotonous) that clearly hasn't been changed in about 10 years. Furthermore, he literally spends about half of the lecture showing us clips from the Cold War documentary he helped produce; a lot of people simply tune out during these (this lecture is right after lunch). A lot also depends on who your TF is with regards to grading and your overall experience, although that's true for all large lecture courses. At the end of the day, I took this class because it's one you're \"supposed to take,\" and I probably regret it. It wasn't horrible or anything, but when there are so many great classes at Yale, this one isn't worth it.",
    "This is prmovably one of the best classes I've aken at Yale and it really is a comprehnsive look at the entire cold wAr from the world's premed expert in that field. The reading is just too much to be realistically dealt with, however, so study groups are a must.",
    "This is a great, great course. Far and away the best lecture I've taken at Yale, and I've taken some good ones. It took a little bit for me to get into it, but once I figured out how to soak in the material I never wanted to miss a lecture. Gaddis has a brilliant style, and though some others criticize him for the overuse of videos, I thought they did a lot to pull the history together and keep the students engaged. Take it to learn from the guy who literally wrote the book on the Cold War.",
    "I would recommend this course. You get as much from it as you put in; reading is not mandatory, but you learn a lot from the books. Even taking it Credit\/D\/Fail, I learned a lot. The Cold War is as relevant a paradigm as any other to study the history of the 2nd half of the 20th century, and Gaddis is as good a professor as they come in this field.",
    "The second half of the 20th century, in survey. One of the broadest history lectures in scope that I could imagine, and as such a very valuable course. It's more relevant to modern international affairs than any other history course I could imagine.",
    "Take it.",
    "I really loved Cold War. It did get pretty video heavy as the course went on but Gaddis's comments were fantastic and made the experience totally different than just watching the documentary. As someone who knew little about the subject before taking the course, I loved learning about the Cold War in such depth. If you already know a lot about the time period, you may be more frustrated than I was.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. go to lecture. find someone who has study guides of the readings, but try to do them; it will help immensely. westad is a bitch to get through but ends up being super important on midterm and final (and relaly interesting!) so don't brush it off...",
    "Huge portions of the class are taught using videos which are very hard to take notes from and kind of boring. Also, the readings are very excessive and completely detached from what happens in lecture, section, or on the tests, so I feel like I wasted my money buying some of the books. So while I learned alot about the Cold War, I think that was just inevitable from being immersed in it so much, rather than any real quality of the class. So, if you want to learn about the Cold War and you'll suffer any class, then take it. If you are just looking for a good or fun class and are sorta interested in history but maybe not, then don't take it.",
    "Take it, obviously.",
    "Amazing class. Gaddis is awesome.",
    "A great series on the Cold War, going from post WWII up though the end of the Soviet Union. Gaddis is a top lecturer and the material is interesting. Be prepared to read though (all of it). Recommended, but start out with Credit\/D before the midterm.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "This class is the story of the Cold War from the perspective of the living, the dead, and the in betweens. The video clips that are part of lecture will spellbind you.",
    "I would highly recommend the class. The topic is fascinating, the lectures a great, and the reading is interesting, if heavy.",
    "Awesome class. Take it. There's a reason it's considered one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "The course was a wonderful look at the Cold War that used videos to keep lectures interesting, and that wasn't too hard in terms of requirements. There is a lot of reading, but it's good stuff, so I didn't mind it, and I did most of it (there are some weeks in the middle of the term where it was a bit impossible to keep up, but I did my best). We only had to write one essay, which was nice, but I think that made our analysis of the era kind of limited. The lectures were good, and Gaddis certainly gives food for thought. He's conservative, so that means the liberal students usually have good conversations about why they disagree or whatever.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but unfortunately this was the last time..",
    "I would recommend this class, though don't take it because Gaddis is a big name in Cold War history. He relies largely on videos, and the amount we got to hear him lecture was consequently considerably less than class time. The material is highly relevant, since the Cold War is a part of our recent history, and Prof. Gaddis presents an interesting approach to studying the time period by focusing on strategy. Take it, if you have room on your schedule!",
    "It is a must take in your yale career",
    "This class is well-known as a must-take at Yale. As an American Studies major, I found it interesting and fun to take a look at American history through a political, rather than cultural, perspective. The lectures are interesting, although long. Gaddis does a nice job of breaking them up with film clips and personal accounts. I personally did not love the class as much as I had been told I would, but I think it covers a very important time in American history and I am very glad I took it.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting class, although I'm not exactly sure why it has gotten quite the hype it has. Professor Gaddis is a good lecturer, although he presents his own view on the Cold War, and leaves you to fill in a more unbiased version on your own through the readings, which are copious. Take it if you are interested in the Cold War. It is not a \"must-take\" though.",
    "Take it if you can. It is a flagship Yale course, and there is good reason for that. It is just brilliant.",
    "If Gaddis teaches it again, take it. It is clearly one of the premier classes on this campus.",
    "Great class, it really helps you understand the state of the world today.",
    "Must take for any history major or anyone who wants to know about the 20th century.",
    "I would summarize as a must-take course, if you're interested in modern world history. It's really interesting and very important to understanding modern geopolitics. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. See above.",
    "Amazing class. Everyone at Yale should take if they can,",
    "Yes, anyone should know this stuff.",
    "This class is perfect if you've ever wondered what happened in world history after 1960-where most high school history seems to end. The class lectures are excellent and the videos he uses are interesting and helps students better organize their notes. There is too much reading but no one does it all although the books are really interesting if you ever get to them.",
    "You learn about the Cold War from many angles - the focus on the Third World was particularly interesting. It is terrific and a definite must-take during your time at Yale.",
    "Cold War is an awesome class for anybody who wants to know how the world looked like within the past 50 years and why the world is what it is today. Prof. Gaddis is probably the best scholar you can get for such an introduction, so definitely put it in your schedule when you can. It's got about 250 pages of reading a week, 1 5-10 page paper, a midterm and a final. The workload isn't easy, but teaches you a great deal and is definitely more than worth it!",
    "If this class is offered again, I'd definitely recommend it. It's not another boring history class.",
    "Cold War is an excellent survey course for the Cold War period, focusing both on the strategies of the US and the USSR in negotiating the conflict and on the effects the war had in countries that served as proxies for a fight between the two superpowers. The course follows the standard lecture\/section format and has a very heavy workload, especially in the first half of the course. I would recommend the course if you're genuinely interested in foreign policy, and if you have the time to do the reading.",
    "Yes! I mean, there's ALOT of reading, be warned, and you should definitely attack most of it so that you have a strong idea of each author's points. Skim reading is key! But other than that, my section was always interesting, and the lectures are brilliant. Do it!",
    "I would definitely recommend History 261 to another student. There is a lot of reading but the course will teach you just about everything you need to know about the Cold War.",
    "Yes.",
    "This is a wonderful history class for those who have little experience taking them. Professor Gaddis is an absolutely enthralling lecturer who speaks clearly and in a straightforward manner. He presents things more matter of factly, leaving arguments mostly to the reading. The class is interesting and the TAs were fantastic. The class is not entirely difficult if you have the study guides and do like one book of the reading (Westad seemed to be heavily favored this year) Me and my roommate were both taking it credit\/D and were surprised that even our minimal efforts the nights before the midterm earned us a good enough grade to switch. The only downside was the room it was in was sometimes crowded and difficult to hear. Wonderful class.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you are not very familiar with the Cold War. I feel as though you really do learn a lot.",
    "If you can, take Cold War pass\/fail. There's one paper, a midterm, and a final, and a whole lot of reading, which is all secondary sources and pretty dry. Gaddis's lectures are fascinating and easy to follow. Sometimes he banks heavily on videos, but they are pretty interesting too. I don't think it lives up to the hype, but good class overall.",
    "This is a great class. I learned a lot about a very important period in history of which I had previously known almost nothing. I definitely recommend taking this course!",
    "Its a great course, a classic and a must-take at Yale, (as long as Gaddis teaches it). It is not an easy course, but it is rewarding because of the amount you learn about the cold war.",
    "I don't think it's being offered again, not next year at least, so I don't know how pertinent this is. In any case, I would recommend this class in an instant, despite my aversion to huge lectures. It really is an eye-opening experience, especially with regard to the Third World. The reading was a bit much and dense (I'm talking to you, Westad), and I wish the paper had been assigned later on in the course, when I was versed in events after 1950. Gaddis also relied on his CNN documentary a lot, but only to show us firsthand just how much blood was shed outside the superpowers.All in all, this was a seminal class, which fulfilled an IS credit for me. Do take it, should you have the chance to!",
    "The Cold War is a class exclusively based on, well, the Cold War. It's focused on the US and USSR relationship, but you also spend a lot of time learning about the impact of the Cold War in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. You really get to know the figures involved on what feels like a personal basis, and the history is examined both chronologically and topically.",
    "This is a must-take. Seriously. Take it.",
    "It's a lot of work, but definitely worth it.",
    "Cold war is an awesome class, I would definitely recommend it to another student if Prof. Gaddis offers it again. It covers a pretty crazy time in history so there is a lot of material to learn, but it's all extremely interesting. Also, Prof Gaddis is a great lecturer and in general the TFs are notoriously good as well. Definitely take it.",
    "It's one of those must-take class at Yale. LOTS of reading, though.",
    "With John L. Gaddis at the helm, this course is one of the best you could take at Yale. In fact, it's one course that you MUST take while you're here, or else you'll regret it. You will learn so much about the Cold War, whether you're a history student who already knows a lot about it, or a science major who has never learned about the big picture before. There is a lot of reading, but it's manageable, and you can sometimes pick and choose what to neglect if you have a week of heavy workloads from other classes. However, try to avoid skipping the reading too often--if you do it, you'll have no problem on the tests. Take it, take it, take it, and good luck!",
    "Cold War is a wonderful course that offers an overview of the Cold War, especially the strategies employed by the relevant American Presidents.I would recommend it. Strengths: Professor has incredible knowledge and experience; material is covered efficiently; TAs(at least mine)are great; books are fascinating and informative. Weaknesses: Too much reading is assigned; the lecturesand the readings don't overlap extensively.",
    "Yes, this is definitely a class you should take.",
    "Take it. Great course.",
    "Yeah definitely take this class, you will learn a lot and the workload is manageable--1 midterm, a medium lenth paper, and a final. You will need to study a lot for the tests but other than that you don't really have to do all the reading.",
    "It's not the glorious class that everyone says it is. Most of the people who laud it have probably never taken many history courses, because as history courses go, this is pretty mediocre and unfocused--mostly because the Cold War is too big a topic to cover in one semester, esp. from all the different standpoints. It's impossible for a survey course like this to be hailed as one of the best Yale experiences, at least for a senior history major like me who has taken a lot of classes dealing with the Cold War.Because of the vastness of the topic, it's hard to concentrate on many themes or issues. The TAs themselves argued throughout the review sessions, for example.Furthermore, Gaddis updates his books as new scholarship comes about (most of our readings were published in the mid-2000s). But these books have become more and more detailed over the years, going into the back-and-forth more and more as more evidence comes to light. And because they are building on past scholarship, a lot of the larger picture and foundations that we know about the Cold War are lost. Gaddis tries to make up for this in his lectures, but it creates a situation where there's a huge disconnect between his simplistic, video clip-filled lectures and the extremely detailed reading that is PILED on you. This class screams for pooled group study guides, as much as I hate them, because of the sheer amount of text.I took the class mainly for the European credit, which I attained by writing a small midterm paper on something that at least involved one European power.Take the class if you want to know what actually happened in the 20th century, and take it for Gaddis' strategy perspective on diplomacy. It was a nice refresher for me on the events that happened. But please don't leave the class thinking you've known everything about the Cold War, or that Gaddis always correct--it's easy to think so, especially because some people come into the class with high expectations thatit is the most amazing Yale class ever.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it because although the class is not easy and Gaddis is a little biased, its still the opportunity to learn from one of the leading Cold War historians and one of Yale's BIG name professors. He is also an amazing lecturer.",
    "Most people take this course because of Gaddis star power, and it is definitely interesting and exciting to hear lectures from someone so involved and knowladgable about his subject matter. However, you could just watch the CNN documentary and get the same information as the course offers.",
    "very good class, take it if its offered again",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who was interested in the cold war. Unfortunately, this class does not give someone who feels that they have little understanding of the cold war a broad overview.",
    "This class is wayyyy over-hyped. Definitely NOT one of the great Yale classes. You basically watch the CNN documentary Gaddis contributed to about 60% of class - literally - and hear Gaddis summarize his book the other 40% of the time. No real use of cultural history, minimal social history, mostly about the big overarching and not very interesting historical\/political trends and events and strategies. It did not change the way I looked at the Cold War or the world. That said, I did barely any reading and probably would've gotten an A if I hadn't done it credit-D.",
    "The material is interesting, and even essential. The class itself is somewhat overrated. Gaddis relies heavily on video clips - watching those would have provided almost as good an education as the lecture itself.",
    "Yes.",
    "Excellent survey course of the Cold War. Gaddis is an engaging lecturer, but he's very opinionated so make sure you get the whole picture. He also shows a lot of clips from a CNN documentary, which is a lot less interesting than his talking. There's a lot of reading but it's manageable.",
    "Great class, but take it with Prof Gaddis when he is back from leave.",
    "Overall, this class gives you an unforgettable insight into the post WWII era, and uses a wide variety of sources while doing so. It will not be offered next year but do take it if its offered in 2 years' time!",
    "Awesome class, definitely take it.",
    "Great class if you want an overview of the cold war and to understand the events that led the world basically to where it is today. For a complete understanding of the way in which the cold war has influenced the world today, take Cold War with the International Studies class Ideas and Institutions: Contemporary Challenges with Jolyon Howorth. It was great taking them both at the same time.",
    "I would definitely take this class. I took it as a freshman after hearing that it was one of Yale's must-takes. Of course, I originally had worries about being able to handle a class environment with sophomores-seniors. And I'll have to say, it wasn't much of a problem at all, I'm pretty sure I scored among the top. The reading assignments are overwhelming, but I would say that the TF's don't even expect you to get through all of it. Pay attention in discussion, as the topics brought up in there usually return on the tests. Overall, don't be intimidated by the course. Just take it, it is truly the top-notch course that people claim it to be. I'm an econ and math major, and this course makes me want to take more history classes in the future.",
    "I think this is best answered with a video...But really, it grows slightly embarrassing how often Gaddis resorts to his damn documentary, and the lectures, while interesting, fall far short of spectacular. The workload is average, though if you want to do all the readings it will take more time, but don't worry, you won't have much company and there will be little accountability for them. The paper and midterm creep up quickly, but after that it is a long, quiet descent for the rest of the semester. A good class that covers interesting material, but by no means the near-mandatory class that somehow Yale lore has labeled it.",
    "The course was great. It focused more on the personality of leaders instead of events, outlining summits more often than actual events. I really enjoyed this change of view point. I had taken Eastern European history the semester before, and this way I didn't feel like a lot of the course was a repeat. It was different than my other history courses and I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn about leaders, and how having an impulsive, irrational leader can make a huge difference in the outcome of an event. Gaddis is an amazing lecturer. He makes each class seem like story time while still giving a lot of information. Each lecture was interesting and you can tell the difference between these and other classes when multiple times throughout the semester, the students broke out in spontaneous applause when the class was over. About half of his lecture is often film, but I really like this as it is more personal and often easier to remember when you see the event rather than just hearing about it. It also makes the class more fun. For the exams, the ids are often very obscure and you only get a choice of 5 of 7. There are often copies of summaries of the readings lying around and if you can get a copy, they are really helpful when studying.",
    "I would recommend it to everybody, history major and non-history major alike. The knowledge we learn is important to anyone living in this world.",
    "Take it when Gaddis offers it again.",
    "take it take it take it. you must. studying isn't hard because it's so interesting!",
    "Cold War is a very good history lecture. John Gaddis is probably the preeminent scholar in the field, and might not be teaching the course much longer. I would highly recommend it."
