    "Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to learn Spanish. The class is well structured, and I learned a lot in just one semester. Lots of opportunities to practice conversation in class. Online homework was a bit frustrating, but for the most part useful, and I appreciated the extra resources on the website. Not too much work as a whole, but a little every day.",
