   "comments": [
    "My writing and reading improved. My speaking probably worsened as a result of taking this class. I enjoyed the readings from Diversit because it was a chance to explore Francophone countries.",
    "I really developed my French grammar skills",
    "I continued to learn new vocabulary, grammar, and expressions in French (e.g. faire causatif, discours indirect, pronoms relatifs, literary tenses). However, I think the most valuable part of the class was learning about France during World War II and about the Holocaust in France. We spent a month on the subject by reading Un Sac de Billes, by watching two movies about the Holocaust, and by completing a final presentation. I have never learned about the Holocaust in such deep depth in an academic setting (Ive read book about it in my own time, but my high school never really taught it that much), nor about Vichy France. This course really educated about history while, at the same time, improving my French.",
    "Learned a lot of grammar Practiced speaking, (hopefully) improved a lot",
    "By taking this course my proficiency in French greatly improved. I learned many new grammar skills and through our end of semester presentations both my ability to speak and my listening comprehension improved.",
    "My french speaking improved, and my understanding of French grammatical rules. My knowledge of French literature also increased significantly.",
    "French 140 has improved my written French greatly. I also improved my listening skills.",
    "More applications of conversational French, advanced grammar, and presentation skills. We explored a lot of interesting texts and concluded the semester with individual \"exposs\" on chosen aspects of World War II in France!"

   "comments": [
    "The French Department takes it self way too seriously, to the detriment of its students. This class was an unreasonable amount of work, even for 1.5 credits. We watched a total of 4 movies throughout the semester, in addition to the assigned course grammar and reading material. The course was so jam packed that there was no time to actually discuss\/ learn from what we were assigned to do. Two of the movies we were required to watch (La Noire de et Inch'Allah et Dimanche) were never discussed in course besides a passing remark. The course could be improved by eliminating the less relevant material so that students actually have time to learn from the readings. There is no point to shoving in a bunch of material that ends up being a time suck rather than a learning experience. Also the audio assignments were not helpful and time consuming.",
    "It is really well taught.",
    "This course is really well organized - there's a course packet with tons of helpful exercises, and a clear syllabus that you follow throughout the term. The workload was very manageable, and I definitely feel that I improved a lot over the semester. No weaknesses of the course that I can think of",
    "The policy of the language departments to make the cutoff between A- and A a 95 disincentivizes student contributions and effort towards the end of the semester.",
    "This course covered a lot of material but it was organized in units which made it very helpful. The course assessed all aspects of the language including speaking, writing, reading, listening etc and gave many opportunities to practice all of these skills.",
    "The strength is that the course load is basically daily so it forces you to really engage with your French, and the improvements are immediately visible.",
    "I think the course is very structured and regimented so that it is impossible to fall behind. Also, although there was a lot of testing including biweekly exams, quizzes, orals, and compositions, my learning was truly cumulative so I did not feel overwhelmed when studying for the final. I think the mixture of honing previous skills such as tenses as well as adding new grammatical skills was a great way to structure the class. A weakness of the class was definitely the audio programs. Although listening exercises were important, the audio programs were unnecessarily long and exacerbated an already heavy workload. I think getting rid of the parts of the audio programs that we had to reply orally and just focus on writing down what we hear would significantly cut down this time.",
    "Strengths: extremely organized with the course packets, engaging in-class exercises and discussion, and interesting texts and topics. Weaknesses: workload was sometimes uneven (some nights would have much more homework and reading than others)."

   "comments": [
    "No. I would recommend not taking French at Yale. The courses are time consuming and my speaking french definitely worsened over the course of the semester. I would recommend taking a different language where the department has more of an interest in student success.",
    "Yes!!! Take it with Kathleen Burton, she is awesome! Definitely a lot of work for L4, but you really develop your grammar skills from L3.",
    "If you have come this far in French, you should definitely take it! Youll learn how to read things written in literary tenses and your spoken French will develop significantly. After taking FREN 140, I am now confident that I can read most French news articles and books with minimal use of dictionaries, and that I could hold entire conversations in French. Also, you will get to learn some French history, especially during World War II and the Holocaust. Getting to learn the history and the impact of World War II on French culture today were definitely my favorite parts of this class.",
    "Yes! L4 is a great course - manageable workload and you definitely improve a ton",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who enjoys french and wishes to greatly improve this proficiency.",
    "Absolutely. It definitely helped my French in a finite.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot.",
    "Absolutely! This course is a great way to further your understanding of the French language and become a more confident listener, speaker, and reader."
