   "comments": [
    "10\/10 would recommend.",
    "I recommend. It's a decent amount of work but you'll definitely improve as a writer.",
    "A must take for anyone with a passing interest in screenwriting. Entirely manageable workload and enjoyable classes.",
    "FILM 350 gives you a terrific introduction to screenwriting with the ability to create your own work by the end of it. The class is divided equally between scholarship and creation. In the beginning of the semester you work on understanding screenplays and storytelling as well as creating the foundation of your screenplay. In the second half of the semester you write your own screenplay and workshop it with the class. I would definitely recommend this class to another student as it is both fun and rewarding and the lessons learned can be applied to many other subjects, not just screenwriting.",
    "An overview of the art of screenwriting, a forum for discussing current development regarding a 12-page screenplay, and a means of improving as a writer in general.",
    "A great intro to screenwriting. You'll get a lot more out of the class if you listen to how Professor Lapadula tells stories, and if you read extra scripts\/watch movies analytically outside of class. Start on the midterm packet EARLY. Don't save it till the last minute. The coverages take some time. This class is so much fun.",
    "Film 350 01 teaches a student the basics of screenwriting, i.e. how to write a screenplay, the different genres, creating dynamic characters, must-watch movies. I would recommend this class to another student. If you want to learn about how to properly write a screenplay, as well as the film industry this is the class you need to take!"
