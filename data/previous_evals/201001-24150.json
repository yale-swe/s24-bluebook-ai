   "comments": [
    "Take this freshmen seminar if you are interested not in the classic science topics like bio or chem but want to learn more useful knowledge about computers, water sanitation, the internet, and vaccines. Lectures are mostly taught by students so make sure you don't mind working with a team on a large project and like to teach other kids.",
    "This class is whatever you make of it. You can easily slide by without doing anything, but it's much more rewarding if you pay attention in class, etc. It's a good science credit for a non-science person (no midterm, no final) but there is a research paper at the end. The paper, though, can be on pretty much anything as long as it relates to the topic that your group presented. The only thing is that, even after your group presents, you have no sense of how you're doing in the class.",
    "A great class for non-science majors to take. That said, if you are a science major, you might want to stay away as some of the earlier parts of the lecture are extremely intuitive.",
    "Science of Modern Technology is a great course if you're a non-science major looking for a science credit. The ridiculous amount of rounding and generalizations of physics formulas and constants frustrated me at the beginning, but it's a great course once I got over the imprecision of the science. The point is to get a general grasp of technology, which the course succeeds at doing.",
    "Yes. A good way to get a science credit in a relaxed, fun way that teaches you substantive material and helps you understand the role of technological advances in the world without being too formal or dry or anything else you might be afraid of. A unique, fun class.",
    "Definitely take this class! I looked forward going to class to see Dr Prober every week to learn about the different application of science in technology.",
    "It is a good way to learn a little about a lot in the sciences.",
    "The Science of Modern technology was largely controlled by students who choose the course material and present presentations on their topic of interest.The workload is concentrated at the time of your presentation and the rest of the semester is spent learning about your classmates topics and also writing one research paper on a topic of your choice.I would definitely recommend this course for non-science students who would like to learn the origins of technology as well as its modern application and concerns related to its development. You will get as much out of this course as you put into it.",
    "I would recommend this to any non-science major who wants to learn a lot about topics that they would not have otherwise studied, and it is just a great experience to take this class.",
    "don't bother with it. there are probably other sci credit classes that are better. if you are science major, stay away from wasting your time in this class. You can look up the stuff on wikipedia (that's what we did)",
    "It was a nice way to get rid of an SC credit as a freshman but had very little use value. If you can find another way to get rid of the SC credit do so.",
    "Science of Modern Technology was an amazing way for someone who isn't really a \"science person\" to get a science credit in a very interesting and fun way while not being too overly challenging. We were divided into groups, and each group had 2 weeks to present their topic to the rest of the class. It was nice to get to do a big group project like this, as this is relativelyrare with most Yale classes- though if you don't enjoy group work, then maybe this isn't the class for you. The workload was not too difficult- there was a lot of work to do to prepare for your presentation, but the rest of the semester there was only homework to do every other week that was graded pass\/fail, and a big paper to write at the end. Professor Prober is great, and managed to make science a lot of fun for me (and he even gave us animal crackers every class and all sorts of cool stuff throughout the semester). For anyone who was never really into science but is looking for a really interesting, fun, and not too hard science class- I very strongly recommend this class. Couldn't think of a better way to get a science credit!"
