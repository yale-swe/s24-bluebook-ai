   "comments": [
    "Rogers is so good, so funny, and makes Milton incredibly interesting and dynamic.",
    "Definitely take this class if Rogers is teaching it. Milton can be kind of a lot sometimes, but it's a really great experience overall.",
    "The reading is great - well worth doing every page of. And lecture is incredible. Don't get behind though...while it's possible to read the entirety of Paradise Lost the day before the final, it's not recommended, and it's much more fun to follow along with Rogers and the people in your discussion section.",
    "This class is so so fun! Prof. Rogers is just the sweetest man, and his lectures are funny, entertaining and will surprise you every time. Probably not for you if you don't like Milton, but if you do, go for it! You'll learn a lot and understand a new side to our favorite English poet. The TFs are also great.",
    "This course covers all of Miltons major works, from the good (Paradise Lost, Samson Agonistes) to the dull (Paradise Regained) to the torturous (the Divorce Pamphlets). Professor Rogers is an intelligent and very sweet man who has clearly got this class down to a science: every lecture is engaging, well paced, full of useful information and often quite memorable. One of the best courses to knock out your pre-1800 requirement if youre an English major. Section was thought-provoking and worthwhile, since most students did the reading and werent shy during discussion.",
    "Yes. Ideally taken as a sophomore or a junior, I think, rather than as a senior.",
    "Absolutely. John Rogers is an absorbing lecturer. He knows so much about Milton and is clearly passionate about the material. He's also a very friendly and personable man.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you're an English major. You'll appreciate Milton, not just slog through him.",
    "This class is fantastic! I only took this class because I had to for the major, and I thought that I would really resent having to read so much Milton. It sounds pretty boring from the outside. But John Rogers is the best lecturer I've ever had at Yale, and he totally made me fall in love with Milton. Now I literally read it for fun, and quote it to my friends, and they're like shut up. I love Milton now. Take this class. You will not regret it.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who knows a bit about English literature already, and wants to be impressed by a teacher at the top of his game (talking about a poet at the top of his game)."
