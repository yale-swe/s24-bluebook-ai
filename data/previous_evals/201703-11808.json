    "This lab is intellectually challenging and plentifully insightful. In terms of both workload and rigor, it is probably up there with the most famed labs at Yale, such as Physics 165L. At moments I couldn't decided whether I was engaged in philosophical dialogue with Socrates or in a Froco meeting. Overall, one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "The only thing that would prevent me from recommending this to another Yale student is the lack of course credit. Outside of that, the class is fantastic."
