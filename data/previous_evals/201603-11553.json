   "comments": [
    "I loved this class! It was, by far, my favorite class this semester. I learned so much about various psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as Depression and Alzheimer's Disease, and how simulating symptoms of these disorders in animals can lead to novel treatments. Very interesting material. Studying from Professor Donegan's notes and study guides really helps one make sense of the disorders. Take advantage of these! Also, if Veronica is still the TF, do not hesitate to take this course! She is awesome!",
    "This class can make you learn a lot about clinical disorders, their causes, symptoms, classifications and treatments.",
    "I got a detailed explanation of the physiological causes of various disorders ranging from drug addiction to Parkinson's. I also learned how animal models are sued to find new treatments and cures for these diseases.",
    "I learned everything there was to know regarding animal models and clinical disorders. You learn a lot about the neuroscience behind clinal disorders in the human body along with how they apply in animal models.",
    "This wasn't one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale! The class is an amazing overview of how brain works, and how t breaks down under different disorders. It was incredibly interesting and I learned a lot! I also learned alt about evaluating different research models and methods, and how to determine if it's a reliable model or subject. Overall a very useful class!",
    "How to handle a lot of readings and in class note taking.",
    "I learned about clinical disorders in psychology and applied a lot of what I had learned to animal models and experiments. I now see each experiment involving animal models in a new way and try to think critically about them. I learned a lot of psychopharmacology and feel more confident in reading academic papers on these topics.",
    "I learned how to think like a scientist. Especially helpful was learning what could confound an experiments results, and how to question the results effectively.",
    "I learned a lot in this class about the biological causes of mental illnesses and I learned a ton of material about the illnesses themselves, such as the symptoms and causes of each illness.",
    "I learned a lot about animal models of clinical disorders."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think one of the biggest weaknesses is the fact that there is a paper and final within a week of each other. I think either moving up the test and making it non-cumulative or moving up the paper would be more effective for learning.",
    "Strengths: the material for this class was incredibly interesting and engaging to anyone who is interested at least a little in psychiatric disorders. The layout of the class was very straightforward and easy to follow, and students always knew what they were expected to know.",
    "The class is very well organized. 1 pre-test, 2 midterm exams, and a final, as well as a 10 page paper made the work manageable. Lectures can be a little boring, but Professor Donegan's notes really help make the material less complex.",
    "This course requires a lot of work, that needs to be put in throughout the semester. Weakness is that lectures feel really dry and sometimes it's hard to keep awake but the professor is a really nice guy so you should go ask him questions in office Lear any doubts",
    "This was a good course. I think the course would be improved if the assessments had more explanation and less recall. I also think it would be better if the paper was moved to a different time of year.",
    "The lectures are kind of dry but if you have trouble taking good notes on this new, difficult information, the instructor posts all of his notes for lectures online ( the lectures are mostly pictures so he posts his commentary).",
    "Overall this class is amazing! Professor Donegan does a great job at structuring the class in such a way that it is very easy to follow. He also provides additional notes to make sure his students understand everything. Also, he presents topics in such a way that one naturally leads to another which makes the class very easy to follow!",
    "It was a great course with great information and material however I thought it could have been a little more interactive with students.",
    "Tests were fair, and review questions for the test were very helpful. Lectures were engaging.",
    "I enjoyed each lesson immensely. They were well organized, and I thought they were very engaging. I thought that the topics were covered well, and I loved having a video introduce each new disorder because it put a real face to what we were learning. My only suggestion would to maybe add a discussion section in future years if the class grows larger. Overall, I loved this course.",
    "High level of interaction of professor with course. Lots of information given in an understandable and digestible way. Prep for tests were very helpful.",
    "There was a lot of material to memorize, but we did end up learning a lot from the course.",
    "A strength of the course is the focus and specificity of the material."

   "comments": [
    "If you are at all interested in psychiatric disorders, and especially the underlying neuropathology, you will LOVE this class. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student. The workload was manageable, but it can be challenging to understand the neurobiological and neurochemical components of the disorders. You can't get away with memorizing everything because some test questions were specifically geared to assess our knowledge of these components. So, it's important to devote some time to really understand these. If someone tells you this is a gut, they are lying to you.",
    "Take the course definitely if you're a psych major. If not, there might be easier Sc credits out there and if you don't enjoy studying about clinical disorders, don't do it.",
    "I would recommend. It is difficult though.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. It's not very exciting, but the lecture notes are posted online so you honestly never have to come to class.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 147 to another student ONLY IF he or she had a strong background in neuroscience. A lot of the concepts are hard to grasp if you don't have this background (like me) and you will probably struggle. Given this, Professor Donegon is a great lecturer and really cares about his students, so if you ask him for help, he will give to you.",
    "Not the best science credit but learned a lot. If interested in clinical disorders, I suggest abnormal psych instead.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! It was incredibly interesting and was very different frommmost psych classes I have taken at Yale! It was incredibly cool to see how he brain worked normally, as well as under abnormal conditions, \/!: will definitely be relevant to other class I plan on taking. Overall an incredible class!",
    "Yes, if you enjoy the subject, there is some very interesting information to be learned.",
    "Yes -- very informative for those interested in medicine and mental health.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in psychology, animals, and neuroscience. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an introductory course that is highly interesting or to anyone looking to learn more about clinical disorders. I took the course because I am interested in veterinary medicine, and this course allowed me to learn more about the experiments behind the laboratory medicine involved in the practice.",
    "Yes. Especially for anyone who loves neuroscience. I learned of current, cutting-edge research in highly crucial fields of study like Alzheimer's and drug abuse. That is to say this class did not feel like recycled lectures from years ago.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if the student is willing to spend time memorizing facts about the illnesses.",
    "I would recommend this course if a student needs an easy science credit."
