    "I learned the Arabic alphabet. I learned to hold basic conversation in Arabic. I learned to express basic written sentences in Arabic.",
    "This course is a Hollywood intro class that sparks ones interest for learning the language. The class is good spirited and challenged students.",
    "Basic Arabic writing, speaking, and reading.",
    "I mastered the Arabic alphabet, basic vocabulary, and beginning reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. I gained exposure to different aspects of Arab culture, particularly through lessons in the Shaami dialect. I enjoyed learning about the geography, history, and traditions of the Middle East. I feel confident in my Arabic 110 foundation as I move into L2.",
    "The basics for learning arabic. I learned grammar, vocabulary, culture and reading."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths or the use of different media for teaching. Areas that could see some improvement are more engaging homework sets and more opportunity to practice speaking.",
    "The fact that the class demands students to be intrinsically motivated to study the language is both a weakenss and strength.",
    "Only reason I could keep up was because I knew the language before. So I think slowing it a bit down would be helpful.",
    "The course structure was reasonable, but I thought that towards the end of the semester our pace moved too slowly. The tests and homework assignments were fair and useful for my learning. I enjoyed coming to each morning and practicing my Arabic through various activities. I think that Shaami section time could be used more effectively; I don't feel like I learned that much from my section. In general, it was somewhat frustrating that class consistently started late, but I like the 9:25 start time. Professor Aziz was patient, kind, and extremely knowledgeable. I appreciate his ability to tailor the course to each student's learning style and level of comfort with the language.",
    "I felt the course was very book heavy. Sometimes I felt the lecture didn't really help expand the knowledge learned in the book but when they did connect it was extremely helpful. I really liked the book it was extremely easy to follow and use. I think more reading practice would be helpful."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in and passionate about the Arabic language you will find this course enjoyable. If you're not passionate about the Arabic language you might struggle a lot and think that your struggle is pointless.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to begin learning Arabic. It goes very fast however, and if you have no prior background you just need to make sure you are keeping up with everything. Learn the alphabet before you start the class!!!!",
    "I would recommend it only if they're very interested in Arabic or they know the alphabet from beforehand.",
    "I would recommend this course because I have learned so much Arabic from just one semester and Professor Aziz is dedicated to helping us learn the language. The course requires hard work because it is fast paced. Although learning a new language is difficult, Aziz offers assistance outside of class and provides a large number of opportunities for us to practice our speaking skills. The assessments are straight forward but challenging, and it is important to stay on top of all the work throughout the semester, as there is an increase in difficulty after the first few weeks. Aziz is extremely accessible and will discuss homework corrections and class lessons in detail during his office hours each week.",
    "L1 Arabic is an excellent introduction to a unique language and culture. Professor Aziz makes class engaging and fun, and we cover a good deal of material at a reasonable pace. Assignments are not exceedingly difficult but effective in teaching course concepts. I would highly recommend this class to another student interested in learning about the Arab World through its beautiful language and rich culture.",
    "I definitely would while it was really hard it definitely was worth all the struggles."
