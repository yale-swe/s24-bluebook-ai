   "comments": [
    "A wonderful look at the evolution of Italian Cinema from the start of neorealism to the current day. Some very interested readings and discussion, plus it's with the inimitable Francesco. Take it.",
    "Definitely, it was really fun, but only if it's with Francesco.",
    "Selections of italian film from 1945-2000's. Variety of styles with a focus on neorealism. Be prepared for a 2+ hr film screening every week.",
    "I honestly wouldn't recommend this class if you are a serious Italian student looking to improve your ability with the language. It will be disappointing and time-consuming. Take it if you know minimal Italian and need a humanities credit or a 5th class.",
    "Interested in practicing your Italian? Interested in watching some cool Italian films? Interested in learning from an awesome professor? Take this course.",
    "An amazing course, my favorite L5 course in the past 3 years. Looking at Italian cinema through the eyes of neorealism was incredibly cool. The real kicker though was Professor Rabissi. He was incredibly wonderful. Every class session flew by. Mandatory screening are annoying, but (having been in film courses before) it certainly ensures that people actually watch the film!",
    "if you want to continue your italian, and want to see some good (great?) films, take this course.",
    "Amazing class! Allows you to solidify your Italian while studying historically important and beautiful films. Francesco is the best. I can only recommend the course if it's taught by him.",
    "Yes! Take it! This class is very relaxed. You watch a movie a week, and in the process, learn about Italian cinema from neorealism to the present. It's a really fun class, and also helps improve your speaking and writing, without feeling too intense or pressure-y.",
    "This is a great way to get exposed to Italian film. Take it if you're at all interested. Francesco is that man.",
    "I recommend the course if Italian cinema actually interests you. If you're just looking to continue Italian, I'd look into another course that is more speech-heavy.",
    "This is a really great L5 class. It will help you practice your Italian with the class discussions, and the films will give you a sense of Italy over the past 70 years. The papers were a good way to review grammar and the final was reasonable."
