   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it if you have a background in photography. The class is very fast paced and requires a lot of time. You need to be willing to take a lot of photos and work hard or else it is pointless.",
    "So fun! Chance to learn a lot and make a lot of work with good feedback.",
    "It's an upper level photo class in which you get to pursue any project you want and get feedback on it. Take it.",
    "You have to come up with your own work. There are no specific assignments - you make a certain amount of prints, and show them.It is not a technical seminar. There are a few days when you learn how to scan negatives, a little bit on printing and different kinds of cameras, but it is better for people who know what they are doing and the best tool for their work.For this course to be valuable I think you have to be very self-directed and proactive as a student. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn't have direction or is still trying to figure out what they want to make. It is possible to go through this class and not push yourself very hard. But if you have an idea to work on, you will have a great environment, lots of support\/feedback, and the space, time, and facilities to get it done. The most successful students who made the most work in this class were the ones who came in with \"projects,\" or topics to photograph, either one or several, and developed them over the term.",
    "Advanced photo is a very self-directed course in which students pursue individual projects throughout the semester - most students focused on one longterm project. There were four critiques and one final critique in the semester, and students were expected to work on their own time to prepare photos for these presentations.Please only take Advanced Photo if you're truly passionate about photography. If you are a senior looking to finish off your Yale career with an easy credit, please don't take this course. It wastes everybody's time, and there are students in this class who really do want to be photographers, and need the help getting there."
