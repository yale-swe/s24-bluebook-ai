    "Take it! Italian is a beautiful language, and I loved taking it with Chris- he's American, and I found it much easier to understand him than some native speakers. Also he's awesome. It's a pretty fast-paced class, but as long as you stay on top of your work you will do fine on the tests.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I feel as though I was prepared with the right tools to continue my learning of the language. I do not feel as though the class was too difficult, but it was not so easy that I did not learn.",
    "Lots of work, quick understanding. Pretty standard for a language.",
    "Good class. Moved a little faster than I had expected. It was hard to keep up with the vocabulary since we sped through chapters but I felt like the teacher really wanted us to learn and class was always fun and interactive. Professor Kaiser is great. He was so enthusiastic and patient and willing to help us out. He made class a lot of fun. We always did different kinds of activities, sometimes getting out of our chairs, working with partners, writing things in Italian. I really enjoyed class with him everyday and I know the rest of my class agrees.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! The language is wonderful, and the program is very accessible and welcoming of new students. Be prepared to move at an incredibly quick pace and to learn much on your own.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I loved it.",
    "It was a great course! If you want to learn your first language or start a new one Italian is a great choice. The grammar can get a bit tricky at times but once you understand it, it's a breeze.",
    "It's a great class, especially with Christopher Kaiser. Take it if you have any interest in Italian or if you are looking for something interesting. Be prepared to do the work for any other language class though. THUMBS UP (and try to get Chris Kaiser)",
    "I would recommend ITAL 110-02 to another student. I might describe the class as follows: ITAL 110-02 is a fast-paced immersion introduction to the Italian language. The main emphasis on the class as I experienced it is an overview of basic grammatical concepts and a saturation of helpful vocabulary. Students who take the first semester will gain basic conversational, reading, and writing skills that permit, with diligence on the part of the student, the ability to conduct basic interactions with other speakers of the language.",
    "yes i would like to recommend it to another students because its a interesting language which very related with english.",
    "Italian 110 is a challenge but is delightful with the right teacher. I would recommend taking the class with Christopher Kaiser."
