   "comments": [
    "Great course. All sensei are adorable. You spend one hour or two on Japanese everyday and you do improve.",
    "JAPN 110 is overall an excellent course. The teachers are all incredibly dedicated and are always able to sustain interest in their subject. You probably will not find better language teachers anywhere. The main issue with the course is the amount of work. By the end of the semester, the work becomes so great that you feel as though you would be absorbing the information more efficiently if you had less work.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is definitely an excellent way to learn another language while here at Yale. The language is difficult enough but by the end of the semester you will be confident in your ability to give and take directions, ask for items at stores, introduce yourself, and have the basics of grammar down. Your reading and writing should also be somewhere on like a 1st grade reading level, I'd say.",
    "Japanese 110 is an introductory Japanese course. It is one of the most entertaining courses that Ihave taken at Yale. There is intense studying and heavy memorization involved, however, keeping up with all the work is highly rewarding. Class time is completed with \"Japanese clinics\" and various review sessions throughout the year. The senseis always make themselves available to everyone. I would highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Yes! Just try to get a tutor. And study the grammar.",
    "I highly recommend this class!! I learned so much in just 1 semester. I feel like I can already carry on conversations and I can now email my grandma in Japanese.",
    "BEST CLASS EVER, FO REAL. The teachers are all really great and willing to spend time with you outside of class if you need help, class sizes are small, and the textbook is really systematic and teaches grammar very well. Definitely a class I looked forward to going to every day.",
    "The students in Japanese 110 have built a strong sense of community and bonded with each other over the semester. Students motivate each other and make first year Japanese a fun and stimulating experience.I will strongly recommend Japanese 110 to another student.",
    "This is a pretty good course: the classes are really fun, my classmates were really cool, and I learned a ton of Japanese, but there is just an absurd amount of homework. Certainly, if you take a language like Japanese, you\u0092re making a commitment to do way more work than you would if you were taking Spanish or Italian, but three hours of homework a night is ridiculous and unreasonable. I had to put more time into Japanese than my other four courses combined, and if you\u0092ve never had any exposure to Japanese before, be prepared to struggle for the entire semester, because there is so much work, even for people who already know a little bit of Japanese, that if you know absolutely none coming in, you\u0092re never going to be able to catch up, so this is definitely not a class to take \u0093for fun\u0094 unless you\u0092ve decided that you don\u0092t want to have a social life anyway. Nevertheless, the senseis are funny and very competent (but when they sent out emails to the class in English the results are sometimes very comical), and this was my favorite course this semester. I just think it would be so much better if there were less homework, since I think that there is some point at which just assigning more and more homework is counterproductive since it just gives you less time to study for Japanese as you have to spend your time filling out worksheets or listening to online audio conversations (the audio quality is terrible, by the way).",
    "Intense. Only take it if you're serious about learning the language.",
    "I would definitely reccomend it, but there is a lot of work.",
    "Unlike other L1 courses in more traditional languages (Spanish, French, etc.), Japanese 110 requires a lot of work. For me, who had never taken Japanese before, I found that I had to really stay on top of the classwork. Learning a whole new system of writing, speaking, and grammar structures can be daunting at times. Attendance is vital - I learned the most during class time. The teachers are really great and very open to questions and involve everyone in the classes. Although Japanese was by far the class I had the most work in this semester, it was also my favorite class. The amount of improvement\/learning in just a few months is truly amazing. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning and putting in the effort to learning a really cool language.",
    "It is a very fast-paced class where you learn something new every day. The instructors are wonderful and charismatic and put a great amount of effort into putting together materials for daily class. It is very easy to fall behind, so putting in the right amount of work daily is important. I wish that kanji were better taught in class, rather than self-taught. I also wish we were taught more about Japanese culture and got opportunities to bond with instructors outside of class.",
    "japanese is such a great language. take it",
    "If you're interested in Japanese\/Japan at all, this is an excellent language course and a perfect way to start.",
    "This class is a very rigorous course which does effectively teach you Japanese. I wouldn't suggest it to a freshman, because I feel the workload can dominate a semester if you aren't prepared. However, any one else ready to take it on should absolutely do it. Everyone I know has complained about the work, but they're all coming back for another semester.",
    "Hey folks. So, you know how when people say that Japanese at Yale is hard, but youkind of just brush it off, and are sure it couldn't be that bad?It is. It's hard, very very hard. You'll have to work extremely hard if you want anything resembling a B.That being said: it's also brilliant. The teachers are warm, enthusiastic, and plain old fun, and I couldn't think of a better atmosphere to learn the language. Honestly, my only complaint is that the pace is much too fast, that at times I find myself frustrated by how I have to learn things in a cursory manner since I have to move on to the next topic so quickly.Advice: Don't get behind, and use all of the extra resources. Japanese clinic, office hours of TAs, and teachers. And as long as you know exactly how much work you're getting yourself into, have a brilliant time.",
    "I think Japanese 110 01 is a very good class, but I would only recommend it to serious Japanese learners. The course is quite intense, especially for people who have never had any former experience of Japanese before. If you want to learn it well, be prepared to devote around 2 hours a day for it.",
    "Hard-work. Class gets extremely difficult from the middle of the semester. But if you do the work, the result is worth the effort.",
    "I didn't think I would enjoy learning a foreign language, but this class was the best. It's making me consider being a East Asian literature studies major. Take it.Seriously.",
    "Its a lot of work. Harder than Chinese maybe. But fun!",
    "Japanese 110 is a lot of work, but it is definitely worth it. All of the professors are really really great, and you will learn so much from them. The class is pretty fast paced, so you always have to stay on top of the lessons so that you will be able to participate in class. It was a pain to memorize the core conversations for each class, and there is a lot of homework, but you will end up learning a lot of Japanese. I highly recommend this course if you are interested in learning Japanese, but you should just be prepared for the workload. I probably did the most work for this class, but I would still say that it was my favorite class this semester!",
    "Insane amounts of work. Yup, even more than Chinese. Tough grammar. Long drills. Confusing grammar patterns. You'll wonder to yourself why you went through with it. But somewhere along the line hopefully, you'll feel that it was worth it and realize how much you have progressed. Japanese 110 is taught by an amazing team of professors, and you would be robbing yourself of the opportunity to really get to know a cool language if you passed this one up. Be prepared for a few hours of work every day. That includes waking up early on both Mondays and Fridays, for you Juniors or Seniors who want to take a second language.",
    "I would completely recommand this class. Fun and very learning.",
    "If you're looking for a language class in which you'll learn a LOT, take it! It's definitely the most well-taught language class I have ever taken and the senseis are all amazing! They explain the grammar really well and class time is completely devoted to speaking practice, so you get the most out of it. Be warned though, the workload is *very* high. Chances are you'll be looking at at least 1-2 hours a night of homework, especially as the semester progresses, but you will improve a lot, even by the end of first semester! Not to mention, class is lots of fun and you'll enjoy waking up for class every day.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have already have a background in Japanese. Otherwise it would be pretty tough to keep up with the work.",
    "Definitely take that class if you are remotely interested in Japanese.",
    "I would recommend it if you enjoy taking languages. The staff is great.",
    "Very difficult language, at an almost impossible pace. But if you are committed (by which I mean 2+ hours of homework per day every day), it has its rewards.",
    "Japanese 110 01 was a very fun and interesting class, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. But I would only recommend it to someone who is willing to consistently do the required homework, for it is pretty easy to start falling behind.",
    "The class is intense, it immerses you in japanese from the first day. The teachers dont like to speak in english at all, so you have to learn japanese pretty fast. I would definitely recommend Japanese to any student who wants to learn a far-east language"
