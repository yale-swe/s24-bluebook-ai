    "Russian is exactly what one hears about Russian, a complex beautiful language that is quite rewarding when one puts the work in. I would recommend it to math and science kids who already have an affinity for Spanish or people who already have a language with a case system because these are the people that seem to thrive in this awesome course.",
    "Russian 110 doesn't require too much work as long as you stay up with the material on a day-to-day basis. It's a lot of fun making progress in such a foreign language and I would definitely recommend it to a student interested in Russian.",
    "I would recommend Russian if you like learning languages and are ready for a challenge. It's not an easy language, but if you put in the time, it's very rewarding, and it sounds so cool!",
    "TAKE IT. If you're looking to take a new language, this one is really fun, well taught, small and interesting. I looked forward to it.",
    "Absolutely -- it's a lot of work but well structured.",
    "I would definitely recommend first year Russian to anyone willing to do the work for it. Just be ready for an hour of homework every day."
