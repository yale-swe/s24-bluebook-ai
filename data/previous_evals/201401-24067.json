    "No, only if you need the class. There are other classes that cover more info within a semester.",
    "Yes, should be changed a bit for next year (with more student interaction in lecture) but fun course none-the-less",
    "This class is not what I was expecting. It seemed amazing during shopping period, but as a social science major I was disappointed because there was actually no discussion or interactive-component. It was all lectures. I feel like this class has a lot of potential, if re-structured to actually be more like a seminar, it could be really cool. Prof. Prober is quirky and can seem tough, but he actually is a caring Prof., something that comes through during the semester. Also, you do need math. You don't need to be a whiz, but if your math is rusty it could be a struggle.",
    "G&G105 is a great way to get a science credit. It is not too hard and some of the material is really interesting. That said, like most science credits for non-science majors, it isn't a great class. It was very boring sometimes and Dr. Prober did not allow students to use computers. I'd say take it if you need the science credit but otherwise there are probably more engaging energy classes.",
    "A survey of energy (generation, consumption). It is billed as a science credit for non-science majors, but make sure you still have a grasp on general chemistry and physics concepts if you want this course to make sense (this is mentioned in the description of the class). That being said, it's not a very difficult course. A few problem sets where a few questions might be very unclear--make sure you go to the TA to clear these up, but are otherwise very easy and straightforward. Exams are simple if you skim the lecture notes and relevant textbook chapters (not very long or hard to read).",
    "Definitely worth taking when you are interested in energy related topics.",
    "If you are interested in both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of energy and resources, then yes - I'd recommend it.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course. There are other science credits out there. While the topic is an interesting and relevant one, the format of the class was not conducive to learning. It is deceivingly capped at less than 20 students and then taught as a lecture and not a particularly engaging one at that. In addition, the problem sets are long, confusing and require a lot of random research.",
    "No. A lot of what is learned in the class I'm sure is better taught in other classes.",
    "Take it if you're in energy studies because it's a broad survey course. I wouldn't recommend it to people looking for an easy or fun science\/QR but that's ok. Not the most stimulating class, but it's what you make of it.",
    "Not as great of a course as I thought it would be. Although it was taught in a seminar setting, the bulk of the course was either Prober lecturing at us, or a month of \"group presentations.\" I was pleased with what I did learn, which was unfortunately not all that much, and I feel as though there's a lot more we could have learned.",
    "Unfortunately, this class did not live up to my expectations. The topic is extremely interesting, and has so much potential. This year, however, the lectures were rather disorganized, and it was often hard to really know what the main takeaways of each lecture were. However, given that this is the first time Professor Prober teaches this class (except for as a freshman seminar last year), there is a good chance that the structure will be improved next year. The professor seemed eager to hear our opinions, and I think he will work to improve for next year.",
    "Went into this for a SC credit expecting it to be as engaging as I usually find science courses for non-science majors (i.e. not), but ended up enjoying it way more than I expected to. Prof. Prober is very engaged, loves what he's doing and slowly but surely his passion rubs off.",
    "Take it if you are passionate about the material because if not it will get boring."
