    "I would recommend it because the material is interesting. However, don't expect most lectures to be exciting. Also, the exams were very hard.",
    "This class gives a good introduction to robotics, and the framing of the course as using robotic intelligence to try understand human intelligence was really interesting. There is nothing wrong with this class, but only take it if you need the credit for the major or if you're really interested. Otherwise, some lectures might end up becoming a little boring. As a survey course it gives a good introduction to robotics and balances theoretical knowledge and practical application of intelligence in robots.",
    "This class covers the behavioral approach to robot design, some particular algorithms, and a variety of other robotics topics. Overall quite interesting, and the discussion of behavioral robot design during the first weeks of class was enlightening. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in robotics.",
    "Solid survey class in robotics-- don't expect too much depth in any one topic, but expect to cover a wide range of interesting concepts and research within robotics. A word to the wise-- take it with Scaz if you can, Dr. Tsui seemed liked more of a substitute professor at times. Workload and grading is very reasonable."
