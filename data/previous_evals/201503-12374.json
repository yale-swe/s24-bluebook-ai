   "comments": [
    "This is a straightforward multivariable calculus class. I have taken MVC before, so this class wasn't too difficult, but it definitely proved challenging at times. I think it's an essential step towards taking higher level math classes, but it is definitely quite difficult,",
    "Tough class if you're not mathematically inclined. Taking it fall semester was a mistake for someone not so math-minded. Good course though, goes fast and the midterms are mostly expansions on psets. Shop it, but know that the harder stuff comes later and the beginning vector stuff is easy and won't really tell you how hard the later stuff can be. Consider taking it credit\/D and don't be afraid to W after the first midterm, or even the second.",
    "Overall a great math course! Prof. Gonzalez is extremely passionate, infusing humor into a seemingly dry subject. He teaches the concepts so well that you can't help but engaged in the material. If you work diligently in this class, a good grade is within your reach.",
    "I would recommend to another student. It can be difficult if you don't put in the work. Overall a good course.",
    "It is a standard calculus class, not much more, and not much less. If you need to learn Calc 3, take this class, otherwise if you're looking for some more interesting portion of mathematics, look for an elective spun towards another concentration. If you can, try to take the class with a post-doc rather than a graduate student, since they seem to be more prepared (for the most part).",
    "This is a very challenging, fast-paced course, but the material is interesting if you generally like calculus. If you take advantage of peer tutoring and office hours, you should be able to succeed. Jose is awesome and really cares about the class.",
    "A difficult but great course overall, would highly recommend.",
    "Tough class, very fast-paced. Exams were challenging.",
    "Math 120 is a thorough course and a difficult one. There will be many problems on homeworks, practice tests, and probably even exams that one may not know how to do, or are needlessly complex in their solution. These are what made Math 120 annoying and difficult at times. As for teachers, taking it with Jose was nice because he is very thorough and wants to ensure that each student is with him whenever possible.",
    "Math 120 essentially served to prime me with a lot of mathematics knowledge that I most likely have not grasped yet in a practical manner yet, in other words is a necessary step in pursuing whatever my interests are. However, some parts of the experience were quite brutal and almost demotivating in pursuing more math. I would recommend Math 120 as a fellow student mostly because I feel like it is a core mathematics class that will be necessary in most STEM fields. However, if someone is looking for a math class simply for the love of math, I would not recommend Math 120.",
    "I'd recommend Math 120 to another student, because it is doable if you stay on top of the work.",
    "I don't think anyone will be taking this class who doesn't already want to\/need to learn multivariable calc, so this won't change any opinions, but let it serve as encouragement - you'll have a good time and be fine.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to another student.",
    "Basic concepts in Multi; computation-based class. Take it if you need it.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend MATH 120 to other students. This was the first math class I took at Yale and everyone warned me that it may be too difficult or too fast-paced. While the course did move quickly, I found it manageable by reviewing the lessons before and after class and doing the homework a few days ahead of the due dates. The course is well-organized and not designed to trick students or place unnecessary hurdles in the way of their success. In contrast, the course is made to be fair because the exams were an accurate representation of problems we had done; homework similarly reflected the material taught in class. The practice exams that were provided were extremely helpful as well. There was also so much support available to help us through. My professor Jose was a very organized, knowledgeable, and excited lecturer. I looked forward to class because his enthusiasm was contagious and it motivated us to be invested in the course and work hard. He was very good at taking on our perspective as students and presenting material in the most easily understandable manner. His notes on the board were impeccably neat and he explained things in a logical progression. Furthermore, Jose was extra encouraging and frequently urged us to ask questions and visit office hours. He would remind us at least once a class that he would be super, super happy to answer our questions or help us in any way. When we did, he would always go far out of his way to make sure we understood the material and were comfortable. There was never a point where I felt hopeless, even if I was confused about a topic because I knew he would be more than happy to help clear it up. He took a personal interest in all of us and I always sensed he was deeply invested in the success of each of his students. I attended a number of review sessions and am confident Jose is one of the best Math 120 instructors in terms of teaching skill\/style. I was initially a little bit concerned whether I would be able to do well in the class because I had originally been placed into Math 115. However, I had taken the equivalent of 115 in high school and wanted to challenge myself. I am so glad I did. If one puts in the right amount of effort into this class, it is quite attainable. The design of the course is such that the complexity of the topics increments slowly and everything builds on top of each other meaningfully. Even though I am not generally one of those people who loves math, I loved this class. I raved about it to my suitemates, friends, and classmates. This class caused not only my knowledge of math to grow but also my mental skill and acuity. I am so glad I had the opportunity to learn from Jose as an instructor and know him as a person.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it- it teaches you valuable skills if you want to continue taking higher level math courses.",
    "This is a difficult course which is taught very quickly and covers difficult material. Do it if you have to, or if the material interests you; however, if neither of these describe you, then get your QR's somewhere else. With that said, Jose is a fantastic teacher. If you want\/need to take it, he's a good choice."
