    "I loved hearing from Joey, but it would have been helpful to break up the 3-hour class time with a bit more structure and intention regarding discussion and\/or other forms of active engagement and participation.",
    "The class was well-organized and built on itself. The one difficulty, and I know this was a scheduling issue, was that it would have made for a more logical sequence and better final project to have the session on advertising come earlier in the semester. That session might also have included a little more information about media planning and budget, in addition to creative. Joey was very generous with us this semester in giving us many sensitive and useful documents to review. One way the course could be improved as it continues to evolve would be to assign those documents, a few at a time, along with the different topics on the syllabus. I think it will help future students to break the reading out over weeks, and use it to inform specific discussions, rather than to get everything together.",
    "Syllabus was clear, it included pretty much everything interesting about commercial theater for nonprofit producers, and once Joey added paper examples, the stories, theories and concepts explained in class made much more sense."

    "Joey was a lively instructor, which brought the material to life. As such, he often spoke fast, which was challenging for some, particularly those who were not native English speakers.",
    "Joey structures his class well, explains things clearly, and is tremendously entertaining. We could see him working to be the best teacher he could be, and it shows. I have not doubt the course will continue to improve as it goes along, and future students are extremely lucky.",
    "Joey Parnes, though new to teaching and to YSD, is quickly becoming one of the most beloved instructors, and I would argue is THE PERFECT professional to teach this course. His extensive nonprofit management background helps him to translate between the nonprofit and commercial worlds, and he knows firsthand what nonprofit managers need to know when working with commercial producers because he's been on both sides. On top of him having the perfect resume, he is a teacher\/mentor at heart and understands pedagogy. He is an EDUCATOR in addition to being a professional - and is so without any teacher training. This is an incredible gift to his students."

    "I expect that I will retain overall concepts from the course and I walk away with a better understanding of how commercial producing works. However, there are so many details of the industry that I don't expect to retain, unless I apply those concepts in the near future.",
    "Joey does a good job of balancing the interests of non-profits in commercial theater - he knows his audience. I was happy, however, to learn about his work from any perspective. I now know at least what I don't know about commercial theater, which is a huge step forward.",
    "I learned way more in Joey's class on commercial producing than in the CTI 14-week course, which is mostly a speaker series."

    "It was challenging having people audit the course from outside of YSD. They lacked the baseline knowledge of theatre, which made the final group project particularly challenging. In the future, if non-YSD students are allowed in the course, I would ask that they a) take the course for credit, and b) demonstrate some knowledge of the theatre industry.",
    "Keep coming back year over year! The final project needs to have more parameters so that we can spend more time in the numbers and less time framing the project for ourselves. I'm not sure how useful putting together a production schedule is except to help us get more accurate numbers, but we didn't discuss the production schedule in class so it seemed to come out of nowhere."
