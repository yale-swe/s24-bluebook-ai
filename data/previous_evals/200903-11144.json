    "If you wish to advance your knowledge of Coptic, you must take this class. Any class that Prof Layton teaches, should be taken.",
    "Egyptology 513 01 is an intensive Coptic reading course focusing on Shenoute's Canons. The course deals with translation of primary material into good English renderings as well as understanding their place within the context of Shenoute's monastic federation. I would absolutely recommend it to another student, interested in improving their Coptic reading dramatically while reading fascinating material.",
    "I would strongly recommend the course to any one who would like to improve his Coptic skills and to have an acquaintance with the world of the monastery in early christianity in Egypt."

    "It deepened my understanding of the latest stage of the Egyptian language as well as providing fascinating insight into a period of history that I don't normally study. A fun and exciting way to expand my knowledge.",
    "I believe that thanks to the course I was able to make an enormous step with my Coptic, both in Grammar and in Lexicon."
