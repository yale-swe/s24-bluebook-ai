    "Identities is a course about how individuals and groups formulate their identities according to a number of factors, and it involves everything from discussions of essentialism to analysis of the political salience of difference. It's a great course for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of how individuals and societies view themselves vis-a-vis the world around them.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially to anyone who has ever had an identity crisis in their life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The reason I would recommend it is because I have never seen so many bright individuals engaging so passionately in conversation as I have seen in this class."

    "This course taught me a lot about different ways of thinking in different departments, and also it made me question almost everything I have accepted to be \"true.\" More than anything, this course made me feel like academia is worthwhile.",
    "Personally, this course helped me tremendously precisely because I am in a process of transition in my academic and professional pursuits. I have gone through a period of doubting my interests and not knowing what I shall pursue in the future. This course really broadens my thinking in such a way that I feel more at ease with taking the time to explore bigger ideas and questioning assumptions."
