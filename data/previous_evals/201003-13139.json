    "Chances are if you're considering this, it's for a major, or something along those lines, so you should know what you're getting into. It's not the prettiest of subjects, but ultimately, it's good to know, and required if you're going to do anything beyond it. It's really not as hard as people make it out to be, so shop it and see if you can hang.",
    "This is the natural continuation in material and difficulty to math 230, but it is a step up. Don't expect it to be a walk in the park, because it isn't. The homework is very difficult if you don't take advantage of Prof. Jones's office hours. The tests are quite reasonable, in general.",
    "This class covers a lot of material that Math majors need to know. The professor's style of teaching is only good if you already know the material (otherwise you'll only get confused.) Material isn't too hard. Some questions on the exam don't change from year to year.My advice for the class is learn the material before hand. Memorize the proofs for the exams and do really well on the midterm (it's worth 45 percent of the grade which is just dumb, but that's the way it is)",
    "This is a solid foundational Analysis course. It is very rigorous and requires a lot of work to finish the problem sets and study for the exams, but you will feel like you have a solid mathematical knowledge after you complete it. Prof. Jones is hilarious and a lot of fun, and he's extremely helpful in office hours-it's always worth going! Be prepared for very difficult exams, though.",
    "I would recommend this class especially if you liked and did well in 230.",
    "Definitely if you plan on majoring in math.",
    "Math 301 is a great course for anyone interested in pursuing mathematics in analysis. The course is taught very well, and although it is challenging, you will really learn a lot.",
    "This is a very formal introductory course in analysis, and as such will be very challenging to anyone with substantial comfort with formal mathematical proofs. This course will prepare you for the rigor of advanced math courses. Problem sets are difficult but manageable and the exams are certainly fair if you prepare heavily. Probably not very interesting\/useful of a course should you not be majoring in Math\/Physics\/Compsci etc.",
    "This class is the Compsci 323 of the math department: it really separates those who will succeed as pure math majors from those who will succeed as applied math majors from those who should probably study polisci instead. The problem sets are *very* difficult; plan to devote at least two nights to them. Jones lets you collaborate with peers, but this is a mixed bag: you really should do this as little as possible to get the most from the class. (Jones is hilarious but can be a little tough to follow.) The midterm and final are still difficult although you know what 25% of the exam will be like beforehand. However, all in all, this class is a character builder. Despite most likely having failed, I am glad I took it.",
    "This is an introduction to the basics of real analysis: sequences, series, convergence, basic topology, and calculus. Take this only if you have to, and pray that they have changed the text by the time it's your turn; our text, written by Beals, was mediocre. If you really want to learn this material, I suggest picking up a copy of Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis. Regarding the actual course: Prof. Jones was perhaps one of the most entertaining professors I've ever had, but he was apt to go on tangents, and his lectures generally just followed the same arc as the text. If you do take this, go to class, and pay attention whenever Prof. Jones suggests you \"do this exercise\" or says \"this is a good ___ \". There's a good chance that the objects being considered will appear in some capacity on a test.",
    "This is an important class to take if you want to be a math major. There is no way to avoid it. However, it is not a fun class. In fact, it is boring and tedious. Professor Jones is a terrible teacher. He is nice enough and tells funny stories, but his lectures are disorganized and unclear.Homework is time consuming and challenging, but if you go to office hours, Jones will tell you how to do the problems. So overall, if you read the book, go to office hours, and study what he tells you to for the exams you will be fine.",
    "Take this after 230. The professor rocks, it is manageable in terms of workload, and the tests are not too difficult if you go to the review sessions. They are effectively impossible if you don't though, so make sure you go or talk to somebody who went.",
    "I learned as much reading the book for 3 hours on the airplane in august as I did in the subsequent four months. Don't worry about the homework assignments too much, just memorize all of the problems from previous years exams. Prepare to be frustrated either way though, because the exams are designed to artificially stratify the grade distribution.",
    "The professor is great and the class is very interesting. The class is really difficult but if you took math 230 you should be alright. Definitely take it if you're willing to put up with the work - you will learn a lot."
