   "comments": [
    "This class was a fantastic survey of contemporary British fiction, with a great mix of genres (novels, poetry, movies, plays) and authors from all kinds of backgrounds. Professor Phillips has lined up an incredible selection of enjoyable works that, together, provide students with a great understanding of Britain's changing social climate and the literary texts that contribute to\/reflect that. As well as a literary approach, the material offered sociocultural, economic and historical lens through which to understand England in the 20th century.",
    "interest in british fiction, knowledge of english history, clear communication skills",
    "Dude. Wow. This class. Was challenged every single time we met, really had to engage with ideas, come prepared, defend opinions, etc. Really, really formative in making us think critically. Blew most seminars out of the water.",
    "Like any Yale lit course, this class teaches you a lot about reading carefully and thoughtfully, and writing strong, clear criticism. It requires that you be self-motivated since there are almost no graded assignments until the final paper. Most interestingly I would say it functions a bit like a comp lit course--you have to learn to think about things (i.e. class, race, gender) through a British lens rather than an American one, and the two are more distinct than you might expect.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the literary period covered, but I don't think my writing improved much in this class. I think I could have benefitted from weekly or biweekly reading responses and more constructive feedback.",
    "Greater knowledge of British Literature and history of the past 70 years",
    "From this course, I gained a great appreciation for the literature on the syllabus as well as the historical contexts of all the works. The interdisciplinary approach to seminar and presentations with historical background and literary close reading was really excellent.",
    "I gained a wide variety of new perspectives, and an understanding of British literary culture that I feel like I probably should have had earlier. Plus, the requirement to write a 25-page final paper is a huge challenge, and a super valuable learning experience."

   "comments": [
    "The class was well structured with manageable readings and weekly student presentations. Professor Phillips is an excellent seminar leader and engaged with the material in a way that I learned a lot from. Workload-wise the class is bottom heavy, with little to no laborious writing work until the hefty final paper at the end of the semester.",
    "incredible course! reading list is phenomenal",
    "Meeting twice a week might be an improvement, actually, to give us more time to sit with thoughts. Strengths are the great syllabus but mostly just Professor Phillips' great, approachable, human, and super challenging teaching style. It was really an intellectual space for all to engage, but the professor made himself known and guided the conversation well.",
    "Strengths: great reading list, reasonable reading load, brilliant professor. Professor Phillips thinks about literature more as a writer than as an academic, and I personally found that refreshing and interesting. Weaknesses: Short notification on deadlines (i.e. a paper was announced Monday, due that Friday). The course requires that you work hard and pay attention, and there's a very low bullshit tolerance.",
    "The strength of the course is unquestionably the readings. They're great. The biggest weakness of the class, in my opinion, was the structure and the atmosphere of the room. I found the course structure, which is so backloaded with the senior essay, to be extremely unhelpful. I also didn't find the professor to be very helpful encouraging students in seminar which often made for a tense atmosphere.",
    "The course material is a strength; the course could be taught better.",
    "The strengths of the class are surely the excellent books on the syllabus. The reading was not too arduous, and Professor Phillips led an engaging seminar that was complemented by well-executed student presentations. On the written assignments, it sometimes felt as though we received a lack of clear feedback and paths to improve.",
    "Besides Professor Phillips, this course's biggest virtue is the variety of texts. There are poems, plays, novels, and films spanning a gobsmacking range of locations and perspectives. I've been a little disappointed in myself as an English student for reading the works of mostly old white men, but this class had texts by women, POC's, and people from all over the socioeconomic spectrum. It's a great experience, and the reading is fun and engaging. The only weakness that comes to mind is that there is only one graded assignment. Professor Phillips assigned an earlier, shorter essay, but the whole grade is split 50\/50 between participation and the final paper, which makes it difficult to know how you're doing in the class until it's over."

    "I definitely would recommend this class to English majors without a shadow of a doubt. Learning from Professor Phillips is a privilege; he is such an accomplished scholar and writer and couldn't be better positioned to teach the material he has chosen to include on the syllabus. I've walked away with a deep understanding of all aspects of Britain since the start of the 20th century and some of the works we read have become real favorites that I will definitely revisit!",
    "absolutely!",
    "Absolutely yes.",
    "If you're interested in the subject it's a great class. Strong post-colonial angle, with a reading list full of stuff you may not have heard of but that turns out to be excellent (and you probably wouldn't read it in any other class). Great if you need a senior seminar, and totally manageable as long as you don't have a super heavy load of other writing classes.",
    "I don't think I could recommend this course. The readings are very interesting, but if you struggle at all with speaking in class or connecting with professors you will not have a good time. And of course a senior seminar final paper is gonna be challenging, but I've honestly never struggled more with a humanities class and felt less supported in my time at Yale. It was tough, and not in a good way. If you're really confident in the material and yourself and need an English senior seminar, maybe take it, but if none of that is true, skip it.",
    "Although the course features interesting material, I would not recommend the course to fellow students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I learned a lot from my peers and from the professor. It was well-organized and flowed very nicely between the novels, plays, and poems.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anybody in the English major, but unlike a lot of other upper-level seminars, I think it would also be a valuable class for non-English and non-Humanities students. The course work is super manageable--usually between 100 and 150 pages a week, and often less. Professor Phillips is one of the coolest professors I've ever had. He's clearly an expert in his field with valuable insights, but he never feels the need to take control of the conversation to show off; he lets the class run its course and allows the conversation to develop naturally. It's the ideal seminar situation. Plus, the texts are all fascinating and engaging. Don't tell anybody I said this, but this was the first English class I've taken where I've read every book cover-to-cover. Most of them are easy reads, and all of them are interesting. There are plays, novels, movies, poems, and they cover a crazy variety of perspectives. Almost all of them are books that I would have never heard of let alone read if I didn't take this class, and a couple of them now rank among my all-time favorites. **TL;DR: Take this class if you can. You will not regret it.**"
