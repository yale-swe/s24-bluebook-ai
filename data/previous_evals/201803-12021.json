   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Pak Indriyo is great. Give the man tenure. His first and foremost concern is teaching and making sure we learn -- not all professors are like that. Weaknesses: A little disorganized. Emails sent out at absurd times (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 a.m. emails are the norm. Be prepared for an assignment due in class to be mailed out at 4 a.m. the day of at least once).",
    "Very funny and fun.",
    "Strengths are showing up everyday, weaknesses are speaking the language.",
    "Strengths: Very fun and interactive class which makes learning a language easier. Weakness: It is an L1 class so I believe the professors should have spoken a little more English to avoid confusion on assignments.",
    "Strengths - Indonesian was a fun course. I was always excited to come to class. the Professor was really cool. Weaknesses - it took ages to get our tests and homework back. Sometimes months and i really found this was quite annoying. Also I kind of wish we had a real book for class and not just like a bunch of worksheets",
    "The learning in class was engaging and helped me quickly develop an understanding of basic structures and vocabulary. It might have been helpful to get more feedback on in-class assignments and activities.",
    "I thought it was a great learning experience and very interactive.",
    "Strengths - fun & engaging Weaknesses - not very well organised"

   "comments": [
    "I would. Firstly, Indonesian is actually an easy language to pick up and be relatively competent in speaking\/writing\/reading. Secondly, Pak Indriyo is a caring, hilarious teacher and his anecdotes are 10\/10. Third, you can put a ton of effort into this course when you have the time\/are able but during those hell weeks for other classes you can basically do nothing besides show up -- it's a very take-your-own-path type course. Also, the TA we had (Yudhis!) here on the Fulrbright is the GOAT. Absolute best TA at Yale, they should bring him on to faculty.",
    "Ya. Ada baik sekali.",
    "Yes I highly recommend.",
    "Yes, this course is very fun and interesting. Not only do you learn the Indonesian language, you also learn about the culture of Indonesia.",
    "yeah 100%! Indonesian was one of the coolest classes I've taken at yale. You will not regret taking it. the professor is good.",
    "Yes, Pak Indriyo and the TF's all took time to help the class become more comfortable with the language.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject!",
    "Yes"
