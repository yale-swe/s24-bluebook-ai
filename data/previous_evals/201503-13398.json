    "As the course syllabus says, a deep, slow read of one of the most pivotal early Christian texts. There is so much material in it that cannot be covered even with a whole semester; you gain so much from being in a bookclub-like seminar filled with people who are all interested in the same issues (how do we know God? what is faith? what is time) as you. Take it; it was one of my favourite classes at Yale. :)",
    "What can I say? This is the only class in which I've ever done the reading retroactively-- not because I felt like I had to catch up, but because I genuinely wanted to.",
    "This class helped me think about life, religion, morality in new ways. Or at the very least, the class allowed me to step back from my beliefs and ideas about life and reconstruct the arguments that supported my worldview. Any class that can do this is a good class. The Confessions transcend time, culture, and religion and can still remain relevant in our current context. At times, and especially in the later books of the text, the Confessions is simply too confusing to understand fully. This class will give you the opportunity to discuss and dissect Augustine's arguments in a seminar setting, and work to fill in the gaps of the reading. It helps if you are somewhat familiar with Augustine or Christian theology, or talented in though it is not essential."
