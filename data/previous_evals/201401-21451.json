    "An in-depth look at the theoretics and politics of performance, both historically and currently. Professor Roach is one of the pioneers in this subject and inspiring to learn from. Definitely not a class to be missed!",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in the subject! You won't be disappointed.",
    "Performance Studies was--unexpected. A fantastic deconstruction of the everyday, every day. A class of discovery and introspection--of placing myriad lenses on the world around us, so that everything exploded in kaleidoscope colors. A story-telling class, where the events of our lives could be held up to academic analysis and intellectual critique. It was truly beautiful. It was a unique class, that called for unique thought-- take this class. Take it not for the reading, perhaps, or the theory--but simply the pleasure of taking apart the everyday with the direction of one of the best professors Yale has to offer. A man who sees the beauty in everything. There's meaning--and gravitas--and delight--in the slightest sliver of an idea, the most mundane morsel of thought. A professor who cares for you, the student, and whatever you may have to offer, be it the guilty pleasure of a sneeze or the rite of passage of a Mory's cup.",
    "A brilliant class for any and all students. Take this class!!!!",
    "Performance Studies is great. I took this class to build a foundation and vocabulary about studying performance, and it was supremely useful, fascinating, and enthusiastic. It's an incredible field, and class discussions were great. I particularly appreciated the opportunity to express myself and apply what we learned to life experiences in the class's 3 short papers."
