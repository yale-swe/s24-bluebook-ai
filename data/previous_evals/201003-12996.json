   "comments": [
    "EPE 215 is a lovely way to get a grasp on the Western Cannon, so if that's what you're looking for in a course, you should totally take this! Kapustin's coverage of the material makes it possible to really get a grasp on reading these texts and discussions are meaningful and not to be missed!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Poli Sci or EP&E. Especially for underclassmen who have not yet applied to EP&E (If you get in the class) it is a meaningful presentation of why and how the three topics should be studied. Take this. Professor Kapustin is excellent.",
    "Even though you have to take it for the major, take it with Prof. Kapustin. You will not regret it. Highly recommended for anyone interested in some of the most critical thinkers of the last three hundred years (plus Aristotle).",
    "Absolutely. One of the best classes you will take.",
    "Fundamental material for any thought regarding the foundations of society and economy. Few professors succeed in making philosophy as directly relevant and meaningful as does Professor Kapustin. Excellent class.",
    "Everyone, regardless of major, should take this course with Kapustin. This was the best course I have taken at Yale (by junior year), both for its great reading list, brilliant interdisciplinary connections, and awesome professor. The authors are great, as they span the three disciplines and while not all are famous, all are relevant and brilliant. Indeed, my thoughts about life and the way institutions around me were constructed completely changed.Professor Kapustin is absolutely brilliant: he is simply riveting in class and speaks with so much passion, enthusiasm, and conviction; he draws fantastic connections in and between the texts that enhance understanding; he entertains every person's thoughts and makes them feel comfortable in class. You will learn so much from him and become very excited about the material.The reading is a fair amount, and takes a long time if read well. However, as there is only a midterm and final, not everything needs to be read. Pretty fairly gradedTake this!!! Take Kapustin!!!",
    "I cannot even begin to express how incredible an experience this course was. Experience is really the only way I can even come close to adequately encapsulating this course in one word. I believe that there are angels among us, and Prof. Kapustin is divinity manifested among men. I have never had a seminar professor who commanded our respect and admiration from the very first class. Every word in his meticulously-crafted discussion has meaning for understanding the fantastic texts we have the opportunity to read. As someone inculcated in the Western Canon as a frosh, reading Aristotle and Hume once more alongside Hayek, Ferguson, and Schumpeter among others not only informed the way I treated those works from antiquity, but it opened my eyes to how our culture has developed with the advent of the commercial arts and capitalism as a global force. On top of all of this, the collection of students in this course was ridiculous. Everyone was on their A game all the time, everyone had something meaningful to add to the discussion, and the course illustrates what happens when you put extremely capable, motivated students with a brilliant professor whose gravitas makes doing the reading a non-negotiable act.One of the greatest courses Yale has to offer with one of Yale's true luminaries. Take it if you can.",
    "Take this class. Take it with Kapustin.",
    "Classics of EP&E takes a look at a series of philosophers who were pivotal in the development of western thought on the subjects of EP&E. If you have any genuine interest in these topics, you won't regret the time invested in this course.This is a great course, and Kapustin is a masterful teacher. The only ways in which I was ever the slightest bit disappointed in this class is when time ran out and we hadn't gotten as far in our discussion as we might have liked--but that was only because the discussions were so good to begin with that they took serious time.",
    "Greatly recommended for everyone, including non EP&E majors.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. If you get a chance, take a class with Kapustin."
