    "Excellent course to really get to understand your own writing! A must take at Yale if you can get in. Credit D would be good cause unless you know you are a great writer, your grades will suffer.",
    "If you want to learn how to be a better writer through the process of writing a lot, totally take this course. But if you want to gain skills you might take a different writing course.",
    "This class was not as illuminating or life-changing as I thought it would be. I am glad I took it because I enjoyed the exercise of writing on a daily basis, but I definitely don't feel like a different person after taking it, which is kind of the way it had been portrayed to me beforehand. As a non-English major, I think some of the appeal was lost on me.",
    "Take this class if you already feel comfortable as a good writer and just want to write more. Do not take this class if you're looking to become a more craftful writer or want to carry a thought beyond 300 words. This class is great to get words on the page but lacks a total vision and leaves you with a bunch of words and not much to do with them.",
    "Definitely take Daily Themes if you care about writing you'll improve just by the fact that you're sitting down every day to write something new, and creative. This class can be a lot of fun if you enjoy creative writing, and if you're willing to venture outside of your comfort zone on some of the prompts. That being said, if you have a busy semester, it'll be hard to fit in the time to write daily, and to actually enjoy the process. The tragedy would be if you come to resent writing because you take Daily Themes when you're really too busy for it. It's a wonderful experience, but it does require dedication and a personal commitment to writing and striving to improve. Students should be warned: take this credit\/d to start out, until you get to know your tutor. I thought I was doing pretty well until my tutor shared what my grade would be, so have an open conversation about this early on and again at mid-term!",
    "Take it. Laid back and enjoyable class. The work load seems overbearing, but honestly, a week of themes can be written in about 1\/3 the time it takes to do a Diff EQ problem or approximately 1\/2 required for another STEM class PSET. Be for warned - Professor Zarin's lectures are painful to sit through, but otherwise the class is really great. Enjoyed writing my themes far more than I thought I would. Take the class with a group of friends.",
    "Definitely in my top five classes at Yale! I loved that we received regular feedback from the tutors. It was so fulfilling to write themes every day, to be able to pour out what was on our minds and know that someone would read our writing. The lectures were pretty boring, though, and most people ended up not even showing up to them.",
    "If you're interested in writing, you should absolutely take this class. I can't even begin to say how much I've learned over the semester. And don't be intimidated if you're a STEM major - I made it happen, and it was 100% worth it!",
    "The act of writing and the meeting with the tutors is the best part about he class. The lectures with Professor Zarin were generally pretty pointless, but the guest lecturers were good for the most part. I'd definitely recommend the class-- especially if you get a good writing tutor.",
    "Take this class if you want to see a drastic improvement in your writing. Though the lectures are extremely boring, the class will teach you how to write better. You write five themes\/week with the supervision of a tutor, and you are forced to improve\/edit your previous work at the end of the semester. It was an extremely rewarding experience that taught me a lot about how I write, but maybe take it CR\/D if you're not that good of a writer in the now.",
    "I enjoyed the assignments and the accountability, but I found the lectures un-engaging and unenlightening.",
    "Definitely take this course! It is certainly work, every day you do have to write, but it is so enjoyable and worthwhile. Your writing improves a lot, you learn a TON about yourself, and you have fun doing it. It feels so good to look forward to doing your work! And everything that you do you have so much freedom with - you can write about anything and explore any topic. This is a legendary course for a reason, and I think if you feel like you can commit to it, you will get a lot out of it.",
    "ENGL 450 is a great course for both English and non-English majors who are interested in creative writing. It's amazing to see how much you've written by the end of the semester--and know you've written almost every single day since January! Would highly recommend.",
    "Take this class! But take it seriously and put in the work, what you get out will be amazing",
    "Good class, become better at writing, lectures could be improved.",
    "Your experience in this class is totally dependent on the tutor. Even if the lectures are brutally boring, which they can often be, you will get a ton out of this class if you click with your tutor. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but you'll know after one meeting whether or not you should stick with them.",
    "Yes, take this class if you are willing to write 300 words per day, five days out of the week. If you're like me and put things off until the last minute, however, perhaps reconsider, because it is really frustrating to be up at 2 a.m. and realize that you still have to do your theme for the day. (On the other hand, this can tap previously unknown sources of unbridled creativity.)",
    "I had a fantastic experience, but it varies by tutor and who happens to be teaching the lecture. The lecturer this year was Cynthia Zarin, and she was spectacularly unhelpful. Focus on your relationship with your tutor -- they give great advice. This class taught me that writing every day is not only possible, but a really fun exercise. I'd highly recommend for anyone looking to get into the habit.",
    "Daily Themes was my favorite class this semester, but I would recommend it with reservation. First, your experience really depends on your tutor--mine was amazing. Second, it is a huge time commitment and I would only recommend taking it if you can make it a priority, otherwise you'll just get frustrated. Third, Professor Zarin is a better seminar professor than she is a lecturer. That being said, it is the best way to learn discipline in writing (no matter what your field) and at the end you come out with a considerable body of work that you can expand and return to.",
    "Not worth it. Write on your own everyday-- you'll get more out of it than taking this course. Professor Zarin's lectures were beautiful but way too confusing, and she read directly off the page. My tutor often seemed not to have even read my themes before our meetings, and spent most of them talking about anything but writing. Overall disappointing, probably the worst class Ive taken here so far.",
    "Like I said, if you don't do daily themes you're either a coward, a fool, or someone so ignorant that you just haven't heard about it. It's Yale's crown and it brings out your best whether you want it to or not. Also, the minimum work per day is 250 words: that's SO little. If you really are a human sloth that survives on rare moments of energy expenditure\/genius, you can excel in the class, because it doesn't demand hard labor, rather a little organization and a willingness to look closely and 'know thyself' etc. If my friends don't take daily themes after all my panegyrics on it, I'm not sure I can speak to them ever again.",
    "Wonderful course. Everyone involved is dedicated to Daily Themes and to making the students more thoughtful, better writers. Professor Zarin's lecture style isn't for everyone, but I don't believe it's easy to lecture about a course that essentially centers itself around free-form writing. That being said, she was always organized, and I enjoyed how we studied various themes from week-to-week. I'd absolutely recommend this course to any Yale student, especially seniors. It's an excellent way to feel more comfortable as a writer and to feel more comfortable about one's life and Yale experience.",
    "I LOVED this class, specifically: -My tutor. She invested so much in her students and it showed both in her kindness and in our work. (If you get Shifra, you're extremely lucky.) My one-on-one sessions with her were frequently the highlight of my week. -The act of writing everyday really does wonders for your craft. I consider myself a GOOD short-form writer now, and I was a poor short-form writer before! -This class actually forced me to reflect a lot on my life in ways I hadn't before (by virtue of having to write about so many things, you have to find things to write about!). That was invaluable. -The guest lecturers were often amazing, especially Michael Cunningham's. -The prompts were often really interesting, creative challenges. -Reading the X-themes was a valuable way to grow as a writer. The only thing I didn't love were Cynthia's lectures. I came away from her lectures feeling that I had learned very little about writing. They were often too cerebral (and not practical enough) for me. In fact, I wish we had spent more time in-lecture looking at\/discussing actual writing. I also felt her 'who\/what\/where\/etc' strategy was ultimately ineffective, but maybe that's tied more to my thoughts on her lecture style overall. That said, REGARDLESS of who teaches the class, if you're lucky enough to get in, definitely take it! A highlight of my Yale experience.",
    "If Zarin is teaching it, then no. I personally loved the class, but that had nothing to do with the professor and rather the basic fact of writing 300 words a day. If you like writing, and are a creative person with diverse interests, then this class will be a cakewalk and extremely fun. If not, it could be hell, especially because the lectures are USELESS and will be the biggest waste of an hour fifteen minutes each week. Unless you are a senior, wait to take it until the English department realizes that Zarin-a brilliant person-is not meant to be teaching this class. Even if she is teaching it, though, I would say that this is a great class with the wrong professor. I enjoyed it anyway, but could not consciously recommend it to someone knowing the potential for what this class could be.",
    "Take it if you want to write about stuff, which is the course's essence.",
    "I was excited for the opportunity to write every day, but it quickly became my most time consuming class. I would warn that daily writing does not mean the writing can be sloppy -- each day's writing is criticized for its style and content. It was exhausting. The lectures are pretty useless, so overall I would recommend this class if you are interested in responding to a prompt every day.",
    "It's a lot of work - take this Cr\/D even if you think you can do it, because everyday is a LOT OF WORK. Weekly tutorial sessions can be helpful if you are willing to talk about your work, be critical of it and try to see where your writing can go. Lectures are rather boring, unfortunately, although they have the potential to be better with more engagement of students during lecture.",
    "Daily Themes was amazing! I think a lot of it depends on how you get on with your tutor, since that relationship can really be a defining point of the class. My tutor (Professor Shifra Sharlin) really made the course great and memorable. I'm extremely grateful to her for her kind guidance throughout the weeks and thoughtful feedback each week during our morning meetings. She was very instructive but also gentle, and she really helped me find my voice by the end of the year. I feel that I really grew as a writer thanks to her. She has a kind and supportive demeanor that really makes you comfortable in challenging yourself and trying out stranger prompts that you may tend to shy away from. She also went out of her way to make the class even more special to her students, like hosting a dinner where we read each other's works and making a coffee for me early in the mornings during our meetings! Daily Themes has been one of my favorite classes at Yale because of Professor Sharlin.",
    "Daily Themes is a very unique course based on daily writing in response to specific prompts. Those prompts are varied, sometimes linked and sometimes stand-alone. The course provides a very rigid structure insofar as the writing must be done in 250-350 word pieces every day, but I really allows students to write about whatever they want in pretty much any style they want. Non-fiction items can be integrated, personal memories, or whatever interests the student may bring can be brought out as the themes are often quite general. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is curious about writing, wishes to improve their writing, or simply wishes to explore personal memories or the way writing can be a discipline and therapeutic."
