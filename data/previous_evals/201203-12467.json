    "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't interested in bio, because it can get fairly dull even if you are. But it's a pretty good and an informative course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Physio! The class has great lecturers (even the bad ones are better than any chem\/physics\/ intro bio teacher I have had.) The material is so interesting that I almost looked forward to studying for the exams and memorizing it. That said, it is A LOT of material, so be prepared to study hard before exams. The readings aren't necessary to do, and there is way too much to keep up. I got the book Physiology by Costanzo, and that turned out to be far better than the actual text book in terms of explaining things. You should still buy the text book because you may need it to answer the weekly take home quizzes. I started studying a few days before each exam and have done fine so far. Some people say that how well you do in this class\/ howmuch you enjoy it is a good indicator of whether you have what it takes to be a doctor. This is entirely false. My sister hates physiology, and she is an oncologist, doing just fine. Don't let this class determine the path of your life. Take it and ENJOY it for the cool material! Just know that it is not an anatomy class- it explains how organs in your body work, which is way more interesting.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!!! This class is a lot to digest, but you really do learn so much. Pretty much all of the professors are amazing and the lectures are always super well organized. The TA's are all amazing as well, especially Sascha.",
    "There's just too much material to go really in depth with any particular system. The book sucks, and I do not understand why it is the official course book. Oh wait, it's because the guy who wrote it is one of the lecturers. Yeah, that might be it.",
    "If you are interested in how the different physiological systems in the course work, definitely take this course whether or not you are premed. The lecturers for the most part are great and they really care about the students learning and not about their grades.There seems to be a lot of material but just focus on the lectures and read the sections in the book that corresponds to the material (there's a LOT of extra detail in the book that is not necessary).",
    "A decent amount of work. The quizzes and tests are resonable if you put the effort in. I learned a lot and found it very interesting.",
    "As a Biology major, having taken the usual smattering of core classes for the major, this was my first elective within the major. It was, by far, the best science class I've taken at Yale. Don't be intimidated by the material: it is voluminous, and can sometimes be a little in-depth, but there isn't a person who took the class that hasn't said it's the most they've learned in one semester. You really start to think of what's going on in your body on more than a holistic level; I feel like I have a much better understanding of the application of the biological principles that I trudged through in years past.If it wasn't good enough already, the only work for the class would be the weekly quizzes (which they give you full credit for granted that you go to weekly sections), and all the tests were multiple choice and true\/false. Definitely not like any otherscience class I've ever taken. In a good way.tl;dr - TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT",
    "Great option for MCDB credit or for pre-med biology class.Great science class for non-majors if you are interested in how the body works.",
    "This is a very intensive class but you will learn a lot. Totally worth it for sure.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! This class is one of the best science classes in the biology department, if not at Yale. It's very organized; the weekly quizzes are essentially ungraded because you get a 100% if you attend section for the week; the two midterms and final were very fair in my opinion; the exams are MULTIPLE CHOICE and T\/F (it's been too long since I've since this format--i.e., since high school), which is awesome; and the systems discussed are really interesting. This is a class you don't want to miss.",
    "Amazing course, but pretty difficult at times. There is a huge amount of material that is all incredibly fascinating, while at the same time extremely detailed and complex. Definitely look forward to taking this as you'll leave with an unparalleled understanding of the human body!",
    "This was a great class that required tons of work, time, and energy. The biggest flaw of this class is that the instructors fail to provide you with a concrete \"big picture\" summary after every lecture. Thus, you get stuck memorizing all of the little details (thinking that these details will be on the exam). In reality, there are tons of little details on all of the exams (particularly the final) but they were totally not the details that I ever expected. Overall, this was a very good class. The material was interesting, but the instructors really need to choose a new textbook. 1300+ pages of B&B just doesn't do it for me.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, very useful and not super difficult.",
    "This is an interesting, dynamic biology course focusing on organ systems. In my opinion it's the only course at Yale that's directly relevant to what one would learn in the first year of medical school. It is A LOT of work\/studying if you expect to do well, so expect to make sacrifices for this course. I would recommend this class only if you have at least 9 hours per week of study time to put into it. You'll learn a lot. Weekly online quizzes, 2 midterms, 1 final.",
    "yes i would recommend this course for the material you learn in it, but its definitely a lot of work",
    "I would",
    "Highly recommend whether you're premed or not. Great to understand how the body works!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!! This is THE best-taught science course I have taken at Yale. The professors are wonderful lecturers and approachable if you have any questions. I didn't even realize I read a 1200 page book by the end of the semester because of how manageable it all was. Lectures are engaging and easy to follow and I frankly don't know why you'd not want to come to class to hear these professors and doctors speak! Usually science professors tend to be better at doing research than lecturing, but that is NOT the case here. Everyone, including the guest lecturers from the medical school, is wonderful.Exams are multiple choice and true\/false, which I personally prefer to short essay, were a welcome respite from other science class exam types. Also, piazza, the online component of the course where you can ask questions that other students, professors, or TAs can answer, was very helpful! It's a wonderfully run course and the professors really care about the students, which is not a feeling I often get in other science courses. So please don't hesitate to take this class! I really don't think you'll regret it. I'm not premed, and I didn't need this class for my major or any general requirements, but I'm so glad I took it. It was actually fun, and incredibly informative. I really gained a greater appreciation for the human body and for the power of a great professor!Also, I did not feel like it was any harder than other science courses. I actually found it easier in some respects, as you're really only responsible for material covered in lecture, and the clicker questions help give you an overall sense of what the exam questions will be like. The readings aren't long at all and the weekly quizzes don't take up more than thirty minutes or so (also you get full marks for the quizzes if you go to section! I recommend Kseniya's section as she is absolutely WONDERFUL. She goes over the material we covered in class and connects everything together really well). JUST TAKE THIS COURSE! :D",
    "Recommend for sure. Take it. Even if you're not premed! Though it would help to have some interest in biology or anatomy. It's fascinating to learn about how everything works!!",
    "The workload is manageable, don't stress out about reading the book, you only really need to know what is taught in lecture. Definitely an interesting and rewarding course.",
    "Great class about physiology. Major amounts of info crammed into the class, but well worth.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!It is amazing and the best class I've taken at Yale. The 2 midterms and the final are all multiple choice, everyone gets perfect credit on the homework, so that part isn't so bad.But the material is so fascinating, you learn so much and yet you learn it so well you never need to study.",
    "This class is wonderful. The fact that it's three times a week for 50 minutes is actually really great; the material is easier to digest. The professors are clear and understanding and experts in their field, but do a really good job explaining the tricky parts. The class is engaging and you learn a great deal. One of the best science classes at Yale.Also if you can, get Kseniya as your TA.",
    "Physiological Systems provides looks at the mechanisms behind the several body systems we cover (muscular, respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, nervous, endocrine, and reproductive...did I miss one?). The professors are super awesome, and my TA was cool. There are weekly online quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final. The discussion sections are super helpful.I would definitely recommend taking this course. It helps you understand how the body works, what is involved in maintaining a steady state, and gives you an appreciation of the human body.The reading is about 80-100 pages per week (which is a good amount considering it's from Boron& Boulpaep). Keep up with the reading, and you'll do great!",
    "If you are an MB&B major thinking about going into a career in medicine or in academia, it's a great class to figure out what you like. Personally, I discovered that I am much more interested at the molecular aspect of physiology, which wasn't very focused on in the class. Often, the material went into scant coverage (at best) of important biochemical principles that govern physiology.",
    "The only downside is the amount of information that you have to memorize for the tests. For us, the midterms and the final consisted of multiple choice and true\/false questions. I almost wish there were some free response questions because it would be nice to show a deeper level of understanding.",
    "Yes. Very tough and time consuming, but it's really interesting.",
    "Expect to invest some time into the class, but I can't name a class that is more worth it. Definitely take it wanting to apply to med school. If by the end of the term, you don't think taking this class was the best shopping period decision you made, you might want to reconsider.",
    "Great class! Tests are not comprehensive or fair though.",
    "Yes, take the class! Although it is a lot of information, you will leave the class feeling intelligent because you have learned SO much! It will also help you in the medical profession -- seeing what system of the body interests you most.",
    "Great overview of a very broad topic. You will learn a lot of relevant information.",
    "Really liked the class. Gives you an accurate taste of what med school classes would be like. A difficult class, so be prepared to put a lot of time into it! Find a system of taking notes in class, whether it's typing notes or writing on the Power Points. There were people that absolutely LOVED the class, but I didn't feel the same way. I really, really liked the class, but it wasn't my absolute favorite. The things were learned were very applicable and you often read about the stuff we learned in other places. I would recommend this class.",
    "Great course if you're interested in physiology\/med school\/how the body works. Great lecturers overall. Don't stress too much about the details because the exams only test the basic concepts. Get Sascha as your TA!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. The material is extremely well taught and all the professors are extremely committed and dedicated. It is, however, a rather hard class that will require a lot of your time in order to get a full understanding of the topic and draw all the necessary connections to perform well on the tests (which are vey fair). I would also recommend taking Cell Biology before enrolling in Physiology.",
    "Physio was a great class. Well organized, good TAs (especially David, he was phenomenal),and all the lecturers were great. There is a LOT of reading and it is very hard to stay on top of it all, but the class is still very manageable even if you aren't quite able to keep up with the reading.",
    "I would not take unless I had an easy courseload to where I knew I could dedicate a LOT of time to this course",
    "Very rewarding course with super interesting material. You work a lot and you learn a lot. Take it if you have the time to devote to it.",
    "The class has a LOT of material. I've literally never read more through a class's textbook than in this class. The class went through about 20-30 pages of the textbook per lecture, which doesn't sound that much until you realize that there's 3 classes in a week and about 4 weeks per midterm\/final. The final is also cumulative, so you theoretically need to cover ~1000 pages in the textbook. I've found that the final focused mainly on the renal system and the material from the third segment of the semester though. The different lecturers that taught us were all phenomenal, so although there was a lot of material to cover, I believe the class was well taught and the midterms and final fair.So if you're prepared to do a lot of work, but feel rewarded for it, do take this class! Otherwise, stay far far away.",
    "It's a good introduction to all the different systems in the body. It goes pretty in depth for each one, considering the time constraints and the amount of material. It got a bit scary at the final when you realize there are SO MANY things that happen inside a person, but the material is really cool and interesting to learn about. I would definitely recommend it, both to bio majors\/pre-meds and to non-majors like myself, who are either just interested or need an upper-level bio credit for their major.",
    "Very good course, possibly my favorite at Yale. You learn pretty in depths about mostly every bodily process you'd want to know about. Obviously a great class for pre-meds, and a lot take them so prepare to work hard in studying for the exams",
    "This is a great class and very comprehensive for intro physio. The multiple lecturer system works very well for this class. It's really not a lot of work. The weekly quizzes are a pain, but no work other than those. Just don't waste time reading B&B - too many unnecessary details that won't come up on the midterm.",
    "I would, but I would warn them that the sheer quantity of material is really hard to keep up with, especially with the degree of specificity expected. Might be a good class to take credit\/d\/fail if it isnt required for med school or the BENG major. Otherwise, it's a time drainer and the class is excessively competitive.",
    "This is a GREAT course. The material covered is fascinating and it is taught very well. I like the change-up of professors, with different lecture styles. Work load was good, weekly quizzes were fair and the reading was manageable if you keep up. Exams were very extensive, though, so study ahead.",
    "This is a textbook class about physiology. You'll learn someinteresting material, and the lectures are all very clear and well delivered. The notes are extremely useful and you only really need to study those.Tests are multiple choice\/true or false. You have to learn a lot of material. Again, a good intro class, but nothing I'd rave about.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course! It is one of the best science classes at Yale (if not the best) and you really learn a lot about your body. It is a lot of material to handle for one semester, but you get a big overview of physiology and a taste of the material you might encounter in medical school. A lot of the students are premedical students (I am not one), but I find physiology really interesting and loved taking this class!",
    "This was a great course with just far too much information for me to grasp. Saltzmann was a great lecturer and while it was one of the best bio classes I've taken, I def didn't feel like the information emphasized in lecture was the focus of the exams. I was told by previous students that lecture provided all the relevant exam info and that reading the 204394393309 page, dense textbook wouldn't be necessary. The book was just so dense that I don't think I got too much out of it. That being said, I wish that lecture was a bit more focused on what lecture would be on because the textbook was so dense.",
    "An excellent class. I would totally recommend it, even though it requires a lot of studying. Totally worth it and if medicine is something truly for you, you will discover that by taking this class. If it's meant to be, you 'll love it. I did. One of my favorite, best-taught classes at Yale. A gem in the sciences.",
    "100% take it!! It is such a great class, you walk away with so much knowledge about how the body works. It is also very well taught, which is hard to get with a Yale science class. The guest lecturers are mostly really good too. One of my favorite classes so far. My TA, Sascha, was also the absolute BEST. Granted, it is a lot of memorizing before the midterms, and the textbook is so dense that it's almost impossible to understand, so you have to pay attention in class. But overall, very worth it and if you're interested in biology, definitely take it!",
    "This was a really great class. The material is incredibly interesting and the professors are very good lecturers. Although there is a lot of information, tests are fair and teaching fellows are very eager to help.",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly. This is a great course for the BME major or for anyone who is studying biology (and a great course for premedical studies, too).",
    "It's a great course and you learn a lot of information. Incredibly useful as preparation for medical school and beyond.",
    "It is a very interesting class but there was really a lot of information to take in and can be very overwhelming at times.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Hands down one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. It doesn't matter if you are pre-med or not, science major or not. The human body is fascinating, exciting, and amazingly complex, and this course really inspires a sense of awe and appreciation for the things our bodies do (often without our knowledge!) every single day. All of the instructors were phenomenal, and even though exams were fairly difficult and there is a lot of material to learn, my view of life and the body has fundamentally changed thanks to this course.",
    "Classic, meh Yale science class. An interesting subject that at times lived up to its potential, you would probably enjoy this a little bit more if it weren't at 9:30 AM. You may as well take this if you need science classes (I'm looking at you, pre-meds) although you probably won't be hugely inspired. Word of advice: don't buy their textbook. Use the one by Costanzo.",
    "YES - it's great! It's a comprehensive overview of almost every physiological system in the human body (down to a cellular and molecular level), so if you like learning how body systems work in a lot of detail, you'll love it. Yes, it's a ton of information, but the class is structured really effectively, which I think helped a lot. There's a weekly online quiz due every Monday morning (really more like homework because it's open-note and you get full credit if you go to section that week), which helps you review what's covered in lecture each week. Also, the professors rotate andteach the topics they know best, which helps keep things fresh. I thought all of the professors were excellent. I also can't emphasize enough how helpful section is for this class. The TAs really know what they're talking about and help you pick out the key concepts and overarching themes for each system. I was in Sascha's section for part of the semester and Katherine's for the other part, and they were both fantastic. The exams (2 midterms and a final) are entirely multiple choice and true\/false, which can be really stressful. The textbook is huge and goes into a lot more detail than you generally need to know, so when studying for the tests I usually found it most helpful to go through the lecture powerpoints slide-by-slide and then look things up in the textbook when I needed more detail or didn't get everything in class.",
    "No.",
    "The lectures are very interesting, but the course is fast paced with lots of information. Weekly quizzes (full credit if you go to section), two midterms, and a final.",
    "A class definitely worth any BME, MCDB, MB&B, EEB or pre-med major's time. The course was well taught and the lectures were divided up according to the professor's expertise. It was highly beneficial to have multiple lecturers who could best teach their portion. The course could be improved by dividing it into two semesters for a more thorough examination of each of the body systems. It left a little to be desired in that we were so limited on time.",
    "A lot of information on the major organ systems of the body. Occasionally interesting, though my academic interests are at the subcellular level. A lot of information but manageable.",
    "It covers the physiological systems of the human body and is a fairly intense course.",
    "Take it!! You learn so much about the human body, and it's so fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this class, even if you are just interested in learning more about the human body. It is not easy, and there is a lot of material, but definitely doable.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are considering BME. It is a lot of work but is rewarding. There are plenty of resources and I felt like I could have done better in the class if I had reached out more to the professors and TFs. Keep up with the work as the reading gets overwhelming if you fall behind.",
    "I would recommend BENG 350 because you learn so much about your body and it's definitely worth taking.",
    "There is a LOT of information to know but if you go to all the lectures, do all the reading, and put time and effort into studying, none of it is all that difficult.",
    "Yes. But be prepared to work really hard.",
    "Overall, this was a good course and I would recommend it to another student. However, I offer a warning that the material is a lot to get through and the exams are strenuous. They are all multiple choice and true\/false, which may be good for some students or a major Achilles heel for others. A few lectures were boring, but mos were interesting. Weekly quizzes were helpful, but a little bit of a nuisance when the questions were unclear or never addressed again on the midterms.",
    "It's a great course and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in physiology.",
    "The profs are all solid and you will gain a more relevant understanding of the body than from any class at Yale. That said, this is a difficult class, and if you aren't premed and\/or aren't willing to put in a lot of time outside of class reviewing and reading the marathon length textbook chapters, you might struggle. A bio background is more useful for the sake of knowing how to take multiple choice biology tests than for the actual material; I (a physics major) went into every exam thinking I knew most of it and could deduce the rest, and I found out that that's just not how biology works. Still recommend it though.",
    "Although I learned that I do not enjoy physiology, many students enjoyed this class.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've ever taken. There is a lot of material and by the final it can get a bit overwhelming but it is completely doable! I found the material fascinating from beginning to end and lectures were always a pleasure to attend. Cell bio was extremely helpful in building a foundation to take this course. Weekly online quizzes,section, 2 midterms and a final. TAKE IT!!",
    "Incredible class. Take it. Exams are hard, but fair and the material is extremely interesting.",
    "You'll get a thorough understanding of the human body systems. In fact, since this class is just an introductory overview, you'll probably be interested in learning even more about a specific system. Unfortunately, this is again just an introductory class, but it's great nonetheless.",
    "Take this course! It's a great bio credit, and if you're at all interested in the human body, you will enjoy it.",
    "very good bio class. i would recommend it",
    "The best lecture course I've taken in Biology at Yale. Take it take it take it. You learn a LOT but it's very well structured, very clear what you need to know, and the professors are all pretty interesting lecturers which is crucial for a 9am. Great for pre-med. Interesting class in general. And not too hard, all the tests were multiple choice + true false, and you can get full credit for the weekly quizzes by trying somewhat on them and going to section",
    "I enjoyed most of the lectures. There's a lot of true\/false on exams which can be frustrating. Weekly quizzes are generally helpful if you take time to do them well.",
    "Take it! It's a great course and covers a lot of interesting material. However, beware, the exams cover a lot of material and there's not much of a curve.",
    "Make sure you're interested in the material, because there's a lot of it. The midterms and final exam are multiple choice though and you get 100% on the quizzes as long as you go to section.",
    "I would recommend Physiological Systems to another premedical, biology, or biomechanical engineering student without hesitation. The lectures were interesting and many clinical correlations were presented. Event though the text was dense, section discussions and the Piazza website created plentiful opportunities for material comprehension. Frequent guest lecturers made each class enjoyable, and they were consistently able to condense the reading material into direct and well organized slides. All professors were available outside of class and were genuinely interested in the material they presented. I would take this course again if I could."
