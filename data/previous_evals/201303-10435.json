   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a fifth class. Also, I would recommend this course to anyone who is genuinely interested in learning about the various dances in the world and their greater significances. While this class does not assign a lot of work (2 in-class essays and 1 term paper), I honestly believe that a student who actually does the assigned readings and attends lectures will gain a tremendous amount of knowledge. Also, Professor T. invites various dancers to perform\/ teach us their respective dance.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking for a fun class. Especially being a BME major, this class was a nice break from the sciences and math classes that take over my schedule.",
    "Interesting primer on African contributions to American culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student, regardless of their major. It is really enjoyable and the workload is pretty manageable.",
    "Easiest class ever. This is what I like to call a 12 hour class. You spend 1 hour studying for the first test, one hour for the second test, and about 10 hours total for the research paper. As far as I could tell, everyone got A's unless you really gave 0 effort. Thompson is hilarious, but who really knows because I attended 4 lectures total. Solid gut.",
    "the workload is non existent. two in class tests with really vague essay questions so they're easy to answer. and one ten page paper at the end but the range of topics is really wide. i wrote mine about beyonce. basically: gut.",
    "Take it if you want a fun gut class. If you're looking for something more serious, look elsewhere.",
    "I think this class was awesome. The content was interesting, the course load was more than manageable and Master T was THE BEST. Definitely take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It was great and not too much work.",
    "I would recommend the class because it has interesting subject matter at the base of it, but I was a little disappointed because Professor Thompson was hard to understand, and, as a result, I could not absorb all the knowledge from him that I wanted to.",
    "TAKE IT IF IT'S OFFERED. You don't have to be an athlete to enjoy MAMBO",
    "Take it, Thompson is great and he's not getting any younger.",
    "Great class if you don't mind the loose structure.",
    "You learn about how indigenous African culture influenced black cultures in the New World (NYC, Brazil, Cuba, etc). It's really cool and you dance and sing in lecture.Everyone makes mambo seem like a total gut, but it doesn't have to be. If you read Thompson's books you will definitely learn and gain an appreciation for African art and philosophy. If you're black or latino you'll probably take this class more seriously than most of your classmates, because the subject matter relates to you viscerally.Overall, a fun class, not too hard to get an A if you put in the work.",
    "This is a truly great class. Yes it's not a massive workload (though grading depends on your TA.) However, don't take it because of that. Take it because it's a great class. And don't skip class! Although you can definitely get away with missing many classes without sacrificing your exam grade too much, class is where it's at. This is the only class I have felt this way about in my Yale career. There is too much cool stuff going on to miss.",
    "Great class. Take it.",
    "Interesting and entertaining gut class taught by a legendary professor. Highly recommend.",
    "It is an excellent course in which you delve into the rich history of African American culture. It does not require a background in the material before taking the class but it is really fun and I learned a lot.",
    "I would summarize this class by saying it is a broad overview of how African principles of art, music, and dance migrated to the New World via slavery, and how they persisted and spread in this hemisphere, and a study of their different manifestations, such as different types of dance and styles of art. I would definitely recommend it because the topic is fascinating and you learn a LOT of information.",
    "Fairly easy course. I know many people who don't go to class and are able to do well on the tests. Lectures are structured relatively well, but they can be hard to follow at times.",
    "It's not as easy as some people make it out to be, but it's still pretty easy.",
    "Would describe it as somewhat interesting and not a lot of work. I would say it was a good fifth class.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a wonderful class to take. It is very culturally enriching and Professor T is amazing.",
    "Mambo is often fun. You don't just learn about dance, but you can actually dance -if you want to. I think it's a good course for any student who wants to try something new without endangering their GPA. The class is not difficult at all, but if you immerse yourself in the reading and lectures it can also be an enlightening and entertaining experience.",
    "TAKE IT! Do not graduate from Yale without taking a class with Prof Thompson. He is so passionate about the class and makes it very entertaining by making people dance. Two midterms and a research paper so not much work at all.",
    "I loved MAMBO! It was one of my favorite courses that I have ever taken at Yale so far. I found the course material extremely interesting, and now, I have an entirely new framework to speak about modern dance and music. To me, Mambo is the essence of the liberal arts education. I loved the blend of lectures, music, and dancing that the class had.",
    "It fulfilled an art history requirement for me which was definitely a huge draw but also if you're looking for a relaxed class take this one. the work is minimal as is required attendance.",
    "Great class, Master T is a great lecturer and the topic is interesting.",
    "If offered again, take it. Master T is an old fellow so seize up the opportunity if possible!!",
    "Yes x 100",
    "don't take it. worst class. not worth it",
    "I would recommend it because you learn a lot of information you don't find in every course, and I would recommend that people do the reading because it's great.",
    "yes i would recommend it if you want a cool class without much work",
    "Easy class with interesting subject. Id take it again in a heartbeat",
    "I didn't take this class.",
    "If a fellow student asked me, \"is this class hard?\" I would respond \"Can a butterfly sing?\"",
    "It's exactly what you expect to be.",
    "a must take",
    "NY Mambo is not a class; it is an experience. You'll get the most out of this class if you go along for the ride. Master T is truly an accomplished professor and I have tremendous respect for him and his work. That being said, your grades can vary greatly based on your TA and their standards.",
    "Overall, African American Studies 112 (\"Mambo\") was a great class in which you have 100% of the control over how much you get out of the class and what grade you get at the end. I wish it had been a little bit more structured (I didn't know who my TA was until more than halfway through the term) and that the syllabus and readings had been a bit more informational and directive, but overall I took this class seriously and I was rewarded highly for it. The class is structured so that you don't *have* to take the class seriously to get a passing grade, but I recommend to anyone and everyone considering Mambo that you do at least some of the readings and go to most if not all of Professor T's lectures. Seriously, just get out of bed and go to class. Professor T is THE MAN and he is not just \"a scholar\" or \"an authority\" on Afro-Atlantic traditions. He lives the life, he walks the walk, he is THE expert on all of this because he has experienced it all. He brings his experience to class every single day and has the most amazing stories to tell you. Take this class, GO to class, and do some of the readings. You will learn so much and have a great time doing it!",
    "A good fifth class, a good break in the day.",
    "Take this class if by some miracle Master T teaches it again.",
    "AFAM 112 is a very interesting intro course for a young student looking for either a major in the field or just an interesting lecture course without a huge workload.",
    "AFAM 112 discusses the Africanizing influences that envelop our everyday lives. Africanization is everywhere and AFAM 112 opened my eyes to the various cultures that exist and where they all began. I would strongly recomment AFAM 112 to another student. It is fun, covers interesting material, and has taught me a lot about New York City Mambo.",
    "AFAM 112 is a very fun and lively lecture with a lot of class participation. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "A great course on the history of traditional African music and culture and its transmission to the Americas.I would recommend this class.",
    "take it; go to class; you'll get something out of it",
    "African American Studies 112 01 is a very interesting class where you are taught about African principles of song and dance and how these influences are seen in many other types of dance. THis is a very fun and upbeat class with lots of music and dancing.",
    "YES",
    "Of course I would take this course: there are too many positives! Just make sure you actually go to lecture, since they really are brilliant (if you can hear them!).",
    "I would describe Mambo as a fun, get-away class. It is an interesting way to break up a rigorous schedule. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Definitely recommend! Low stress, aside from the days prior to the two exams. You learn a lot, and Master T makes the class very fun!",
    "Mambo is a course on African dance and culture. Take it because Master T is awesome and the class isn't much work- 2 test and 1 paper",
    "Easy and informative.",
    "Very interesting class. I would strongly recommend taking it because it offers diversity in a class schedule.",
    "Pretty cool class.",
    "Mambo is a great class! It is focused on such a unique and interesting subject matter that the class is inherently interesting and fun. Master T is an incredible person and professor who is so knowledgable about this subject matter and has so many personal life stories that enhance the class (he is also just super cool and funny and a good dancer). Sometimes the class can get a bit disorganized and frustrating since most of the class does not show up for lecture (including some of the TAs). But you get out of this class what you put it. It is a very manageable work load and the paper is fun to write because it can be written about basically anything related to the class (which means a lot of cool and relevant subjects can be discussed). Ultimately, a great, fun and manageable class with one of the most famous and intelligent professors at Yale.",
    "If you're hesitant, take it!",
    "Good class!",
    "Take it!",
    "Highly recommended. Interesting course material",
    "This is an interesting course. Prof Thompson is def a gem but can be hard to follow at time. Be prepared for little structure to the class which can be frustrating. Nevertheless, you will become acquainted with a lot of different aspects of black and latin art, dance, and culture. A cool course.",
    "If you want a gut, this is it. If you want to actually learn this stuff, you'll learn. In short, take it no matter what you're looking for in a class.",
    "It's an extremely fun class and the research paper is a rewarding assignment that I enjoyed.",
    "This class is great. The gut of all guts. However, don't be deceived\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you actually have to do work for this course. If you pay attention and show up to lectures you will be fine and scoop an easy A.",
    "Despite what you have inevitably read from others' comments, there is some intellectual value in taking this course. Yes, Master T makes this class as silly and work-unintensive you've probably heard, but there's some interesting takeaways in terms of the development of New World art forms. Frankly, it's fascinating to think how African art traditions affect so much of American Black culture. This class is the ultra-gut, but if you come to class, expect to learn something!",
    "Good",
    "Interesting class. Definitely opens up the world of African art and culture. Not a lot of work. Midterm, Paper, Final. Easy to get lulled into a sense of security, though. Take good notes in class so you can do well on the midterm and final.",
    "I would recommend it. It is an interesting look into a topic I never expected to study. Master T knows what he is talking about.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because it is easy and not a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend it because it is a very interesting class that doesn't require lot of work and you learn something different that may be somehow useful in your other classes or in your life.",
    "Afam 112 is more difficult for how easy it is rumored to be. If you want to be a good student and show up to class, but are reluctant to participate in the activities (like me), it is difficult. There's a fine line between sitting too far forward to risk being called on and too far back that you can't hear the professor. I suggest either going to class and trying really hard to take good notes or doing the readings. I personally did not do any of the readings, instead I would skim through the books before the exam to find details to write about.it is also helpful to have a friend so you can compare notes, that is not to say that you should depend on one another to take notes because sometimes he talks so quickly it is helpful to have two sets of ears listening.",
    "It's an amazing course, especially with Professor Thompson. It's full of insight into History you would never have thought that you would find in this course. It's kind of like learning what the epitome of cool is.",
    "Great class I genuinely recommend it.",
    "I would describe African American Studies 112 01 as a course where one could learn a great deal about West and Central African culture, especially as it has manifested in the so-called New World. Though, I would recommend it only to those who are looking for cultural enlightenment but not intense, intellectual rigor and who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard of hearing.",
    "I would recommend it for an open-minded student who wants to learn more about dance in the African diaspora. I wouldn't recommend it for someone thinking it'll just be another easy class.",
    "Easy, only stressful for a few days of the semester.",
    "A tracing of black creativity from africa to the contemporary mambo.",
    "Yes take it.",
    "A great course where you learn about something that is quite interesting!",
    "Supposedly the administration told Master T not to give out as many A's. I don't think T listened. Great class that will always be taken as long as Master T is teaching.",
    "Although this class is considered a gut, you can get a lot out of it if you go to lecture and listen to Prof. Thompson. He is a brilliant professor who's really passionate about the subject. I greatly enjoyed his enthusiasm and I learned a lot from him. He brought guest performers from the area for the units on capoeira, bomba, and others and even had Sabrosura, Yale's Latin dance team, teach the class how to dance to bachata and merengue which I enjoyed a lot. Other times he would show films, some that he shot himself. Overall, this was a great class and I'm glad I had the opportunity to meet and learn from Prof. Thompson.",
    "For a student looking for a very interesting class that is rewarding in the end, I recommend taking this class. The workload is manageable, and the material is very interesting to learn about and discuss.",
    "It is a good class to learn about dance and history at the same time.",
    "This class is an interesting and fun way of learning about different African dances and customs. I highly recommend this class for other students, mostly because my overall experience was excellent and I felt as if the lectures were very informative. AFAM 112 was very rewarding.",
    "really great gut. You don't have to go to class, sometimes the lectures can be very funny though and the prof is crazy, in a good one! One final paper of your choosing, midterm and final that are just made up of essays. Your grade on these really depends on your TA, but most people did well if they studied.",
    "Mambo is a survey of the organizing principles of African art, music and dance and a study of African influence in modern artistic styles and cultural expressions. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, regardless of his or her level of understanding of or interest in the subject matter. Take it, you won't regret it.",
    "definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to experience a true master of a subject",
    "Easy humanities credit."
