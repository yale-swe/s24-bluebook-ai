    "yes, absolutely",
    "This is a fast-paced, heavy workload course that will require a lot of effort each week from the student, especially if he\/she has not taken a transport before. The second half of the course (from turbulence onward) cover \"specialized\" topics, while the first half covers the foundations of transport phenomena.I would recommend the course to anyone whose research involves studying transport phenomena, because there is no other course comparable to this at Yale in terms of the range of topics covered.",
    "It is a useful course for students whose major is chemical engineering. I highly recommend it to fellow student.",
    "I would summarize it as a great course covering a wide range of important and interesting topics in transport processes, which provides students with a really solid theoretical foundation for pursuing a deeper study in any transport related field. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student for this same reason.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is helpful for all engineering students.",
    "Yes I would."

    "My research involves modeling thermodynamics and transport of CO2-water mixtures for the purposes of CO2 sequestration. The lectures from the first half of the course will be especially useful for my research. The lecture on boundary conditions will probably be the most useful one for me, because our formulation involves a moving gas-liquid interface where we don't assume that the \"commandments\" like no-slip are true.",
    "Transport is related with many engineering problems, especially thermodynamic problems. Lots of my group members do research prjects which are closely related to transport. Hence, this course can help me understand colleagues' research better.",
    "In my opinion, it has helped me clarify a lot of concepts I had learned about in the past and which are somehow part of my everyday work, but it also has introduced me to new aspects of transport that could be really useful for my research in the near-future. I really believe having taking this course will have a positive impact in my dissertation and my future career as a researcher.",
    "This course is helpful to my research. I'm working with porous materials and this course made me understand transport in porous materials in depth.",
    "This course gave me a wider perspective on chemical engineering problems"
