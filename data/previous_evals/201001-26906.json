    "cool topic, interesting books, not too difficult. i'm glad i took it.",
    "Class was decent at best, but wouldn't jump to tell someone else to take it.",
    "A great way to learn about the period, the prominent figures, and their literary contributions. Not very comprehensive, however. I would recommend it to anyone unfamiliar with the period, but not to anyone looking to prove deeper than a standard survey course.",
    "Would take this course again. Strength is that it met only once a week and allowed for freedom of interpretation for the texts. Interesting reading material and an inviting atmosphere for the class.",
    "I would summarize this course as an overview of the literature and main issues in the Harlem Renaissance, looking in particular at the literature. It covers issues of gender, poverty, racial identity, and North\/South tensions, among other things.",
    "An examination of black literary works during the Harlem Renaissance, with special attention paid to the authors' personal lives.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course."
