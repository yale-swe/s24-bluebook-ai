    "Anthropology 502 is a course that discusses a range of conceptual themes in ethnographic methods. The literature covers types of fieldwork, developing a site, ethical issues, and the role of the anthropologist in the field among others. I would recommend this course to someone who wanted to learn more about what anthropologists do. I would not recommend it for learning how to apply for funding or for the specific methods one might use in the field.",
    "Yes. Good course to get a sense of ambiguities in anthropological practice.",

    "This course established my knowledge and understanding of anthropology as a discipline. The methods that Professor Siu taught me will apply not only in the construction of my senior thesis, but will also apply in my future career plans asa doctor. The curiosity and sensitivity to difference and the invisible yet structure within the absence of community or cohesion is something that I will always seek out.This class has taught me how to think in an invaluable way and I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to participate in this class.",
    "This course provided me with an extensive background on the various approaches to ethnographic research in anthropology. The written project for the course was a project proposal that will be developed further and eventually submitted with my applications for funding. The exercise of thinking through the project and figuring out how to frame it as a research project was incredibly helpful in furthering my dissertation research. Professor Siu provided a lot of insightful and constructive feedback that assisted me in this process.",
    "The mock grant exercise was very useful.",
    "good overview of issues pertaining to research design"
