    "If you're interested at all in anything privacy, control, and technology, take this class. Like freeculture? take this class. Want to go to law school? Take this class.It's a writing credit taught in a Law School format that's worth every minute you savor.I would take it again if they allowed me.",
    "I just finished CS185, And if you ask me how I'm feeling I would have to say sappy - a combination of sad and happy.Happy, because I got into and took one of the most rewarding and unique classes available at Yale. Brad has incredible passion for the material and the class discussion was intense yet relaxed at the same time. We learned a lot, we had a good time. Brad understands the college student position, and definitely leverages this knowledge to his pedagogical benefit.Sad, because the class is over. Perhaps I will just take it again like so many of those students from last year who would keep showing up anyway.",
    "Take this class! It is ridiculously good. We know the game and we're gonna play it--it's totally worth the Friday meeting time, and Brad is awesome. I learned so much and had a ton of fun.",
    "Inside we both know what's been going on. This is a sweet class. Take it if you can get in! You will have to do 3-4 page reading responses every other week, which was a bit of a ride on the struggle bus, so just start them early.",
    "You're too shy to say it",
    "If you're a student that wants a chance to have serious, fun, meaningful, and enjoyable conversations about modern technology, you're in luck. I know your heart's been aching, but this class is here to cure your wounds. You'll have a great time, forget you're learning, and realize at the end of the semester that you now have a true grounding in the topic at hand.",
    "We've known each other for so long [Take it. It's lots of fun, but you learn so much relevant information that everyone who uses the internet should know. Pretty reading-intensive at the beginning.]",
    "Control, Privacy and Technology is a fantastic class. I would definitely recommend taking CPSC 183 before you take this class. CPT is a great class - its definitely alot of work but it is clear what is expected of you. Brad is never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. This year the class also had a really active panlist, and I think we are going to keep it going after this year so we're never gonna say goodbye (unless you want to and thats cool too).",
    "ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION HANDS DOWN. Brad Rosen is THE BEST. If you love law, are interested in law, have a sense of humor, use facebook and\/or gmail, care about where the world is going as far as social media, etc. you should take this class. Brad Rosen cares about his students in a refreshing way. He will make you laugh and think and you will leave the class knowing so much more about the technological world we live in and the problems of big companies, privacy, etc.Honestly? You wouldn't get this from any other guy.",
    "TAKE IT. My favorite course at Yale. Brad is an amazing, engaging teacher. The material is fascinating and relevant. Courseload consists of one reading response every two weeks and a final project. CPSC 185 is honestly the best class that I've taken at Yale. If you get in, do yourself a favor and just take the class. You won't regret it.Never gonna run around and desert youNever gonna make you cry",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in anything related to privacy, technology, or law. You will never take another class like this \u0096 unless you take a second course with Professor Rosen.",
    "Never gonna give you up,Never gonna let you down",
    "Absolutely take it.",
    "Definitely take this course. I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling -- this course was one of the best during my time at Yale. Brad is a wonderful professor, the workload is fairly easy (although you'll certainly have to put some mental energy into it, just not a lot of time other than the final project), and you get to learn some pretty amazing stuff about privacy, who controls what information, and how these things work together within the law. I really gotta make you understand, this course is worth every minute. If you've gotten to reading the reviews you're obviously somewhat interested, and if that's the case definitely try to get in. You won't regret it.",
    "Would recommend. This class is a good primer on the current issues of privacy policy in the face of evolving technologies, and both the novice and expert can benefit from the subject matter and the discussions.",
    "YES.",
    "You're an idiot if you don't take this class. Never again in your Yale career will you get a more balanced class between intense learning and substantive conversation. I love this class and so will you. I promise.",
    "This course is highly recommended. Challenging readings, but very interesting course material and discussions.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter, you need to take this course. It was one of the best classes that I've taken in my four years at Yale. You learn a lot and cover a lot of material, and this course was one of the most fun and enjoyable classes that I've taken. Brad is a great instructor. I came to look forward to class every week, partly because of the content of the class, of course, but also because I enjoyed having Brad leading the discussion. He's not afraid to make fun of himself or joke around to make the class more fun, and you wouldn't get this from any other guy. Overall, I highly recommend this class. I came to look forward to attending it every week, and that's saying something considering that it was held on Friday afternoon this year. It is unique in its subject matter and a great experience.",
    "\u266bA full commitment's what I'm thinking of...\u2669\u266c",
    "Ok, so you know the rules and so do I, getting into a top seminar at Yale can be an incredibly difficult and lengthy process, but I can tell you beyond any shade of a doubt that you absolutely must (MUST!!) do everything in your power to get into this class. I could not have picked a better class to end my Yale experience, and I say that having taken a number of the \"must-take\" classes from Yale greats. Brad is everything that you could want from a professor: he's entertaining, he's interesting, and at the end of the class you'll realize that amidst all of the fun you've been having you've also learned a really tremendous amount about internet privacy and the state of the law. He went above and beyond for our class: bringing in regular snacks, sharing some of his own experiences with privacy to help us to better understand the concerns that exist, and even inviting Edith Ramirez, a commissioner of the FTC, to come speak with us about the framework the FTC is working on for regulating the Internet. Wow. If you've already taken Brad's lecture, you know how special he is and that you MUST TAKE THIS SEMINAR. If you haven't, you should change that immediately, because he is truly one not to be missed. There's a reason why he's one of the only professors able to hold a seminar on Friday. :)"
