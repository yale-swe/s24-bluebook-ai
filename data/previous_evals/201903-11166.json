    "Thorough understanding and appreciation of Italian language and culture.",
    "I significantly bettered my spoken Italian, as well as my grammar, writing, and reading skills.",
    "This course reviewed a lot of the verb tenses and grammar that was covered in L1\/L2, but in more depth so that I now feel a lot more comfortable using them in conversation. It also incorporated a lot more vocabulary, and focused on conversation fluency.",
    "Continued to develop my Italian skills. More thoroughly studied grammar concepts introduced in L1 and L2, built my vocabulary, speaking ability, and reading ability. Learned about Italian culture through articles, films, comedy YouTube videos, and cartoons.",
    "I practice a lot of the Italian that I learned over the summer. It encouraged us to be comfortable speaking in class and sharing with others in Italian.",
    "How to speak Italian",
    "I learned to write effectively in Italian and to engage in conversations in Italian.",
    "Developed intermediate level Italian grammar knowledge. Through application of this grammar while writing as well as speaking, my knowledge of the language was expanded.",
    "I learned a lot about Italian government and culture as well as practicing and advancing my knowledge in Italian language. We reviewed past grammar and then continued on to more complex tenses."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - professor, minimal homework Weaknesses - class 5 days a week, sometimes tough material",
    "It felt like we really didn't need to meet five days a week.",
    "Strengths- the Italian department is very engaged and has a lot of events going on that make it easy to get involved, the grading isn't really tough, all the faculty in the department is very kind and welcoming, the culture activities and films are interesting, the workload isn't intense at all Weaknesses- the only real downside to this class was the textbook cost: we were required to buy it new to complete online activities before the exams which were helpful but not worth the $220 in my opinion. If the department could somehow supplement this or not make it a requirement, that would be really great.",
    "Strengths: Fairly straightforward, not too much work, great look at Italian culture and politics. Weaknesses: Not particularly exciting, level of engagement by the class was sometimes very low and made it hard to focus.",
    "You will benefit from the course as much as you invest in it. It emphasizes communication and fluency, which I appreciated. On the other hand, it can be boring sometimes, if the topic that the instructor picked is not interesting.",
    "The strength of this course is the size of sections and the engagement of the professors. One weakness is that it meets everyday.",
    "I believe the course was structured in a very logical manner. More current material built upon old knowledge in a great way. A weakness of the course might have been the relatively strict emphasis on grammar and less material on culture, etc.",
    "This course requires Italian Tables as part of the grade, which are helpful for learning the language but do not always fit schedule-wise. It would be nice if there were more regular cultural events that weren't at meal times that students could go to. Instead of something everyday during lunch hours, there could be some sort of regular practice or gathering a few days a week in the Romance Language Lounge that could count toward that participation. More than just occasional film screenings. This course is strong in that the department really wants students to succeed. It emphasizes understanding and fluency over just getting things right, and there are a lot of opportunities to learn from mistakes."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Teresa is the best! If you take L3, take it with her.",
    "Yes.",
    "Definitely! Italian is such a beautiful language and the culture is so interesting. The department here is very chill and has cool events going on all the time, so I would definitely recommend it for students wanting to improve their speaking skills.",
    "I guess if you have to fulfill your language requirement, this class would be a good one. But it is not particularly fun. However, I think out of the various L3 language classes, it's engaging and not too much work.",
    "I would recommend it because you need to finish your language requirement anyways.",
    "Yes, because it is a laidback language credit",
    "Yes! Italian is a fun and beautiful language and Teresa is a kind professor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It really pushes you to apply the language as well as provides you with the tools to become quite fluent. I left the course ready to move to Italy.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in continuing study of Italian. You just have to be sure that you have the time to actually practice with and engage with the language. The course, like most L3 language classes, meets everyday, but daily practice outside of class is really important to do well."
