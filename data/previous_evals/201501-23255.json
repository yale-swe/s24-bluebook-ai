    "It is a great class and will improve your spanish even more! Always try and speak and answer because that really helps.",
    "Great class to take - I would recommend continuing with the language if you are passionate about it in 130.",
    "140 is a very good continuation of the sorts of material you learned in 130. There's a bit more emphasis on literature, as you read a lot more passages and even a ~50 page novella, but all of the material is actually really interesting and speaks a lot to the issues facing Latin America from Columbus to military dictatorships. Furthermore, I came in feeling like I was going to tank Spanish- 130 was seriously a struggle for me, but in 140 I felt like I really hit my stride and learned a lot. This was not all due to the better curriculum, as I feel that Janelle Gondar, who is literally the best Spanish teacher I have ever had, really kicked me into shape and helped me learn the language. Take the class if you have to, or even if you don't have to and are looking to learn Spanish. Your best language-learning years are behind you, but now is the second best chance to gain fluency.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in pursuing Spanish, especially with Prof. Gondar",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Spanish abilities. I recommend taking it with Professor Gondar because she is excellent.",
    "Spanish 140 is a great class for advanced Spanish speakers who still want to learn grammar and improve their reading, writing, and speaking skills. The class teaches complex grammar, new vocabulary, and helps students speak more confidently.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course especially with Janelle Gondar",
    "This course is good for honing skills in Spanish grammar, and also improving fluency and speaking skills. It is a nice balance between reading, writing, and speaking. I would recommend this class to someone interested in furthering their Spanish fluency in preparation for studying abroad."
