    "Yes. The texts were well-chosen and exposed the students to a wide array of subject matter.",
    "The course covered a good variety of genres of texts that are written in both Sumerian and Akkadian. We discussed issues such as which text was the original, how to deal with differences between the two languages, a variety of sign forms, and other issues. I would recommend the course if you read both languages and are interested in more exposure to these topics.",
    "I believe this course was an excellent source for anyone interested in a Sumerian-Akkadian bilingual discourse. During this class, we read several bilingual texts which provided excellent opportunities for students to compare and contrast the two languages side by side. I stongly recommend NELC students this bilingual course work."
