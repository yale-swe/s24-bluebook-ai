    "Two hours, three times a week can seem like a lot, but it was definitely worth it for this class. 1.5 Credits and a much more engaging way to learn the material when the lab is included during class hours. Take it especially if you have trouble with bio because the small class allows for specialized attention if you do not understand a topic and need further explaining.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.The class is small and students receive a lot of attention and support from the teaching staff. It is a really great way to get an initial exposure to science and research.",
    "A nice class for a non-science major. It was little work but it I do not recommend taking it.",
    "The lab section of this class and the topic (antibiotics and antibiotic resistance) are very interesting, but sometimes the class doesn't quite feel like a real science class. The lecture part is not terribly engaging."
