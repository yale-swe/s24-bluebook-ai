    "Teaches you how to draw conclusions. A great seminar in which to learn how to be in a seminar. You dive elbow-deep into sometimes complicated primary sources and do critical and comparative analysis of their implications. Some background knowledge of the region recommended.",
    "This class is a whirlwind, intense examination of modern Arab thought. If you haven't taken any MMES classes yet, this is going to be very difficult for you but will be very worth it. You learn an incredible amount in a short time, and as long as you keep up with thereading you'll be fine. It's heavy, but mostly worth doing.",
    "If you're up for some often dense reading - political philosophy, deconstructionism, etc. - and feel like taking the road-less-traveled when it comes to Middle Eastern Studies, this is definitely the course to take."
