    "- Highly recommend writing an independent essay because it provides a lot more freedom and flexibility than writing it in a seminar",
    "I would absolutely recommend completing your senior essay as an independent study as opposed to in a seminar. By far, everyone I knew writing independently got far more out of their senior essay experience than our peers in seminars. Take advantage of the opportunity to deeply explore a topic you care about. Your undergraduate career will be over soon, and you're going to want something to show for it.",
    "Definitely make this an independent project -- it's really fulfilling to work on something independently.",
    "Both stressful and rewarding. In my opinion, worth it, but make sure there's something you care enough about to write 50 pages on."
