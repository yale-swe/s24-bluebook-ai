    "Weekly readings teach you about gamelans context in Indonesian culture and class time is spent playing the instruments",
    "one of the best courses I've taken at Yale - this is truly a gem of a class. Class time is essentially all rehearsing and a lot of fun. It's not stressful and very little work. I learned how to play at least 4 different instruments, and I got to really study Indonesia.",
    "Absolutely take this class! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! So fun and a cant miss experience.",
    "This is a great class! You should definitely take it! It's super fun and really different from other classes. There's a fair amount of reading and writing that goes along with the music, but it's worth it!",
    "An opportunity to learn about an intricate foreign culture",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! You end up learning a lot about Indonesian culture and the interplay between religion and the arts. We had a weekly reading (about 10 pages) and video, with some short reading responses (just a couple of sentences each). This class was also a LOT of fun. Playing the gamelan is relaxing, even though it sounds a little weird at first.",
    "Gamelan music is very different to anything you've seen before. If you are interested to learn about a different musical style, even a different way of thinking about what music is and why you create it, then I would recommend taking this class. Also, because it is quite a different style, it is also quite accessible to students who have no\/little training in Western music.",
    "I would for sure recommend this course to another student. It is an opportunity to learn to play an instrument that you don't need any experience with in a manner that introduces you to a culture, music, and context that for many students at Yale is new; proving to be a worth while and rewarding challenge."
