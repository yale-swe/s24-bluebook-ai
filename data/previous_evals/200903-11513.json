    "Excellent class. Be careful though as the entire grade is basically the final paper. Class sessions are organized thematically which is a useful way to approach the subject matter.",
    "This is a fantastic seminar. There is not that much reading (compared with other seminars), and the reading is fascinating (unlike other seminars). The course packed is predominantly composed of primary sources, which allows us to really understand what was going on so many centuries ago. There is a long paper at the end, but Prof. Marcus definitely helps you along theway. The deadlines that he sets in the syllabus are great to get you thinking about your topic. I would definitely recommend this class because there was not a crazy amount of work, but I still got A LOT out of the class.",
    "the reading material is very interesting if you like the topic. honestly, a seminar is 90% the people in the room and 10% the syllabus; i didn't have a great experience, but that doesn't mean the course isn't good.",
    "This class was sort of unusual in that although it is a history course, it covers things more by theme than by time period or area. You learn more about ideas\/concepts than specific events or happenings. I would recommend it if the course descriptions sounds interesting to you, but otherwise I wouldn't.",
    "I would recommend this class but would also recommend having some basic background.",
    "You read a lot and write a 20-25 page term paper (due the last Thursday of classes). A lot of reading but not a lot of work otherwise besides the paper. Definitely start research early on the paper! Check out books early too. We had weeks where discussion was kind of dull, but in other weeks it was interesting. If you're interested in the subject and passionate enough to write a term paper about it, then take it."
