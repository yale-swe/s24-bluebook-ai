   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to others. It isn't too difficult. Talk to your TA about your paper topics before you write it because some of the prompts are confusing. Go to lecture, they're really interesting.",
    "Take this class! However, although Professor Gage is wonderful, keep in mind that your final grade comes from the TA's, so be sure to get one that you like and think is fair.",
    "Yes!!! This class was phenomenal! Professor Gage is a great lecturer and the class is wonderfully and refreshingly well-structured and conceived of. I found everything assigned tohave been worthwhile without being excessive. It is the perfect class in that it requires manageable student input with a huge return. I will warn however, that for an American history buff, this might be a lot of review. As a non-history major though, I found it to be a great introduction to many of the issues that continue to shape America today.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. I only have good things to say about the class. Not only is it an excellent overview of American history from 1900-1945, but it also teaches you invaluable research skills. After having taken this course, I appreciate the Beinecke and the Manuscripts and Archives collections and am grateful to have them on campus for any future research I need to do. Professor Gage is AMAZING- she is enthusiastic and her lectures are exciting and easy to sit through. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Its a broad overview of American history from 1900-1945 with major emphasis on the two world wars. I really enjoyed it because it was a glimpse of American history and very straightfoward, no tricks.",
    "Yes, especially if you are a history major\/need a humanities credit.",
    "Yes I really liked this class. It was very fair and interesting.",
    "Unless you genuinely like history and are interested in this topic (I was), then don't take it. And if I could re-do it, I would definietly have taken it credit d. 4 essays and 2 tests!!!!! Plus the TA's grade REALLLY hard. I spent a lot more time on this class than I ever anticipated or wanted to. Also the papers are AWFUL-- theyre like middle school level assignments but they're graded like dissertations..",
    "Take it! It's a solid class. Prof. Gage is a dynamic lecturer and her lectures do a very good job of synthesizing things and making connections. This class is very much like AP US history, and a lot of freshmen and sophomores seem to take comfort in that, so there are a lot of eager freshmen and sophomores in this class. They generally don't seem obnoxious though so it's fine. Readings are generally good, exams are fair.",
    "Great course; Gage is an awesome lecturer and the TAs are great. It's a lot of work and it's not easy but you learn a lot and it's worth it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. The information is something every citizen should know and the work is not bad.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in American history. It is a pretty brief overview of the subject material from the progressive era until WWII. But Prof Gage is a great lecturer and I think this is a great intro course into how to write a historical paper.",
    "This is a pretty good class. The writing assignments are unusual but not terribly difficult. Not necessary if you've already taken AP US history.",
    "Yes, take this class! The writing assignments are a little difficult and frequent, but the lectures are amazing and I really feel like I learned a lot during the semester, even after having taken U.S. History in high school.",
    "It's an excellent class, especially if Professor Gage is teaching it. She's an engaging lecturer and she spins history in a way that is extremely cohesive and interesting. The TAs were also really good. I didn't take AP U.S. in high school, so I wanted a better understanding of American history, and this was the perfect class for me. It's so interesting and I'm sure it would be useful for those who have taken AP U.S. too because you cover the period of 1890-1945 more in depth than you probably would in an AP class. Great intro class for anyone who's interested in American history and culture!",
    "I would recommend it but make sure you understand progressivism well.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone interested in the time period, especially those who are new to advanced history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for all the reasons listed above. Great class for history majors especially because the papers teach you about resources history majors should know how to use.",
    "I would recommend it if you didn't already know much about the period; if you were, you would gain some useful frames for thinking about things but not too much info. The paper assignments were kindof weird but useful in retrospect...you had to go to manuscripts and archives which is something I wouldn't have done otherwise.",
    "Great survey of American history between 1900 and 1945. Will leave you with a solid understanding of progressivism, radical movements, and labor relations in this period. Also, will show you how America changed during the Great Depression and World War II.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn some American history. The course says that it covers 1900 to 1945 but Gage actually starts a little earlier than that and covers some Reconstruction era history. This course has taught me a lot about american history so I would definitely recommend this to Amstud majors but also to all Americans as we all should know about the history of our nation.",
    "This is a fantastic class for anyone who is thinking about majoring in history, interested in US History, or honestly just wants to take a fascinating history class. So really everybody should take it. Beverly Gage is AWESOME--I thought US History wasso boring until I took this class. Now I'm Bluebooking for Gage classes or the continuation of this US History class. Also, if you're thinking a history major, this is a seriously great way to learn how to do real research. It uses three or four 3-5 pagers to show you how to do archival research, census research, and journal research. Really good step-by-step way to ease into the major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the lectures were great and the work load is doable.",
    "This class is awesome and I would definitely recommend it! Professor Gage is an amazing lecturer that knows how to engage the class. If you've studied U.S. History before, most of the information will be old information, but what I liked about this class is focused more on the major themes of the time period (though for the midterm and the final you will have to know the specifics for the IDs). Sometimes the readings were interesting, other times it seemed really monotonous. The workload is deceivingly heavy at times: there are four 3-5 page papers, a midterm, and a final. The papers are not typical essays, but rather assignments that make you think about how a history paper is written. In one paper we had to examine an artifact from Manuscripts and Archives, another we analyzed the census data of a person in 1920 and 1940, the last one we did was more traditional and we analyzed a historical paper of our choosing. These assignments took a lot of time to do ( at least for me they did), but by the final two I had actually started to enjoy writing them. This class is a good fifth class taken either Credit\/D or for a grade if don't have too busy of a schedule.",
    "This is a great class for any one interested in understanding the growth of America from a nation rebuilding after the devastating Civil War to a world superpower by WWII. The transformation is incredible.",
    "This is a good class to take if you're looking for a Humanities credit and have a general interest in American history. It covers an interesting part of history and Professor Gage does a wonderful job of putting many social and political themes into historical perspective. Do not think of it as a gut humanities class, though it could be more enjoyable if taken credit\/D.",
    "It is a really interesting and fun class. The workload isn't bad and the reading is actually interesting. If American history interests you at all, take this class!",
    "This was an introduction to the period of American History between 1900 (although it was more like late 1800s) to 1945. Major periods\/themes we discussed were: industry and labor, race, immigration, growth\/expansion of government, Progressivism, WWI, the Great Depression, and WWII. There were two lectures and one discussion section a week. Readings were a mix of primary sources and secondary scholarship. There were four short papers, an in-class midterm, and a final. I would absolutely recommend it because the professor is a superb lecturer, the readings are well-selected and informative, and the workload is manageable.",
    "Yes! Its pretty basic AP US history stuff you learn, but if you're interested in the time period then you should take it. Plus, Prof Gage is a really great lecturer!",
    "This class is a solid survey of American history from the late nineteenth century to the Cold War (not just 1900 to 1945 as the title suggests). If you have taken AP United States History, the class is largely redundant. However, Professor Gage is a great lecturer, and the writing assignments are interesting in themselves. The class gives you a strong foundation in doing archival research. The workload is very manageable.",
    "Fantastic course. Lots of reading but all very interesting. Make sure you're prepared for discussion. The papers are super interesting and tests are fair.",
    "Yes",
    "I would highly recommend this class for any Yalie regardless of year. I especially recommend it for those who are not history majors but would nonetheless relish in the opportunity of being able to dabble in the study of history.",
    "AMST 131 is a great lecture course to survey 1900-45. The readings are interesting, and section is a great place to have all kinds of interesting and relaxed discussions about the American identity and American policies. Remember there are 4 papers, each very different, due on Sundays. I would certainly recommend the course, if only to listen to Prof. Gage lecture.",
    "I think this is a great intro American Studies course. Overall, the amount of reading is about average. Certain weeks it can be heavier or lighter than usual, but they were always interesting.This was not at all a very difficult course though, and I think it provided a great foundation.",
    "Very good overview, definitely take it if you're an American Studies major or just want a good class on some American history. The essays helped a lot in learning how to write for history courses."
