    "Current Topics in Science is a freshman seminar that meets once a week for the entire year. It consists of 3-week modules on a certain topic of scientific interest in recent times, and the speakers brought in on the subjects are very knowledgeable and interesting. The leaders of the course, Drs. Kankel and Bailyn, are entertaining and helpful. Overall, I would recommend this course to both science and non-science majors. The work was never too difficult and you get exposure to a variety of fascinating subjects.",
    "Yes. Catered cookies and tea.",
    "This class was simply AMAZING! Basically, we'd show up once a week, eat delicious cookies and drink artisan teas with a group of really cool people, listen to lectures on interesting subjects in science, and had a comically small amount of work. I can't recommend a better way for a DS\/humanities person to get a science credit, and if you're a science person already (like me), it'll make you love life. The professors are great too!",
    "It gives you really in depth knowledge and understanding on the topics you study, which include cloning, evolution, climate change, genetic modifying, etc. Three classes per topic, one class a week. Pretty nice class, not too much work.",
    "This was a good class, and it was interesting to learn about the different topics, but it often seemed as though there wasn't enough time to learn about each topic. This often made homework difficult to complete. But the instructor assured us that assignments would be graded with that in mind, so the final grade shouldn't be to bad (of course, I haven't seen it yet). Still, the workload is pretty light, and even if the modules can be hard to grasp completely in the time allotted, they're usually at least manageable.",
    "Highly recommend it if you if the class description appeals to you.",
    "I would recommend scie 031 to another student.",
    "good broad approach to science"
