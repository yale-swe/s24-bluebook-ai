   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was really well organized per lecture and into subunits. The lecture also took seminar form which was nice in being able to incorporate students into the discussion. We did waste a lot of paper on the packets so the biggest weakness was not uploading the packets to classes.",
    "This is a reading-heavy course that benefits all those that takes it. This is a nuanced introduction as well as in-depth exploration of many of the issues facing the United States when it comes to health care policy. I was constantly surprised by just how intricate and surprising many of the areas emphasized were. I highly recommend this class.",
    "Good assignments!",
    "Great class - a lot of (maybe too many) readings",
    "It's so long with no breaks. The readings are really long and dense.",
    "Strengths: A lot of useful information Weaknesses: Some visual aids would be nice, or more in-class groupwork",
    "Strengths: This is easily one of the best courses I have ever taken. There was a lot of reading, but this is one of the few classes where I have really felt like each reading was important and added to my understanding of policy. I think that the importance of the readings, and their interconnectedness, really showed when writing our midterm policy briefs. Weakness: It would be helpful to make the handouts given in class available online or to print them double sided to not waste paper. I also wish it was possible to have small group discussion in this class. There are a lot of important topics covered, but for those who don't feel comfortable speaking up in such a large class, it can be difficult.",
    "HPM 514 was my favorite course this semester. I thoroughly enjoyed the lectures and felt like I learned a lot. The readings are extensive and could probably be cut somewhat, but I'm sure Dr. Schlesinger has a master plan for what he wanted us to learn (so what do I know). The assignments were some of the most difficult prompts I have ever been given- they require you to really think and synthesize the material in a meaningful way. I spent an enormous amount of time planning my papers before the writing even started.",
    "i liked how it tied policy to politics",
    "Readings and class lectures are very useful in understanding the material. Assignments are too open-ended though.",
    "Strength: very good overview of politics that affect health policymaking.",
    "Great course- learned so much valuable information that will be highly relevant in my future policy work. Would recommend switching the order so that the group assignment goes before the individual one. This way, students know what to expect, and can go off independently for the second one and feel more prepared. Also, we had multiple group projects during the last week of school and it can be very difficult to meet with three or four different groups for various classes. Additionally, I don't like to procrastinate my work but I was forced to for the last week of this class because I was waiting on other group members to write their parts upon which mine was based. This was an unnecessary stressor at a very busy time.",
    "I think the course could benefit from being slightly more discussion based. I understand that this is the intention behind the course, but it often felt more like a lecture course - perhaps smaller class sizes would make this more feasible.",
    "Very good course. You learn a ton about health politics and policy in the U.S. It's extremely well-structured, and your expectations are quite clear. The readings are also very interesting.",
    "Strengths: lots of interesting and relevant topics covered; logical layout of lectures Weaknesses: very US-focused (though the professor does a good job of reminding us that concepts apply in other countries, etc.)",
    "This was an absolutely fantastic course. Professor Schlesinger is a great lecturer and really encourages student engagement during class time. I certainly gained a more nuanced understanding of domestic health politics after taking this class. In addition, the two big assignments he gives are incredibly worthwhile and really solidify the concepts you've learned in lecture and reading material in a challenging but enjoyable way.",
    "Great lecture and discussion. The group assignment was difficult.",
    "The course covered a lot of political and governance issues over the past decades, which at times felt overwhelming but the information was fascinating. The lectures felt long and drawn out at times, though the material covered is important and interesting, to sit for 2 hours with some topics was painful. However, the readings for each week were well-selected and incorporated appropriately into class. The assignments, while challenging, were very fun to write and truly sparked some creativity.",
    "This is a great course that teaches a lot about the political challenges facing healthcare policy at both the state and federal level. Professor Schlesinger is brilliant and a pleasure to learn from. There is A LOT of reading in this class that can be a little overwhelming, especially with extra readings added for the final.",
    "This is one of, if not the, most important classes in the health policy program. Not only does it lay out the history of healthcare and its challenges, but also introduces the reasons for the flaws of today's system. The most challenging thing is to solve those problems, which both assignments ask students to do. It is a great practical application of what is learned and what people will face in their future work.",
    "One key strength of the course is the use of handouts which the professor provides for the students. These handouts capture relevant diagrams and exhibits from the class readings and also from outside the class readings. The professor uses these handouts to drive classroom conversation. I find that these handouts are great learning tools.",
    "Pros: Mark is good at talking about the nuances of the American healthcare system, I liked how the course was divided into various units, like Federalism and Public Opinion. Cons: Since attendance was not taken, many people skipped class. You should take attendance and explicitly state that the Teaching Assistant will do so at the beginning of the class.",
    "strengths: Readings - highly recommend familiarizing yourself with readings before class. it was helpful for me to have a reading group through the semester to share reading notes with. in the long term, they're helpful for the midterm and finals (which are written to be a relevant synthesis of the course), but on a week-by-week level, they make the class discussion so much more interesting\/easier to engage with. Class discussion - definitely a legit discussion class, even though there are more students than in a typical discussion led course. That said, prepare, and if you can't, still participate :) Even for those with little government\/politics\/health policy experience\/knowledge (as was the case for me), Mark's questions lend themselves well to creativity, common sense, and application from your own experience\/ other disciplines. Prof\/TA support - HUGELY helpful resources Weakness: Readings- there are a lot of them... Recommend focusing on the first couple or forming a reading group",
    "I absolutely loved this course. One of the best I have taken. Professor effectively used the information shared and learned in the class but went above and beyond to actually make us this about the material and how we would use it to solve problems and actually use it in the future. Very meaningful a work, engaging lectures and relevant material."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark was great! He is charasmatic, interesting, funny and very knowledgeable. He does a great job of getting everyone involved. It was just hard sometimes being in a huge \"seminar\" to get everyone to feel comfortable talking.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is fantastic! Sensitive to individual's needs, Mark has a wonderful way of integrating class material into a relaxed, inclusive environment. Mark does a great job in eliciting student participation. I don't think this course would be as great without Mark.",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Professor Schlesinger is an amazing professor, and easily one of the most engaging professors at YSPH. I really enjoy how he structures class, giving us a general outline and then really walking everyone through the major concepts in the readings.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Dr. Schlesinger is a master lecturer. He presents material in a purely academic way, but helps guide the class toward using the material in a practical manner. He is interesting to listen to. I could have sat in his classes longer to be honest.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0too subjective in grading. often graded on his opinion and whether or not your thoughts were in line with his opinion",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great lecturer!",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Incredible. Brilliant - able to talk for the entire class while still engaging students. Equally flexible and responsive to student needs. Finds a way to provide detailed feedback to every student.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Dr. Schlesinger is a brilliant professor and a masterful lecturer. His talks are continuously interesting and engaging and he artfully explains the complex healthcare system in a way that can easily be understood. The way his lectures are laid out and followed to a tee is fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I like Mark's use of the traditional chalk and whiteboard approach. The lack of power point really proved helpful. In addition, the professor is indeed a professor who is interested in teaching. His evaluations are very detailed and he does the evaluations on a student by student basis. Unlike other professors, who merely provide a grade, Mark actually provides the student with half-page to one-page material of feedback, detailing what went wrong and what went very well.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark's questions lend themselves well to creativity, common sense, and application from your own experience\/ other disciplines. He's able to think about these topics from so many perspectives, which is really helpful for health policy and for the assignments in particular. More generally, a very thoughtful mentor to have.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Wonderful, invested, encouraging. Honest"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course as something all public health students should take! It is a broad overview of the ACA and how to fix the healthcare system. It is also set up great for collaboration and fosters discussions and creativity on the topic!",
    "Thoughtful and provoking course!!",
    "Assignments are very challenging but its one of the first classes I've take at YSPH that has really forced me to think",
    "Political Science course applied to healthcare. Great instructor, very engaging teaching style that allows for constant student participation. Most intelligent instructor at ysph",
    "A lot of information and insight into healthcare politics, a lot of work, and sometimes an information overload",
    "A must take course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student and would, in fact, recommend it to all in the MPH program. This course really helps you to understand the complexities of our political system and health policy.",
    "Highly recommend- difficult course, but very interesting and helpful to policy students. I feel like I have a much better understanding of the intricacies of the health policy landscape.",
    "too many \"unofficial\" out-of-class (not-mandatory, but \"kind of\" mandatory) meetings to discuss various topics and assignments",
    "Good class to take for those interested in policy and the political arena.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in health policy. This course broadened my understanding of health policymaking.",
    "Great class--you learn a lot and it's also very intellectually stimulating.",
    "Must take for health policy students.",
    "This is a great class - I'd highly recommend it. Doing all the readings every week can get challenging after a while, especially with some of the denser papers. But the class is so worth it and really gives you a deeper comprehension of domestic health politics and the big forces at play.",
    "This is an advanced crash course in the history of U.S. political systems and governance, which at times relates to the international sphere. We discuss the development and advancement (or destruction) of various government programs within healthcare. You will extract more from lecture if you prepare the readings before class, and take advantage of the knowledge Professor Schlesinger has to offer.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. Mark is probably one of the most brilliant professors at YSPH and I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is a lot of reading and work in general (The midterm and final take a long time), but well worth it.",
    "Even if you are not in health policy, this is a class worth taking. It is fundamental to so many other areas that it could probably be required for everyone.",
    "Yes. I would recommend Professor Schlesinger's course. The course uses specific health policies to explain the many-sided dynamics of the health policy arena. By the end of the course, students would have become adept at health care policy design and analysis.",
    "Yes- totally recommend for those interested in US health policy, but could be useful to broader range - including international students. A weakness in our department is that a lot of our required courses seem most applicable to US health care system. Though this class does draw a lot on the US health care system and politics, the skills I gained from this class (thinking critically, engaging multiple stakeholders, considering competing platforms, writing policy memos) are applicable more generally.",
    "Highly recommend to all students if only to see what a class really should be like"
