    "As advertised, this course offers a basic knowledge of statistical methods for the layperson.",
    "Learned a lot about statistics! It was interesting to take intro psych at the same time and learn about how bad we are at statistics, too.",
    "I learned about different statistical methods for evaluating data such as ANOVA, hypothesis testing, and so much more. I also learned about the basics behind general probability and statistics in general.",
    "Basic concepts of statistics. How do analyze data.",
    "I learned basic statistical methods and how to apply them to different kinds of data.",
    "Very solid conceptual understanding of basic statistics. Application skills are ok, could be better. Did not do a lot of practice exercises as the semester progressed, which would have made me a lot better. I know how to use Minitab really well now.",
    "Increased my knowledge of statistics",
    "Really good intro stats course, gets pretty detailed toward the end but really well taught.",
    "I learned a huge amount from this class, I learned a lot in the second half (103) especially. I learned a lot about different statistical techniques and thought that the way the class was organized was quite effective.",
    "I learned basic stats techniques, such as regression and probability.",
    "I learned about various statistical tests that could be performed given a certain set of data and a certain goal. I learned how to use Minitab and interpret various pieces of statistical output to conclude if something is statistically significant or insignificant, or to fit the best model for data.",
    "I learned a comprehensive overview of basic techniques of statistical analysis and feel comfortable implementing these techniques to study real-world data.",
    "I learned a lot of useful basic statistics that I need to know for my psychology classes. I now have a better understanding and a more critical eye regarding the stats that I see cited all the time in my daily life.",
    "This two-part course teaches basic concepts in statistics using Minitab or SPSS. It is overall a surface-level introduction, in the sense that you will be able to recognize statistical procedures by name and know generally what they do -- but not necessarily have a deep conceptual understanding nor be able to do them in an actually useful statistical software.",
    "Basic statistics and probability, linear regression (simple and multiple), ANOVA (one-way, two-way, three-way and more), generalized linear models and logistic regression. Use of MINITAB as well as the mathematics that underlie the computer program's processes",
    "I learned how to apply a variety of statistical procedures and tests to analyze data and make predictions using the program Minitab.",
    "A general understanding of statistical analysis.",
    "Statistics with pertinent social science examples.",
    "I learned a great deal about introductory statistics topics, and they are applicable to many different fields, including medical ones.",
    "How to use MINITAB. Basic statistical concepts such as standard deviation, mean, etc. There were a couple of really cool moments towards the end of the semester, especially when we were talking about GLMs and ANCOVA.",
    "I didn't feel like I learned that much. The pace was way too fast for an intro class -- which i assumed would be for someone who had never taken the subject before",
    "Logical thinking, basic but extremely important statistical concepts.",
    "Basic stats above AP Level",
    "How to perform statistical analysis and look at data in a new way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A big strength is the professor! He is very committed to making himself available to everyone, which I really appreciated. I wish I could say the same for my TF!",
    "I thought this course was very well organized and well put together. My only comment is that sometimes the TAs would lead students astray and then we would be punished for following their advice.",
    "Strengths of the course: - the instructor. what a pleasure to work with JRS. i loved his sense of humor. he made the material simple, easy to understand. he is an extremely intelligent man who uses really intelligent cues to help students spot patterns as the material gets more complex. i have a lot of admiration for him. - the lectures\/notes. all crystal clear and really, really easy to follow. Weaknesses of the course: - i wish there had been more opportunities for practical practice like the kind of exercises that would show up on the exams. but i guess we were supposed to do these on our own.",
    "I thought the assignments were all fair and challenging and the professor charismatic and interesting",
    "FLIPPED: The flipped class was amazing! It's very helpful to be able to work through MiniTab as we learned. The office hours after class portion was most beneficial because although there are other actually designated office hours, it was easier to ask questions right after class.",
    "I thought that the class was well organized for the most part, but I thought that the class could be improved by making the TA's more active in the class. JRS was extremely involved and clearly cared about how everyone did, but I never even met my TA, and the only communication I had with him was through the grades he gave me.",
    "Strengths: good overview of statistics in general, balanced workload. Weaknesses: pace was a little fast.",
    "Overall, the course is well organized since JDRS has taught it for some time. It is well taught, and the filmed lectures are great - they provide flexibility if one needs to miss lecture, or allow one to review a concept from class. It could be improved in feedback, but that is mostly the fault of a very slow TA than the course itself.",
    "The flipped format was great. Watching the lectures on my own allowed me to process the information at my own speed, while the class discussion provided a helpful forum to follow up with questions. I wouldn't change much - this was a great format for me.",
    "I think the course moves really quickly and it can be easy to have no idea what's going on in lecture. The more practice you get the better, so the problem sets are really important and helpful. I wouldn't mind if the problem sets were more repetitive (asking you to do the same process for multiple questions) just so that you could ingrain certain skills that were only talked about it lecture.",
    "Really strong course that is engaging and memorable while still presenting material in a clear and approachable way. (NOTE TO STUDENTS: just deal with the initial frustration with setup on Macs and use Minitab -- SPSS isn't free and despite promising from the beginning that the class will provide instruction for both programs, SPSS instructions are only given maybe 30% of the time)",
    "The class just moves a bit too quickly to stay on top of the material well. The daily quizzes and weekly problem sets help students stay up to date, and are probably the best way to do so given the great amount of information the students are responsible for. It may be helpful to use a different program to implement the statistics on problem sets though: MINITAB does not seem to be widely used in practice even though it is helpful. It could be much more helpful, albeit more complicated, to use something like R.",
    "The professor was a HUGE strength of the class. He was awesome-- making statistics interesting with lively lectures, jokes and games.",
    "This course has some flaws. First, the program the course recommends and at times requires students to use only runs on PCs, something not explained in the course description. This is a problem for the vast majority of Yale students who use Macs. The professor recommended that we download a partition so our computers run both Mac and PC software simultaneously, but this slows down the computer significantly. Furthermore, the program in question, Minitab, is very old and is no longer used by most statisticians, who use R or Stata. The material for this course was also presented in a way that many students found confusing, showing examples before explaining the math at work and never clearly explaining the differences between examples. Furthermore, the TAs never graded homework fast enough, preventing students from adequately preparing for exams. I received my three homework grades three weeks after taking the final. I found this class frustrating, vague, and unhelpful. The professor seems like a great guy and cares both about his students and the material and tries to make the class engaging, but the course needs a different stats program and a restructuring of material.",
    "Jonathan Reuning-Scherer is the strength of this course--his enthusiasm, organization, and availability made what otherwise might have been a boring and difficult class engaging and manageable.",
    "Solidly organized course",
    "Fantastic professor, great teaching. Captivating lectures. TA could be a bit picky at times.",
    "Great lectures, and I found the video lectures helpful as well. Canvas quizzes were annoying but helped consolidate the material; not really sure clickers were worth it. I think most of the learning happened over solving p-sets. Jeopardy was a great exam review. The practice exams were extremely helpful. Overall, solid introduction course that made statistics easy and understandable.",
    "Too fast and not very interesting",
    "LOVE THE ONLINE RECORDED LECTURES i also love the powerpoint slides",
    "I think that there should be computer office hours in the stat lab for students. I really struggled in learning minitab at the beginning.",
    "Stats 103 is a great introductory statistics course. The problem sets are very helpful and the online quizzes in the beginning of the semester keep students on track but do not add any stress. Professor JRS is also incredibly engaging and enthusiastic.",
    "Strengths included our Professor's enthusiasm and expertise in statistics, the optional review sessions and open office hours. Weaknesses included the overall size of the course ( a huge lecture can make it difficult to engage with the Professor) and inconsistency in grading amongst the teaching assistants.",
    "SO many resources for information Information presented very clearly Great organization Many people available to help"

   "comments": [
    "Yep! Good, basic class. Everything you need to know are in the notes. There's no required textbook.",
    "This is a great introduction to statistics. Take the course seriously and it will reward you.",
    "Good intro to stat--lots of overlap with AP. JDRS is funny and helpful. Not a true gut; some psets are long. The exams aren't really hard, but there is very little given in the way of prep, so you go in kind of blind. Not an issue if you are comfortable with the material, but still a little unfortunate.",
    "Yes, interesting stuff that you learn, useful for most fields of work.",
    "This is a good overview of statistics, and is very application-based - you don't just learn about statistics but you learn how to use it and how to analyze data. Statistics is super practical in many fields and I think this class gives enough tools to be really helpful. There are tons of resources for help - office hours almost every day from both the professor and TAs. Professor Reuning-Scherer is a really good lecturer, he manages to make statistics interesting and engaging and he is always ready to help his students.",
    "Absolutely. Great place to start for basic statistics. Great QR.",
    "A very well-taught stats class, but still a stats class, y'know?",
    "yes I think I would. It's an interesting and effective way to learn stat",
    "Yes! Take the Flipped version of the class!",
    "This was a great QR credit. JRS is funny (in a dad-humor kind of way) and very understanding (aka posts all the recorded lectures online which is a LIFESAVER for the final). One of the few math classes at Yale where the problem sets are designed to help you practice the material rather than test your understanding and hurt your grade. Weekly problem sets took a few hours each, two midterms and a final. The two midterms are as a large lecture, and only the final is subject specific. Stats for Social Science is definitely the best section to be in, since you keep JRS, and the the grading\/tests were SUPER fair, since he gives you the exam from the year before as a practice. Really a kind human who seems to want everyone to do well.",
    "I would recommend STAT 103 to another student only if they are willing to put in a lot of work. There are weekly p sets which take up a fair amount of time and if you don't go to lecture the p sets won't make sense. JDRS is great because he makes stats about as fun as he can, BUT he moves really fast. I think the course covers too much material.",
    "I absolutely would!",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed intro stats-social sciences. I thought it gave students a good overview of statistics in general and I would recommend this to another student. The workload is very manageable and straightforward, and the tests were also very reflective of the psets, which helped greatly.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have little or no statistics background. The first 8 or so weeks are probably 80% AP Statistics material, so it was not hard to follow. I found the last 5ish weeks rewarding, since it was new material for me, and complemented my learning. Be warned: stat 103 final is cumulative, whereas the others are not. JDRS overall is a good instructor, and when other courses got tough, the flexibility of the filmed lectures made it easy to catch up with stat. Go to JDRS's office hours - I've heard that he pretty much answers questions on psets.",
    "This course was an outstanding introduction to statistics - clear, well-paced, and comprehensive, but never overwhelming. JDRS is great at explaining the material. The examples in lectures and in class kept the real-world relevance of statistics close at hand. Definitely take the flipped version - it's the bomb.",
    "If you need to take a stats class, JRS is a wonderful and engaging professor, and my TA (Ryan Yeh) was really nice and accommodating. I personally wouldn't have chosen to take a stats class because I don't love the material, but I think it was useful and overall I am glad I took it!",
    "Take this course if you would like to be able to understand the \"Results\" section of a social science paper, but know that it's not enough information to actually go out and do much on your own. Literally any level of math experience is enough to do well, and the class is super well organized with a huge number of resources available. Also -- JDRS's sense of humor grows on you.",
    "Absolutely--very strong course!",
    "Yes, if they are a non-math major looking for a QR. It's definitely not easy and the psets are tough, but it is doable!!",
    "I would avoid this one if I were you. The professor is nice guy with corny-but-fun sense of humor, but the material is presented in ways that are difficult to understand. You also have to use Minitab, a stats computer program that ONLY RUNS ON PCs. You can try to use other programs, but you will have to spend many hours teaching yourself how and looking things up on the internet. This course is frustrating and not very rewarding.",
    "It's likely that you're taking this to fulfill a prerequisite or a QR requirement, but you're in luck--this is math in a useful, well-taught way. You'll probably enjoy it much more than you're expecting!",
    "Yes",
    "Solid course. Would recommend.",
    "Yes. It is helpful to know statistics, regardless of what you plan to study.",
    "Take it if you like statistics, or if it's a requirement. Don't take it to fulfill your QR. JRS is amazing, but there's only so much he can do to make statistics interesting.",
    "I would not",
    "Would recommend.",
    "YES. Loved professor Reuning- Scherer and i learned a lot! Theres a lot of help and support",
    "yes, it teaches you really useful skills and is applicable in almost any field.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in statistics or need a QR credit, this is a great and useful class.",
    "Though most people have to take Intro Statistics as a requirement, it is a good course for gaining a broad overview of statistics as a whole. Please be aware that the pace of the course moves quickly.",
    "GREAT CLASS if you take it flipped"
