   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY. Take this class. It's a lot of reading, true, but it's totally worth it. The syllabus is great, and you read a huge range of things. The seminar style is super engaging, and paper writing isn't too crazy. This was my one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Not unless the syllabus changed. Read a ton of pretty bad books. Two hours was too long to sit through.",
    "Great, emotionally overwhelming, philosophically stimulating. Wonderful reading\/viewing list. Take it.",
    "I would probably only recommend this to English or philosophy majors. There is a lot of reading, which varies between amazing (like Lilith's Brood) and atrocious (like Ridley Walker). The secondary reading is so dense and boring as to be almost incomprehensible. Discussion is interesting but it may feel like you're having the same conversation every week if you aren't seriously invested in the genre. The papers are open ended, allowing for a lot of creativity and freedom but I ended up feeling a bit aimless.",
    "The methodology taken in this class is really interesting, you look at apocalyptic narratives in a lot of depth but you do so in a lot of different genres, it's really interesting. I totally recommend it.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a very interesting class and the books you read in class are pretty interesting (some more interesting than others). Professor Berger is great and laid back overall.",
    "It's hard to describe what we learned in Apocalyptic Narratives, because it doesn't feel like there was one cohesive thread throughout. I realize part of the course's purpose was showing us the range of disaster or apocalyptic narratives, but it was ultimately quite difficult to say if there was one cohesive point that I could take away from the course.",
    "This class was mindblowing if you do the readings and engage in the material. Classes are just a discussion of the readings and essays are completely open ended. The class really is what you make of it. So if the topic strikes an interest I would highly recommend taking it. Although there is a lot of reading, it was more of an American studies class than a lit class, which was great."
