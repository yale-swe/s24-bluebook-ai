   "comments": [
    "If you are already committed to the French program take it because you have to. If you are a freshmen thinking about placing into L3, don't.",
    "I thought that French 130 was much better than French 120; the course was organized more clearly and it was fun to get the chance to read a variety of texts. I would definitely recommend taking 130 with Stemmer, if you have the chance. I very much enjoyed her class!",
    "A pretty solid language course. It helps you become more fluent in french! You read L'Etranger, Le Petit Nicolas, and M. Ibrahim et les Fleurs du Coran, all books which are either really fun or really interesting (or both!) And you watch movies and talk about them. There is a LOT of work for this class, but that should be expected from a foreign language course. Professor Stemmer is great though, I say take it with her.",
    "French 130 is a great class for anyone interested in the french language. I greatly improved my speaking, french accent, and listening skills while refining my writing and reading. The class focuses on speaking and listening which is worked very well for me.",
    "A lot of busy work that if you're organized you can get done after an hour or two a day. The evaluations, however, are quite difficult. Will learn a decent amount and improve your speaking.",
    "yes--it really helps strengthen your french grammar in a fun environment",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it because it doesn't go over topics that you already know, but it goes over hard areas such as verb tenses just enough to refresh your memory and learn them better.",
    "Better than L1 and L2. Reading actual novels in French is a refreshing change from French in Action. Sure, the homework seems daunting at first, but you get used to it (I try to finish most of the worksheets during the weekend). As you adapt to the class, you'll find yourself loving French more and more. I can't see how anyone would stop after L3!"
