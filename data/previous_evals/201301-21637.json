    "The class requires a fair amount of work, but is truly enjoyable. By the end of the semester, you'll notice a great increase in your Japanese language skills!",
    "Great class! Lots of reading, and not as much grammar as L3\/L4, but more kanji. Stever sensei and Maruyama sensei are great.",
    "This class is very focused on reading. It has a vocab\/kanji heavy emphasis, but in order to retain that stuff, You have to be proactive in reviewing. L5 is a crash course in how to teach yourself. That being said, there isn't a large emphasis on speaking, so expect to force yourself to find new ways of doing that."
