    "DS Philosophy is a great introduction to philosophy from ancient Greece to the Middle Ages. This course gives a good comprehensive overview of important philosophers from that time period.",
    "DRST 003 01 is an interesting class, but I felt that it lacked structure. It can be difficult to know, after every class, exactly what you have learned in the class.",
    "If you're taking Directed Studies, do whatever you can to get into Szabo's Philosophy section. He was absolutely brilliant and struck a fantastic balance between grounding us in the historical aspects of the thinkers we were reading and making us consider their philosophical questions in the abstract. It's such an amazing section because you get both the important introduction to these philosophers as part of the history of philosophy AND the even-more-important introduction to philosophy as a discipline (to philosophy's major concerns, practices, etc.). He's also just an eminently reasonable person, and class is very nearly always engaging. He'll probably end up being the best section leader I had in DS.",
    "I would recommend DS Philosophy as long as the student is committed to reading every page of these works. You dont have to read every page with the same attention to detail and not every page will be equally annotated, but one of the skills that DS teaches is sensitivity to density and significance, (ie learning which passages to skim and which passages to explicate) and you can only acquire this capacity if you read the works in their entirety."
