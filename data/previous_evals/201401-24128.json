    "I really enjoyed this course. As a public health student with no legal background in a class that is shared between the law school and school of public health, I certainly learned a lot about the legal framework for my team project. I enjoyed working with my team members and learned a lot from them. Although this course required a lot of work, I am very happy I took it.Sometimes I felt the seminars were randomly selected, but interesting nevertheless.",
    "Strength: the instructors, instructors, instructors.The classes that were entirely devoted to the group work were, I think, a missed opportunity. There were so few classes and so much interesting substance to read and talk through--and so many great guest speakers--that it would've been great to have more of those substantive classes. I would've also appreciated a class where Ali, Amy, and Gregg talked about their work and their experiences\/challenges\/triumphs\/failures as advocates.All of the guest speakers were great - especially the two speakers who were formally at the Center for Reproductive Rights and HRW, respectively. An honor and privilege to have them in class and to hear their reflections on their previous work.",
    "The GHJP was one of the best courses I have taken during my 2 years at YSPH. The course gives your the opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary group of students from the med school, law school, and school of public health. The course is very time consuming but very satisfying!",
    "Strengths: The readings were immediately relevant to the themes of course and the guest speakers were interesting and engaging. A thought-provoking course. I appreciated the fact that the course was discussion oriented and encouraged the students to incorporate elements of their own experience into the learning experience. The students were encouraged to make connections with respondents deemed necessary for the writing of their reports. This was truly a course in health justice practice. The weekly supervisions were useful for students to discuss with their supervisors their progress in their projects.Weaknesses: The course bills itself as interdisciplinary but catered more to students with law degrees or those currently training in law. Too much law jargon was used in the course without any explanation. More effort could have been made to encourage discussion, rather than allowing the 2 or 3 students in the class to dominate discussions. More guidance on some projects would have been appreciated, with set deadlines for the construction of drafts. Some students felt that in the beginning, their projects lacked momentum. Some students would also appreciate clearer roles in their respective projects, and better inclusion of those who don't have background in law. Some did feel excluded from their projects because of this, and the instructors could have done a better job in working to bridge that divide. It's necessary going forward that all students know their roles and how they can add constructively to elements of the project. It would be helpful if the course instructors select students whose backgrounds they know would add constructively to the projects because at times, some students doubted their relevance to the project. In situations where the relevance is clear to the instructors, they should work harder to communicate that to other members of the team in different disciplines.",
    "Big strength is cool projectsWeakness is use of class time, I think we should have had less discussion of readings and more time doing skills-based trainings like the one we did on interviewing people with disabilities.The readings were a bit too theoretical at times."

    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Very helpful, although clearly overworked and overextended. Always gave gentle encouragement. Very intelligent and constructive during supervisions. Open to suggestions and criticism if things weren't working out. Needs to improve on providing students better guidance early on and assessing their competence and understanding of their role in the projects early on.",

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in global health justice, but the student must be prepared to devote at least 15-20 hours a week on the team project, in addition to preparing for weekly seminars. Different projects require different modes of data collection, such as telephone interviews, survey design, email correspondence, literature reviews, etc. A student interested in taking this course must be prepared to take part in the aforementioned tasks. Ultimately, this was the best course I took at Yale for its real-life application of an interesting and important project.",
    "Great course for anyone interested in thinking critically about how global health is conceived and pursued today.The opportunity to hear Gregg, Amy, and Ali talk together is itself worth the price of admission.",
    "Make sure you are able to commit the time needed to get the most out of this class. Very rewarding class.",
    "This course is very time consuming. This course is best reserved for mature students, preferably those with some practical experience in health and social justice. It is not a course to be taken lightly. It is in effect a law class so be ready for the bias.",
    "A great course where you tackle a real global health justice problem. I would recommend it."
