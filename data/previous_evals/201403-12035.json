   "comments": [
    "Davis is a fantastic professor and the class is well structured. If you aren't naturally interested in China or sociology this class may be a struggle, but if you are this class is a must take.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to anyone who's interested in China. It doesn't go too deep but definitely covers the most important inequality issues. But keep in mind that this is a sociology class--meaning it is descriptive and not prescriptive. So don't expect to come out with an opinion of whether the situation in China is right or wrong or whether we SHOULD have more and less inequality.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to anyone with a serious interest in China. This course is rigorous and Professor Davis will hold you to high standards on assignments, but she's an excellent mentor and you'll come out learning a lot. Students also have a lot of freedom to pursue topics they're interested in for their final papers. All in all a very rewarding experience!",
    "Yes. especially if you're an east asian studies major",
    "Yes I would recommend if the person is serious about China and sociology. But this class might require some basic understanding of China and the Chinese language.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, without a doubt. Davis directed discussion brilliantly. She was comfortable letting it flow when it was strong, and interjecting and offering her own expansive knowledge when it was flat. She also pushes you to defend what you're saying in class, which sounds intimidating (it's not -she's really nice about it) but is exactly what a good professor should do. The readings were fascinating and manageable, too. Between the readings and the fact that the class was roughy have native Chinese students, you learn so much about post socialist China. Only two caveats: it's super helpful to speak Chinese, and the class is actually quite quantitative. Most of the readings deal with statistics, and there are two excel exercises (which are doable even with little stats\/econ background), but it's helpful.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in inequality studies. You'll learn an incredible amount about how inequality is produced and maintained in China, but also in the world. If you're unfamiliar with sociology, there may be a learning curve, but you will still take away a tremendous amount of knowledge from the course. It changed my perspective on social policy issues and institutionalized disadvantaged. Plus, you get to do your own research paper, which sharpens up skills that you would use in doing a senior thesis. Can't recommend it enough.",
    "Very enjoyable course. Professor Davis's knowledge of the historical developments and current problems in China is astounding. You get to write a twenty page final paper on any topic of choice and Professor Davis gives great guidance on the paper. The readings are carefully selected and always very informative; despite the broadness of any week's discussion topic (e.d. education inequality in China), after doing the assigned reading the class is able to talk somewhat intelligently with helpful instruction and input from Professor Davis."
