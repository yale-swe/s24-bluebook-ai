    "It was a great choice for me--just make sure to be in good touch with your advisor and choose a topic you're passionate about.",
    "Writing an independent senior essay was a phenomenal experience. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a very clear interest or passion that they want to pursue, as long as you know that you have it within you to deal with a relatively structure-less environment for your senior essay that relies entirely on your self-motivation and ability to reach out to your advisor(s) on your own. Make sure you pick your advisor(s) well, but if you have something that you care enough about a semester ahead of time to want to work on it for several months, write an independent senior essay. It's an amazing chance that is rare among other classes at Yale, and it forced me to grow as a scholar and a person a great deal.",
    "If you are so inclined and can't find the proper outlet in a Senior Seminar.",
    "Do it in the fall, not the spring. Your spring semester will thank you.",
    "If you know what you want to write about and are willing to spend a lot of your \"spare\" time to work on it, go for it. Also read up on secondary sources, big time. It really helps you figure out what your own angle is. And stay on schedule."
