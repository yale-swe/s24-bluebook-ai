   "comments": [
    "Don't save your reports until the last minute. You probably will do that on the first one, and then you'll learn your lesson. Be prepared to write 5 lab reports of 30 pages each.",
    "if you are prepared to work hard and work consistently from the first day of lab, take it. if you are willing to sacrifice every other subject for this one, take it. otherwise don't. while this is an interesting class, the write-ups take way too long. and it is not even worth it.",
    "It's a good course but you need to remember to keep up with the work and dont wait till the last minute. Some of the lab reports are over 50 pages long ad involve very intricate calculations.",
    "330 tends to create a lot of stress, but the key thing is to just start the lab reports early. The experiments themselves involve a lot of measurements and might not be the most inspiring. However, the analysis from these experiments really provides a lot of insight into thermodynamics and NMR (which ultimately makes the weekly 4 hours of lab worthwhile).",
    "You're only taking this course if you are a Chem major or a Chem E major. DO NOT TAKE IT OTHERWISE! It's ridiculously time consuming and lab sessions are very tiring and tedious. You will (you have to) learn how to write long lab reports and to tedious data analysis. However, the class material is not particularly hard, just time consuming.",
    "Heavy emphasis on formatting in lab reports. Budget your time on lab reports, don't expect to get out of lab early, and enjoy the more interesting experiments (bomb calorimetry, heat capacity ratios). Well organized course, though, and the TAs (as well as Professor Vaccaro) are all knowledgeable and available to answer questions.",
    "Chemistry 330L is an intensive lab course. I would recommend it to any student who wishes to improve the quality of their lab reports, as long as they understand that the class has great dealof homework.",
    "If you can disregard the amount of time absorbed by this class, you really do learn a lot and the subject matter and its presentation is very interesting. I would recommend taking this class concurrently with physical chemistry.Plus, you get to whine to all your friends about the length of your reports. And let's just admit that whining is fun.",
    "Most work I have ever had for a class. I came in knowing about the reputation of the 50-page reports, but never fully realized the burdens until I actually started writing them. You absolutely cannot procrastinate on these reports. \"much greater\" workload does not even do justice to the actual workload.",
    "So much work. It's literally impossible to comprehend how much work this class is until you're drowning in data. The experiments are extremely boring, and the amount of data obtained from them doesn't look like a lot until you're working on the reports. Doing the reports, you have to budget your time in terms of days or weeks, not hours. Taking this class, you'll have the hardest semester at Yale. You'll learn so much, but the cost is high.",
    "Most likely, students will have to take this class to fulfill a requirement. Otherwise no, too much work.",
    "I ended up writing well more than 200 pages in reports, ~40k words. Some people wrote less. It's so much work, and report writing is so mind-numbing. Often, I found myself asking why I had to calculate this or write this explanation, and so on. Getting results from experimental data was cool, but writing tons about was terrible.I managed to get through the semester taking a total of five credits, all of them between average and high in workload and difficulty. But I also did nothing this semester but work and a few extracurriculars and also missed out on sleep.",
    "You're probably taking this class because its a pre-req for your major. It's considered one of the hardest labs at Yale in terms of the sheer amount of work involved. Each lab report averages around 50 pages and there are 5 lab reports throughout the semester. However, I do feel that your skills in writing reports improves in this class, and this lab is a good supplement to the concepts that you learn in Pchem. Be willing to spend an extraordinary amount of time in this class though.",
    "CHEM330L is one of those classes that you take if you\u0092re a Chemistry or Chemical Engineering major, but pretty much avoid otherwise. I only know one girl who was unsure of being a Chemistry major that took the course. It\u0092s a lot of work and the labs aren\u0092t particularly interesting, but you get through it.",
    "The usual answer--you'll only be taking this because you have to, for the chemistry major or for chemE. Be prepared for a lot of writing and some not so interesting labs--just follow Professor Vaccaro's advice to NOT PROCRASTINATE and you'll be fine. I learned that the hard way.",
    "A lab that only vaguely feels like a chemistry lab. Very long lab handouts that require equally long lab write-ups. It's pretty much as bad as everyone says it is. Try not not have Joshua Karli as your TA if you want your life to be slightly less painful.",
    "Professor Vaccaro himself calls this class the \"scourge of the chem major\". Definitely only take this class if you absolutely have to, it will consume your life. Seriously consider only taking 4 credits, and not having any really demanding extracurricular. For you chem majors\/chemE majors, stay strong, after this class, nothing in the major will ever seem difficult again.",
    "Prepare to drown in lab reports.",
    "The material is fascinating, but everything you've heard about the workload is true. Be very careful with time management.",
    "Yes, you have to write long lab reports. But they're not so conceptually hard. Once you actually do the lab and all, you'll understand what's happening. And then it might actually be fun to organize your data and thoughts on paper. It's a lot of work (compiling data and calculating standard deviations can be a pain, but that's why we have excel!), but it's nothing that you can't do. Don't let this class scare you away from a chem or chem eng major!",
    "NOT THAT BAD IF YOU MANAGE YOUR TIME WELL AND START THE REPORTS EARLY! DON'T PUT THEM OFF!",
    "If you're doing chemistry or chem e, you have to take this class. Stay on top of the lab reports and really make an effort to understand the content before going to lab - it'll make writing doing the labs (especially electronics) and writing the reports much easier. Be prepared to spend a lot of hours on this class but even though you'll hate it, you'll learn a lot."
