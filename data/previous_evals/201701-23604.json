    "Wonderful class with an engaging and beyond insightful teacher. Creates and encourages the historical analysis of current events that leaves a lasting impact. Readings were occasionally very lengthy, which isn't really an indictment as they were all necessary, just difficult to balance the workload on occasion.",

    "Harvey is a fantastic lecturer who managed to weave complex concepts -- capitalism, democracy, diplomacy -- into captivating narratives. His storytelling is remarkable and especially so when he includes stories of his past research and work in the Middle East.",
    "The Professor had a wonderful way of relating the material and using personal anecdotes to further the impact.",
    "The professor's explanation of the readings and background knowledge contributed significantly to classroom discussions. Additionally some of the readings were very interesting.",
    "There were two excellent aspects of this course: 1) Professor Weiss' lectures, especially those covering the reading material early in the semester on the origins of agriculture, as well as his fascinating stories about his time doing archeological digs in Western Asia, and his fine analysis of the region's complex dynamics. They had us all scotched to our seats! 2) The readings Professor Weiss selected for us. Each one of the readings is *absolutely* illuminating."

   "comments": [
    "None. Except it would be great to do a fieldtrip with Prof. Weiss--if only to the local museum. But Syria or Iraq would be great, too!",
    "Student accountability with the readings was not established at the start of the course, causing frustration that was only voiced at the end of the course. Whatever standard of student engagement Harvey would like from the students, should be set as early as possible. However, also note that Harvey's lectures are phenomenal and the classes he could lecture in full should not be diluted with student insight.",
    "I would say less intensive reading. Although as alluded to prior, the reading is necessary and beneficial, just difficult to balance.",
    "The dates for when assignments were due including grade breakdowns should have been updated and finalized at the beginning of the semester. It was nice that the professor was flexible with when the students wanted to submit take-home exams and other assignments; however, it did cause confusion towards the end of the semester. The last minute assigning of an in-class presentation and decision to only require half the class to submit the final paper was unexpected. If these had been decided earlier on in the semester that would have been fine, but it did not feel respectful of student commitments and expectations to make these changes towards the end of the semester.",
    "I can't think of anything major. The courseload at the end--final paper and final exam is a bit heavy, but I learned a lot so I am happy about it."

    "Great, also donuts and coffee really helped.",
    "The readings often felt too lengthy for students to complete in one week. As such, it seemed many were unable to complete them prior to class. This resulted in less student participation in discussions. Additionally, it was often difficult to decipher whether the professor was asking a rhetorical question or one that he wanted a direct answer to. I believe this also contributed to less participation. To address this, the professor could better focus the required readings for the class so that it is at a manageable amount, and then perhaps require an in-class presentation on the week's reading as a quick way to review what the readings covered, answer questions students might have had, and encourage increased student participation during discussions. The format of the in-class presentations we had at the end of the semester was fine. But perhaps send around a schedule on one of the first days of class to have students sign up for one or two days they would like to lead the presentation of the day's readings.",

    "As a student interested in global food systems, this class provided the historical reasoning to how and why our food systems are the way they are today.",
    "I thought it would have provided more context than it did. The focus on the history of agriculture was fascinating; however, falling behind with lectures and readings towards the end of the semester reduced the amount of time we discussed modern-day agriculture, a topic I was looking forward to most this semester.",
    "I had been in the process of deciding whether to orient my remaining studies and my future career on building a sustainable agricultural system, or working on clean energy, and this course swayed me to the former!! It was foundational for me. It gave me an excellent and pretty comprehensive introduction of the key elements of the evolution of agriculture, from its origins over 10,000 years ago to present. I initially did not think that the long historical overview would be very helpful but it was so fascinating, that I am delighted to have taken this course. It reinforced to me how central agriculture is to our humanity, thus enriching my view of it and deepening my desire to dedicate my career to this topic."

    "I would highly urge anyone interested in food and agriculture to take this course! It is a must take. Professor Weiss is a truly engaging Professor, an expert in his topics, and a clear orator and masterful storyteller. All the readings are excellent and the exam format (take-home) are an excellent way to digest and make your own the course material. You will come away with a fascination to agriculture and an understanding of how essential it has been and continues to be to humanity!"
