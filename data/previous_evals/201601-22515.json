   "comments": [
    "Good overview of important topics in water treatment. Yes, I'd recommend this class to another student because it highlights many important concepts related to water treatment that affect our everyday lives.",
    "I would recommend ENAS 642 to another student. It covers a wide range of processes used in water treatment in appropriate detail.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in water treatment as it provides a great overview of the various techniques and their underlying fundamental development.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student if they have any interest in water treatment technologies.",
    "This course describes in great detail how the fundamental principles of science are applied to water treatment technologies. I highly recommend this course to other students, as this course is an opportunity to learn from a true leader in the field, who is also a very effective teacher.",
    "Very helpful if wanting to understand the concepts, chemistry, and mathematical equations behind water purification processes.",
    "It is a very useful course and gets easier as the semester goes on (the first few weeks of material were the most difficult). The homework was appropriate for the course and often included a written response as well as quantitative problems. I would recommend to another student because the material was very useful.",
    "Meny is one of the best teacher's I've had so far at Yale, so I would definitely recommend him to anyone. However, I didn't find the material of this course to be particularly relevant to my PhD research, so I would only recommend it to people who are interested in the material."

   "comments": [
    "Good general knowledge in the field.",
    "The course gave me a good overview of water treatment processes which is important to any Chemical or Environmental Engineer.",
    "Yes. Like many students in the class, I do not come from an engineering background, so I feel this class helped to pull me up to speed with many aspects of chemical and environmental engineering.",
    "This course will prove very helpful to my research as it has laid a great foundation for knowledge of various processes relevant to environmental engineering.",
    "My research is unrelated to water treatment, so in this aspect the course wasn't very helpful.",
    "Understanding water treatment technologies and the scientific principles that underly these processes is a fundamental aspect of environmental engineering, and this course truly deepened my knowledge of this area of the field.",
    "Deepened my knowledge because it taught me the fundamental principles of the physical and chemical background of what is happening in water purification.",
    "It was a good introduction to the more technical aspects of transport in natural systems and water treatment. The membrane and adsorption material will be helpful for my research.",
    "Unfortunately, this course wasn't really relevant to my PhD research, but I still learned a lot through taking the course."
