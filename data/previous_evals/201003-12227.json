    "This course was an excellent overview of a troubling and important period of history. The lectures and readings, rather than cribbing from each other, provide a point\/counterpoint on historical debates that are going on to this day. Professor Winter has unique interpretations of various events and developments, and he presents his lectures are arguments rather than summaries of what happened. The reading is extremely heavy (>400 pages some weeks), but for the most part the selections are well-writing and interesting.",
    "If you really want to learn more about WWI and WWII definitely take it. If not, its not worth the reading.",
    "TAKE IT! It's the best!",
    "YES i would recommend this class - if you don't have time for all the readings, take it credit-D and you'll still get to hear an amazing lecturer and learn about something really interesting!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student, not just to history majors. The material it covers is crucial for any member of society regardless of where they are from.",
    "If you do not know much about this time period in Europe, YOU SHOULD! And this class will help you.",
    "Fantastic class. While the amount of reading is sometimes ludicrous, all of it is interesting and important, and most of it is somewhat skimmable. Professor Winter's lectures are extremely compelling, and while he sometimes argued for views I might not have agreed with, I appreciated the new perspective on the material. The readings often presented points of view that stood in contract with the views presented in class, which allowed me to form my own opinions on the subject. But for real now, take this. You won't regret it.",
    "History 273 01 is a study of Europe from 1914 to 1945, but it is defintely not a summary. Instead it is an intellectual journey that will stimulate your mind and give you many new ideas. YESSSSSSSSS I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CLASS!!!!! IT IS AMAZING!!!!!! It's stimulating, the professor is amazing, I repeat amazing!! You will leave having learned things you would never have learned otherwise. It is a very fair class as well.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Perfect if one is interested in Europe's history or in history of the 20th century in general. Explores aspects of both World Wars that can often be neglected",
    "Yes! Take it! Take it even if history has never been your thing. This course spans so many subjects--literature, art, psychology--in its scope and the readings (there are a lot) will keep you interested and excited about the time period. The lecturer is truly unparalleled.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The readings are somewhat overwhelming, but in my experience many of them are never discussed either in lecture or section, although I'm sure this is dependent on the TA.Professor Winter is a wonderful lecturer who makes you want to pay attention in every class. He has spent his life talking about the subject and is passionate about it. He is also clear about the arguments that he is making, which is very useful for the student taking notes.His analysis of World War 1 and 2 is novel and something that most Yalies should be exposed to.The work itself is very manageable, although if you do all the readings it will take considerable time. The midterm paper is announced well in advance and the TA, at least the one I had were definitely willing to help. The questions for the final are provided in advance, and there are required reading responses. In general though it is a wonderful class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. There is a lot of hidden work. You must find time to read your two books for the midterm paper. This fact is fairly obvious from the syllabus. What's not so obvious is that fact that you have five 1.5-2 pg single spaced reading responses over the course of the semester. This will average out to about 15-20 pgs of extra writing, which should be taken into consideration, since class participation is worth 1\/3 of your grade.The material is great, though, and Professor Winter is the best professor I've had at Yale. I've taken courses with some spectacular professors, but Winter makes it look so easy. He knows this stuff like the back of his hand, and he is really good at transferring that knowledge to students.Take it for Winter and take it for the material. It's a lot of work. You may be able to get by without doing all of it, but you will feel overwhelmed by it at some point during the semester. I was overwhelmed often, but it still turned out to be one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale. Take it.",
    "yes. great class. a lot of reading, but it's all facinating stuff",
    "Europe in the Age of Total War is a wonderful course that covers both world wars and the interwar period. Professor Winter is a very engaging lecturer and his passion for the material is obvious. Don't take the course if you are only interested in the military history - the course covers extensive political and social issues as well. The grading for the class is a midterm paper on a WWI memoir, 3 essays for the final exam, and 5 reading responses. The reading load for this course is enormous - don't expect to complete it all!",
    "Covers the time period between the two World Wars, including the Holocaust. This course doesn't go in depth into many battles or events, but analyzes the the First World War, interwar period and Second World War through a variety of perspectives. Jay Winter is awesome, the lectures are definitely worth attending. There's a lot of reading, but it's manageable and the workload overall isn't bad (midterm paper comparing two war-related memoirs\/books, weekly section with 5 short response essays and a final).",
    "I would describe it as a thematic\/conceptual approach to the period, rather than a primarily factual one. That is not necessarily a bad thing, and I would certainly recommend the course, bothfor the interesting new approaches it provides for thinking about the world wars and for the engaging professor who taught it.",
    "This is an amazing class that I highly recommend to any and everyone; however, I think a lot of people would benefit from taking this class credit\/d, it's a lot of reading.",
    "Take it for an overview of WWI and WWII in Europe, and how they fit into the course of European history. I took it just for fun, and it was a great decision. Be prepared for a lot of reading, but the readings are interesting so its worth it.",
    "WWI, WWII plus arguably the best lecturer at Yale. nuff said",
    "This class was amazing. Winter is a great lecturer; I could easily have listened to him for several hours every day. Of course, the subject of the class is fascinating, too. There's a huge amount of reading--maybe about three or four hundred pages a week on average--but most of it is also very interesting. I realized towards the end of this class that it's actually a very easy class. It has the most reading of any class I've taken--and that includes DS--but, besides that, the midterm essay and the exam are both quite easy, and one could probably get away with doing very little of the reading (which is not to say that one should--I did all the reading and got a lot out of it). Beware of six little essays you'll have to write for section, though. Even though my TA was quite bad, I loved the class and would recommend it to anyone. It's a vital subject to know about, and there's no better way to learn about it than from Winter. Very fun, very informative, and very thought-provoking: definitely one of the best three classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "One of those must take Yale classes. Winter's lecture on why Churchill may be the greatest man to ever live is worth the price of admission alone. You will not be able to do all the reading, however, but that won't necessarily impact your grade. The midterm assignment allowing you to compare to war memoirs is a great departure from the normal history class assignment.",
    "I recommend taking this course regardless of major, as the subject material is fascinating.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. It's probably the best course I've taken at Yale. The final exam was really difficult to prepare for though. Although it's a smart way to do an exam because we pretty much had to study every bit of history that was covered in a coherent way with the 14 final essays we had to prepare. But I definitely learned a lot from it despite how stressful the ending was!",
    "lots of work but really interesting. definitely worth it",
    "great class, definitely take it. provides a new, different outlook to wars that many people think they understand.",
    "This class was amazing. It is one of the most structured and well-organized classes I've ever taken. It really gave me a whole new understanding of that time period, Europe, and the study of history in general. Professor Winter is an amazing, amazing lecturer. The reading is a bit heavy, but every piece is so interesting. During the midterms mayhem, you'll probably resort to skimming a lot, and you can get a way with that.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "Amazing lecture course - like the History Channel for credit. I loved WWI and WWII going in, but I only had a more superficial, video game, AP US History knowledge of it all. This course provided proper European context. But beware, only two assessments all semester - one midterm and final. Also, most reading I've ever seen for a class. But very worthwhile - wish I could have done more of it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class as it is a superbly taught course about a very important period of world history.",
    "great credit\/D class, hard to get an A in",
    "Very engaging lectures, but SO MUCH reading!! I took it credit\/D, which was a great decision because there was no way I could have kept up with the 250+ pages of reading per week. Also, I would have been very stressed about understanding what was going on in lecture if I were taking it for a letter grade, since Winter's lecture style can be, at times, not particularly clear. However, very comprehensive look at World War I through World War II, and fascinating interpretations of history.",
    "Professor Jay Winter is a wonderful lecturer. His eloquent and fascinating arguments make his lectures captivating. The subject material is thought-provoking. Although readings were lengthy, most were very interesting sources.",
    "Everyone has taken a class on the world wars at some point, but you have to take this. Seriously. Take it. Now. Just do it. Don't even think about it. Just take it. Thank me later.",
    "Great class with one of the best lecturers at Yale",
    "I would summarize it as an in depth look at the two world wars and the interwar period. It's not a focus on military movements, though there is some discussion of the military history of the wars. I would absolutely recommend this class, though I warn that there is a LOT of reading that accompanies it. If you don't have astrong interest in the subject, you might find the class a little boring. But if you have even a little interest in the wars, definitely take the class.",
    "This is one the BEST classes at Yale without question. There's alot of reading but it's all interesting and Jay Winter is a PHENOMENAL lecturer. I would literally have heart palpitations during class.",
    "AMAZING lectures, FANTASTIC history class, a TON of reading -- very, very worth it!",
    "Total war is a great course if you're at all interested in this period of history. The lectures are incredible and the readings are really interesting--if you can handle them. My suitemate and I calculated that it's somewhere around 4,000 pages over the semester. I don't know about you, but that wasn't really possible for me. So in that sense the class is a bit frustrating, and the final scary--but if you think you can handle it, or at least commit to read most of the assigned stuff each week, take it.Jay Winter is a god. His lectures are amazing, and somehow he always manages to end right on time with a particularly profound closing note. He does a great job conveying the feelings behind the facts he's lecturing on. The only problem is that he goes over a lot of information very quickly, so if you're trying to handwrite, aren't the fastest typer, or are easily distracted by emails or something, you might miss a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend taking this class.",
    "Total War is an incredible class on a fascinating subject taught by one of the best lecturers at Yale. Professor Winter is amazing. He knows everything and his lectures are incredibly informative, inspirational, informative, etc. TAKE THIS CLASS. There's a lot of reading, but its worth it. It's about the World Wars! TAKE IT.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's certainly the best class I've taken at Yale; I looked forward to almost every lecture. That said, the reading is a lot of work, if you actually do it. I think a lot of the reading isn't necessary, due to how you're graded in the course. But if you're looking for a great history course, or to expand your knowledge of WWI and WWI, this is a choice class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The lectures are fascinating and many of the readings are quite interesting.",
    "This class is a good, interesting lecture, though not the fantastic must-take people seem to claim. If you think history is boring, this class will be interesting to some degree but it won't turn you into a history major.Also, you should know that there are HUMONGOUS readings, and like many big lecture classes, you get out of it what you put in (e.g. how much of the readings you do). If you're one of those people who starts each semester telling yourself that this is the semester you'll buckle down and do the readings, then news flash: no, you won't. If that's you, take it Credit-D if you like the lectures or not at all.",
    "You have to take this class. Go shop it and you'll know why. The lectures are incredible -- don't let the size of the reading deter you. It's worth it.",
    "I think this class is overrated. When I was reading evaluations from prior years, everybody raved about how profound and amazing Professor Winter's lectures were. I wasn't particularly impressed. Winter is a master at making his lectures sound extremely profound, even when they're really not. I found his lectures interesting, but very hard to follow, especially if you're not a war buff who already has a really strong background in World Wars I and II. I did like that the class wasn't like other history classes I've taken, but that also made it challenging. It jumps right into different historical interpretations instead of just giving you the framework and the facts (it's really abstract, which was a really new perspective on history for me). I took it Credit\/D, which I think was a good idea in the long run, though taking it for a grade is definitely doable. There are way too many readings, but it's not necessary to read them all for a good grade.",
    "I highly reccommend it.",
    "Classic history lecture at Yale. Definitely one to take before graduating.",
    "Take it!",
    "Great lecture. Very food for Credit\/D if you don't want to do the reading and just want to hear Professor Winter's amazing lectures. Definitely a great Yale history class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It teaches you a lot about the period 1914-45, which most people appreciate without fully understanding.",
    "yess!",
    "It's a course about the two world wars. I would recommend this class because the content is generally really interesting, but make sure you don't take it Credit\/D\/Fail, like I did. There's just too many reading responses to make it worth your while."
