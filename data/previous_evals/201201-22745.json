    "Pretty boring. Wouldn't take it.",
    "A perfect fifth class! Fun, easy survey class. Really interesting topics analyzed from philosophy and psychology simultaneously. Light-hearted, enjoyable lectures. Perfect amount of interesting reading. Really cool essay topics. No down side to this course!",
    "Would probably take a lot of effort to actually do well in this class. It is, however, possibly the easiest credit in all of Yale if you take it Cr\/D\/Fail. If you do that, the workload is 20mins\/week except 1.5hr\/week for the two weeks you have essays due. You won't have to go to class or section, and you'll definitely get above a D on the final even if you take it cold.All that said, Gendler is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale.",
    "yes!",
    "A great course. I'd recommend it to anyone. Goes over lots of interesting philosophers and their ideas.",
    "The course was an introduction to the study of human nature through the lens of philosophy and cognitive science\/psychology. If you have a significant background in either field, the course might not be stimulating. However, for students who are interested in expanding their academic horizons, I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "It's interesting",
    "Great, fun class. You write a short essay every week and the lectures are super interesting... favorite class this semester.",
    "Take it before you graduate! Even if its Crd\/D, you will learn so much just going to lectures and sometimes doing the readings I suppose. I had never taken a philosophy course at yale but I'm glad that I did and that it was this class. Professor Gendler is AMAZING! She is really invested in her students and organizes the class so well.",
    "Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature with Professor Tamar Gendler is a really excellent way to get some exposure to foundational texts such as Plato and Aristotle, and gain an understanding of current research topics in cognitive science. It is worthwhile to note, however, that Professor Gendler puts a lot of effort into this class, and she expects a lot from her students in return. Class was engaging, but the weekly assignments and essays added up to maybe more work than I'd originally bargained for, especially since there was a set number of high scores given out in each section for each assignment, so the grading distribution was calculated differently than it may be in most humanities classes. On the whole, however, this class was AWESOME and I'm very glad to have taken it.",
    "Definitely! Very fun class.",
    "If you have taken intro psych, intro ethics, or intro ancient philosophy (or related courses), then you will find this course VERY redundant. It basically goes through the main issues that those other courses bring up, but this one does so in much less depth. It's probably terrific if you have no idea what any of that stuff is about, but if you do then don't waste your time.The course policies also were pretty unfair. If you miss a section for ANY reason, you get docked 3 out of 9 points for that section even if you make it up (which is a lot because sections are a hefty portion of your grade). I missed section because I had a 102 fever and was still given this penalty even though I notified the instructor in advance that I was bed-ridden. What's more, every week you have to turn in directed exercises (which is a pain), and no matter how many hours I spent on them I was always graded ridiculously harshly. The papers also seem to be graded arbitrarily. The final exam is next week, so i can't say much about that.I think the course used to be a gut, and the instructor decided to make it 10 times harder after reading the previous evaluations because she didn't want to teach a gut. There is no way that anyone could have done all of the readings--the assignments were so long!! Lecture also was somewhat pedantic and frustrating.Basically, it's a lot harder than I thought it was going to be, and unless you devote your life to the course you're going to get a B. I'm pretty disappointed. Still, if all of this material is new to you, it's probably worth your while because the topics are extremely important to your education.",
    "If you're like me and you want to be well-versed in basic philosophy, but you don't have the time\/energy\/desire to delve deeply into tons of ancient texts, take this class. Pretty easy, the reading and lecture are fun, and Tamar is a force of nature. I would recommend it.",
    "An interesting class, but it kind of felt like a waste of time. Nothing to get passionate over, and the curve makes it kind of hard to get an A. Personally, I would not take it again.",
    "BEST COURSE AT YALE, I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT",
    "Really good class if you know nothing about the subject. If you've taken any courses in these areas already it will be boring unless you motivate yourself to really interact with the supplementary readings or the classical texts in an intellectually rigorous way. For example, if you are the type of person who gets maniacally obsessed about ethical problems or even just intellectual exercises, take this even if the lectures might be useless\/boring (but some of them have cash prizes).",
    "It gets pushed lower and lower as a priority as the semester continues. I'm not sure if I'm glad I took it because I didn't get as much out of it as I could.",
    "I would absolutely take it. Especially if you know nothing about philosophy and have more of a social science background-- it is a great fusion of the two.",
    "A good class that at first is really interesting, then gets a little tedious and repetitive.",
    "Professor Gendler is probably the closest thing you will find to a rock star or a stand up comedian in the world of philosophy. She is great, explains complex issues very clearly, is incredibly entertaining and cares about the students so much ! The topics read are also incredibly fascinating and relevant to all. I would suggest it to everyone except juniors or seniors majoring in philosophy.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! If Tamarisn't teaching it this semester, it might be worth it to wait until next year, because she is incredible. But the material itself is also awesome. Its more philosophy focused than psychology\/cognitive science focused, but the lectures are definitely interdisciplinary. You'll learn so much, and all of the material is extremely applicable. This class rocks.",
    "Take this class! If you're looking for an introduction to philosophy, the cognitive sciences, and psychology, this is the perfect class for you. Don't expect to learn everything in depth, but it's a very good way to gauge your interests.",
    "What Plato got right, as shown by modern psychology. I would recommend this, particularly if you need a humanities credit.",
    "Take this class!!!! It is very interesting. It is much heavier on philosophy than science, but it is still a fantastic way to learn about ancient philosophy all the way up to contemporary philosophy. There is a lot of reading, but you don't have to do it all and some of it is actually pleasant.",
    "Suitable for students from any fields. Must take!",
    "A great first philosophy course. Not too much work, but the readings are mostly great.",
    "Perfect intro phil and psych class. Well structured and thought out. I'd recommend it to any non-DS freshman, and maybe a first-semester sophomore, but for few people beyond that stage, unless it's for personal interest. For anyone older than that with any background in philosophy, a super easy A\/A-.",
    "Definitely! It's a good way to read some of the more famous philosophy texts mixed in with psych studies. It was nice to see how philosophy intersects with empirical data.",
    "Its too much work. If you are interested in the subject then yes sure.",
    "at first the class seemed super interesting but the lectures are just repetition of the reading and got old after a while. by the second half of the semester it was hard to pay attention. the directed exercises are graded excessively difficultly and they're worth 35% of the grade which seems stupid.",
    "Great class, excellent resources and incredibly well structured lectures. The reading are sometimes repetitive, nevertheless they are necessary for the understanding of basic philosophical concepts. Overall a great experience,",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course. Take this course if you'd have time for it because there is so much you can get out of it if you put in the time for it. There is a lot work if you're willing to put in the time. You are not assessed to often, however. Everything becomes really important.",
    "An excellent introduction to crucial concepts in psychology and philosophy. Professor Gendler is an amazing professor - you will never be bored in lecture. Workload is moderate, but interesting. Fabulous.",
    "Good! Interesting material, Professor Gendler is great.",
    "This course teaches you the basics in Philosophy and Human Psychology. You read about Plato, Aristotle, and Kant while also reading about contemporary empirical studies. I thought this course opened up my mind and taught me to think in a new way. The papers were fun to write and allowed me to explore a topic that I was interested in. Definitely worth taking!",
    "See answer to Question 1. I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "It is a mix of philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. I had never had exposure to any of these disciplines before and this course was the perfect way to get that exposure without committing to a super-boring introductory course. It also seemed like it would still be interesting for high-level students in any of those disciplines just because the inter-discipline connections it makes are unique. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "This is an awesome class. A great intro course, and Tamar Gendler is unbelievably intelligent. Take it.",
    "I would recommend it to broaden your ideas and background",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Gendler is great, and the material is very interesting. The workload isn't too heavy: there's a weekly assignment and a couple of essays, but both the assignments and essays are very short.",
    "This is a very interesting class that teaches you a lot about the connection between philosophy, psychology, and other fields. Tamar Gendler is an amazing and animated teacher who really cares about the material. I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a class with a low time commitment that will still hold your interest.",
    "It is not too difficult, but not too easy either. I would absolutely recommend this class. You certainly come of outof with new views about life.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have never read any psychology or philosophy in your life. You can get much better information in other courses.",
    "Extremely well-organized, much thought has gone into this class. If you are into writing philosophy papers, or are willing to give it a try so you can develop your argument skills, take this class! It is not a gut class though -- there IS work to be done.",
    "Definitely recommend taking this course - it was quite unique and rewarding.",
    "Good course, I skipped a lot of classes, and we'll see what happens on the final, but overall I feel like it wasn't as amazing as everyone else said it would be, partially because it lacks depth, but also because a lot of this philosophy stuff gets old after you've heard another courses. it's definitely harder than it was last year, and the study guide for the final exam was 10 pages long, including:165 definitions20 quotes10 essay topicsso it's kind of a rough final exam, and it's really unclear what they're looking for, but overall it's an okay class. Perhaps I'm jaded because I'm not a freshman, and I didn't pay a lot of attention, but the course was okay. It feels a little bit too much like high school, to be honest. The grading is also kind of arbitrary, it seems, especially when it comes to essays. I've had some of the lowest grades in my college career in this class, and I'm not 100% sure why. It must be pretty awesome if you are a freshman though, and I would encourage that you take it. By the way, when it comes to the readings, I didn't really do them because I knew I wouldn't remember them, and that I would form a study group for the final exam. Tamar suggests that you do this, but she also recognizes that students don't always do the readings, and help compensate for it. It really depends on what you want to get out of the course. If you have no experience with the topics, then you really should do the readings and pay attention to go to class, because you really can learn a lot. If you've already taking courses like this before, the philosophy content in the course is pretty useful and will help you sound smart when talking to other people. However, you will be frustrated by hearing about prisoners dilemmas and learning about the Milgram experiment, again. Thankfully we didn't talk about Phineas Gage, or I would've projectile vomited into the crowd. Also, I realize that this is rambling, but I have very mixed thoughts on this class. Try shopping at and see if you would like this kind of experience across the rest of the semester. It's deathly not a super easy class, but it's not that involved either. Also, before I forget, make sure you work really hard on your essays and direct it exercises it, because they are not graded pastel like they were last year. This is a humorous how long this is becoming, but I should also mention in a fatherly way that it is really helpful to spend a lot of time on your essays. Velocity essays are nothing like any other kind of essay you've ever written your entire life, even if you're a senior. So they will be very hard and scary. Also I got lucky because I had a good teaching fellow. I heard that some of the others were not as good, and that was probably not very cool. By the way, you should totally make time to talk with Tamar, since she's one of the most awesome people at Yale. Ironically enough, she occupies the office of a professor who died while she was a student at Yale, the same professor who see the through her freshman dorm window. It's kinda crazy how the world works like that. But really though,this class is pretty good if you're young and haven't taken any philosophy or psychology courses, but if you're older it's not as great, and you really have to decide what you want to get out of it. I hope the length and rambling nature of this essay was enough to distract you from shopping period. But seek my advice, young grasshopper, and you will succeed.ALSO BEFORE I FORGET. Grade distributions from 2011:15% A30% A-30% B+not sure of the rest. math majors can figure it out.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Gendler is the best lecturer I've ever heard and makes coming to lecture informative and totally worthwhile. The workload is really chill too- one short directed exercise a week and two short essays. If you're at all interested in human nature (and how could you not be?), take this class.",
    "Very interesting class, but not recommended if you've taken any sort of philosophy (esp. moral or political philosophy) as there a lot of overlap. Provides an interesting twist because of its interdisciplinary nature - you learn the philosophical theory but see whether it actually applies to humans when you real the empirical work.",
    "Yes, this course is perfect for your first philosophy course. Even if you've taken a lot of philosophy classes, it's fun just being in the lecture because Professor Gendler is amazing!",
    "Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature was a mind-blowing course. As my first introduction to philosophy, it was simply incredible. It has made me want to further pursue studies in the realm of Philosophy. Tamar Gendler is one of the most brilliant people I have ever met--brilliant in every sense of the world. I cannot recall looking at my watch a single time during any of her lectures. She is one of, if not THE BEST, lecturers I have ever had. She makes philosophy oh-so-enticing and superbly enjoyable. Yale is lucky to have such an amazing professor, lecturer, and thinker. In other words... EVERY SINGLE YALE STUDENT SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASSWITH TAMAR GENDLER!!!",
    "Very interesting course. Fascinating to see the interplay between ancient philosophy and modern psychology. Made me think about my life differently. Very happy I took the class. Tamar Gendler's lectures are amazing. Definitely one of those classes you should take at Yale, if you aren't in DS.",
    "If you're afraid of Plato and Aristotle, and don't want to be, take this course. They'll become your friends. A little disjointed at times, but you get into those deep \"college\" conversations.",
    "Great class, don't take it Credit\/D. A lot of the course is what you put in, and you will not put in anything if you Cr\/D it. Very interesting when you actually do the work.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes if you know little about philosophy! Very good survey course.",
    "Great course with really interesting material. I would highly recommend it.",
    "It's okay. A broad overview of philosophy and psychology. Super well-organized, clear expectations, totally manageable. I could see why people liked Gendler, but I found her boring- she talked to us as if we hadn't done any of the readings or gone to any lectures yet during the year, presenting everything as if it was totally new. I wish it was more challenging.",
    "It's a great class but if you want to really enjoy it and get the most out of it, do the readings.",
    "Professor Gendler is great, she is charismatic and her lectures don't get boring. Sometimes it felt like she was babying us a little too much, and for someone already familiar with psychology and cognitive science literature, the examples and studies used were pretty clihch\u00e9d. That said, I had never taken philosophy, so it was useful to look at what were probably clich\u00e9d philosophy texts...meaning that the psych texts we used were probably very good for people that had little to no experience with psych. As an intro class, there is really no way to get around this, just be aware if you already know a lot about either of these subjects, and be prepared to hear a lot of concepts for the 6th, 7th or 8th time.",
    "Awesome take it.",
    "It's an interesting class. You will talk about the material from it in conversations with your friends. It will help you understand yourself and the world around you better. That said, do it as a fifth credit--if you're only doing four classes in a semester, it's not worth being one of them. You'd be better off with a more rigorous philosophy seminar, or psychology class.",
    "This is a class for freshmen and sophomores. Regardless of your major, I would advise against taking it as a junior or senior. I had really high hopes for this class from shopping period, as she really draws you in with her interesting opening examples. However, what serve as cute introductory examples becomes tedious and oversimplified when they're expanded to a full course. She refers backs to the same studies\/philosophies over and over again, and yet never really deeply engages with many of their complexities. If you didn't do the (somewhat extensive) reading you didn't know what was going on in lecture, but if you did do it (and have been at Yale for some length of time), you were very bored as she oversimplified and repeated them. Overall, it just felt a lot like being babied. The directed exercises you need to complete every week are generally useful and sometimes interesting, but all in all, it really felt like a high school class. With that said, if you've never been exposed to any of this material, (which, if you've done any popular psych independent reading, you probably have) it is cool. There's also no question that Professor Gendler really cares about her students and her courses; her target audience just doesn't seem to be upperclassmen.",
    "YES! Like any class, you get what you put into it. If you go to all the lectures and do the readings, you get a lot out of it. Professor Gendler is a great lecturer and every class was fascinating. The readings were laborious at times, but overall the readings were interesting, thought provoking, and captivating. The final was not hard if you studied for it. The two papers were graded fairly. I felt like I learned more about how to write a philosophy paper and my grade reflected that (I did better on the second paper than on the first.) The directed exercises might seem like a hassle, but they really do enhance your learning process. I would suggest this class 100% to anyone. If you are worried that the content might be outside your expertise, Professor Gendler and the TFs are available by email and office hours. Definitely a MUST take!",
    "Great class, definitely take it. Lots of reading responses, but not too bad!",
    "Broad overview of western philosophy. Not really a cognitive science course but the professor makes all the material very accessible. Great course!",
    "YES. One of those must-take classes at Yale, particularly if you haven't learned about psychology or philosophy in a whole lot of depth. Makes you think about human flourishing, morality and political theory in a great introductory way.",
    "I would totally recommend this! Must take class at Yale.",
    "Great lecture for an elective. You'll learn very interesting material (at least once you study for the final), and the class will make you think about interesting topics like morality, happiness, and freedom in a critical way through classical and modern texts. I'm really happy I took it. Tamar Gendler is fantastic--try to get into her section if you can!There's a fair amount of work in the course--weekly directed exercises, two essays, section, and a final. The final is straight-forward, but you can't study for it in one day!",
    "PHIL 181 is a great survey of Philosophy, Psychology, and Cognitive Science. It's a wonderful, in-depth class that manages to cover a lot of material in a fun way. I definitely recommend this class; however, I would caution that there's a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this class. The readings are fascinating, and the class is much more rewarding if you keep up with them. The work is manageable (two short papers, weekly reading responses, section and a final).",
    "TAKE IT. no tests, manageable workload, two short papers, interesting topics, straightforward final.NO TESTS, only a final (she gives u huge study guide with all the possible essay questions, quotations that will be analyzed, and terms that you will need to define. veryyyy straightforward final, you'll just really have to put in the time to study.)Weekly assignment, usually 2 pages long. Takes 2-3 hours, not bad at all. She lays out exactly what she's looking for, and even gives examples.Topics are pretty interesting, covers a broad range of stuff.Lectures are engaging, her powerpoints and presentations are the best. u can tell she puts a lot of time into them...she has animations, clicker questions, etc.2 papers - about 4 pages long, not too stressful. they take some time, but she gives u an outline to follow and as long as u put in the effort, you'll be fine.",
    "This class definitely serves its purpose as an intro. course. You get exposure to all sorts of topics and ideas. By the end of the course, you have a general comprehension of the broad overview of philosophy. I would highly recommend this class to those who are considering\/interested in philosophy. The lectures are enjoyable. And if you find a topic you're interested in, you can discuss it in more depth with your TF.",
    "Good course, take it!",
    "Summary of the course: A fabulous survey introduction to philosophy and cognitive science. Stimulating ideas, a terrific instructor, and fascinating readings. I read a review of this course as something like a \"goody bag\" of ideas, and that description is spot on.I would HIGHLY recommend this course to a fellow student--assuming s\/he did not have an in-depth background in philosophy. If you've never studied philosophy before--like I hadn't--then this course is the perfect chance to be introduced to important thinkers. There's absolutely not assumption that you have any background in philosophy--but you're also not coddled. Personally, I thought what made this course an introduction to philosophy was that it introduced these thinkers alongside modern psychology, which made the material more accessible. The work-load is demanding, but if you put in the effort, it is extraordinarily rewarding. The only really \"hard\" part of this class are the essays. And if you do well enough on them (which is not hard to do, since you'll likely do better on the second one, and the higher grade gets weighted more), then you're likely in a good position, because the directed exercise only require 1-2 hours of effort and the exam is based directly off of a study guide provided by Professor Gendler. You really can't go wrong taking this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I took it for my Hu credit, but it ended up being super interesting anyways. You will learn more fundamentals about philosophy and psychology than you will in any other course.",
    "Everyone should take a philosophy course before they graduate, and unless you're diehard into politics (in which case you should take Political Philosophy) then ABSOLUTELY take this class. I don't think Professor Gendler is teaching it next year, but if even if she isn't, take it! If she is, then all the more reason to take it! Her personality is wonderful and I wish I had been in her section so I could have known her better. Lectures are great, and funny if you pay attention. In a nutshell, I recommend this class wholeheartedly, but there is quite a bit of reading. You don't have to do all of it, especially since there's a wonderful study guide for the final at the end.",
    "TAKE IT, especially if Gendler is teaching it. Most organized and fun lecture I've ever taken at yale. Quite a lot of reading compared to most courses, but most of the reading is fun. Also, DO all your reading even if it's kind of a pain - it will be worth it when it comes to the final.",
    "Prof Gendler is absolutely fantastic and makes this 300 person lecture course seem like an interaction. Her lectures were brilliant, the readings were engaging, the homework was light (perhaps too much so). If you are interested in the mind, take this, unless you want to major in CogSci or something, in which case this course will very rapidly prove redundant.",
    "Best class I've taken so far at Yale. Absolutely take it regardless of what your academic interests are.",
    "Yes!!! So much of the material that you learn in the course is things that you should be aware of or at least familiar with. Also, most of the things we learned are definitely applicable to everyday life.",
    "Awesome class. The material was extremely interesting, and Professor Gendler is a phenomenal lecturer. The class is structured really well so that the material really comes together at the end of the semester. Apparently this semester was substantially harder than previous semesters...definitely not a gut, but not too difficult even if you don't do all the readings (which you almost for sure won't). Definitely take it if it's being taught, which I guess will not be for a couple years.",
    "IF YOU ARE A STUDENT AT YALE YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS WHILE YOURE HERE. It really is the prototypical Yale class, and it runs like a well tuned machine. I wish every class at Yale was set up and run like this class. Gendler is the most well organized professor, the V2 page is streamlined and there is a definite plan to the course that keeps it moving along in new and interesting directions. Kind of like a movie that hits a lot of points while maintaining themes that make you think and that moves with ever building momentum that keeps you on the edge of your seat and never leaves you behind (think forrest gump). The readings are usually not too long and are often engaging to the point where you will really have to look at how you are living your life and viewing the world. Also, the class doesnt try to force a worldview on you like some other classes, but rather it gives you a bunch of insight into human nature from a bunch of angles and lets you decide how to apply it to your own ideas of who and what we are. Bottom line: take it in 2014.",
    "Highly reccommended. You will find this interesting. It manages to incorporate many very different fields of study to answer important questions about human nature. The reading list includes everything from \"must read\" classical works of philosophy to contemporary behavioral studies.",
    "Introduction to the parts of philosophy you want to learn about.",
    "Take it.",
    "Yes, don't think twice about taking this class. It's super interesting foranyone whose interests range from humanities to science and Professor Gendler does an amazing job of choosing readings and giving lectures that tie together perfectly and also are interesting, engaging, and a pleasure to participate in. It's not a lot of work, but for your own sake take this class seriously because you'll get so much out of it!",
    "If you're interested in learning basic concepts in the field of philosophy and psychology, this course is fitting. The material doesn't go too in depth in each topic, but most are still interesting to learn about.",
    "yes",
    "TAKE IT. Professor Gendler is AMAZING and so are all the course readings. She actually makes you care and think Aristotle and Plato are awesome. You get what you put into the class. Bottom line: take it.",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone who hasn't had much exposure to philosophy. It introduces you to some key works and connects it to greater themes and ideas that are relevant in modern psychology and cognitive science.",
    "Cognitive Science 281 01 does a decent job of introducing you to cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology. Don't take this course if you're not interested in \"theoretical\" stuff. The readings sometimes feel like they go in circles, and in the end, the course does not reach any conclusions. The cognitive science and psychology part are decently applicable to daily life. You'll learn about cognitive biases, human irrationality, etc. A decent course overall.",
    "Interesting, but more philosophy intensive than neuroscience. It is a good introduction into the field of philosophy though to see if you are interested in that area of study.I would recommend the course as an intro to philosophy. I wouldn't for those interested in a cognitive science class.",
    "TAKE IT!! I learned so much and enjoyed the readings, lectures, sections, and the professor was incredible!!",
    "Take this class!! The readings are a lot of time, but many of them are really interesting. Grade distribution is great, too.",
    "If you're interested in a survey course where you read a little bit of a lot of people's work, take this class. I thought it was a decent introduction to philosophy and cog sci, and probably more interesting than taking either one separately. Gendler's a fair professor, although there's more work associated with this class than you might think.",
    "Good",
    "the class was pretty epic. however, itd do you more good if you took a normal intro philosophy or psychology class first and then this class. the class won't give you enough of an intro in either subject.",
    "This course was extremely interesting. Professor Gendler explained classic texts\/philosophers Plato, Aristotle, Kant and so on in a very clear way. She combined psychology, philosophy together and made everything very applicable to everyday life. Using the clickers was really fun and allowed students to participate in the lecture. Doing directed exercises every week was annoying.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all students. Prof. Gendler is fantastic and lectures were really enjoyable.",
    "This class is a lot of work. Don't expect it to be easy. It is way more work than you think. But its really worth it. You learn a lot, lectures are fun, and at the end, preparing for the final, you'll really undertand how all the material comes together in a really synthetic way. The final is a ton of material, though. Take this class if you want to be challenged, if you wat to work outside your comfort zone, struggle through writing a philosophy paper, and really work hard to understand some of the classics. It is tough, but worth it.",
    "A great 5th class-- somewhat light on content and you've probably encountered much of it in other classes, but really really interesting and probably contextualizes things differently than you've ever had in a class before. The lectures are actually fun and go quickly, and the reading is truly interesting. Highly recommended.",
    "Tamar Gendler is the best teacher I have ever met. Her perfectionism and dedication is evident in every aspect of this course. She is truly phenomenal.The course is a lot of work - directed exercises can often take time, and the grading is usually unjust and will not reflect the effort you put into it. The final exam is fair, and really gives you a great opportunity to review all the material, and fill in the gaps you missed throughout the year.Its crucial to have a good TA - otherwise 70% of the experience of the course will be lost - some TA's are just really poor and were recruited last minute because the demand for this course was incredibly hight.",
    "Good, solid, clear, straightforward course. Professor Gendler is the star of this show and she explains everything so clearly and lays everything in front of you so thoroughly that it is impossible to be confused. I wish I could BE HER. The course can be a bit more challenging though, I felt that sometimes it was too simple and only skimmed the surface, but as an intro course I guess that is what it is supposed to do.",
    "If you don't take this class while at Yale, you're without a doubt doing yourself a disservice. TAKE IT. Prof. Gendler is OUTSTANDING- she makes the material SO interesting, and presents it SO clearly and in SUCH an engaging (even FUN) way (and she's SOOOOO nice and fun to talk to). The intersection of disciplines around which this course focuses is so intriguing, and she elucidates that connection expertly. Her assessments are super fair (and even fun to do), and the course as a whole is structured extremely well and extremely logically, so that you don't just have a random collection of information in your head when you leave this class, you have a distinct storyline of thought and science woven together that you will remember for years after Yale (and will help you live a better life- if you think I'm kidding, take the class; if you don't think I'm kidding, take the class).",
    "Great course; a must-take! Wonderfully structured and well taught.",
    "Yes. Provides a good introductions to various philosophers. Do spend some time on the essays though, because they can be challenging.",
    "Definitely recommend. Take it!",
    "Well worth taking. The themes presented in the course are important ones that should be considered at some point during your academic career.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone looking for intro to philosophy class. It's very engaging and the cognitive science\/philosophy present throughout the course definitely adds a new component making the philosophical works come alive. Having said this, bare in mind there is a short reading response every week! And also, ensure you get a good TA. Whether you end up loving or hating the class will be highly dependent on how engaged you are during section!",
    "Definitely recommend it, must take at Yale!",
    "Cognitive Science 281 is a great way to become familiar with some major philosophical works while remaining grounded in findings from modern social science. The course is best experienced if you have time to do the readings and approach either your TF or, more importantly, Professor Gendler herself with questions about the material. Try to remain cognizant of the course's broader themes - Professor Gendler puts a lot of time into making connections among all the different strands of the course.",
    "Generally speaking, I would not recommend this course to other students. Only take it if you're truly passionate about the majority of the topics covered (and doing weekly reading responses graded on a scale from 1-9, attending section, writing two \"short\" essays, and reviewing an enormous review sheet for the final). Professor Gendler is great and lectures are entertaining, but this course requires too much work to be taken as an easy fourth or fifth credit.",
    "If you have a budding interest in the intersection between psychology and philosophy, this course is a must-have. That said, I emphasize \"budding\" interest. If you are an upperclassman or have taken any one or a combination of Intro Psych, Game Theory, or Intro Ethics, a LOT of this course will be repeat for you. There's good and bad to that of course, but just know that is what you will be getting.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you want to learn about the relationship between psychology and philosophy",
    "I would recommend this course. Not too hard, not that much work. Gives you a good background for discussion about philosophical concepts at Yale.",
    "I would summarize Philosophy 181 as a course that doest a great job at combining elements of philosophy and psychology in a very interesting way. There are weekly writing assignments that help one to stay on top of the readings as well as a few short essays that are not very intensive. Additionally, there is a very comprehensive review for the final exam that is extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is a great class for anyone who wants to be gently exposed to philosophy. You read bits of Plato, Aristotle, Kant, etc. and supplement the readings with modern philosophy and cognitive science readings. The first half of the semester is basically a self-help class. Which is a lot of fun. I'd advise taking it credit D, so you can just do the readings that interest you, and not worry too much about the weekly assignments and short papers, and still get a lot out of the class. Prof. Gendler is a great lecturer, and keeps them concise and entertaining. There is the (slight) possibility of winning a large sum of money.",
    "I would talk this class if you're looking for a humanities credit. Not too much work and the readings are interesting.",
    "A wonderful course, one that makes you really think about how you live your own life. Very relevant to LIFE. With no philosophy background, I found it very accessible, well-structured, and digestible. Very reasonable amount of work, definitely a must-take.",
    "It's a really interesting look at ourselves. It attacks the deep questions from a variety of angles. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Amazing awesome course. Sometimes the guides were too detailed for their own good, but the helping intention was definitely appreciated. would recommend to anyone.",
    "Great cross-disciplinary introduction to Philosophy that also touches quite a lot on Psychology\/Cog Sci. Fascinating stuff (although DS-ers or people who've already taken Phil courses may be bored) taught by a great lecturer without too much work and with a straightforward exam at the end. Take it.",
    "Overall a great course where you will truly learn a lot! Take it if you are interested in Philosophy and Psychology but keep on top of the readings.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who's the least bit curious about human behaviour. This will give you insight into the philosophical discussion about human nature since 400 BCE or so as well as the recent findings through psychology and cognitive science.",
    "This class is an exploration of human flourishing, morality, and political structures from the perspectives of philosophy, cognitive science, and psychology. As a Psych major, I would definitely recommend this class. It's straightforward for non-majors, but for Psych majors it provides a nice new perspective on issues you have been presented with in other classes. It's a nice change of pace. It's not too difficult, and Tamar Gendler makes it clear that she really just wants you to succeed on the final exam - she gives an incredibly comprehensive review sheet, and hosts lots of review sessions.",
    "A great multidisciplinary survey course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who enjoys both psychology and philosophy.",
    "PHIL 181 is a great survey to philosophical thought. While its introductory nature may render the approach to philosophy as a discipline slightly elementary, you definitely get a good grasp of important authors of both philosophy and psychology, including Plato, Aristotle, Epictetus, Kant, Hobbes, Rawls, Nozick, Csikszentmihalyi and Milgram. Professor Gendler is a very very organized professor, and her method of approaching the subject will smooth over any difficulties you may encounter. The only piece of warning I haveis that the reading is intense, and if you want to get the most out of the class, you must complete it all.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to everyone. Especially those who haven't had exposure to philosophy before - this is a great way to learn about the major philosophies of the western world and how they influence us today.",
    "This was a great course! Take it even if you have no background in psychology\/ philosophy. Professor Gendler is absolutely wonderful and her lectures are always interesting and engaging. There is a fair amount of reading (if you do it), weekly assignments that aren't too demanding, two, two papers, and a final exam. The final exam was very straightforward.",
    "It's a great introductory philosophy\/psychology\/cognitive science class. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you are interested in any or all of these areas and have not taken a phil\/psy\/csci class before.",
    "This class is great for anyone who is interested in learning some philosophy is a very laid back and fun environment. I had never read philosophers like Plato and Aristotle before so for me it was a great introduction. Gendler is an excellent lecturer and her power points are always fun and engaging. The reading load varies from day to day but is never too much. You also do not have to do all the readings in order to do well. The course has 10 weekly directed exercises which are 300-500 words long except for the last one which is longer and requires you to create a additional week for the class. There are 3 1000 word essays but you only have to do 2. And there is a final at the end, which is easy since Gendler giver you all the potential questions that will be on it. I highly recomponed this class to anyone who wants an easy introduction in philosophy and cognitive science.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow student. However, I would caution that it is a lot or reading, and although the lectures are very interesting at first, the novelty seems to fade and the heavy workload and reading makes lectures get increasingly more boring.",
    "If you're a freshman and you want to understand human nature, don't take DS Philosophy, take this. Also if you're not a freshman and you want to understand something about the way we think and why we do what we do, take this class. (Side note: it rehabilitated philosophy for me after DS).I had no background in psychology but this class was approachable, interesting, and made difficult concepts easy to understand. I feel I understand the world a bit better for taking this class.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it if you want a broad understanding of everything but it definitely does overlap with a few other psych intro courses.",
    "Speaking as someone who doesn't like philosophy, it was surprisingly tolerable. The class did a good job of integrating the different disciplines and tying all of the topics and readings together at the end. It was very engaging for a large lecture.",
    "Probably the best intro class I have taken at Yale. Compared to intro psych, this class is infinitely better. Covers philosophy, psychology, and cogsci in a very exciting way. Personally, integrating philosophy is the only way psychology is made interesting for me. Great lectures.",
    "Not a bad credit D class. Personally wouldn't take this class for a grade, as the material wasn't SUPER compelling for me, although it was for others. Lectures are pretty good for the most part, although sections can be a real bore at times.",
    "The class was fine, but don't get your hopes up.",
    "Definitely take this. Its a great way to get introduced to really important philosoophers and see how that connects to oother fields and modern life. Professor Gendler is an amazing lecturer witha brilliant vision for the class. Its fun, engaging, and informative. Slightly more work than I thought itd be but none the worse for it.",
    "I really enjoyed this class; Prof. Gendler is a very engaging and funny lecturer, and she makes a lot of interesting connections between psychology and philosophy. It is a very large lecture, and unless you take the time to go to her office hours, the class may feel a little impersonal at times. The material at the beginning is also very similar to Intro to Psych, but the subjects diverge in the end.",
    "PHIL is a great class that introduces students to the themes of happiness\/flourishing, human justice and morality.",
    "The combination of the philosophy and psychology was interesting, but you should know that the psychology was mostly used to test the philosophy, so don't take the course just for the psych. I'd recommend it. If you're not sure, just watch a few of the open courseware videos.",
    "Great class. You learn a lot and think in ways you may not have thought in before.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was really fun and interesting. Lectures were very enjoyable. I took it Cr\/D, and I would say it's worth taking for a grade. The work load is very reasonable, and you pretty much have to do the assignments to pass, but if you do them and study for the final you'll probably get a good grade. The class is very straightforward in terms of grades.",
    "Fantastic class. Take it if it's offered again. Will make you critically evaluate the way you live.",
    "Great for freshman! shows you how to study. Less about original ideas however and more about synthesizing and name dropping.",
    "I would definitely recommend Philosophy 181 as an introductory course to the intersection between philosophy, psychology and cognitive science. I think the course could benefit from some more rigor, but that being said the professor is amazing (I have yet to have another who could even come close to matching her lecturing skills) and the topics the class addresses are great. You can probably get away with doing only a minimal amount of the reading, but if you do take this course I strongly recommend that you do them--they are fascinating and very thoughtfully chosen. Gendler is very clear about grading policies which is great and the reading guides for the class are unparalleled. Ultimately it is a great class, and you can get a lot out of it, particularly if you challenge yourself to do so.",
    "Yes. Take it. Especially if you're a freshman.",
    "Introductory philosophy course; good for people who haven't taken a lot of philosophy before, but beware, the curve is tough because all the grades seem high in absolute value.",
    "Yes take this",
    "Awesome awesome awesome. Just take it. Perfect combination of psychology and philosophy -- if you are familiar with one field and are worried about dabbling in the other, don't be! The entire field was made so accessible.",
    "Yes. 100%. Take this course if you can.",
    "EXCELLENT course. Prof Gendler puts SOOO much effort into this class and it really shows; I wish all instructors at Yale were like her. Really interesting course with a wide spread of topics within the themes of the class. Can feel a little spread out, but I think it barely pulls together well enough - especially as it is a fairlyintroductory course.Would hesitate to recommend to a higher level Phil student as it's pretty intro. Lots of topics though, and does a good job of pulling together big themes and comparing etc.",
    "I kinda would not recommend this class to other students, especially not upperclassmen. I just felt that it was sort of a mismatch of everything, and that it was sort of a stretch to connect everything together--i mean seriously, what really do the prisioner's dilemma and plato's republic have to do with one another? and the other thing is that if you try hard enough, of course, you can connect anything to anything, which is interesting as an intellectual exercise, i suppose, but not really for me.But on the other hand, maybe I just don't like the cog sci aspects of thecourse, as I enjoyed far more simply learning about Greek philosophy and history, with a little psych thrown in. So if cog sci and random experiments are your thing, this is the class for you.",
    "Phil 181 was fascinating. It linked together interesting concepts that have come up over and over again across the ages. It raises important questions about human nature, how societies are organized and morality. It is a fun introduction to philosophy.",
    "This is a great class to introduce you to well-known philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Rawls, Nozick, Kant, Mill) and psychologists that think about the same topics. Professor Gendler's course is extremely well-organized and each reading and directed exercise has been specially chosen to improve what you take away from this class. The course is a bit more work than you would expect of a large lecture class, but the assignments are not busy work but more about you actively engaging with the material, which is nice.",
    "The material for this class is really varied and interesting. It's a little bit too easy to get behind with the material, but having to be prepared for section does catch you up. The assignments are all straightforward and not very stressful, but it's hard to do VERY well on them... Getting A's requires \"excellent\" work, not just good enough. The preparation for the final was very straightforward, as Professor Gendler provided us with all the possible questions. There will definitely be at least something in this course that really captivates and fascinates you in the readings!",
    "Don't take this class if you've done DS or intro cog sci. I was bored.",
    "It's a good class, though not as great as its reputation. It provides a quick overview of the philosophical outlooks of plato, aristotle, hobbes, kant, nozack, and others and how their views fit in with modern psychological research.",
    "Yes! The class was extremely interesting. It had a lot more to do with philosophy than I had originally expected, but all in all, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "PHIL 181 is a great class if you have never taken a philosophy or psychology course. I found it an excellent opportunity to explore these fields I'd never had the chance to explore before.",
    "YES. Do it. It is amazing (unless you have done a lot of philosophy courses).",
    "The class is fascinating, but be prepared for a lot of reading. Professor Gendler is one of the best lecturers I've seen, but the amount of outside reading she requires is overwhelming at times. If you're not a reader, I would not recommend the course. If you are, it's one of the best classes out there.",
    "YES TAKE IT!",
    "Take this class. Whether you take it as a minimal work gut or put in the time to get the most out of it, the course will be worth it. Professor Gendler is excellent, the material is interesting and applicable, and you can get a good grade while varying how much work you put in.",
    "excellent class. i highly recommend it for anyone (even vaguely) interested in the subject. not that difficult and well taught.",
    "Summary of major schools of philosophical thought juxtaposed against psychological study.",
    "I'm a psych major, and I initially decided to take this class because I needed another psych credit. One of my friends had taken it last year and declared it the best class she'd ever taken in her life, but I was skeptical. I'd taken plenty of intro-level psych courses before, and I'd taken philosophy in high school. I wasn't sure what would make this such a revelatory experience. Nevertheless, after attending a couple of lectures, I decided I'd take it credit\/D\/fail.Ohboy. Am I glad I changed my mind about that.I'm not the gush-y type where course evaluations are concerned. That said, out of all my psych courses, this ended up being the one I enjoyed the most, where I made a concerted effort to do the readings as often as I could and participate in section and get up at 10:00 in the morning (even when I was running on minimal sleep) to attend lecture. It was *interesting* and relevant to everyday life in tangible ways. I enjoyed the interaction between the disciplines of philosophy and psychology, subjects I had always loved separately but never really thought to combine. And if I had the chance to do the semester over again, I would devote even more academic energy to PSYC 181, because it was the course I consistently got the most out of. Even though many of the topics were old ones for a psych major (is there a psychology course at Yale that DOESN'T discuss the Prisoner's Dilemma?), I was rarely bored by them because they were being viewed through the lens of philosophy as well as psychology.So yeah, unless you're a psych\/philosophy double major, if you're on the fence about this course, go ahead and take it.",
    "This class lives up to the hype: engaging lectures, entertaining readings, and a refreshing, interdisciplinary approach. I think this is a great class to take as an underclassman or just as a student who has not had much exposure to the fields covered. It would still be fun, however, even if you have had some experience with philosophy, psychology, or CogSci, as all of the material is presented under the umbrella of \"human nature,\" which is certainly one of the most important and interesting concepts to study.",
    "Definitely if you like interdisciplanary stuff; that was the most interesting part of the course and I think I learned a lot from it. Not so much if you don't like philosophy, which takes up a lot of this course.",
    "Yes--one of the must takes at Yale.",
    "Great class! Take it for the experience!",
    "PHIl 181 combines philosophical work from \"dead guys on Tuesday\" with current empirical work from \"cog sci on Thursday.\" Everyone at Yale should take this course. It reviews information from a variety of interesting fields: happiness, morality, justice. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
    "If you want to think about life's big questions in a well-organized, broad course, then yes.",
    "Absolutely! This would also be a really great 5th credit class, with not a lot of stress.",
    "This course was great. The superior organization of the class created a fertile environment for both learning brand new concepts and expanding our knowledge of familiar concepts. The great cohesion between the interdisciplinary materials covered allowed us to make connections that we hadn't before. The pairing of having superior command in a lecture setting and being personable in a more intimate setting makes Tamar Gendler a truly amazing professor. I am very glad to have taken this class. My only hesitation in saying so is that I wished I had had more academic experience before taking the course. It probably would have been more fulfilling had I taken it my junior or senior year, because I would have been able to synthesize what I had learned during my first few years and used them to establish a more supportable stance on issues.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in psychology or philosophy, I really enjoyed it and the workload was very manageable.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to every Yale student. You are really missing out if you don't take this class. It will change your life for the better in every conceivable way.",
    "Take this class, but be expected to do a lot more reading and work than expected.",
    "I highly recommend this class because it provides a great perspective on aspects of human nature from a well-balanced psychological and philosophical perspective.",
    "YES - best course I've taken during my 4 years at Yale.Professor Gendler is AMAZING, and you'll get a great introduction to key texts in philosophy, psychology, and cog sci.",
    "It's a good class. I think it has a lot to offer most students, even those with a solid background in philosophy or psychology (maybe less so those with previous classes in both). Prof Gendler does a great job of synthesizing information and bringing together recurrent themes in a way that gets you to think more generally about the material presented and the way the issues raised relate to how you move through the world.",
    "If you already know a lot about philosophy and or psych about human nature, you'll probably be bored. If not, it's a fantastic and fun introduction.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!! It is by far the best course I have ever taken at Yale. The readings are interesting and Gendler provides a reading guide for each one so you know exactly what you should be taking away from them. Lectures were incredible, intriguing, and delivered by the best lecturer I've ever had. The class is so well organized. You know exactly what assignments are due and when, what is expected of you, and how grades will be calculated. There really wasn't a lot of work; readings for each class (25-50 pages), a weekly directed exercise that could be completed well in about 20 mins (~300-500 words), 2 short essays (800-1200 words each), and a final exam (with a study guide containing all possible exam questions provided). The topics are so interesting and you will leave the course having a new perspective on human thought and action. Again, definitely take this course!!!!",
    "Yes, i would recommend it to a person who is curious about psychology and philosophy and wants to take an introductory class in it.",
    "I would recommend this class, but encourage students to look at the amount of reading required and consider whether of not they'll have time to do all of them. When it came down to finals period, it was necessary to collaborate with other students on the study guide so that all the terms discussed in readings, etc. could be compiled collectively.",
    "Psych 181\/phil 181 is a great course that connects philosophy and psychology in interesting, challenging ways. The course is definitely a great way for psych majors to see how philosophy connects to issues discussed inmodern day psychology, and how these topics date back into ancient philosophy. Professor Gendler is an amazing Professor, and lectures are always fun and interesting. The reading load can sometimes be a little heavy, if readings are complex or very long. Studying for the final seems daunting, but the review guide and the many office hours and review sessions make studying a lot more feasible and straight forward. Prof. Gendler communicates her expectations very well, and is very willing to integrate feedback from students.",
    "I am a student that has trouble keeping up with the work in a lecture if you are not forced to do so. If you are similar, be careful. Too seldom did I do the reading, even though it was excellent. Like any course, what you get out is related to what you put in. I got quite a lot out of the course considering the work I did, but i fell into a poor pattern.The fact that the course completely ignored the question of God is, in retrospect, a bit disturbing. Most of the questions in the course have been approached over and over from a theological perspective. Ignoring religion makes the course fundamentally incomplete. The course seemed comprehensive while I was taking it, and only after the fact did I really look back and ask these questions. CGSC 281 covers a lot of interesting ground and some great thinkers, but it does so by skillfully avoiding the deep questions of divinity.If there is a God, that has deep implications for flourishing, morality, and political legitimacy\u0097no doubt God would have some insights into these matters. If there is not a God, this too has deep implications for flourishing, morality, and political legitimacy. Either way, human nature rests on the possibility of God. I wouldn\u0092t weigh the efficacies of going rock climbing versus going to a movie without inquiring about the weather\u0097nor would I try to determine how to live the most satisfying life without wrestling with God.You can\u0092t cover everything in a class. But that\u0092s what makes the study of human nature challenging, and to largely leave out a huge aspect of humanity feels pretty strange\u0097it feels sort of like studying mathematics without every talking about geometry or angles. You can do it, but you miss out on a lot of interesting stuff and end up with a dangerously incomplete set of solutions.Plato, Aristotle, and Epictetus would have been fascinated by the teachings of Jesus, Muhummad, and Buddha-- and would probably have a lot to say about them. They would carefully weigh these \u0093religious\u0094 ideas of human nature and struggle with them. Perhaps Plato would have become Christian and maybe Epictetus would become a monk. In any case, I hope they would want usto examine the full scope of ideas. I think Aristotle would be disappointed with us for leaving out a universe of thought in an introductory course on human nature.",
    "Great class, take it - great lecturer, important and interesting material.",
    "Philosophy and the science of human nature is a great class that provides an introduction to both philosophy and phycology. I would strongly recommend this class, I really looked forward to the lectures because they were very interesting and incredibly applicable to my own life.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. It doesn't have too much work. It has interesting readings and is very accessible!",
    "EVERYONE AT YALE SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE!!",
    "If you're at all interested in psychology and philosophy (and you don't know much about the latter) take this course. If you simply want to take a great course, take it with Tamar. She's phenomenaL.",
    "It's an interesting overview of a wide array of topics. A good class, but a bad choice for credit-d because of the weekly assignments.",
    "Yes, it's a really interesting course if you want to learn more about human nature (who doesn't), and it will really expand your outlook on people, yourself, and on life.Be prepared to \"read\" and write a lot!!! Mostly write though, since you really don't need to read any of the articles, just go to class and take sparse notes on the terms and important concepts, and you will be fine on the exam.If you have time though, look through the articles and pick an interesting one to read in your spare time, since they're amazing in terms of being loaded with interesting and captivating content.",
    "Absolutely take this class! If you are looking for an engaging and relevant survey course of the big philosophers, this is the class for you. I'm not familiar with Knobe's course format, but Tamar Gendler has done a SUPERB job organizing the class. It is a student's dream. The expectations are clearcut, the reading managable, and everything is basically spelled out for you. The workload is totally managable. It is possible to entirely not touch the readings during a busy week and still understand what is going on in lecture. There are weekly reading responses that require about 3 hours of time reviewing the readings (especially if you haven't done them yet) but they are pretty painless. Additionally, I would actually recommend doing the readings when you can, because Tamar has put an immense amount of effort into compiling interesting readings from a variety of disciplines. Also in this class, you will learn how to write a philosophy paper. The TAs assume you have never done this before, so they give a lot of advice, and are very understanding, especially the first time around. TAKE IT. GREAT AND NOT TOO HARD. YOU LEARN A TON. And it's meaningful!",
    "Yes. And yes! Great summary of the great ideas about human interaction. A must for every Yale student. Make that every human being.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "Yes! A fabulous course that covers a huge number of very interesting ideas. It changed the way I think about morality and society.",
    "Wonderful class. Masterfully designed. Take it!",
    "Take this course! It's manageable and interesting, although I think you can get away without doing a good majority of the reading. However, to get the most out of this course, do all the reading, participate in section and start your papers early. Go to all the lectures as well. This course was fantastic and I wish I could take it again. A great introduction to philosophy."
