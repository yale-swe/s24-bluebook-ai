    "Renaissance Portraits and techniques. That's the class.",
    "An incredible in-depth study of Renaissance portraiture with respect to Renaissance society. Origins of portraiture studied and more modern portraits and concepts also explored. Moreover, a study of portraits in relation to religious themes, social status, memory, and authorship. I would recommend this class to someone interested in art and how and why humans depict themselves and others.",
    "This class is awesome. Professor Keizer has an interesting lecture style that builds up his point, so you don'tfeel like he is just asking you to believe something. The readings can be a lengthy and there are a lot of them, but for the most part, you didn't really have to read them. There is just a midterm and final (which are the same format!) and one final essay. I know the subject may seem limited, but you learn a ton more than you might think!",
    "I would definitely recommend it."
