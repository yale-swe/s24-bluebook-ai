    "I was able to see completely different ways of interpreting the world and images. Sandra's perception is amazing, she can interpret little minute details that for me would have gone unnoticed but make a whole lot of sense and do tell the story behind what is being shown. I feel I got a better sense of how to build \"think pieces\" instead of \"taking the viewer by the hand\", however I would still need a lot more practice for it to become second nature.",
    "I learned about filmmaking.",
    "I learned a lot of technical skills as well as the ethics of documentary storytelling.",
    "I learnt how to look at a story and critique it. I also learnt how to carve a narrative, shoot from different angles, conduct an interview, empathize with an interviewee and produce engaging content. Learnt many helpful and hands on skills.",
    "learned filmmaking mostly by doing",
    "During this course I developed technical filmmaking skills as well as insights into the process of making a film.",
    "Learned how to operate a camera, operate sound equipment, edit film, interview a subject, find the most interesting story among footage, how to create interesting visuals, how to \"show, not tell.\"",
    "This course taught me how to tell a story in a cohesive, interesting, and visually appealing way. The class furthered my camera and editing skills as well."

   "comments": [
    "was disorganized and didn't maximize the use of class time to learn technical stuff.",
    "Time commitment is huge. Huge, Huuuuuuuge. Lots of readings, training videos and also the need to produce video material. Coming from grad school, I was lucky enough to have a lot of knowledge from photography, and still it took me a long time to do everything, half-way through the course I dropped film skills because I didn't feel I could keep up and I just thought it got a little uninteresting. The pro side is having different opinions and being immersed in an art school class, where the environment and discussions were very different from the business school. Another point was that We had approximately 4 weeks I think to do our final assignment, but only one week between our class critique and the final showing. That was very hard to pull off, because basically almost everyone needed to re-do their film structure. Still it worked.",
    "Class material is so interesting it is hard to not be engaged but at times felt way too simple.",
    "The class could involve a few more in class demonstrations, those were particularly helpful when we had them.",
    "could've gotten way more done, lots of class time wasted on tangents",
    "The class is very conversational based. In a class that last nearly 4hrs this can be draining. Sometimes the conversations seem very one-sided and opinions seem to be dismissed easily by the professor. At the same time the discussions can lead into an infinite variety of conversations where the focus is the interaction with your peers, which is fun (conversations can be about technical aspects of film, to discussing movies, to race relations). The weekly reading assignments start off engaging but toward the end of the class seem to have a disconnect and seem pointless from the class. The biggest positive is the lessons you learn from the professor about her experience in filming, and watching\/discussing her works. This is where the most is learned and if you actually are interested in filming can learn about the industry.",
    "This course is good at getting you out in the field with a camera. It helps to teach reinforce the importance and structure of narrative in filmmaking. However, this course lacked technical instruction on how to use the camera. While the videos that were assigned were informative it is not nearly as helpful as practicing it with a camera in hand.",
    "This class does a great job of providing professor feedback on weekly student work. Each video project is given great attention during class critiques. The course encourages students to think critically about how to most effectively tell stories and communicate a message. Sandra is extremely interesting and very helpful. Some of the readings don't seem completely necessary. Class time should probably be structured so that there is some time for discussion about the readings, as well as more in class instruction on certain camera and editing techniques. As it is now, students are expected to learn most of these skills outside the classroom.",
    "Where do I even begin? First of all, cannot believe this class is four hours long. Totally unnecessary. Or, maybe it would feel necessary if we actually spent a portion of the class receiving some sort of technical training instead of having to learn everything through an online subscription (why do I go to Yale to learn videography through an online course?). The assignments were well-paced and certainly do-able, but I felt like I received so little feedback from week to week (I also didn't get a single grade or any comments for anything throughout the semester even though we were regularly turning in work). And for some reason points of aesthetic\/technical success and failure rarely came up in critique? Even though many if not most of the people in the class had very little background ever using professional camera\/video equipment, there were so many moments where pushing people's technical abilities or at least raising the expectations a little more could have helped boost the quality of class work."

   "comments": [
    "If you like photography and telling stories, or even video-making this is a very good course to take baby steps into documentary film-making. It is highly demanding in terms of workload, so beware of that!",
    "I think this a good way for someone to start to learn the basics of filmmaking.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with any level of interest in filmmaking and wants to learn the basics of documentary filmmaking.",
    "If you're willing to put in a lot of work and genuinely want to learn about filmmaking (especially the technical aspect), take it.",
    "I would, just for shaping the way in which you think about the world\/have been taught to.",
    "just pick up a camera and editing software trial and learn on your own",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in making documentaries, or even films in general. It is a highly informative introductory course which teaches both the conceptual and technical aspects of filmmaking.",
    "I would recommend this class to a friend but just know that it is work. A lot of student procrastinate doing assignments and this can catch up and end up causing a lot of stress. If you have no actual real interest in film you prob should take a deferent art class, because you might find yourself struggling to be motivated.",
    "I took this class because I am interested in filmmaking and I wanted both a practical skills-based course, and a creative outlet that didn't involve also screenwriting, acting, etc. It was a very direct relationship between what we learned in class and what we created for our projects. I was very pleased.",
    "I would strongly reccomend this course to anyone potentially interested in film. The professor is extremely knowledgeable and provides a ton of expert feedback. The class will really encourage you to challenge your own ideas of the best way to tell a story. It is a lot of fun and you learn a lot, even if the workload can be overwhelming at times.",
    "lol I mean..........if you really must....but there are probably better ways to learn to use a camera and tell a nonfiction story."
