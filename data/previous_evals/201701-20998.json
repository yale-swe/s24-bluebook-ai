   "comments": [
    "Read some good literature I wasn't otherwise exposed to.",
    "I found this course to be a great introduction into Philosophy curriculum at Yale, and its readings and lectures were consistently interesting and engaging.",
    "This course was my first real introduction to philosophy and first and foremost, I learned the skills needed to write a philosophy paper. I also gained more insight into the philosophy of politics and reasons why populism\/authoritarianism are on the rise throughout the world.",
    "Great class this is a stay woke class",
    "I learned how to write a philosophy paper and did some reading of some cool important books\/writers",
    "A greater understanding of the historical and philosophical antecedents of propaganda.",
    "This course allowed me to synthesize and apply knowledge across several disciplines to evaluate and analyze the important relationship between propaganda and democracy.",
    "I developed the ability to think critically about the way propaganda and language functions in our society. I also developed the ability to write a philosophy paper and dissect incredibly long and hard readings.",
    "This course provided me with the best readings I have ever done at Yale",
    "I was just honestly shook by all the stuff I learned in this class. It would be too much to write, but it's just incredible to see how ideology plays so much into our understanding of democracy and our pursuit of it and all the policies we have passed in this country.",
    "From taking this course I was able to gain a better understanding of American history and the development of contemporary political and social conditions through the discussion of propaganda, democracy and ideology.",
    "I learned to think more deeply and in a more philosophical way about what ideology is, and what ties seemingly disparate ideologies together. The connections between Southern race theory and European anti-Semitism were probably the most thought provoking parts of the course.",
    "Taking this course allowed me to analyze current political discourse through a powerful historical and philosophical lens. I can now draw useful parallels and connections between damaging ideologies like colonialism, Nazism, American anti-black racism, and Trumpism over time. I also have a deepened appreciation for the importance of language and the ideology that underlies it.",
    "so many. this class was the class people,come to yale to take. not only did it put into perspective of subtle things that go on in our society but it pushed us to think of the the root of bigger issues that would be out of scope when analyzing the way someone talks about another group of individuals.",
    "This course provided both an education in how to evaluate history as well as insights into how one can evaluate through the lens of philosophy facts which are generally considered to be outside philosophical consideration.",
    "Learning to look at issues of race from a different person",
    "I became much better at philosophical analysis especially of texts that were not necessarily purely philosophical and are often taught in other subjects.",
    "you definitely learn about different historical approaches to propaganda that aren't covered in normal history classes",
    "This course exposed me to concepts such as totalitarian propaganda techniques, and it showed me ways in which institutionalized racism is evident and continues to persist.",
    "This class dramatically changed the way I think about a so many tangible areas of thought, it feels impossible to touch on them all. It provided an analytic framework to talk about all kinds of political issues, and to talk about the way we talk about them! Principally, the course is concerned with the relationship between political values like freedom or equality and language. That may sound broad, but Prof. Stanley made extensive use of historical and contemporary examples that brought his theorylaid out in detail in his book which we were not required to purchase!down to Earth. In fact, I'd say this was, without a doubt, the most practical Philosophy class I have ever taken. (And that's coming from someone whose current summer reading list includes Plato, Hume, and Nozick.) Politics have always been and always will be important. But I think it's fair to say now is a time when everyone should have a clearer understanding of political speech. If I could make this class a requirement for every undergrad at Yale, I would.",
    "So glad I was finally able to read a lot of the material on the syllabus. Came away with a much deeper understanding of how propaganda\/ideology are seen in the Black and Jewish intellectual traditions (and what those traditions have in common). What I learned in this course will always mean so much to me\/be so influential in how I engage with politics, my community, and my career in film and media.",
    "critical analysis of social categories and concepts, philosophical perspectives on ideology and the use of language in the construction of social reality, development of rigorous thinking and argumentation",
    "Loved this course. Made me so much more skeptical of language and history I read."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material is fascinating, and the idea of learning about propaganda in an intellectual setting is quite enticing and feels type naughty. But really the structure of the course is not there to facilitate learning. I read the reviews saying how it was super interesting but highly unorganized and not worth it, and I still took it thinking that it would have improved off of that feedback. I was wrong. I think the class has so so so much potential but the lack of organization was just too much. Professor Stanley clearly is passionate about his work so in that way he is dedicated but the administration of the class seems like an afterthought. The syllabus isn't followed and Professor Stanley will sometimes send out new reading randomly the night before class and then call the class out for not doing it. There were many times when I did what was on the syllabus or read what Stanley had announced in class and then it wasn't used or necessary. I would recommend just getting a reading list and do the reading on your own.",
    "The primary strength and weakness of this course is in its spontaneity. Professor Stanley was able to bend the class toward what we were most interested in learning within the curriculum. At times, though, the course could be a bit disorganized, making it difficult to know when readings had to be done by.",
    "The course was good, but not great. My biggest concern was with how lecture time was spent. We could have covered more material more effectively if the syllabus was more set in stone and lecture more scripted. This course also could have worked as a two hour seminar and been quite effective.",
    "Very disorganized; I felt like I did almost all of my learning from doing the readings and almost none from attending class. I think if Professor Stanley had a better idea of what he was going to talk about each day and made sure to stick with it it would have felt more helpful but it seemed very repetitive",
    "Strengths : - Historical knowledge building - Relation to the current political climate Weaknesses : - Could be quite messy at times",
    "It is notoriously unorganized and the syllabus can be hard to follow, but it is and amazing class with important and interesting readings.",
    "The strengths of this course were the great reading list and the engaging lectures. One weakness and way this course could be improved is to get the second half of the syllabus with due dates further in advance.",
    "The course is good because the material is incredibly interesting and relevant and the format of class (lecture with section) works incredibly well as a way to grapple with the material. There was a lot of reading however, to the point that it was nearly impossible to complete along with my other classwork which made me miss out on some interesting reading.",
    "Perhaps less reading-- all the reading was awesome but some of them were so long that you couldn't get through it all (like reading the entirety of Black Reconstruction)",
    "Strength: The TFs and material of the class. Strength and Weakness at the same time: Disorganization",
    "The strengths of this course come from its interdisciplinary nature and its diverse reading list. It gets us to think about American democracy, propaganda and ideology in an entirely new way. The weakness of this course comes from its total disorganization. There needs to be a complete syllabus posted at the very beginning of the course and if it is edited, then we should be issued a new copy. The first syllabus we got was tremendously confusing: it was unclear exactly what readings were due when, the expectations for the class were also unclear and other basic information about the logistics of the course was unavailable until the very end. For example, how much each essay would count, or when the last essay was due. I think this class would also benefit from slightly more organized lectures. Professor Stanley's manner of teaching can be very engaging at times, and at others completely confusing.",
    "I doubt that most people did all the readings, in part because Professor Stanley's lectures seemed to cover everything we needed to know, but also because there were a lot of them. I wonder about reworking the syllabus so that there's a more manageable amount of reading, all of which is relevant to lecture. The course's greatest strength is Professor Stanley. Just getting to hear him talk for a couple hours a week made the course worth taking.",
    "Prof. Stanley is extremely interesting to hear talk, but also pretty disorganized. Many lectures would challenge me to think about something in a new way or see an interesting connection between two trends. Others felt kind of repetitive. Sections were definitely a highlight, and I really enjoyed the focus they put on rigorous discussions where students responded to each other critically. The paper prompts were very good and fun to write.",
    "Great at describing foreign concepts and ideas. no weaknesses.",
    "The course is extremely well done, and provides relevant and interesting texts. At times, the amount of reading can be heavy, but thorough engagement in this course reaps many rewards!",
    "This class was great to take in light of everything that had happened both on campus and around the country, but the course was heavily influenced by the personal opinions of the professor",
    "no organization whatsoever, please use slides or at least try to follow the syllabus",
    "I really enjoyed the material that this course covers, and I felt that a strength of this course was its ability to either expose me to eye-opening concepts that I couldn't believe I didn't know about, or to confirm within an academic environment things which I had always considered to be truths, but had never encountered in a classroom before. I think that the only potential weakness is that while informative, the lectures did not stick heavily to the syllabus. This class had an element of spontaneity to it, although this is not necessarily a bad thing.",
    "I think the main strength of this course was the material presented. Lectures were, generally speaking, very interesting. At times, Prof. Stanley maybe leaned a little heavily on the reading. (Though that was tremendously helpful on days I hadn't done it.) My main frustration with this course was that we were never provided a full syllabus. Of course, this allowed Prof. Stanley a great deal of flexibility in lecture and in what readings he assigned, but as someone who obsessively plans out his semester on the first week, it was infuriating not to know when my papers would be due.",
    "Would have liked a bit more of a confirmed syllabus - I made the (sort of) mistake of purchasing all the books listed at the beginning of the class, many of which we barely covered (though I'm glad to have these in my possession now).",
    "Lectures could definitely be more structured and planned. It often seemed like Professor Stanley was working off the cuff. That said, the course is for a broad audience. The syllabus is very interesting and draws on a variety of traditions. I thought that the course itself was well-organized, good essay prompts, etc.",
    "Stanley is incredible, the TAs are incredible."

   "comments": [
    "No. The class is so unorganized and unstructured that it makes learning and engaging with it nearly impossible. The lack of organization and specific dedication on the administrative side made me feel unmotivated to dedicate myself to the class. It felt pointless putting time into doing the reading, for example, if I knew professor Stanley was just going to change it last minute anyway.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It being my first experience with a philosophy course at Yale, I found it to be an enjoyable and manageable foray into a new subject. The weekly inclusion of contemporary sources (articles, news media, etc.) was helpful and something I liked and mentioned often when discussing the course with others during the semester.",
    "Yes, while some of the big questions I have still remain (i.e. does propaganda undermine democracy?) the reading list alone makes the course worthwhile. The class is as much of a demonstration of how racism and anti-democratic principles formed as it is a philosophy course on propaganda.",
    "Lots of reading, but all of it good. Jason is a fantastic teacher, and all the material we covered was super interesting and very relevant.",
    "Stanley is a bit disorganized, but always interesting in lecture. The class is only three short essays and reading responses. There is quite a bit of reading, but most of it is important stuff to read, an dit doesn't matter if you read every word of everything.",
    "Yes",
    "It's interesting and entertaining but not the most helpful\/educational class out there. I took it as a second semester senior and the papers were challenging and the readings were great but I felt like the lectures were extremely repetitive and I wasn't totally sure what I was learning. it's a good class to take at the end of your Yale career though.",
    "I would recommend it only if they do not like structured classes and prefer to have a more open dialogue during class.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. You must take a class with Jason Stanley. He is excellent and a fun lecturer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Lectures were engaging and the material is particularly important given our current political climate. As someone interested in the Holocaust, this course was extremely interesting and helpful.",
    "Yes, the course was incredibly interesting and really important to have an understanding of especially given today's political climate. It will really open your eyes to a lot of things you are probably not aware of about history.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I LOVED THIS COURSE I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE",
    "Yes I definitely would. Intellectually, it raises some very interesting questions. And if you have any interest in understanding American politics and society, going back to the Reconstruction to the election of Trump, this class is indispensable.",
    "This course isn't for everyone, but, if you can stand some rambling in lectures and a very unorthodox style of teaching philosophy, you'll learn a lot and be better for it. Professor Stanley is a phenomenal lecturer -- I'm not sure that he has lessons plans , but he's a smart guy who can talk in an interesting way about some of the most important issues facing our system of government.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings expanded my thoughts and gave me a lot to chew over. Prof. Stanley is great as well, and you can learn a lot at office hours. You essentially need to do whatever readings you want to write about, so it's generally a light workload, but the more you do the more you'll get out of the class, obviously. I got a lot out of the class as a Poli Sci major because I think it's a mode of analysis that I haven't gotten in a lot of other classes.",
    "If you are looking to really take common examples of laws and ideologies that are a part of a greater system this class is for you. The great thing about this class was that not only was it enjoyable with a cool professor that understands the privileges he holds and Yalies hold but you also had interesting things to talk about. overall best clas i have taken yet at yale.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Professor Stanley is an amazing lecturer, and the material is incredibly worthwhile no matter what your field of study.",
    "It's a great fifth class to take if you are looking for something that's relevant but basically no work. Just take everything Professor Stanley says with a grain of salt.",
    "I certainly would because it offers very important parallels to today's world and helps understand how many world leaders come into power.",
    "Yes! Prof Stanley and class materials were thoroughly enjoyable interesting and informative.",
    "yes, was interesting and engaging",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! This class was by far one of the best classes I've taken, and I highly enjoyed the material that we were presented with.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It's the most practical Philosophy course you can take.",
    "Definitely great class for any major, with any background. This material is so relevant and so so so important - I could not stress this more. Professor Stanley is also so delightful and funny and intelligent and even though he gets off track sometimes his anecdotes and examples are fantastic and will stick with me forever.",
    "Yes, I would. Lectures are not amazing, primarily because the course is aimed at a broad audience and Professor Stanley tends to improvise. However the syllabus is great. Moreover -- regarding the 'level' of lectures -- students should be mature enough to recognize that they can bring rigor to the texts themselves and engage with the material at the level that is appropriate to them. I'd especially recommend this course to students who have been steeped in a discipline in which they have not yet encountered some of these issues. In my case, this course provided me with a crucial space in which to work through topics that I'd skirted but never really engaged. If the topic of ideology compels you, seriously consider taking this. The two TA's are great. Professor Stanley cares a lot about this material and about the success of his students, and will happily continue the discussion at a higher altitude in office hours or over Email.",
    "This class is more closely aligned with the Philosophy and AFAM listings, so if you go into it expecting a CogSci class, you'll be disappointed. I thought that we would discuss the current political climate in the US more than we actually did, but I did learn a lot about the history of propaganda in America.",
    "YES! TAKE THIS COURSE! ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE."
