   "comments": [
    "It's a good introduction into philosophy. I enjoyed the class. Class was mainly for the professor to discuss various interpretations of the texts and in section we discussed issues we had with the texts with the TA which was helpful. All of the tests are essay tests, so if that's a factor in deciding, take it into account. If you have any interest in philosophy, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes. Take this class, it's sooooo good for becoming a real, complete person.",
    "The only reason I was in this course is because it is required for the philosophy major, and that is the only reason you should be in it, too. The course is a broad survey of \"modern\" philosophy (meaning a period of only about 200 years from Descartes to Kant) with absolutely nothing on ethics or politics. All the course cares about is metaphysics (what actually exists) and epistemology (what we can know). If that's something you're interested in, then this may be a good course for you - Professor DeRose was a fine instructor - but I would recommend Introduction to Ethics or Introduction to Political Philosophy (especially with Pogge) as your first\/second course in philosophy.",
    "I would recommend it, but be prepared for tough, abstract concepts. The reading is considerable, but not more so than other humanities courses.",
    "Only if you need it for the major .",
    "Lecture is pretty good - DeRose is a cool guy who definitely knows what he's talking about and has a knack for explaining things. Readings are nicely selected to give you a good picture of the argument without having to read the entire work.However, the philosophies themselves are extremely frustrating. A lot of them were redundant. I felt like most of them lost me in the beginning because they started out with bad premises that they didn't bother to defend. Eventually I went from frustration to boredom because I stopped caring. I guess that is more of a flaw with the works themselves than with the class though. The philosophers got better as the semester went on, but unfortunately I had checked out long before the end. It makes a certain degree of sense to present them roughly in chronological order, but it sucks to have to wade through the horrible ones before getting to the good ones.Section was ridiculously boring but doesn't technically count as part of the final grade so I didn't go to a lot of them toward the end.Overall, I do not recommend this class. It sounds a lot cooler than it actually is. You don't get to do any substantial philosophizing of your own 0 mostly just regurgitate what you've read.",
    "Reid, Hume, and Kant are great, read the books that are assigned for them and skip the class unless your philosophy major. The other philosophers make unnecessary jumps between epistemology and metaphysics.",
    "Only take this if you have to. It's interesting but gets vague awfully quickly; it can be hard to decipher the issues even if you have a background in philosophy. Professor DeRose is pretty good, but it's just not worth it unless you're very good at metaphysics and epistemology - in which case you'll enjoy it.",
    "Take it if you are interested in philosophy, but be warned that it doesn't cover some of the more interesting issues in moral or political philosophy etc. Mostly epistemology and metaphysics according to eight of the greats. Be prepared to put in the work, too.",
    "Good course to learn the basics of modern philosophy.",
    "Worth taking simply for the knowledge base you will gain and for what you will learn about philosophy. Keith DeRose is pretty funny and also very LOUD so you shouldn't have too much trouble staying awake.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for another student. I thought it was one of the best introductory classes to philosophy a student could take.",
    "I would recommend it credit\/d\/fail or as a way to fulfill a major requirement. It seemed difficult to really dig into the material and engage with it in the lecture context.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in philosophy and plan to keep up with the reading.",
    "It's a good introduction to modern philosophy. It's an epistemology class at its core. Thought the lectures were difficult to follow at sometime, but they're good if you pay rapt attention the entire time. I wouldn't say this is the best philosophy class I've taken."
