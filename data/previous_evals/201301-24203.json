    "This is a great course for beginners or more advanced students who want to brush up on their genetics. This course moves at precisely the correct pace.",
    "Excellent course. very detailed and insightful.",
    "I enjoyed the labs to bring the practical aspect of the course. I also enjoyed all of the examples used in the PowerPoints. However, I think it would have helped a lot to include more molecular epidemiological studies, especially focusing on the methods and design of the studies.",
    "I had previously taken the other molecular epi course offered several years ago, but decided to take this one as well because the syllabus looked a lot different. I think I got a lot out of it, the focus was on emerging research and techniques in the field and I think this will be very helpful in my future research.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was a great introduction to molecular epi, and will be extremely beneficial later on to have had exposure to the various techniques and concepts in genetics.",
    "I enjoyed this course! The range of topics discussed was very interesting and well balanced and I felt that the homework assignments, labs, and final presentations did a good job of tieing the course topics together. I learned alot and found this to be one of the more interesting and useful courses that I've taken at YSPH so far."

    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Dr.Zhu is very responsible, helpful and insightful.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Dr. Zhu did a great job in teaching this course, and i enjoyed his thorough powerpoints. However, I never received a returned assignment from this class. That would have greatly helped.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Dr. Zhu did a great job with this class. I think that its clear that hes really excited about the material and he presented it in a way that was clear for people who may not be very familiar with molecular epi techniques. I liked the laboratory components, because I think it was useful to get some hands on experience. I also thought some of the homeworks were really helpful in illustrating what we discusses in class, for example designing primers.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Dr. Zhu is a wonderful professor; I really enjoyed taking his course!",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0I thought that Dr. Zhu was a great instructor. He was very enthusiastic and approachable and did a good job of explaining the material in lecture and explaining the applicability of the material to current research methods etc."
