    "Having the opportunity to create my own study and go through the experimental process from start to finish was a unique and insightful experience. I've gained skills in numerous levels of the experimental process, from hypothesis formation and literature analysis to statistical comprehension and forming next steps from study conclusions. It was a unique experience indeed.",
    "Invaluable skills on how to run research. Really made me appreciate research (and how valuable having RAs to do the boring work is). Amazing course if you put your heart and soul into it. Knowledge of statistics is not required, but if you don't know anything make sure you have a friend who does and is willing to help - you will have to do some.",

    "Learned (by doing) about the process of designing and conducting a linguistics experiment."

   "comments": [
    "As a course, it was a bit difficult to ensure standardized levels of comprehension for the whole class. Coming in, I felt it to be rather difficult to keep up with the study explanations of other students because I didn't have a good working knowledge of the concepts behind their studies. In the future, it might be better to be more restrictive of which students should take it. Strength-wise, the attention that the professors applied to each student, how they tailored the class subject matter to the needs and questions, was the most rewarding part.",
    "The structure of the course was really helpful for guiding us through our projects. A semester is probably slightly too short to pull this off if you're not ready to really hit the ground running."
