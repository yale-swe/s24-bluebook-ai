    "This class was phenomenal. Definitely my favorite course this semester, and very high on my Best Classes At Yale list. This year, because we had Erich, we would alternate learning the structure of Bardi with the structure of Kayardild, with a few general introductory and concluding lectures. I mean, how cool is it to be studying Bardi and Kayardild?! Claire is absolutely positively brilliant -- ask her anything about linguistics or Australia, and she'll not only answer you, but she'll be able to tell you the most fascinating facts about the topic. She's also extraordinarily enthusiastic and incredibly responsive to feedback, which is great, especially in a class this small. (Erich's also amazing, perhaps even more so, but he is sadly leaving Yale for bigger and better places. :-( ) If this class is offered again, definitely check it out! The more linguistics you know, the better off you'll be, but talk to Claire if you're unsure -- the class in future years might have a very different set of backgrounds.",
    "If you're a linguistics major, take this class. If you aren't, take this class and you'll be one before long. Claire is an authority in this field and knows a HUGE amount about the entire language family. Her love of the subject, as well as her many and entertaining fieldwork stories, is always obvious and contagious. This class was the highlight of my week all semester.",
    "If you think you might be into the material, this is worth your time. The workload is not too bad, and you learn some very interesting things.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in linguistics. It is a great case study and it also provides a sense of linguistic fieldwork.",
    "This class was a thorough introduction to two indigenous Australian languages, and an interesting view into a different world. It might be a little challenging for someone who doesn't have some sort of background in Linguistics, but for a person who does, I recommend it."
