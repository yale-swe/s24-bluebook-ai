    "This course seemed like a big jump from L1, but it was relatively easy to follow. At points, the syllabus moved really fast, and sometimes not fast enough, but that is understandable given it was the first time with this textbook.",
    "I believe the seminar style helped my speaking abilities.",
    "It's very chill and enjoyable and we learn something new every day. I can't think of any complaints, except for maybe a better textbook.",
    "This course is strong in its introduction to the Italian culture. By reading Italian from many different ages and analyzing poetry and music, I have been able to understand Italian in many contexts. While learning the more challenging tenses (subjunctive especially), the class was more fast paced and there might need to be some more review and practice time embedded in the curriculum."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Taking Italian with Julia was a joy. We learned the material in a range of ways, and I thought that class was kept very interesting, which is saying a lot since we met every day.",
    "I would recommend Italian because it is a nice break from heavier course loads while still challenging enough to not be boring.",
    "Yes! Italian is fantastic!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It not only improves skills in speaking and reading Italian, but is a phenomenal introduction to the Italian culture."
