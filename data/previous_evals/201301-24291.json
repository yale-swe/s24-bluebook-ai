    "Yes, I would recommend this class. No other class like it is offered at Yale. It is a must-take for anyone researching quantum information\/computation.",
    "It samples the many of the key concepts of quantum information and computation and even goes further to give us a glimpse of the cutting edge research associated with the subject. It was hard, however to find overarching themes as some topics seemed disjoint. However, if will succeed in stimulating one's excitement in research for the course.",
    "It is a broad survey course that also engages many topics in depth. The format of the final presentations is useful to the student and engaging to other students as well. It is a worthy course for any mildly interested party.",
    "This course teaches basic concepts as well as applications of quantum computation and information, which is a fascinating and important field for the future world with quantum computer. I'll recommend it to others.",
    "Take the course! Especially if your work is in the area of quantum information.",
    "take it"

   "comments": [
    "I truly now have the fundamentals of quantum information science. Should I pursue this direction in my own research, I feel that I am well-prepared to at least understand where to begin.",
    "This course has definitely strengthened my appreciation for the topic of Quantum Computation. However, in some aspects, I am left feeling that there are many unanswered questions, which drives me to continue my research in the subject.",
    "It has provided me with much necessary background that I can use as a basis for discussing the material with labmates to obtain an advanced understanding.",
    "This class is directly related to my experience. A large fraction of the concepts are directly applicable.",
    "After this course, I understand more about principles of quantum computation.",
    "it was a very deep and wide course directly in teh heart of modern research"
