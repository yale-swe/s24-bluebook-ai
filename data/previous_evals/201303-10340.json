   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking this class if you're interested in learning about Buddhism. The class is pretty abstract though. Quintman is a great professor!",
    "This was a fantastic class. It gave me an excellent overview to Buddhist thought and I really enjoyed all the different modes of learning that Professor Quintman put together: lectures, guest lectures, a field trip to the Rubin Museum, analyzing a mural from Tibet for the final project...I loved the readings, and it didn't hurt that the workload was pretty light. Most of all, Professor Quintman is a wonderful teacher who is incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and enthusiastic. You should DEFINITELY take this class if you have any sort of interest in Buddhism, or religion\/the Himalayan region in general!",
    "yes, I found it very enlightening and a relatively low course load",
    "i'd shop it. if you don't think you're going to love it, wouldn't take it. don't go in half hearted",
    "Take it only if you're really interested in religions or east asian religions in general. Know that most of the course focuses solely on Tibetan Buddhism (since Quintman is an expert in that area, after all). The work is pretty easy, though the final project was chaotic.",
    "Take it! Buddhism is fascinating and you'll get a very holistic and comprehensive understanding of Buddhist traditions and of the Buddha himself.",
    "Take this class if you want a really great introduction into what Buddhism is really all about. It won't be a lot of work and for the most part you never need to take notes during class. The projects are innovative and interesting. Take it as a 5th credit and definitely do the readings.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking for a pretty easy class about something you'd never learn about otherwise. This was my first religious studies class, so I wasn't really expecting it to be such an academic approach to the religion, but I got used to the style of analysis and writing.",
    "Yes, if you're at all interested in Buddhism this is a great introductory class. This is one of those classes which would get you thinking at the end of every session. The workload is very manageable, and I really enjoyed the final group project for the class. Prof.Quintman has a lot of knowledge in the subject, has traveled extensively in the Himalayas and he cares for his students and would make sure he clarifies any questions you might have. If you want to know how the fundamentals of Buddhisms relate to the theme in The Matrix then you need to take this class! I assure you it'll get you thinking!",
    "T\/Th lecture, weekly reading response, two major projects, and some film screenings.",
    "My main problem with this course was that there was too much emphasis on technology. We spent a lot of time talking about the various internet programs we'd use to do our projects, and sometimes that cut into time we could've spent actually talking about Buddhism. I also felt like I was still confused about some basic aspects of Buddhism by the end of the course.",
    "A pretty solid introduction to Buddhism. You will learn a lot about the religion\/philosophy\/science. However, while the lectures were always pretty interesting, the group project at the end was very frustrating.",
    "I think that I learned mostly about the Buddha. I don't think that I have a good understanding of the religion as a whole. I also think that the class could have added at least a class discussion on the religion in its current state. I was hoping that we would talk about the repressed Buddhist in Tibet, but we didn't.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. I took this for fun (for a letter grade) which didn't count for any distributional or major requirements, and was so glad I did. The class is so interesting and Professor Quintman is amazing in presenting the material in a very accessible way. The workload is very manageable but at the same time not easy. I felt like this class challenged me in the right ways.",
    "I would not recommend it. Take another class about Buddhism or Buddhist art. The subject is fascinating; there is just no direction here.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was low-stress, but I learned a lot and about a topic I had known almost nothing of before. We had a few really cool guest lectures, along with an interesting field trip, and the projects were varied and mostly fun.",
    "It is an overview of the life of the Buddha and a pretty good class. I would only recommend you take it if you are actually very interested in the life of the Buddha and not looking for a class that is going to teach you a lot about the practices of buddhism.",
    "RLST 125 is a good introduction to Buddhism. The lectures are excellent and the readings are interesting.",
    "This is a wonderful survey class of Buddhism. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "Fine. I didn't learn too much but it's an interesting topic. Prof. Quintman cares a lot.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to those interested in Buddhism. You end up learning so many fascinating things that you didn't know even if you have already read a lot about Buddhism."
