   "comments": [
    "If you get into this class, take it. It's one of those classes that makes you realize, Wow, I go to Yale.This course was incredible. I cannot recommend it highly enough. You'll learn about journalism and the financial system, and take trips to the NYT, WSJ, Bloomberg News, the NYSE and NY Fed. Professor Herman is an incredible professor, and he's so committed to the class.The work is as follows: 4 papers, 2 of which are pretty easy, 1 of which is based on a book, and a final paper on your own topic.",
    "I loved it. A must-take. You write four papers that involve doing some research and interviews, there's a really small presentation during class, and the reading is light, but also pretty optional. There's an amazing list of guest speakers and field trips, and it's pretty awesome to have access to such interesting people as a student. This has been my favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "I would recommend this course. It covers business journalism from all angles including finance, labor, government reports, media hoaxes, the best and the worst stories, etc. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun with the assignments as well.",
    "Yes! This is an amazing class!Professor Herman teaches from experience, which makes his lessons even more valuable. The guests are great too, and having dinner with them afterwards is also a great opportunity. The trips to New York were particularly interesting. The readings and writing assignments were also manageable and aid in our consolidation of the material.",
    "If you like journalism and you like the economy--this is the class for you. There was a good mix of finance and journalism students in the class to offer their perspective on different issues. The assignments are really like nothing you'll ever do for another class, and the reading is very engaging--you'll enjoy doing it.",
    "This has been one of the best classes I have taken at Yale! The class will take you to NYC to visit the New York Stock Exchange, Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, the NYT, PorPublica, and the Fed. Professor Herman is a delight to talk to -- he's also incredibly knowledgeable about Journalism. If you so wish it, you will have access to an incredible array of sources through hin.In terms of difficulty, the class can be as demanding as you make it. You can either go out and write a ten page article, or you can write a two page article. Overall, I highly recommend it for someone interested in journalism!",
    "A great survey of the cross section of the media and finance.",
    "YES take this class if you can get in, it is a no brainer!!!!! The class is so fun. You will love it.",
    "Absolutely. Great class - not the most rigorous ever, but it exposes you to real business and economic journalism with engaging guests, relevant reading, and good in class discussion. To improve the class, I would make it slightly more rigorous (expectation that the reading is completed, etc). Herman is the best - such a nice guy, loves teaching and helping students. Some professors are accomplished but suck at teaching - Herman has a long and distinguished career, is a great teacher, and is genuinely passionate about his students and helping them learn. A real character.Not much work at all, and a great way to learn about something new. If you already know a lot about journalism and finance, you might not learn much new. It's much better to take it if you don't have experience in one of the two areas. Great senior year class.",
    "Yes! Take the course; it is interesting, the speakers that Professor Herman brings in are really great, and the discussions can be interesting. There is a lot of reading and you will not be able to do all of it, but do what you think is most interesting. The workload was fair but Professor Herman is not an easy grader, but is always willing to meet and help his students which is certainly what counts. If you are lucky toget in, take it!",
    "Yes take it! Awesome professor. Awesome field trips and guests. A really cool topic: you'll learn a ton about business, journalism, and the media in general. Professor Herman is so kind and caring and is always available for extra help and advice. A gem of a class."
