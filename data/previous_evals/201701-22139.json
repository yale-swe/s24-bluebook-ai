    "Just how much the study of texts could be",
    "This course taught me a great deal about how the digital humanities can assist in textual analysis and contemporary critique. It also helped me to understand the impact of performance in modern American culture, both constructed and inherent to literature and art.",
    "I developed an awareness of digital humanities as a discipline, and enjoyed exploring the ways this area of study served our understanding of the texts.",
    "Less of a literature class than a \"fun ways to incorporate your personal interests into a project inspired by literature\" class. I'm not sure if I learned a concrete skill set, exactly - there was a lot of experimentation, creativity, and asking various Yale resources for help implementing your idea. Excellent American Lit readings and group discussions though."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course's greatest strengths are its combination with the digital humanities and its emphasis on performance analysis.",
    "This was the first year that thiscourse was taught, so it lacked a lot of structure. The books we read were all great, but they lacked a consistent theme which made class discussions difficult.",
    "Strengths were the syllabus texts, and the very reasonable workload. Weaknesses were the limited themes engaged with (ultimately, all texts were approached almost exclusively from a perspective of race in the United States, which is obviously a crucial theme throughout the American canon but would have been interested to see more such as WGSS-related themes and writers, etc.); the quality of discussion was often quite low, probably because the readings each work were typically too extensive for most people to fully engage with them in advance of the class.",
    "Some of my favorite readings at Yale have been through this class. According to Dimock, \"All American literature is about race,\" and it definitely marks a difference from the actual American Literature class I took, which focused on the literary world as it saw itself, and those internally recognized Greats. Really hard to keep up with the reading though, because there's no accounting for different lengths of each book - one week we're reading ten Emily Dickinson poems, one week we're reading Uncle Tom's Cabin."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, because it's an incredibly interesting course with a great reading list that pushes the boundaries of English",
    "Yes! Take this course if you get in! It's a tremendous seminar that will push the bounds of the typical \"Yale seminar.\"",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. It was not very well organized and seminar discussions seemed to drag on and we're not very engaging.",
    "Performing American Lit was being taught for the first time this year and it seemed like it might have been a good idea, but my experience was of a poorly-conceived use of the \"digital humanities\" and a kind of vague \"cool\" project that really didn't feel like a \"capstone\" in the English major at all but like an unsuccessful admissions-brochure version of what sort of cool interdisciplinary studies can look like.",
    "This was a great class. It was so refreshing to be able to work on creative projects in response to the literature we were reading and it actually made me so much more engaged in the readings. Seeing the texts we read reinterpreted in different mediums really put them in perspective. The assigned work for the semester was also really manageable - one presentation on a text, which can be a traditional presentation or sharing possible creative projects in response to it, a proposal, 3 process blogs for your final creative project, and the project itself (or as much as you can complete) and a reflective essay! I thoroughly enjoyed going through other people's process journals and seeing their final projects come into fruition! The only sad thing was that our mini-festival was quite early so most people hadn't finished their projects and we never got to gather and go through the final versions but finals week is an iffy time to plan that so it was understandable.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in the texts extensively and willing to do the readings. I would probably add the caveat that the discussions can be somewhat labored and slow at times, but perhaps that was just due to the students this year. Prof Dimock is incredibly kind but does have a tendency to lecture throughout discussions a lot, and also to shut down\/negate students ideas in ways that feel counterproductive to stimulating further conversation.",
    "If you have a creative bone in your body when it comes to fun ways to reinterpret a text, definitely take this course. It's like an excuse to use all the best Yale resources for that one pet project (related to class readings) you've always wanted to try."
