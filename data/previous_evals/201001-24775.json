   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Evidence in Humanistic Inquiry to another student. Evidence in Humanistic Inquiry was a great course! Though its focus may sound a little strange (studying the way we interpret, understand, and examine evidence), the way the course comes together in its varying foci is fascinating...the team teaching of Prof. Thompson and Prof. Genoni, providing a political philosopher's and art historian's eye, respectively, was excellent.",
    "This course lacks focus. There is a substantive course in there somewhere, a really great one, about what humanists are really doing, by what standards, and with what kind of results. Norma Thompson and Mia Genoni might even be the professors to teach it, especially prof. Thompson. But this wasn't it. This was a series of disjointed case studies. It felt like each professor was bringing the thing they really wanted to talk about -- for prof. Thompson, political philosophy, and for Prof. genoni, art history -- and trying to fit it vaguely and unsuccessfully into the theme \"evidence\" -- a theme which was consequently left undeveloped by class discussion. we never really got a sense of what we were talking about, let alone went into any kind of depth with it. also, the blog wasn't great, and the midterm assignment is really bad. you have to use four of the sources on the syllabus to talk about evidence, and it ends up pretty stretched.that said, Prof. Thompson is really great. Take a class with her. Buy \"Unreasonable Doubt,\" too. The book is really good, and taught me more about evidence and judgment than the course did. I wish the course had been about what the book was about -- citizenship, judgment, certainty, and taking responsibility for the way we engage with the world. but we actually never mentioned the book in class, which was disappointing.Prof. Genoni is also pretty engaging, and able to explain things clearly and with some vigor. at times condescending, but sometimes that comes with the territory.the symposium they put on was surprisingly good. some really great papers presented. But the symposium probably won't be happening if this course is offered again, which it will likely not be, at least not in this form. if it's still the same course, lookelsewhere.",
    "Yes! Take it - you can't beat the professors and the course material literally shows up in every intellectual endeavor you ever have or ever will undertake.",
    "The course is noble in aim, but it does not end up fulfilling its declared aim of sorting out how we approach the issue of truth in the humanities. It feels more like a collection of vignettes in textual analysis than a course with a real and steady aim. Interesting, worth thinking about, but not a definite must by any means.",
    "I'm not the traditional student this seminar attracts. I didn't take DS, and I often wonder whether the humanities as an enterprise are really worthwhile. With this in mind, let me say: this class has been the best intellectual experience I've taken part in within a classroom at Yale. In addition to understanding what the practice of art historical and architectural criticism actually looks like, I have become stunningly aware of the influence of my own observation processes upon the conclusions I've made, how I use evidence to back up my beliefs and claims, and how one might start to critically examine axiomatic assumptions.The combination of Professors Thompson and Genoni made each class feel exciting and new, but even through team-teaching that often proceeded in parallel, I was constantly amazed by the surprising intersections between each professor's respective intellectual sphere. Looking back, the class feels remarkably coherent. It's hard to say whether it will make an appearance again in this particular incarnation, but I cannot recommend it or any classes by either professor more enthusiastically.",
    "Absolutely take this class- it was the best I have taken yet at yale!!",
    "Definitely recommended for another student. You will be exposed to o very interesting and thought-provoking synthesis of material",
    "I would recommend the course. Sometimes I felt like it lacked a unifying thesis, but we had lots of great discussions anyhow, many of which related to one another in surprising and exciting ways..",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you love long discussions that sometimes wander, and don't mind being in a Humanities seminar where the explicit purpose seems more to sit and talk then to gain footholds in specific material. That said, the reading list is really great. The class blog can be fun if you write your posts early in the week when the class is still fresh in your head. On the whole--this class is a bit wishy-washy at times, but discussions are lively and the reading is very enjoyable. I recommend."
