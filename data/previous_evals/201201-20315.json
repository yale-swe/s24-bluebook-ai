    "I would recommend this course. These are teachers that are interesting, prepared for class and will certainly help you if you have a research idea.",
    "This is a very advanced course in terms of de facto prerequisite. However, it is very difficult to find the same level of well-thought and critical discussion about financial crises in the other course.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "The course goes through the history of financial crises from the Free Banking Era until today, presenting empirical and theoretical papers. It is not very technically demanding, but it is very helpful to give some background and understanding of these crises and what research has been done so far. I think the course is a great start to own research in the area of financial crises and would recommend it.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. The best course I have ever taken.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student, particularly those who are interested in studying the last financial crisis."

    "This course provided me the opportunity to get a jump start on my second year paper. The key area and research question were all derived from the class project. I truly appreciate the experience.",
    "I acquired a lot of knowledge about financial crises and about the papers that have been written in this area. I have a much clearer understanding of the literature now.",
    "This course has helped me develop a new angle on my research making it more relevant to current financial issues. It has definitely helped my dissertation \/ research."
