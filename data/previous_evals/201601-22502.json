    "Absolutely!!! Such a cool class with such a great professor. Absolutely.",
    "Outstanding. Professor Cowles is an ambitious intellectual, who really tried to push his students to think about addiction in myriad ways. This was both heart-warming (empathy was a big part of the syllabus) and challenging. At times I feel like some of the readings were glossed over, and some time might have been wasted doing group exercises. Nevertheless, would recommend it to another student in a heart beat. Strengths: - quality of the instruction - depth, diversity and range of the readings - diversity of the assignments - excellent seminar discussions Weaknesses: - number of students in the class (should really have been 16 or even less) - slightly too many group exercises. - Sunday midnight deadline for short papers",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is fascinating and the papers throughout the course really let you take ownership of the material.",
    "Really enjoyed this class. Professor Cowles is a fantastic discussion leader. He talks enough, but not too much. It was a really interactive seminar, pretty different from the ones I've taken before. Reading load was the lightest for any seminars I've taken, so that was pretty nice. Would recommend.",
    "Take the class if you can get in! A truly amazing class that will provoke thought, change your perception on addiction and mental health, and make you an overall better writer\/student\/thinker. I would recommend this class to any HSHM major or anyone interested in addictions from a medical, scientific, or social angle.",
    "History of Addiction was a seminar with four short response papers, weekly reading responses, and a 10-12 page final paper. Readings were always categorized into a historical document primary source, a scientific review, an insight into the experience of being an addict, and a secondary source commenting on the addiction and its history. It was a particularly large seminar this year, which probably won't happen again in the future. The class was good overall and quite interesting. Professor Cowles is a good seminar leader who adds a lot of insight to discussions. At times this felt very much like a sophomore-level seminar, with a lot of structure, which could feel restrictive at times (likely made more so by the size of the class).",
    "Great seminar. Take it with Cowles!",
    "Take this class!! It's a lot of reading but it's worth it!",
    "I really recommend this class! Truly loved it! Honestly, I can't see much weaknesses, because I think Cowles did an amazing job of moderating the discussions and preparing us every week with the readings. He was extremely organized. He is a very smart young professor and he really knows a lot about the subject of addiction. He was a huge positive element that made this seminar very good.The class itself was well-structured and the readings were all interesting. I learned so much about the history of different addictions and their different cultural, social and historical implications. The readings were all manageable.",
    "Absolutely! This was a great seminar and it was only the first time this course was offered!"
