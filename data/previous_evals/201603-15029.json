   "comments": [
    "This class was one that sifted through vast amounts of information and analyses, and I think everyone probably walked away having taken away different insights and skills. The experience that I believe was common was that we practiced taking a wealth of experience and knowledge and translating that into one creative project, the maker's journals. The readings were fascinating, and I think people who are not AFAM or related majors have a lot to gain from taking a class with such a broad approach to examining our constructed world.",
    "I learned how to explore and portray the academic insights I gained from class readings and discussions through artwork- a skill at which before I would not have said I was particularly adept.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about the history of Whiteness and its constitution in racism, and the cultural, historical, and political tools that keep it in the dominant place in society. Most of this learning took place during the extensive reading, which was diverse and fascinating.",
    "I learned a lot about whiteness at the level of: reading content observations of the classroom discussions\/dynamic how the units of the class were structured the professor herself, through her observations of the class\/responses to comments.",
    "Throughout the class I have learned to look differently and more critically at myself and the history of my own people, gaining a deeper understanding of how white privilege and white supremacy work as they permeate and structure our lives and world, and how I am complicit in perpetuating them. I have also realized I am capable of making art, which is not something I considered within the realm of possibility for me before.",
    "I learned a bunch about whiteness and practiced the skill of turning information into creative work. I appreciated that emphasis.",
    "By intentionally putting the spotlight on Whiteness and White culture, \"Constructions of Whiteness\" allowed students to approach racism from a more fundamental level. It also subverted the traditional invisibility of Whiteness, which contributes to racism in the first place.",
    "This is a very difficult class to evaluate, because there seemed to be a huge split between what students expected out of the class and how the class was taught. I would say I learned more about the difficulties of discussing something as colossal as whiteness, and how its pervasiveness (and ability to be spoken about in infinite ways) leads to a wealth of miscommunication. I did learn more about race theory and various ways of studying whiteness in America, and the syllabus is something I'll surely consult in the future.",
    "As a critical survey of whiteness, the course succeeds simply on the merit of the readings. The readings are an effective entry, if not foundation, for thinking whiteness, in history, in literary, in visual culture. I learned white literacy.",
    "I learned the value in treating whiteness as a topic of study.",
    "I gained systematic language to talk about the constructs of whiteness and more ways of thinking about just how expansive whiteness truly is."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class lacked organization. There were too many people and too many pieces (presentations, papers, journals, hundreds of pages of reading each week, and visitors) for class to run smoothly or ever feel complete at the end of two hours. That said, there are few courses in which I have learned so much about how my peers think (rather than just what they think). Everyone had a different component of the class where they shone most brightly, and I learned a great deal from everyone's presentations and perspectives. I think this class needs to be smaller if it's offered again, and the syllabus needs to be reduced in terms of both reading (a little) and assignment\/in-class activity expectations (a great deal). I think these changes would make for a more engaging class, and it would certainly facilitate more feedback throughout the semester.",
    "A strength of this class was that the readings were very interesting and stimulating- allowing time for class discussion brought new perspectives I wouldn't have otherwise experienced. However, there were too many readings per week, and it was impossible to really and truly read and process even half. It was then frustrating if we did not really discuss the content of the readings in the class. I think there needs to be a more clear correlation between the readings and class time, and\/or less readings in general.",
    "the readings were varied and i learned so much from them, but especially in the first half, i think there were kind of a lot. it made it difficult to discuss--maybe if we had guided our class discussions more? for example, when we started off class with someone's presentation and centered our discussion and incorporations of the readings on one project of a classmate, it worked a little better. i did appreciate the sense that our reading, learning, and creative projects were actually the most important part of our being in class",
    "The major strength of the class was the amazing and thorough syllabus, to which I would recommend committing a lot of time as a student. Otherwise, the class was too big for a seminar at thirty students, and too short to cover enough to make each section feel worthwhile. I would recommend cutting the presentations, or giving concrete instructions for them, to give more time to talk about the reading. Similarly there was little guidance on how to complete the reading responses, which were never returned, and almost no feedback at all on any work turned in. I think the class could be amazing with more organization and focus, such that everyone came in ready to talk for two hours about a central reading or two and connect it to the 6-8 supplementary pieces, and could expand the conversation from there, perhaps bringing in videos or texts or personal experience\/work. The presentations were often much too long at ~30 minutes and only variously informative (my own included). Claudia is amazing and I wanted to hear her opinion on literally everything, which didn't always happen because of time constraints.",
    "A weakness of the class was its size. It should have been half the size it was (~30). Not everyone felt entitled to participate in class discussion. Some people dominated; the professor could have moderated better.",
    "The strengths of this class is that it is a thorough analysis of whiteness, its supremacy and privileges, and there is no class like that at the moment. The readings are great and diverse, and really attempt to analyze whiteness in and of itself, without always comparing to blackness. I also enjoyed the artistic part of the class, and the final project was a great experience. My main critique of the class is that there were too many people. 25+ people in a seminar room was just too much, and actually made it difficult to get the most out of the readings and the discussions. I also thought that most weeks there was too much reading, which sometimes approached 600+ pages. The quantity of different readings and the total page count made it difficult to focus the discussion sometimes and often readings were not discussed at all in class.",
    "Strengths: Prof, topic, some of the readings, chance to talk about current topics, focus on creative output. Weaknesses: Too much reading, we didn't talk about the reading in depth enough, spent a lot of the classes talking about the superficial problems and not getting as deep as I would have liked, too many students admitted (25 is an unwieldly class size, though I appreciate that Prof. Rankine included so many of us). Didn't receive any feedback on my reading responses.",
    "The class needs to be smaller in order to facilitate a more inclusive discussion and allow for equal participation by all in attendance. The reading load was overwhelming considering that the reading material was often not the focus of the discussion. The reading should be slightly reduced and reading quizzes shouldn't be a part of evaluations if weekly reflections are already required.",
    "Strength: the readings are great, the journal project is very rewarding, Professor Rankine is authentic and brilliant Weaknesses: there were too many things to read, and we did not spend as much time as I would have liked on the actual readings.",
    "A tad disorganized, a lot of reading (that was often overlooked and could thus feel unnecessary for class). At the same time, I enjoyed the readings we did: they gave me the language to talk about whiteness in a useful way. The maker's journal\/art project is a cool experience (though don't procrastinate!) and an opportunity to explore whiteness in a way you're excited about.",
    "The strengths of this class felt real but dormant. As I said above, the syllabus and theoretical organization of the class was exceptional, though I believe the reading was always far too long for us to be able to focus on much. That said, I think we would have been able to access these strengths had the actual class time been utilized. The class size, in my opinion, was twice as big as it should have been, and we rarely discussed readings during the two-hour class time. It seemed that Professor Rankine wanted the class to take improvisatory directions, which I think could have worked had the class been much smaller. Because it was giant, though, and attempting to work as a seminar, it often resulted in conversations that were either surface-level or focusing on something outside of the reading. It was frustrating to have so many bright people in one room, so many interesting texts, and such a treasure of a professor and not be able to synthesize them into a functional group. I was also confused by the assignmentsthe weekly reading responses, it seemed, were not read by Professor Rankine or the TAs, and our final \"makers journal\" project, a collage-centric, self-directed, visual dive into a topic of our choice, felt undirected and (in many cases) cursory. Again, I think all these assignments would have been used better had the class had around 12 participants, but the size let much of the responsibility over these individual projects get lost.",
    "The seminar itself is probably the course's biggest weakness. The primary problem was the size of the class. At 28 students, it is difficult to focus discussion or dig deep into the material, which is all the more frustrating when there are 200-400 pages of (dope) reading every week. The size of the class also complicated the Maker's Journals, which would be progress a lot more smoothly if students received more structured feedback over the course of the semester, as well as a more defined goals from the get go for the journal's aims. Generally, the course would benefit from a smaller class size, a stricter timeline for its assignments, and more moderation in the seminar room.",
    "There was a lot of reading but very little discussion about the reading. The course was fairly unstructured with little guidance.",
    "Strengths: brilliant professor, unique opportunity to work with Professor Rankine, classmates genuinely cared; creating the Maker's Journal was a challenging and interesting academic\/artistic experience that added dimension to the course Weaknesses: I think we had an unreasonable amount of reading considering how much we time we spent discussing it in class - not much time. Class time was not organized well, we repeatedly ran into technical difficulties, and there was little accountability for the work we did. Didn't get feedback throughout the semester. The types of students this course attracts were pretty similar. I think the course would have benefited from debates and contrarian ideas. I think the workload worked against itself. With so much material to cover, we didn't go nearly as deep into the texts as we could have. And many texts were left out of class discussion.",
    "The course's flexibility is both its strength and weakness. I appreciate being able to interpret readings however I desired, but also would have appreciated some structure to class discussions so that it maybe felt like a cohesive conversation that \"got somewhere.\""

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class- I learned a lot; however it definitely read as a first time class...hopefully future iterations will be better organized and constructed.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course, especially to White studentsit is essential that we read and digest this material. That being said, it is hard to keep the drive to read everything going when it isn't discussed in class, so check that the organization has been changed in 2017 to give enough time in class for the reading.",
    "If you're interested in whiteness and would've done the readings, the thinking, the making on your own time but need guidance and structure, then take the class. It's bound to be better structured next time around, with a stricter size cap and a better handle on bureaucracy.",
    "I would recommend taking this course, especially if you are a white student like me. Throughout the class I have learned to look differently and more critically at myself and the history of my own people, gaining a deeper understanding of how white privilege and white supremacy work as they permeate and structure our lives and world, and how I am complicit in perpetuating them. The final art project seems daunting at first but was very well guided and in the end a great learning experience that proved fun too.",
    "Yes. Most likely they will decrease the cap (there were 25 students my year which was way too many) and change around the syllabus as this was the first year. There is WAY too much reading, but you soon learn you don't have to do it all. Rankine is a pretty great professor but sometimes doesn't steer conversations back to the topic at hand well enough. Class will depend on who is in your class. Still take it because thinking about whiteness is v important and Rankine is a great guide to the topic.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, 100%",
    "Yes, if you want to learn about white people\/whiteness.",
    "I'm not sure how to answer this. I doubt this class will be taught in the same way again, sincein many people's eyesit didn't work very well. I would recommend it if the class size shrunk and if the reading and projects were more of its focus. I would not recommend it if it stayed the same size.",
    "I would, but only for the student who cares enough about the topic (or Professor Rankine's work) to put in hours of reading. Some weeks had 400-500 pages, and realistically that doesn't get done all of the time. Depending on the student, that can be a stressful week-to-week experience.",
    "Honestly if you are interested in the topic then yes. If not, it's a lot of work for little reward."
