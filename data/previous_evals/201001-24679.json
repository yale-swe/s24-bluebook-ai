   "comments": [
    "It is a course dedicated to studying and understanding the habits in food and diet in the ancient Greco-Roman world. I would recommend it for the great teaching, content, style, and knowledge gained.",
    "Yes definitely. Very fun class.",
    "This is a survey course about the food and diet of Ancient Greece and Rome. You will learn everything from what they ate and why, to how they farmed it and cooked it to how they sacrificed it to the gods. It is very interesting. I highly recommend it.",
    "Very unique class that I would make sure to take before I left Yale!",
    "I would say it is a good introduction to the subject (I would maybe use the term \"survey\"). I would recommend it, if that was what the student was looking for.",
    "CLVS 232 is an interesting class that covers food and diet of ancient Greek\/Roman civilizations. This is a fun course for both those that have and haven't a background in this area of history. The class can be a little repetitive seeming, but this is just because not everyone has the same background and Professor Grimm does a good job of keeping everyone on the same page.",
    "This is an intersting class, not a lot of work at all but can be dry at times",
    "Overall, the course is an interesting look at a topic not usually discussed. However, the course will seem very boring to someone not deeply interested in the topic.",
    "For a course that has been taught so many times, it was surprisingly disorganized. The order in which material was introduced in no way matched the order of the course packet. It was often difficult to know when to read what, as the 'syllabus' included no such information. In general, this course was useful to me only in so much as it gave me the opportunity to do very little work for credit. However, it even has a disadvantage over other such courses because Professor Grimm counts attendance. Between the quality of the class and the compulsion to actually attend, I would recommend that prospective students look elsewhere.",
    "I would definitely recommend to a fellow student it was fun",
    "Food and Diet in Greco-Roman Antiquity is a great class to take if you want to have a class with a title that makes people do a double take after they hear it. You basically learn about the history of food and diet in classical Greece and Rome\u0097which I found to be a lot more interesting than I originally expected it to be. In studying food and diet, you learn a lot about ancient Roman history from a different angle, which is actually quite informative. Be patient, as the class may wear on a little long sometimes (75 min is a long time), but Professor Grimm is a wonderful lecturer and really makes an effort to get to know her students as the semester goes on. Our class was large, compared to previous years, but we still got the opportunity to try quite a variety of reenacted ancient Greek and Roman food, and the midterm and final project were interesting and conducive to learning but not too awful, in terms of work. All in all, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Good summary on a fairly low level of a variety of food related topics. Shows the relation of food to various fields of study than one might not have originally thought to be related."
