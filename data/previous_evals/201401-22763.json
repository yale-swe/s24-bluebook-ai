   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student. I would let them know that the course is challenging, but also extremely rewarding. I feel that I had an opportunity to grow as a person, student, and seminar participant throughout the semester. Few courses provide the chance to develop in all three of these areas. Taking this class was one of the best decisions I have made in my time at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the course. I think there are elements to appeal to students with many different specialities or interests: post-colonialism, gender issues, close readings, etc.",
    "Absolutely. It is a fantastic course, with important canonical readings and historical context. Most importantly, however, it gives a real sense of why it is important to study literature to understand the world. Highly recommended.",
    "We read several of Camus' works, and Professor Kaplan provided the historical context for them (either in class or as secondary readings). We then moved on to read works of other Algerian authors to examine how Camus work has been interpreted since his death. I would recommend the course. An understanding of francophone Algerian literature is essential to anyone studying French literature, and Camus is an important figure in both Algerian literature and French literature in general."

   "comments": [
    "This course significantly deepened my knowledge of the ways in which language, culture, and history intersect to shape national identity in Algeria and Arab society as a whole. It allowed me to draw meaningful connections across the fields of Arab Studies, Gender Studies, Arabic, French Literature, and Religion.",
    "I do not plan to study the 20th century, so I cannot say how this course will help with my research. But, it provided an understanding which will certainly be helpful to anyone hoping to pursue a career in French Literature."
