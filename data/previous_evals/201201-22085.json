   "comments": [
    "YES! It is so interesting and you get to look at a wide range of topics in Israeli culture and life. You read novels, watch movies and TV shows, and just talk about them each week in class. The essays (midterm and final, as well as 2 shorter ones) weren't bad and allowed you to more fully analyze the readings. Shiri is absolutely great and now I want to read more Israeli literature and watch more Israeli movies... take this class!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. You'll absolutely love it. You basically talk about the contemporary Israeli issues. You get to read really good Israeli novels ( in translation of course) and watch really cool Israeli movies\/tv series. You won't love every single novels you have to read. but there are a couple that you will not be able to put down. and you will become really obsessed with every single movie\/tv series that you have to watch. You will be asked to write two short response papers (2-3 pages), a midterm paper (about 8 pages), and a final paper (about 12 pages). The professor can sometime be a bit particular about your writing, but she will look over anything you ask her to look over (your outline, draft).",
    "I would highly recommend this course to someone who does not know much about Israel aside from political history and news headlines. It really broadens your horizons regarding the country and its people. As a person of Middle Eastern descent who only knew the things I knew about Israel in terms of the I-P conflict, this was a welcome and necessary exploration of the other aspects of Israeli life and culture. You'll get to read literature that you would probably never know about. Warning: Prof. Goren loves the non-linear narratives, so be prepared for extreme confusion sometimes. Still, some of these novels are quite fantastic. You also get to watch some TV shows (who knew Israeli television was so good?) and films. And of course, Shiri is wonderful.",
    "If you're at all interested in Israel, I say take the course. The material covered is pretty interesting, the class discussion is good and the professor is great. It's not a great amount of work either (the class works well as a fifth credit).",
    "Really fun class. You read about a book a week which is a lot page-wise but is such fun reading that it feels like a nice break from other classes. Lots of materials ranging from novels to short stories to TV shows to movies.",
    "Its a cool lit class. Books are pretty interesting and Prof goren is great.",
    "Books and movies. You read good books (in translation) and watch some good movies (with subtitles). You learn a lot about Israel's perspective on many issues"
