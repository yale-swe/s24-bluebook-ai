   "comments": [
    "Take this course. Dr. Kaplan is a genius and the concepts of operations research that you learn in this course have wide, wide applications in any field, from medicine and public health, to business, to the environment, the military and intelligence fields, housing---you name it these models can help describe and optimize many kinds of systems out there in the real world.Best if you have some basic probability under your belt as that is the foundation of the course.",
    "Highly recommend, great set of tools for modeling.",
    "I would recommend Policy Modeling. The course covers models and approaches that are useful across a wide range of applications. It helps develop a pretty unique perspective and demonstrates how simple models can be applied to address complex phenomena.",
    "If you take one course at Yale, take this one. It will fundamentally change the way you look at the world.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. However, be prepared to work extremely hard. The math involved is easy, applying the concepts are different story. Have a basic probability class in your arsenal, at least.",
    "It offers some new perspective to see the world.",
    "The course is a modeling class with simple math models. I will recommend this course to another student.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone interested in applying quantitative methods to concrete policy issues",
    "Would recommend to anyone.",
    "The class is an introductory level course designed to teach students how to create simple models for evaluating alternative policies in the public sector, with a focus on applications in public health and housing. Overall, I would recommend the class to an MBA student looking to enter the public sector in a role that sets various public policies. I would not really recommend the class to a PhD student, since the focus is not on theory but rather on applications. The class could still be interesting to a PhD student but probably lacks the theoretical depth that doctoral students may have in other courses."

    "This course was a revelation to me: it opened my eyes to a discipline I didn't know much about before taking this course and showed me a path towards applying these skills to understanding the functioning of health systems, in particular those health programs devoted to the treatment of infectious diseases such as HIV, TB and cancer.I will try to cobble together additional classes to supplement what I learned in this course, but since the untimely demise of the Operations Research PhD program at Yale, it will be difficult to parcel together all that I need at Yale at this point.I want to use the methods of operations research as the core of my dissertation, so this class was essential to me.",
    "Gave me modeling tools that can be applied to a wide array of fields.",
    "The course helped me think about new ways of approaching questions. It also illustrated how simple models can often provide valuable insights, even about complex phenomena. I'm not sure if I will apply the models directly in my research (though I may), but the general approach is certainly transferable.",
    "This course is directly relevant to my profession and my dissertation.",
    "Not much. The class is not directly related to my research but I do enjoy the class content.",
    "I am a maser student in engineering. It give me another perspective of probability theory. Professor Kaplan is very helpful either inside the course or outside of the classroom. I gained knowledge of how I apply probability theory outside of my own field.",
    "Gave me a new way to think about\/approach problems. Inspired me to study some topics that I never even knew about."
