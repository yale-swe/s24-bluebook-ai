    "I think choosing a final \"research study\" topic and writing the final paper project for this class in segments throughout the term in small sections each week rather than the short homework assignments would allow us to apply the material we learn each week more meaningfully to a final study proposal, and would potentially allow for implementation of real studies following professor feedback on each section submission which would allow for a thoroughly thought out and revised project proposal at the end of term. As enjoyable as all the speakers were, I also feel this course is best suited for first-years and students will get more out of the course in their first or second term at YSPH since by 2nd term second year most second years have taken a full class in many of the topics presented on, which include measurement issues as part of Chronic Epi topic courses already.",
    "Outstanding course even for a physician scientist, excellent way to expand your knowledge of measurement issues and outcome assessments from an expert in the field",
    "The course was good but all of the guest speakers made it seem disjointed. Overall, an informative and interesting guest speaker series.",
    "good",
    "I think this course can be arranged into other courses, such as EPI II. The whole concept of this course is not difficult. Repeat the same concept in different research every week seems redundant and unnecessary.",
    "If people have taken epi of cvd, then I don't think this course should be required. I thought a lot of the measurement issues described were obvious and i don think this needs to be an entire course of its own.",
    "The scope of the measurement methods and topics are great. Maybe we can assign priority and spend more time on more applicable topics.",
    "I feel I didn't learn a lot from this class. The material covered in this class are overlapping with other courses at YSPH. Highly doubt why this is a required course for CDE. I could have taken cancer epi or heart disease epi instead if it wasn't required.",
    "This class suffered for a lack of organization and cohesion. Because it is comprised of guest lecturers presenting disparate topics, it was difficult to walk away with sufficient knowledge of any topic in particular. A strength is that students are exposed to a wide variety of topics. It might have been helpful to have an assignment each week, related to the topic being discussed.",
    "I found this class to be very useful in terms of understanding how to properly evaluate a research paper. The only thing I did not care for was the partner\/group final project. My partner did not put any effort in whatsoever for the final presentation and final paper. I ended up having to rewrite my partner's portion of the final paper because she plagiarized and honestly wrote very poorly. My partner also barley contributed to the final powerpoint presentation. I wish the final project was individual because my partner is now getting credit for all of my work."

    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0The instructor is great. Professor Lichtman is able to provide endless real-life applied examples to all sorts of measurement issues in research and is thoughtful in both her delivery of the material, and understanding of other stresses students are facing from other applied projects. However, the course curriculum structure itself could use some re-vamping.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Outstanding teacher, expert in her field, I enjoyed her lecturing very much and also enjoyed the lecture format including guest lecturer with discussions",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Very knowledgeable about her area. Seemed to not care a whole lot about the class but was a bubbly, kind, intelligent professor!",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0nice",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Good professor.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Judith is great. Her lecture is structured and informative.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Always gives amazing feedback! Very down to earth also and immensely knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Professor Lichtman is a wonderful professor who cares deeply about her students and is always willing to help them in any way possible. However, as this course is mostly taught by guest lecturers, students were not able to fully benefit from her knowledge. She returned assignments with helpful feedback quickly."

   "comments": [
    "This course is required, although much material in this course should have been previously covered in topic-courses for any students in the CDE track.",
    "Terrific introduction to the issue of various outcome assessments, bias and critical thinking in designing and interpreting a research studies I am glad I signed up",
    "Guest lecture series of measurement issues in a variety of fields. She is an easy grader and kind professor.",
    "This course needs to be reformed.",
    "Great introduction to CDE research methods. I will recommend it to fellow students.",
    "Great course to more carefully think about measuring in many domains of public health and medicine. Great eye openner!",
    "I will not recommend this class to anyone.",
    "This course provides a broad overview of a range of measurement issues in CDE. It is slightly disorganized, particularly the final assignment. There are no clear instructions, which was difficult. Some of the homework questions are repetitive. While it does expose students to a variety of measurement topics, I cannot really say I walked away with a very solid understanding of any one topic in particular.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who wants a better understanding of how to critically evaluate research papers. There are only about 3 or 4 homework assignments throughout the course of the semester, which entail reading and critiquing published papers. Then there is a final partner\/group class presentation and paper."
