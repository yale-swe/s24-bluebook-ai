    "I wouldn't recommend it if you are worried about getting a good grade. If you want to take an easy class in CENG department this is one of the easier ones, but still pretty challenging.",
    "Condensed. Few problem sets.",
    "It's a good class to take if you're interested in how separation processes work. It's well taught and provides a good base of knowledge.",
    "The class had a light workload: three problem sets (some of which were fairly long, but there were only three of them) and three tests. The material was conceptually easy to learn, and lectures were easy to follow (although sometimes too slow). I would recommend this class.",
    "Obviously, you aren't going to be taking this class unless you have to...so just do it. Professor Van Tassel is really accommodating...just a little spacey. Sometimes he seems in his own world. Just keep emailing him, meeting with him, he really will work with you to make sure you pass. The workload is manageable compared to some of the major's classes...just be prepared for some beast of problem sets sporadically throughout the semester."
