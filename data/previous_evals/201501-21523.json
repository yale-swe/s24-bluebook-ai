    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student, it's amazing. Take it.",
    "You need this class. You do. Hey, stop it. You do.",
    "Take the course it's so enlightening!",
    "This is a necessary course for all undergraduates interested in the Humanities to take. It covers such a diverse range of topics including literatures, visual arts, performing arts, and more. There are so many opportunities to personally meet the artists that you study on the syllabus, which is amazing. Professor Alexander is a wonderful human being and an amazing lecturer who happens to be famous as well, so definitely get to know her.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in having your academic life ROCKED. It will seriously change your life. It will challenge you, it will inspire you and it will give you a new appreciation for art. You'll be exposed to brilliant musicians\/playwrights\/poets\/writers, and you'll become part of an incredible community of students\/artists\/art appreciators. You'll also improve your writing via the blog posts, which are such an enjoyable way to synthesize all of the material in the course.",
    "Sometimes you have a book to read for the week, and other times you have articles to read, but you have weekly blog posts in which you write mini-papers about the material you are covering. I highly recommend this course to all - Professor Alexander puts African American Contemporary Art at the center of our studies, where it should be, and encourages us to engage with it and wonder about its meaning and endurance. Take any course with her! Guest visits were such a treat - unbelievable experiences with talented, passionate, and hardworking people - doing work that matters, that you get to ask about - work that does work.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN. Professor Alexander is a luminous presence. She is sharp, brilliantly intellectual, engaging, and warm. She takes you through contemporary Black art, a subject she knows personally and intimately, and shows you why the project is urgent and life-giving. She also is also in incredibly open and a mentor. This class was LIFE CHANGING. I now consider the rest of my life an extension of this class. TAKE IT.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale by far. Everyone needs to take this class. Professor Alexander is amazing.",
    "Amazing course, will teach you as much about the past as the current and the future.",
    "This class not only teaches you so much about contemporary art being created by black artists, but it explores the socio-political meanings behind the art. Would highly recommend it, not just because you learn so much about art that you probably wouldn't learn elsewhere in a regular Yale course, but because everyone should take a class with Professor Alexander.",
    "Great Class. Should take. Make sure you get a good TA though.",
    "Great class, but you should do the readings if you truly want to gain from the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. I came out of this class being a better writer, thinker and much more knowledgeable about the field.",
    "AFAM 194 is a comprehensive survey of contemporary African American arts and artists. We covered mediums from jazz to hip-hop to photography to theater to painting to dance. I highly recommend it to any student who wants to become connected to an under-studied art world that exists today rather than one that exists in some well studied far off historical period.",
    "An amazing class, you should definitely consider taking it. The workload is manageable too",
    "Great course for ANYONE - whether they are well versed in AfAm art or not. Can introduce you to the greats & allow you to further understanding the meaning of black art. Would highly recommend. Professor is incredible. Amazing setting for interacting w\/ peers in a way that is not always encouraged by other courses. Walk away feeling like you've learned a lot & enjoyed it all.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! The material and readings are so relevant and understudied. Professor Alexander is so brilliant and poetic, her lectures wove information and themes together beautifully.",
    "If you are a human being with emotions, take this class. It will absolutely rock your world.",
    "Absolutely amazing--I would recommend this course to anyone! Every class you are given a new and enrapturing experience listening to the incredible analysis and important words that Professor Alexander shares with her students everyday."
