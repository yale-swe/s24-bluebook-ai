    "Definitely take it if you're interested about design and computers!",
    "History and writing class about technology and GUI. Absolutely.",
    "It's a fun class. It's really niche though - if you like the professor, then you'll like the class. I found Gelernter to be incredibly interesting and amusing. He has an interesting sense of humor, that he doesn't hold back. He's very bold, and likes being very thorough when discussing things. Come on the first day, and if you like it, stay, and if you don't, it won't change. Not a lot of work, but you really need to give your all to the few assignments that there are. The material is very interesting, but it doesn't feel like a lot gets covered compared to some other classes, mostly because there are very few outside readings, and so the class material is entirely from lecture, and no discussion sections.",
    "Yes take it! I learned a lot on the GUI through the class. You'll learn about the evolution of some of the most important aspects of modern computing by doing a manageable amount of work! Plus, Prof. Gelernter is great and wants to make sure that you improve as a writer. You'll learn to be brief and to the point in your writing!",
    "I found this a worthwhile and rewarding class, with intriguing material, though we spent less time on actual GUI's than I had hoped. The class proceeded very slowly throughout January and February, and seemed to be more of a pure design class (as we spent many weeks on architecture, chairs, famous designers and 60's design influence--without explicitly tying all this to GUI's). I personally enjoyed this, though it was not what I signed up for when initially selecting the class. Gelernter is a good editor, though at times idiosyncratic. He's tough on grammar in a fair and helpful way, but oddly particular about certain words and phrases. Pay attention to his writing review sheets and you'll become a better writer.",
    "If you're looking for a design course, this might not be the best one for you. If you're looking for a design theory and history course, this was definitely interesting",
    "I fully recommend this course because it allowed me to develop a writing style that has greatly improved the way I think and communicate. If you allow Prof. Gelernter to influence you, personal development will be immediate and lasting.",
    "Take the class. Learn how to write well before taking this class."
