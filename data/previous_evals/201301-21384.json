    "I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in ethnographic research and have the time to do it during the schoolyear.",

    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to my colleagues. I would summarize the course in this way: In this course you'll learn both the theory, ethics and practice of conducting rigorous field research, particularly interviews and doing participant observation. You will do so with one of the best qualitative researchers in political science today, Prof. Wood, who also happens to be a wonderful teacher. Be prepared to work a lot, though!",

    "This is a key course for me as I gain the skills to conduct my own qualitative field research for my dissertation and other projects.",
