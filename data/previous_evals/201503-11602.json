    "If you are serious about making a film while you're in college, then this is the way to do it. It gives you structure, faculty and peer support, as well as class credit. If you're not super committed to doing the hard work of writing, directing, and partially producing your own film, then it's not your class.",
    "Take it. Make a thesis film. You will have it forever.",
    "Definitely take it. You won't get another opportunity like this! The first semester is the writing and creative process which is so much fun - you get to talk through your ideas and hear other people's ideas which is really inspiring."
