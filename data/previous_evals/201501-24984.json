    "Light workload, neat concept. Many classes at Yale are such that you get out what you put in, but I really don't think this is one of them -- it's a pretty low payoff regardless. I don't think I'd recommend this to someone for any reason other than its ease.",
    "I wouldn't take this class. It's more of a lecture than a seminar. Professor Tomlinson always shows up a few minutes late. The readings sound really cool, but I found them to be boring and dry. If you're considering taking this class, definitely take a look at the readings to see if you like them.",
    "Highly recommended. Super smart professor will guide you through reading some of the most important science texts you can read. I learned a lot. Class was a little more humanities-ish than I'm used to, which was a challenge, but it was a good time. Writing assignments are not long but can be tricky to think about. I enjoyed this class more than I thought I would."
