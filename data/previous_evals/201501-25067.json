    "Strengths: the use of flexible assignments that we could tailor to fit our specific interests within the realm of public health and our departments. The focus on current and relevant public health issues within each week's topic. Weakness: because of the amount of material, the class might be more effective with two sections per week.",
    "I think that the class assumes a basic understanding of anatomy. Many students in the class do not have that foundation and therefore, I think there should be an intro lesson or a reading to get students prepared for the class. I found myself often on Khan Academy or other sites trying to better understand some of the class concepts because during lecture it was difficult to take notes and fully absorb what each system did. I really did enjoy the weekly write-ups, they gave students the opportunity to explore their own interests. The discussions we had were also interesting, it let us see what our fellow students were interested in and gave a different perspectives.",
    "This was a great course to have a general overview of physiology from a public health perspective, while still allowing students to focus on their own specific interests. The evaluations were very fair, and did not make us memorize small details. Instead, we were challenged to apply concepts learned.",
    "Excellent course. I would not change anything about the way Dr. Yeckel teaches it. Provided a basic foundation in physiology with detailed applications to real public health issues.",
    "I waived this class.",
    "Liked the flexibility to write about topics of interest each week",
    "This is a fantastic course, and Dr. Yeckel tries to accommodate the interests of all students in the class. It's also nice that the class isn't just a lecture, but there is always a discussion portion as well. The exams and assignments are very fair.",

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very lovely and sensitive to students' needs. Genuinely interested in improving students' understanding of the material.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is an incredibly dedicated professor, who is always helpful to her students. Her knowledge and interest in this subject is projected in each class, and allows us to become engaged on important public health issues, and how they tie to each physiological system. Also, her creative use of assignments reflects her interest in her students, as she provides us with the opportunity of integrating our own passions with the information we learn, motivating us to truly think and apply our knowledge to real-world scenarios.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0I really appreciated Cathy's feedback on our weekly write ups. I also appreciated her responsiveness to questions about the midterm and other assignments.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Fantastic! Probably one of the most hands-on professors I have had. Takes the time to individually respond and comment on our weekly write-ups.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is a highly engaging lecturer with a knack for making interesting and relevant connections between class content and the bigger public health picture. I loved the format of doing an independent write-up every week on topics in our areas of interest-- it added a great deal of breadth to the class and really encouraged students to take initiative in their own learning-- along with detailed, constructive feedback from Dr. Yeckel, who took a real interest in every student's specific interests and even made reference to them during lectures to support lecture content. And on top of that, there was clearly a spectrum of backgrounds in physiology among different students in the class, and Dr. Yeckel found ways to make the course enriching for each student-- or at least, I believe I can speak for every student saying that-- I know it was true for me. Absolutely excellent course with a clearly devoted instructor.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0I waived this class.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Fantastic instructor! change nothing",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very enthusiastic and is very encouraging. But sometimes difficult to follow tangents in class and slides are a little hard to follow at times, especially when there are pictures or diagrams without any captions or supporting remarks. Overall great instructor and loved lectures, however.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is one of the best professors at YSPH. She is incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about the subject she teaches and tries her best to make the course interesting for students in every discipline. She is also very approachable and helpful when it comes to any issues you may be having, not only just in her course.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0informative, conscientious, sensitive to students"

   "comments": [
    "The course is better suited for students with some physiology background, even if minor.",
    "The physiology for public health course is a great alternative for students who are interested in a physiology course, but also hope to keep within a public health curriculum. Although the course is intensive in terms of the amount of material covered, Dr. Yeckel presents assignments that allow each student to be challenged on his\/her specific interests, making the topics relevant to students in any department.",
    "Great course.",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Regardless of your background in physiology, this course will help you to gain a foundation or further the knowledge you already have, and give you structure to develop your particular interests in public health.",
    "I waived this class.",
    "i would recommend for people with an interest in physiology and some background knowledge of the human body",
    "Good practical overview of physiological systems. Really appreciated the public health connection for each system.",
