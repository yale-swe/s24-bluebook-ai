   "comments": [
    "A fun and fascinating introduction to museum studies, with a flexible approach that allows you to research more in your own area.",
    "Take the course.",
    "I would summarize the class by saying that it was a series of lectures given by people active and important in museum life around campus. I would definitely recommend the class to someone because it was really great this semester when it was first being taught and I am sure it will get even more fun.",
    "The class provides a great introduction to what museums are all about and really provides hands on access to many of the resources available on campus. The projects were fun and really enhanced the experience of learning about museums. Also, the class was effective on providing a general survey of the many different types of museums and how they differ in their policies and display strategies.",
    "An inside-look into Yale's museums and collections, and the various discussions taking place inside them about how to collect, exhibit, and maintain them for the Yale community and beyond. I would recommend it, on the hope that its later iterations have tweaked things here and there.",
    "Museums and Their Objects was a fascinating look at Yale's museum facilities, as well as the museum world at large. I particularly enjoyed how each class looked at a different aspect of the museum world by touring Yale facilities and hearing from guest lecturers. I certainly have a deeper appreciation for Yale's museum facilities, and all the work it takes to put on a successful museum exhibition."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided insight into what happened to archaeological objects once they are out of the ground and what is considered art and cultural property. The class contributed to my own personal interested and was not related to any research project.",
    "As an undergraduate, I probably approached the class with a slightly different perspective than many of the other students. I did not, however, feel unequipped to appreciate the class.I have become increasingly interested in museum work, and this class offered an invaluable survey of the museum world. I left each class intrigued and excited to learn more about museums in the future."
