   "comments": [
    "History 229 is a fun, solid history class. The lectures provide a strong overview of all aspects of the period.",
    "This is a really good history class. You learn a lot, the lectures are great, and the readings are not too long and generally interesting. There are two papers, neither of them research-heavy, a midterm and a final. Professor Semmel is really good, and it's a small class so there is a mixture of lectures and discussion. Take it if you have any interest in the political, cultural, and intellectual history of 19th century Britain.",
    "History 229 actually covers the \"long\" 19th century--from 1780 (a strange start date, the anti-Catholic Gordon riots) to World War I. It's about social, political, and cultural history in that order--so you learn about the most important prime ministers but not the whole sequence, and you learn about cultural figures only when they're also politically important (Dickens, Ruskin, etc).",
    "It's a really good survey of the political and social development of the long nineteenth century. Professor Semmel uses a lot of political cartoons to illustrate points and personalities.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It is a wonderful survey course with an interesting and engaged professor. There's no section, and although the amount of reading may seem intimidating, you can put it off until the mid-term and final. The structure of the class is that you have two papers- both of which are actually fun to write- a midterm, and a final. The lectures are easy to follow and help explain many things about contemporary society. Given that I was generally clueless on most things nineteenth-century British, I found this class very interesting. I would definitely recommend shopping this class at the very least.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Its an interesting time period, and the class covers the political developments as well as social and intellectual history. Professor Semmel's lectures are great. The assignments are interesting, but not extremely difficult. I was surprised at the small enrollment, but I won't complain, because it meant we had discussion in class. Over all, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale."
