    "I would recommend the class to another student interested in law and classics. Having a background on ancient history would definitely not hurt",
    "I would definitely recommend Ancient Law to another student. The material was interesting, and both professors did a great job engaging the class in discussion. My only complaint is that the syllabus could have been better-adhered to.",
    "I would recommend this course to students with a previous interest in ancient history, historical sociology, or political philosophy. I would also suggest that students be comfortable with modes of primary source historical inquiry. The seminar attracted a nice mix of students with backgrounds in all of these and more (and in YLS, of course), which usually made for an engaging discussion. The professors were both impressive intellectually, and (except for a few instances where they ran out of questions) led the discussion in interesting directions. They also worked quite well together as a pair. 9AM start time could be rough, but you know that...Workload is moderate reading + a free-form one-page response every week. I had it count as an approved exception towards my political science major (political philosophy distribution). Don't be intimidated by the law and graduate students!",
    "A fantastic class if you enjoy sociological study. The class was highly theoretical, but still managed to keep a practical focus. Theory and scholastic writing trumped direct analysis of translated primary sources, but that is probably unavoidable in a class half-filled with law students."
