    "I would say this is a unique history course that examines an overlooked topic. It combines elements of medical history, social movement history, and even human rights. Strongly recommend.",
    "This course is a good research seminar that introduces us to the experience of searching for materials in the Yale Library Archives. It also gave an interesting overview of issues in global health activism but this was secondary to the research component. I would recommend it for students who are interested in doing research in the field, not those who are looking for an introduction into the topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for all of the strengths I've listed above."

    "This topic has direct implications for my future research and could very well appear in my dissertation (in some for or other). The research aspect of the course has allowed me to identify the sources that are close to Yale that will be useful for my dissertation topic. However, beyond content, the course has reinforced and honed my research skills, e.g. how to digest a lot of material to determine if it is useful for a project, navigating archives, etc."
