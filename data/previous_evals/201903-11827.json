    "My speaking and writing abilities greatly improved. I feel much more comfortable using advanced grammatical structures.",

For example, I think I improved my use of por vs para and preterite vs imperfect. I am also much more comfortable using the subjunctive in conversation. In addition, I feel much more confident in my conjugation abilities for all the tenses.",

   "comments": [
    "A lot of the homework felt like busy work. We had to read a whole novel, but we only needed it for one short answer question on an examen. Prof. Santos is a great teacher and cares a lot for her students.",
    "A strength is the emphasis on grammar. I really think some difficult grammar topics were covered well and really helped me improve my sentence structure when writing and speaking. A weakness is the lack of vocabulary. Even though I was really improving my grammar, it was hard to show it without a translation helper because I never truly processed any new vocabulary.",
    "Too many assessments but it did a good job in reinforcing grammar skills. I think more opportunities to practice my speaking skills would have been helpful. Also, the readings were really long and difficult, making them hard to get through and I feel like I got little out of them except for the pressure to understand them and memorize things."
