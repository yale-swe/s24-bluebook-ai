    "This course helped me in particular with reviewing grammar rules and building off of the skills I already had in this area.",

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A major strength of this course is that it is designed for simultaneously reviewing grammar concepts students may have already learned while building up vocabulary and more complex structures. There are plenty of short writing assignments and exercises as well. The one major weakness of the course is that there are not very many opportunities to practice oral communication. The course could be improved by making it meet twice per week for longer hours.",
    "I felt the range of media and topics was good, and the grammar useful and manageable. I would benefit from slightly more grammar and vocabulary but in general I can't think of any obvious weaknesses."

    "Yes, this course was helpful to learning Russian, had a good amount of work, but not too much, generally, and was well taught."
