   "comments": [
    "Strengths - caliber and diversity of project offerings. Some really cool opportunities to engage with dynamic environmental consulting scenarios and a real client. Weaknesses - poor instruction: a couple of interesting guest lectures, but the initial series of lectures on consulting felt like a waste of time. Additionally, while simplicity is certainly an asset, the rigidity around trying to dumb things down to the easy-read format missed the heart of the objective, instead becoming silly busywork.",
    "Cant think of any",
    "S: real-life project; exposure to real client W: Goal changed a lot during the semester",
    "Strength: Overall the class is great. I get hands-on experience with a famous company, good for career development, clear feedback from instructor and teammates Weakness: perhaps the instructor can be a bit less \"hands-off\" during the semester by somehow checking in with the client to make sure that the project is on the right track. Sometimes it is hard for students to get direct\/clear feedback from clients despite the weekly Skype meetings. Also it can be difficult for students to express some ideas directly to clients (say, too much work for a semester, too many changes of research topics, etc.). Instructor can be the ideal liasion.",
    "Strengths: nice client selection with clear expectations. The course's timeline and expectations were super clear and consistent from the beginning. Weaknesses: I think the course would have been stronger if it had been more centered on the project rather than lectures and guest speakers. I absolutely appreciated the opportunity to hear from guest speakers and learn from Maureen's expertise, but I joined the course to work on the project. I think the lectures and guest speakers should be optional - perhaps students should have to attend 5 over the course of the semester, and they can choose the 5 that are most relevant to their project and their professional interests.",
    "The instructor is incredibly poor in providing reasonable feedback, listening to critique, and providing the tools necessary to succeed.",
    "Strengths: Working with a real-world client to develop a useful deliverable is both enriching and rewarding. Engaging guest visits with industry experts were fun and informative. Weaknesses: In-class lectures about consulting were not helpful.",
    "The feedback from Maureen was sometimes conflicting with what the client wanted. Also the editing she provided did not conform to modern standards. It would have been better to have in-line citations, etc.",
    "I enjoyed most of the guest lectures. It would be helpful if we could discuss more as a class at the beginning of the semester strategies for working with the client to get more specific about their goals and expectations (and aligning those with the goals of the Yale team).",
    "Course format should be updated - needs more practical training lessons in communications, data visualization, slide deck creation, etc.",
    "a great course the way it is"
