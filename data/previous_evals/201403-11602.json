   "comments": [
    "slides were set up well but there were lots of errors on lecture slides professor seemed unsure of herself when answering questions and had little sympathy",
    "Important subject matter, but the teaching quality was not great (especially because the professor was difficult to understand) and the workload was immense and stress-inducing every week. The exams felt totally overwhelming. I feel like I would have learned a lot of the relevant concepts just by reading the book (which was good and helpful) and going over the codes\/output.",
    "This is is very good cause it teaches a lot of knowledge about how to make regression analysis and inference and also how to diagnosis and remedy the model. It is a littlt bit demnding but it is indeed help me a lot.",
    "The materials in the course were very useful and insightful. But the organization of the course was of poor quality.",
    "The textbook is great. It is clear to understand and has helpful examples. But this does not mean that the content of the lectures can suffer. I certainly learned a lot from reading the textbook, but taking this course was incredibly frustrating. One suggestion that I have for the content of the course is to have one lecture dedicated to going over the big picture of what we have learned in class. Lectures are divided into individual topics, but they are never really put together into one clear picture (aside from a short set of slides on the last day which were breezed through).",
    "This course is the worst one for this semester. First, too much unnecessary homework. Most of homework problems don't request thinking. Just using software with the code provided by TA is sufficient. No improvement in understanding is made after completing homework. Second, the instructor only provided limited details for knowledge relating each chapter. Her lectures and notes don't serve the purpose of teaching, and they should be used for review sessions. My experience is that I cannot find relevant explanation for theoritical questions. Only simple facts and conclusion are represented during the lecture. Third, unresaonable exam questions leads to an increase in workload. The exam is totally departed from our homework. Two exams accounts for half of the final grade. And a final project is required. Students also need to spend much more time after classes to learn by themselves from the textbook, since the instructor regards a topic mentioned during lectures, as covered, and will examine whether you could calculate the result by hand or derive some formula. Thus, students are uncertain what need to be mastered by details and which equations only need to be familar with.",
    "The final exam was unreasonable for the time limit. Not enough background information was provided with the final project assignment. Also instructions on the final project were vague. The homework assignments were reasonable and helpful.",
    "The course material is not difficult and is practice oriented. The course teaches fundamental concepts of regression and software usage. However, this course is not well organized although there is textbook. It doesn't teach theory and barely practice. The class was dismissed early in most of the case and the professor lets TA teach the most useful materials.",
    "The course is helpful but there are too many points in this course and the instructor did not give a good summary or sketch to make them clear and logical.",
    "very heavy workload very hard exams",
    "Useful course. Great TAs. Poor teacher.",
    "There are a large amount of things we need to learn in this course, so i think only two hours each week for the lecture are not enough, because it is hard for us to master what is taught in one whole chapter within only two hours' lecture.",
    "Strengths: The class covers the basics of linear regression, and the homework assignments do keep us up to date with the coursework Weakness: Tests do not reflect the exercises from homework and lectures.",
    "Introduced a lot of useful linear regression technologies.",
    "strengths: - a very useful course; covers all the important concepts related to applied regression for public health",
    "Strengths: potential use and application Weakness: introduction of theory and actual application",
    "This course was extremely frustrating. The instructor was not engaging; her delivery was dry, resulting in lectures that students did not gain much from. The weekly slide sets were disorganized and contained many typos that the instructor failed to catch and\/or correct. The homework assignments failed to prepare us for the types of questions we were expected to solve during the exams; they felt more like busy work than anything else. My saving grace was that the textbook (Applied Statistical Models by Michael Kutner) was absolutely phenomenal. You can master regression solely by reading the book--this class was pretty much worthless.",
    "There are a lot of improvements that need to be made to this course. Although the material is very important to understand, you will essentially be teaching yourself. The slides the professor gave us were riddled with mistakes, so you could never trust that what was on them was actually correct. In addition, the midterm and final exam were both unfair. Although the final was at least open book, the midterm was not. It seems ridiculous to have to spend time memorizing formulas when you should be concentrating on how they are applied. There was also not an adequate amount of time allowed to take either of the exams, or to complete the final project, which was given to us right after the final exam. Fair warning, do not take this course if you do not know how to use SAS. It is necessary in order to complete the weekly homework assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Instructor is intelligent and nice, but difficult to understand and not very engaging in class. Focused examples including codes\/output would be helpful so that I can keep track of what I am learning or supposed to be learning. The workload was immense and stress-inducing every week. The exams felt totally overwhelming. I feel like I would have learned a lot of the relevant concepts just by reading the book (which was good and helpful) and going over the codes\/output. If there was a way to reduce or better distribute the workload for this class across the semester, it might be more useful because otherwise students are just struggling to keep their heads above water and don't have time to use their brains.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The instructor is very responsible and are willing to share their experience with us, she transfers explicity the knowledge from the textbook.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The professor seemed to have trouble explaining key concepts regarding important topics for the course. Slides too often contained too many typos and mistakes, making it really hard for students to follow the lecture. The instructor did not sensitive to the students' background and rarely attended to students' need. The structure of most lectures was poorly organized and materials presented in the slides were of poor structures and organizations. The lectures went way too fast that most of the students had to spend a huge amount of time after class in order to do homework. I wished she could slow down during lectures and be more clear especially about key concepts",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0I think that Professor Zhou has an interest in getting to know students, which is not the case in all classes. And I have no doubt that this course and topic are hard to teach. However, I think that the structure could be heavily improved on to benefit students more. Possibly one of the most frustrating things is the number of typos in the lecture slides. If slides are not posted prior to lecture, it should not be because the instructor is expecting to come across typos and thus wants to fix them after class. PLEASE just review the slides beforehand. Furthermore, typos shouldn't exist after lectures are re-uploaded! Even after the lecture, I still find typos, which makes the content terribly confusing. While the midterm was a fair assessment of our knowledge, the final felt like a slap in the face because of the time constraints. I don't know if anyone actually had enough time to put thought into answers on the final. If people are frantically scribbling at the end of the exam, perhaps you should give people an extra 10 minutes to fairly prove their understanding of the material. Let us prove what we have learned by giving us a fair amount of time on the exam. I found the homework assignments to be helpful in understanding the content of the course. But PLEASE give us more than four days (two of which are the weekend) to complete the final project, which is a major assignment. Giving us this short of a turnaround period doesn't respect other responsibilities that we have, like jobs and other courses.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Poor speaking skills Too many mistakes made during lectures: still remember in the first lecture, the instructor made a very misleading mistake: linear models should be linear in parameters!!",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Instructor did not make it clear in the course and had a lot of errors in slides.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Expectations for the final exam and final project were somewhat unreasonable. Often lectures move too quickly and are difficult to understand. The powerpoint slides often contain errors, making it difficult to study them.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Expression ability of the instructor is not very strong.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0the worst instructor i met ever, she is trying very hard to hard students! Completely don't understand what she was talking about in the class! Suggestion: change the instructor",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Please explain the questions more clearly. For example, to derive the formula in the text book.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Strengths: Powerpoint slides are well written out Weakness: Some difficulty with explanations",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0informative, hardworking",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Dr. Zhou is a good professor although she can be rather strict sometimes. Her lecture slides for the most part were useful. However, occasionally they contained errors and she would upload the correct version after class.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Knowledgeable. Genuinely tries to be consistent and definitely puts in effort although not always comfortable; Methods do not always translate; style does not always connect; not always engaging.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Weaknesses: dry lectures, disorganized slide sets, she often confused herself while explaining the concepts to us.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Although I think Dr. Zhou did try very hard to get us to understand the material, she was often not able to adequately answer our questions, even when posed multiple times. The most frustrating aspect of her lectures was the fact that she would have multiple mistakes in her slides (which she did not often correct) and would only catch them when she was in the middle of the lecture, which would lead her to then stop and look things up in the textbook. Her lectures are also very hard to follow, and as result, you end up teaching yourself the material."

    "Unless there is a big overhaul of this course, if you don't have to take this, don't. It is a better use of your time and money to just buy the textbook and learn linear regression on your own. I am really surprised that after dismal reviews in previous years that this course is still of this quality. We spend thousands of dollars on tuition in this program, and we deserve to have high quality courses. This is such an important topic, and it deserves to be taught in a thoughtful manner.",

    "terrible class, don't take it unless you have only two class in the semester",
    "I would recommend it to another student since, no matter how the lecture sucks (assume) or how much homework there is, it is a basic course for future data analysis, which is very worthwhile to take. Yet this course is bound with a large amount of homework and also tests, which is designed for further real data analysis, and you must spend much time after school on it if you want to have a good understanding of it.",
    "I would say that this course is a lot of work, but you still learn a lot. I would recommend it to another student who really want to learn about biostatistics, but hard work is needed.",
    "I would recommend it. This course provides very useful information for future work.",
    "Extremely useful class. Make sure you've taken Biostatistics 505 A\/B or an equivalent course otherwise it might be difficult to keep up with the material.",
    "Above average workload with subpar instruction and inconsistent resource. Not to be taken without some exposure to biostatistics and\/or statistical software packages like R or SAS. The payoff is there but the intensity and inconsistency can make for a very challenging experience. If not required, it should be avoided for reasons aforementioned.",
    "Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. You can learn the material by reading the assigned textbook (Applied Statistical Models by Michael Kutner).",
    "The material is very important to understand, but I would not recommend this course to another student."
