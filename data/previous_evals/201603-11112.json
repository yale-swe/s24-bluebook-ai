    "The course was very straightforward in how it was taught. That being said lectures did get a bit dry at times, but its not a big problem if you are engaged and interested in the material.",
    "Strengths: Professor Mimi is very understanding of our situations. She was always generous with deadline extensions, and she was willing to meet with you if you have any questions. You can also tell that she's very well-versed in and passionate about Japanese artworks. Weaknesses: None"

   "comments": [
    "Would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in art history or older Japanese culture. Lectures were engaging and Mimi is one of the best professors I've had here at Yale. It was fun to see her so clearly passionate about such an interesting and niche field. She was also always more than happy to respond to email questions and even mentioned grading the first exam with a gentle rubric because she knows some of the students (like me) have not taken an art history course yet. Readings help to supplement material from lecture, but they are not mandatory. Midterms are easy if you go to lecture and paper topics can be extremely broad, making them a breeze and actually enjoyable to write.",
    "Yes -- if you're at all interested in Buddhist art, Japan, Japanese history, or any combination thereof, take the class. Interesting subject material and an opportunity to learn more about a visual culture often left out in \"traditional\" art historical narratives.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in Japan, whether it be politics, culture, or economics, this course provides a great dive into a lot of the cultural monuments in Japan, its history, and its meanings.",
    "Yes, this is a wonderful course to absorb the information about Japanese artwork. It wasn't a stressful class, so I was able to learn with fun."
