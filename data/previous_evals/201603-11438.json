   "comments": [
    "How to read symbolic logic and more quickly spot logical fallacies.",
    "A whole new language! Really cool rational thinking.",
    "This class taught me so many things about abstract reasoning and formal logic, which I feel have made my skills of informal, everyday reasoning so much stronger.",
    "I gained a knowledge of First Order Logic (theoretical and functional). It was a solid QR class and it prepares you for the LSAT.",
    "I learned the language of formal logic.",
    "I learned how to utilize formal systems of logic to break down components of every-day language.",
    "I learned the rules of formal logic and lots of different applications of formal logic. I learned how to look at an argument in terms of its logical value.",
    "I gained a lot of quantitative skills and got a lot better at logical reasoning. I also learned how to build on past concepts with new ones and use my logical skills.",
    "Through this course, I gained skills in using formal logic that are able to be of broader significance in everyday life. Although not directly useful, the class does affect the way I have thought about certain things (how I think about the word \"or\", for example). Additionally, I feel that I have a strong foundation in formal logic after this course.",
    "I learned how to memorize bizarre rules in order to get good grades on quizzes. I'm sure my logical reasoning skills did improve somewhere along the line, but I'm not sure where or how.",
    "I learned how to use skills of logic in everyday life.",
    "Logic, mostly learning how to use the symbolic notation and how to do sentential and quantifier deductions.",
    "I learned how to identify and form logical arguments following certain premises, as well as how to paraphrase English statements into logical statements in order to make drawing conclusions easier.",
    "This class was an awesome overview to logic. I learned a bunch of different topics that I can apply to classes other than philosophy.",
    "I learned how to work within a formal logical system.",
    "This class taught me at a base level, how to think using formal logic. At a deeper level, it has transformed by thinking, and helped me to better evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of arguments I make.",
    "Logic taught me to stay calm under pressure and how to reason step-by-step to the conclusion. It also taught me that, even though I initially was unsure of my ability to do logic. Practicing how to think backwards to get to a conclusion and how to think of sentences and arguments in a more logical way.",
    "How to think in a more structured and logical way.",
    "This class teaches you how to do truth-functional paraphrasing, truth-functional interpretation, truth-functional deduction, quantificational paraphrasing, quantificational interpretations and quantificational deductions. Additionally, it encourages more strictly logical thinking in day-to-day life.",
    "I learned better how to translate english sentences into more directly analyzable logical sentences, and hopefully as I move forward this will better allow me to tell the difference between successful and unsuccessful arguments in my other classes. I also learned better how to think in advance of the argument I'm trying to develop. The deduction assignments were at first quite difficult but after a while I think that struggling through them helped me to wrap my head around arguments more effectively. I know these are rather vague, but I think that this is because I see the value of this course as learning how to think within this system to sharpen other skills. Of course I also learned the rules of first order logic, but I consider these to be secondary based on my understanding of the goals of the course.",
    "I developed a pretty decent understanding of the underpinnings of first-order logic and the way in which our arguments in plain English can be dissected and analyzed at the micro level. An extremely interesting course for anyone in philosophy or not.",
    "Learned lots of logic.",
    "I had no background in any sort of logic before taking this course, but I definitely feel pretty comfortable with first-order logic concepts now. I think my reasoning ability has improved after taking this course.",
    "Not too much. I learned how to manipulate a slightly watered-down system of logical paraphrase, deduction, and quantification.",
    "Basic logic skills",
    "Understanding basic concepts of logic",
    "The way I view logic puzzles has changed, but the way I view formal argument (say, a passage from a book), hasn't.",
    "I learned about an entirely new discipline: academic logic. There's an entirely new language and sets of rules, but the fundamental lessons extend into our everyday.",
    "Quantitative reasoning, language analysis",
    "I learned a lot from this course: it was fun to study sentential logic and analyze words in their most basic form. It seems, at times, pointlessbut don't fear! It's a really useful way of thinking. Also, Elizabeth Miller deserves an award for her teaching and care.",
    "Understanding of formal logic",
    "I learned how to better understand the logical structures that underly different sentences and constructions. I learned how to separate statements or arguments into their component truth-functional part. Overall, I think my skills in reasoning and logical organization were improved by this course.",
    "Problem solving and logical thinking.",
    "I think this class helps to give someone who has no interest in mathematics a basis in the field without introducing equations and formulae that he or she ma not use. For me, this class introduced me to the field of logic.",
    "I learned how to logically approach deductions and how to paraphrase english into logically workable schemata. I learned the basics of the language of logic and how to think critically about connections between information.",
    "I learned first-order logic."

   "comments": [
    "The quizzes were fair and provided an excellent metric for understanding throughout the semester. I felt the PSets sufficiently prepared me for the tests. Also, I am thankful for the number of sections and office hours that were offered throughout the term.",
    "Extremely well organized.",
    "The biggest strength of this class is how helpful and available the professor and TFs are. I found the class very difficult at times, but they were extremely helpful and patient with me. I did, however, find lectures very confusing at times. Because they were confusing, people would often stop paying attention. I think part of the problem may have been that, for several concepts, rather than starting with a very simple example, we would work for a while with a more complicated example. While there is merit to that method, I would sometimes fail to grasp the more basic concept and then would not be able to understand any of the rest of the explanation of the complicated example.",
    "With Elizabeth Miller, this course is fantastic. She is SO dedicated to her students' success. She gives you so many resources to learn the material, which can be pretty challenging. If you want to do well in this course and learn a lot, you can. (The constant quizzes also ensure that you are.)",
    "The flow and structure of the course was very well-organized, with new concepts building upon old ones. It progressed in a logical manner, and solidified learning because all concepts continued to be relevant throughout the course. The class provided a lot of support through optional sections, office hours, and problem sets that allowed for choice. This made for a level of work that was manageable and not overwhelming. The weekly quiz format also worked well. As a QR course, one weakness is that the course did not seem to be substantially related to quantitative reasoning. In addition, I would have liked to see more applications of informal logic to learn how logic can help determine how the use of language obfuscates its true meaning.",
    "The pset system was really helpful because you could do them as many times as you had to in order to learn the material. The quizzes were a useful check-in and helped me make sure I was doing everything I had to. However in consequence it was more difficult to devote the time and motivation needed to keep up with the work on the weeks in which we didn't have a quiz",
    "The top two strengths are Elizabeth's dedication to this course and the weekly quizzes. Elizabeth made sure that there was always enough help for us -- from her own office hours to sections to group work. And the weekly quizzes made sure we understood the material this week and really pushed me to stay engaged. I loved it.",
    "Assignments of the course were very well-designed -- problem sets were difficult, but optional (and often easier when working with a group. Weekly quizzes also ensured that students stayed up to date with material, as much of the logic curriculum builds on itself throughout the semester. Both Elizabeth, the professor, and Paul, my TA, were very helpful and kind. The only slight weakness at times was lecture. Elizabeth is a very good lecturer -- she is friendly, relatable, and knowledgeable. However, I often did not fully understand what was happening. It often seemed like too much information to cover in one class. Luckily, at home, I was able to review the posted slideshows (which were quite thorough) to understand class concepts. Overall, a great course with helpful assignments and a dedicated professor.",
    "Through roughly half of the course, I was enjoying myself and really felt like I was learning something useful. That half is the strength. The rest of the time, I was bitter and frustrated that I didn't understand concepts that don't seem to relate to real life at all (I'm looking at you, deduction.) These \"What does this actually mean?\" moments are the weaknesses of the course.",
    "Strengths: Canvas\/Logic Engine are great online tools. Facilitate a good balance between independent stud and guidance from Professor Miller. Also, professor Miller is the biggest strength. She is a genius, but also hilarious and makes learning these things- WHICH COULD BE SO SO SO BORING- very enjoyable and relevant. Her slides and explanations are clear and she goes at a good pace, where there is time to be challenged and think critiquely. Weaknesses: The TAs were a little off-putting and section was rather dull and unhelpful.",
    "I love Elizabeth Miller! I wished that we'd checked in every few weeks to reiterate how each chapter was helping us with philosophy, but I really did feel towards the end like the skills I learned helped with the way I even wrote my papers.",
    "Strengths of this class were the weekly quizzes to make sure of comprehension and the optional psets and sections which allowed for you to ask your own questions and work through complicated problems in a small group section. No weaknesses.",
    "The course material itself can be dry at times but professor Miller honestly saves the day and makes the course very engaging and fun. I would LOVE for her to teach more courses like these!",
    "I loved the material, but it moved slowly at moments and quickly at others, and the TF's weren't the most helpful. Elizabeth was, though!",
    "This class is excellent. I think the strengths are the weekly quizzes-which really help students to stay on top of their work and learn the material-to the fast and thorough responses on the logic website to the caliber of professor. There really weren't any weaknesses of the class, other than maybe the idea that the textbook was a little dense and not very helpful. The slides and explanations by the professor were much better.",
    "taking quizzes every week and having the problem sets be non-graded practice is excellent for making sure you stay on top of material",
    "I think that the course was well taught and not confusing, even though the subject would easily be confusing if taught in another way. The slides were clear, and I really liked having weekly quizzes, because it forced us to learn each week's materials.",
    "Very well structured course overall. The optional psets can be both a blessing and a curse.",
    "Though obviously I've only taken this class with Professor Miller, I think how good this class is depends entirely on the professor. This year, with Professor Miller, the class was excellent. Weekly quizzes are extremely manageable and make the final exam far easier to study for. The teaching is what made this course, though. I'm a junior, and Professor Miller is hands down the best professor I've had at Yale. She was extremely engaging in lecture and was very well prepared for class. Professor Miller quickly learned the names and majors of all of the students, and was interested in why we were taking the class. She always made herself available to meet in office hours or after class if you didn't understand something (or if you were just further interested in a topic), and she would follow up with you afterwards to see how you were feeling about the subject that you had been confused about earlier. Professor Miller did an excellent job of spreading out the work evenly over the semester, and grading was timely.",
    "Although I certainly enjoyed the relief that the easiness of this course brought my semester, it probably could have been made more rigorous. As it stood, there was very little content compared to the amount of resources available to learn. I found it unnecessary to attend section, do the readings, or even pay that close of attention in lectures after a while in the course. Although I still attended all of the lectures, I could easily see how one could get away with not doing so. Again, I appreciated this, but the course could probably be improved by making this impossible. Of course others might have found the extensive levels of support crucial to their success; it's hard for me to judge, especially as a philosophy major. I certainly thought that Professor Miller was very helpful and cooperative in her approach to the course. As a final note, the logic engine was really nice. That was a great way to do the homework, and I hope that it will be kept for future iterations of this class.",
    "I thought the course was very well organized and thought out. The weekly quizzes helped me stay focused and the practice helped instill the material.",
    "- Seems like Elizabeth genuinely cares for and keeps track of all of her students, which I could tell by the amount of detail she put into responding to each question or concern. I also appreciated that there were ample opportunities to get help or catch up outside of class. - The textbook was not central to my learning in this class - The class website was well organized - Section time could have been spent more efficiently",
    "The structure of our lectures was a bit disorganized and not highly conducive to understanding concepts on a deep level. I benefited a lot more from in-person office hours, section, and problem sets.",
    "The powerpoints were all perfect and available online, the practice problems were accessible and also online, and every step along the way students were offered help through optional sections, office hours, immediate online assistance, review sessions, and handouts. I am shocked that Prof. Miller and her graduate student even found time to do all the things they did to accommodate their students.",
    "Professor Miller is fantastic.",
    "I really liked the course format (the optional p-set + quiz every week) and I think it definitely helped facilitate learning the material, since every week built on the weeks that came before. I think that the sections could be a little better focused. I didn't find them all that helpful most of the time. Also, we sometimes got bogged down with one person's question in lecture, which would kind of derail the lesson in a way that wasn't useful for most of the people in lecture.",
    "Professor Miller was extremely dedicated, and the system of evaluation was, despite my somewhat shoddy performance, very well designed. The weakness of this course is that there was no attempt at, or even pretension of, rigor.",
    "The professor was fantastictruly the most dedicated teacher I've had at Yale. The teaching fellows, however, needed more expertise in the subject area. I also found the grading structure positive; weekly quizzes encouraged us not to fall behind, but ensured that no single assignment was worth a huge portion of your grade.",
    "Strengths are the course material, the smooth transition between problems sets and quizzes, and teaching staff including E Miller",
    "Well paced and well taught",
    "Make the psets mandatory!",
    "I learned a lot about first order logic, but I think the course could benefit a little more from analyzing real world arguments that would allow us to apply our theoretical skills to concrete problems.",
    "The weekly quizzes were annoying, but ultimately a great way to keep students accountable and make sure they were keeping up with the material. The optional section and psets were a really great compromise.",
    "Professor Miller did an excellent job making logic relevant and incorporating puzzles for us to grapple with. She made it extremely accessible and fun to learn, even when it seemed sort of impenetrable. She also really emphasized how logic is a way of thinking more than just a mathematical translation of sentences. Great class, especially as a QR for a humanities person.",
    "I personally didn't engage with material as much as I think I should have or could have because section attendance and psets weren't required. That's not to say that those things should be required, but that maybe there should be some other required piece of the course to make sure that people stay somewhat more engaged every week. However, I did like the weekly quiz format, because I was always aware of how comfortable I was with the material we'd just covered.",
    "I really like the structure of the weekly quizzes because it ensures that the student understands the material on a cumulative level. However, the lectures could have been much better. They often felt disorganized and confusing. The section was done very well and I learned much better there. I think it would help to see more problems worked out in lecture on a chalkboard or in another way that's easy to see the stepwise process.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course is the way that it has structure. The way that tests and problem sets were laid out, I always knew exactly what I needed to study. I think a weakness is that there seems to be a divide between the theoretical and philosophical ramifications of logic, and the practical application of it. In class, we discussed many philosophical hows and whys of logic, but these did not appear on the test.",
    "I think that the psets were extremely helpful in helping me to learn the information necessary to understand the course material. I felt that the textbook however was only sometimes helpful in understanding the course material, and sometimes it didn't clarify what I was confused on.",
    "This course taught the material and provided more than enough opportunities for when I needed assistance on any given topic. I feel more than prepared for future courses in logic."

    "Yes!!! Amazing course, you'll learn a lot",
    "Yes. It's an excellent QR for someone who isn't a STEM major but who also doesn't want to take a gut.",
    "I would totally recommend this course if taught by Elizabeth Miller! You will be challenged but offered a lot of resources to ensure your success! She cares so much about you! If you need a good QR that isn't too much work take this class with Elizabeth Miller!",
    "I think this is an excellent QR course for students that struggle with numbers. Besides, Professor Miller was an excellent lecturer and created a good atmosphere within her classroom, one conducive to asking questions.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone looking for a QR credit that's not too difficult. The structure of the class sets you up for success and is very well-organized.",
    "Yes I would! The quantitative way of thinking is very interesting especially for someone with a background primarily in humanities. I feel like I learned and achieved a lot in this course.",
    "A perfect QR for someone who's willing to put in (a lot of) work but get rewarded for that hard work. It ended up being a highlight of my semester, to my surprise! How a distributional requirement should be. Seriously. It's fun, engaging, and Elizabeth cares so much about your learning. I was constantly in awe of how many extra office hours, help sessions, and sections she made to make sure she was facilitating our learning to the best of her ability. Another strength of the class is that Logic is new to (pretty much) everyone, so everyone is on equal footing in terms of how much they know. So as long as you work hard each week for the quizzes, it's a fun and rewarding class. Very worth it. Also, another plus: I've never had a lecture of 80+ people where I felt so close to the professor. Elizabeth would remember specific details about my life, about what I got wrong on a quiz, about what I was confused about, etc...simply incredible",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in learning about the nuances of truth and language through a quantitative system. It provides a good base of familiarity with logic to build upon with later courses in philosophy or linguistics.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially to someone interested in finding a meaningful (but not overly difficult) QR credit. It was really neat to see the material build on itself and feel like I had mastered a new concept each week. Elizabeth and TAs were also fantastic resources and truly wanted to see everyone succeed. It is a class where you really are able to decide how well you want to do, based on the work you are willing to put in. Overall, a very interesting class that I am very grateful the search for a QR credit led me to.",
    "Take the course if you're resourceful and know how to be successful when the odds are stacked against you. I didn't understand the last two units whatsoever but still did fine on the final because I know how to take advantage of my opportunities (like the full page of notes, front-and-back, that we got to bring in with us.) It's definitely not a gut like some people say it is, but at the end of the day, it's still a QR credit with minimal traditional math, and that counts for something.",
    "If Elizabeth is teaching logic, TAKE IT! She is the most helpful professors I have had at Yale! She genuinely wants you to succeed -- as a person and in the class. There are weekly quizzes but they are mostly problems from the PS and more to makes sure you fall behind then trip you up. The average for every quiz hovered around 96%.",
    "Yes especially if it fulfills some sort of skills requirement. It isn't just a BS QR that gets you by; it has real life applications and helped me see how I think about things.",
    "Would recommend for philosophy majors who need a logic requirement. This class is not a gut if you are someone looking for an easy QR credit that requires absolutely zero work, because the weekly quizzes really force you to stay on top of the material. Overall an enjoyable class, but only because it was taught by Elizabeth Miller! She's an amazing, kind professor.",
    "I don't know who's teaching this next year, but I would definitely recommend the version I was taught with Professor Miller. She was very invested in making sure we were keeping up with the skills and made sure no one student was falling behind.",
    "First Order Logic was a great overview to the material. Not being a philosophy major, I took it for knowledge that will help me with the LSAT but this class will also serve as a good QR. Weekly quizzes helped with comprehension of material so it didn't compound and leave you completely confused. Also, optional psets and sections allowed for you to ask your questions and work through tough problems on a small scale. Definitely recommend although if you are not a philosophy major, be aware that this is mandatory for philosophy majors and that the material gets harder as the course goes on.",
    "Would highly recommend for a QR, but much of that is based on professor Miller teaching the course. She honestly is so great and I think with a different instructor the course can really be less enjoyable.",
    "Yes, this class teaches the fundamentals of reasoning, and to see students grapple with what can be implied, what can assumed, and what can proposed in basic argumentation was refreshing to see. Having Yale students receive a basic education in logic argument construction was something that was incredibly valuable to me, and I hope, to others.",
    "Yes! I loved the material - it was unlike anything else I've ever done.",
    "Take this class!! Especially if Elizabeth Miller is still teaching it. This class is really helpful for expanding critical thinking skills and is a solid qr. This isn't a gut-it does require high level thinking and quite a bit of work outside of class-but it is manageable if you maintain and keep up with your work. Miller is an amazing professor who genuinely cares about the students and making sure that you've mastered the material. Take this class if you want a qr and are willing to put in a little extra work. Take this class if you want to improve your thinking and arguing skills.",
    "absolutely",
    "Yes, very helpful for LSAT prep, as well as for thinking through life's questions\/other classes in a logical manner. You learn good life skills, even though the specifics of logic might be forgotten in the future.",
    "Yes - as an alternative QR. Probably not for just a fun class.",
    "If Professor Miller is teaching the course, I would absolutely recommend this course. I took this class both to fulfill a QR requirement and also for the philosophy major, and it was an excellent choice for the QR requirement.",
    "I would recommend this class for, of course philosophy majors required to take it, or additionally someone looking for a way to get a QR credit without the accumulation of useless knowledge. I don't believe that this is a good introduction to philosophy for a non-major, but I think if someone wanted to get a QR credit that employed mathematical thinking but without a huge amount of knowledge they will never use again, this is a good, low-stress class that will probably help everyone think a little bit more clearly moving forward.",
    "I would, I thought it was nice introductory class to logic and Professor Miller was very nice, helpful and approachable. The class was interesting and enjoyable and not too hard so someone who is not majoring in philosophy would be able to enjoy it.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to put in a decent amount of work. This is not a gut in any way.",
    "I don't like the dry course material. It is not as fun a subject as the other topics one might see in the blue book. However, Prof. Miller and her TF's make the course so much more fun and accessible, and honestly, if you are even considering the philosophy major and you see that Elizabeth Miller is teaching it, you should jump to take it. If you are going to have to take it anyway, you had better hope she is teaching the course. She will help reduce the stress of the class and make each of the quizzes almost enjoyable.",
    "Superb QR, not at all a chore.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material was very interesting and it was quite cool to learn how to think and reason in different ways than I had before. Professor Miller was great at making herself available if you needed help and the TF's also held optional sections and office hours every week. The coursework was definitely manageable if you kept on top of things. Having an optional p-set was really helpful for preparing for the weekly quizzes, which is what the majority of your grade comes from. All around, I thought this class was great and the material was really fun to learn.",
    "Only take this if you absolutely must. There are many other QRs which are more rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, particularly if Professor Miller is teaching. It's great for someone who likes mathematical thinking, but would prefer not to work with numbers.",
    "Yes, it is a well structured, well paced course that teaches you the basic of logic",
    "I would! Professor Elizabeth Miller is a very bubbly, optimistic person, and her classroom was a happy place.",
    "If Professor Miller is teaching this course again ... TAKE IT!",
    "Yes! Take this course if you're not too keen on math but need a QR--especially if you can take it with Elizabeth. She's absolutely wonderful.",
    "I hear Professor Miller isn't teaching the class next year. If she is, drop everything and take this course. If she's not, and you're looking for a QR, I'd still take italthough again, she definitely made this course worth it for me.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Lectures are interesting, it moves at a good pace, and the material is pretty engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students because I found the problem solving to be pretty fun. It is also not that hard if the time is devoted.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with no interest in mathematics for a QR credit that is bot interesting and intellectually stimulating.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course as a class that provides a strong foundation in logic and gives you a working understanding of truth-functional and quantificational logic.",
    "This course is good for a QR credit if you need one. It's not fluff, and you'll actually learn something that you'll probably find useful, but its workload is very manageable and the professor and TAs are very helpful and available. Additionally, the course was structured in a way which made it not very difficult to achieve a good grade."
