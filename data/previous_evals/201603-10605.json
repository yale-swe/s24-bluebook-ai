    "Strengths The short units that were extremely engaging, Homework assignments were clear, and useful Weaknesses Not enough emphasis on essay writing maybe?",
    "Strengths- interesting reading materials with a variety of relevant topics Weaknesses- not much effort is gone into explaining grammatical points very well. Tests are also super easy (and there's not as many of them as initially dictated in the syllabus). I would say that this course could benefit from being more strict on its students."

    "Yes! Anyone who wants to further their Japanese language proficiency should take this course.",
    "Seto sensei is very chill and fun to be around, but there's not a lot of impetus for studying very hard or memorizing the little vocabulary we do \"learn\". If you want to get the most out of this course, you'd have to want to put in the effort. But once you get to higher levels of Japanese there's not much you can do but continue on regardless."
