    "Excellent spanish class. Take it with Profesora Valle. She is awesome.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. At first I was only trying to fulfill my language requirement andbe done with Spanish, but this class made me want to take more Spanish classes at Yale. It was very similar to my AP Spanish class in high school; very discussion-based and focused on developing speaking, and analytical reading and writing skills, with grammar serving as a supplement. Well-taught, and class size is perfect."
