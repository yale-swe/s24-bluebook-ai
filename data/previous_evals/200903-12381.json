    "Fun class!Not too difficult and the professor is great.Most of the assignments are pretty creative and you really get a new perspective to music.",
    "Awesome class. Fascinating look at how non-Western music works. It's a different world out there.",
    "If that person is interested in improving their musical ear or their broader musical understanding-- particularly of worldmusic, yes. If not, they might struggle to enjoy the material.",
    "World Music Theories is a great class if you want to understand how musics of other cultures work. Working to acquire the tools to understand other musical systems is really rewarding, and the end product of actually being able to listen to music of another culture and understand what's going on is really beautiful. You emerge from the class with new aural skills and an expanded aural palette which is great. Assuming that Turkish music, which is not really an improvisatory practice anymore, is not taught in the next iteration of the course, I would highly recommend the class."
