    "Basic Calc 2 class\/ skills",
    "not a lot.",
    "I learned more calculus.",
    "not much",
    "Basic Calculus.",
    "I knew calculus well going into the course, and I walked away feeling very, very confident in it, knowing it extremely well. I enjoyed the course and the subject matter. Overall, I learned a lot.",
    "This course taught me a lot about identifying the various types of series and testing for convergence or divergence, as well as the importance of studying with other people and the benefits of collaboration, as opposed to a lot of work in high school.",
    "By taking the course, I learned Calc 2: integral calculus with limits, areas, volumes, series, parametric and polar equations. I became fairly comfortable with finding the anti derivative, learned techniques for integration, and developed an intuition for dealing with series.",
    "I improved my calculus abilities.",
    "I gained mastery of integration, series, etc. I strengthened my ability to think independently and critically in math by going further in visualizing proofs.",
    "I learned how to properly do calculus.",
    "I didn't learn anything aside from what I already learned from AP Calculus BC but the tests covered much harder versions of the concepts than were presented in class.",
    "I got by in high school by knowing enough Calculus to get an A. This course forces you to learn the curriculum properly through daily prep problems, weekly psets and midterm evaluations. You must put in effort every single day to learn and this is something I did. Not know at the beginning. It is for this reason that I did very poorly at the beginning of the course. I did learn how to pace myself with the work and seek out help when I needed it.",
    "I learned a lot about integrals, and formed a solid base in calculus.",
    "My appreciation for math increased significantly. I feel more confident in dealing with calculus and look forward to taking more math courses in the future.",
    "Having already taken calculus in high school, I believed I was well prepared for the material. However, in the context of a flipped classroom, I learned the importance of adapting to new circumstances while maintaining the integrity of pre-existing knowledge bases. This may sometimes take the assistance of a tutor, as timely adjustment is of the essence if one wishes to perform well in this course.",
    "I developed my critical thinking skills as well as mathematical skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The coursera videos were useful and good introductions to the weekly class material; however, the quizzes were mostly just frustrating, and i learned more from the examples we did in class. I think the course could be improved by doing more practice problems in class where the teacher talks for some time, but then there is also time in class to work on practice problems individually or with people near you.",
    "Unnecessarily difficult - flipped course was not effective The videos were often not as helpful as learning material in class would have been",
    "This class is god awful. Math was my favorite class in high school. I was so ready to come to Yale and take many, many more math classes. This class, however, was so poor that it will be my last math class. The teachers were awful. They expected you to understand everything already because of the format of the classroom. The reverse classroom is beneficial to NO ONE and just gives the teachers the wrong idea that we know the material the next day. The videos we had to watch were never helpful, just confusing. I was not given any chance to improve, considering there's no room for movement.",
    "This course is flipped which makes it much more difficult to learn the material. The classes are also very boring as a result.",
    "have better instruction",
    "This course is atrocious. The flipped classroom set-up essentially means the classroom sessions are just a huge waste of time. Thank god though for Jimmy Rolfe and his videos because there was absolutely no teaching. So maybe someone could teach the instructors how to instruct and then the videos could supplement. Or they could just drop the class time, give everyone 2 and half hours of their lives back every week and just have videos and office hours.",
    "Before taking this class, I thought I would have preferred learning subject matter in class first, and then watching videos about the subject matter\/doing work on it after. However, for this course, I enjoyed the backwards order of the course: watching Coursera videos before the class.",
    "Strengths: collaborative atmosphere, easy-to-understand video lectures, reasonable length\/difficulty of psets Weaknesses: low in-class engagement, low in-person attendance",
    "The Coursera videos were fairly helpful but - like there was for Taylor series at one point - different kinds of videos should be made to address the same concepts for different students. These videos can have more content and proceed at a slower pace. I would have liked to have additional resources such as handouts and worksheets to practice and develop my understanding of the mathematics. I would have also liked more frequent review sessions to clear up confusions even before testing season.",
    "I believe that calculus is something best taught in a classroom. This type of environment forces active engagement from students. Then class was best when the professor reviewed the concepts in class and this type of environment existed. Unfortunately, with the implementation of the flipped classroom concept, most of our class time was spent doing problems that many of us did not feel prepared to approach.",
    "The course did a good job in providing students with the basic understanding of material but could have gone further in proofs. It would be improved by more in-depth discussions in class and more engagement.",
    "I liked how we did practice problems. But I didn't like the Coursera problems",
    "I am really disappointed in the math department after this class. I shopped five different teachers and they were all very bad. I could not understand most of them because they didn't speak English well. The one I picked was the best out of the five but still not good. The fact that my high school calculus teacher was several times better than any of these teachers is disappointing. I also did not like that the class was flipped; I do not learn well in flipped classes. I found the teaching so bad that I used my notes from AP Calculus BC rather than taking new notes. The tests were also much harder than the problems we did in class. Overall I am just very disappointed in this class. I would have rather had a large lecture class with a really good teacher than a small class with a bad teacher.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the varied opportunities to learn. The lectures could be more helpful if the professors spend 10-15 minutes reviewing the topics rather than jumping right into practice problems. I found that it was difficult to make use of the class and the practice if I didn't understand the concept itself. The flipped classroom allows students to take initiative with their learning but can also be dangerous if the student falls behind.",
    "The fact that it was a flip classroom did not motivate or aid in the learning process.",
    "Learning from videos and literally going over the exact same thing in class didn't seem to give me any more insight. It just felt repetitive and like a waste of my time. Like why do both?",
    "I liked the coursera videos but the curriculum isn't very engaging in general.",
    "Strengths: Good array of topics, many resources to seek out help. Weaknesses: Too much time spent on early units.",
    "I found the flipped classroom to be redundant. Ultimately, class time would be spent going over all concepts stated in the videos. I would have liked, instead, for a more conventional classroom environment, especially considering that some professors' assumption that students are entering the classroom up to speed significantly detracted from their teaching performance (this lead me to change sections late in the semester). Kalina Mincheva made all the difference for me. She was a marvelous instructor and ensured every student understood what she was trying to communicate. I wish I had started off in her section; the course would have gone very differently.",
    "Strengths is that it has the inverted classroom technique so it taught us things out of class and also the professors were always willing to help and they gave us a lot of material to prepare for tests. Weaknesses could be that in class the professor could do more to further teach us the material because sometimes the video is not enough.",
    "I did not like the flipped classroom style. It did not work well for me, and the people who I studied with also struggled learning in this setting. I found this course to be designed for people who had already taken integral and series calculus. Videos did not have helpful examples. They would either include very elementary problems that are not applicable to the problem set, or ones that were too difficult to be understandable."

    "Yes, I learned quite a bit, and I do feel like I have a solid grasp of calculus II.",
    "No - not a well taught\/ well structured class - only take if absolutely necessary",
    "Never. It is so poorly run and conducted. It's a mess. Very few students understand what is happening and the teachers are clueless. They have no idea how to teach or connect with their students.",
    "I would not recommend this course because it is flipped. If you don't have a background knowledge of Calculus, it is extremely difficult to learn the material.",
    "Not really",
    "Nobut you probably have to take it anyway. Be sure to shop multiple sections and find a half decent instructor. There are a couple who are legitimately good (Brett Smith).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who likes math. I like math, and I had a great experience.",
    "I would recommend taking Math 115 to students who have some experience with integration and differential equations but who might not have had a strong base in calculus fundamentals",
    "Unless you can place out of it, Calc 2 is pretty important and should be taken if you want to take higher level math or pursue STEM in the future. Read the textbook before going to class or starting a pset. Most likely you will find yourself turning to additional Internet resources to explain some of the concepts.",
    "Probably, given that it is kind of unavoidable. Professor Mincheva was great, so I would definitely recommend they try to take it with her.",
    "It's essential for establishing a foundation in calculus and the class is well-taught.",
    "If you have to take Math then yes.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because the teaching is horrible, the tests are hard, and the curve is little to none.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Yes! Calculus is very important and I am happy to say that even though it was a rough semester, I came away with a solid foundation. My only advice would be not to let this class slide to the bottom of your priority list just because there is only one pset a week.",
    "I would recommend it if they already have a prior knowledge of it.",
    "Yes, if one needs to fulfill prerequisites.",
    "I certainly would.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who is not required to take it. The structure of the class is somewhat frustrating, and excessively irregular. If the goal is effective teaching, serious thought should be given to shifting the focus back to quality teaching and away from computer programs that give already stressed college students more hoops to jump through.",
    "I would recommend it to other students because it gives you a new way of learning and it helps develop your math and quantitative reasoning skills.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The teaching style did not help me grasp the material."
