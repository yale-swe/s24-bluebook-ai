   "comments": [
    "APHY 060 is a very interesting course and the curriculum focuses on exploring the energy demands of society and possible solutions to meet those demands. I would recommend this class as everything we learned will be relevant in one way or another in the future.",
    "Would recommend this class to non science majors looking for a science credit. The workload is not too much as there are only a couple problem sets that do not take excessively long and a student presentation. Overall the course is taught more as a lecture than a seminar, but Professor Prober is great and easy to approach and work with.",
    "DP is the man. Not a difficult class--if you are looking for an easy QR or SC then you have come to the right place. Light workload--5 problem sets, a midterm, a group presentation, and a final paper. The topics are not treated very deeply and some of the lectures were dry, but overall an enjoyable experience.",
    "I would summarize this class is a low-intensity quantitative look at various forms of energy, with a focus on heat engines and electrical energy generation. There is some talk about alternative forms of energy, but not a very large amount. There is also some discussion on the more qualitative aspects of energy, such as why certain forms are energy are better for certain purposes. I would recommend this class to another student provided that they are interested in energy and don't mind doing some scientific calculation (but nothing very intense).",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to everyone. If you have a solid background in the sciences, though, expect it to be a little on the easy side. Maybe too easy. In any case, it's just an I-really-want-to-go-to-class-today kind of class. Professor Prober is a great guy.",
    "Would recommend it to someone interested in the environment, how the earth works and practical uses of energy. Extremely fun and interesting."
