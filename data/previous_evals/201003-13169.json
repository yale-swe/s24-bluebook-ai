    "This was a survey of the Western Canon. I would recommend it to another student. It was by far the strongest of my three courses, not only in terms of Professors (Capodivacca was great) but I also found the works we read the most interesting.",
    "The literature was for the most part fun to read, and Professor Capodivacca was an incredible teacher. I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, the texts you read are ones you would probably not typically want to pick up for random reading. Who wants to read \"The Iliad\" for fun? Not me before taking DS. But I am so grateful to have had this literature class. It really opens your eyes to the foundations of literature for the next thousands of years, and it helps you understand where our perspectives come from. You'll never wince when you state at a classic text again--instead you'll get excited. Great class if you love getting lost in a book.",
    "DS Lit is a survey course of the more literary swaths of the western canon. I would recommend this course to anyone willing to reed a tremendous amount who is looking for a firm grounding in the western canon.",
    "This course is a survey of western literature, from Homer to Dante. I would highly recommend taking it. It focuses on interpreting literature, and seeing your life differently because of it. The late night (or perhaps early morning) readings are worth it in the end.",
    "This is a great class. The reading list is amazing in my opinion, perhaps with the exception of the Bible since it was sometimes difficult to separate the religious and literary discussions of the text. Even though it might have the most reading of the DS courses in terms of page numbers, the reading goes quickly and is interesting. Capodivacca is a great section leader and takes incredibly personal care of her students.",
    "I would recommend it as a class for someone who wants to learn how to read quickly and analyze complex ideas, but not for someone who wants to develop a thorough understanding of any one individual work.",
    "Directed Studies is a great intro to the Western Canon--you read a ton of great and important books, have very knowledgeable professors, and the opportunity to have small sections with three of them. The only downside is that DS can be a ton of reading--and the course moves very quickly. However, otherwise you might never get around to reading all of the authors DS covers, and if there's one in particular you wish you'd spent more time on, there's always opportunities to take classes that cover it in more depth. DS Lit first semester read Homer,3 of the Greek theatre tragedies, Virgil, The Bible and Dante. The Lit lectures were, for the most part, absolutely amazing and the opportunity to discuss these books in such a small section is unique to DS. If you can do the reading, take the class!",
    "DS Literature attempts to cover a large expanse of literary works of the Western tradition in the matter of a year. It is at times stressful but extremely rewarding for those seeking a broad knowledge of many works to further develop and study throughout their Yale career, if they choose. All the professors are wonderful lecturers and Prof. Capodivacca is an amazing section professor who fosters a section atmosphere and discussion environment like none other.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It gives an incredible sense of the western cannon to all students.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Prof. Capodivacca's section to anyone doing DS! Not only was she knowledgeable about every book on the first semester curriculum, but her class was enjoyable and low pressure, despite being focused.",
    "This is a really great class and professor capodivacca knows what she's doing.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend DS in general, and literature specifically, to another student. The opportunity to read these classics is unparalleled."
