   "comments": [
    "I learned more about the private equity industry and general mechanics of financial institutions, investment cycles and M&A.",
    "I learned about the business of Venture Capital and Private Equity from a veteran of the Private Equity industry who is also familiar with the venture capital space.",
    "Helps to develop your comprehension of the foundation and analyses that underpin Private Equity & Venture Capitalism. Part of what makes this class so great is that it is largely lead by the students. Professor Smith will asks questions about the case or supplemental notes, and the class will be responsible for progressing conversation through the use of content discussed in the readings.",
    "I learned a lot about how to value companies, and I think that my business skills really benefitted from having a forum to discuss and debate ideas.",
    "Really got a better sense of VC\/PE and the unique thought process that goes along with being successful in the industry.",
    "I loved this class a lot. It was super useful in understanding how the industry for private equity and venture capital works. You did need a baseline understanding of finance, but the class and the cases we studied were also accessible to non-finance people",
    "Basic understanding of how Private Equity and Venture Capital fund raises equity, approach deals and bring in value to businesses",
    "A case-based overview of the world of Private Equity and Venture Capital. Weekly assignments helped to develop a basic understanding of financial modeling and the great set of guest speakers allowed students to see the status of the industry today",
    "Developed extremely useful practical knowledge in the world of private equity investing. Useful modeling skills, and how to think and solve real life business and investment decisions.",
    "I gained a ton of practical knowledge about how to invest in early-stage companies, how to value later-stage businesses, how bankruptcies work in the US, how companies pay down debt, how cryptocurrencies work, etc. Truly, I could not have imagined learning more in one semester.",
    "So much learnt in 1 semester. How to evaluate deals, pricing the deal. It was the most worth it class I have taken at Yale",
    "I learned what private equity and venture capital is, how to evaluate companies, how companies start, grow, are acquired or have a public offering."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was really varied and provided a good overview of a lot of interesting areas, however I think it is misleading to name this class \"venture capital\" because, compared to another residential college seminar at Yale that DOES teach VC (\"The Business of Venture Capital\"), this class barely skims the surface. It is very focused on traditional, investment-banking and private equity style cases and assumes a LOT of prior quantitative knowledge and experience.",
    "The class follows the Harvard Business School case format which was very conducive for learning the material.",
    "Strengths: The class relies on class participation, so it forces everybody in the room to be involved and engaged. The work is actually enjoyable, so this is never a problem. Weaknesses: Feedback was typically general, rather than specifically oriented to each individuals mistakes. However, Professor Smith was always willing to meeting with students to help with their needs.",
    "I really liked the format overall. I think that having an entirely new case each week worked well and allowed me to learn about many types of businesses. I think that, for whatever reason, the class participation wasn't as great as it could have been. I also think that discussion of some of the more complication valuation stuff could be talked about in class the week before the case which required it.",
    "This was a great course and there aren't too many classes like it which is nice. It was very engaging, but I wish there was more formal teaching for certain ideas\/methods.",
    "Wake is incredible! Can't really think of ways to improve the class",
    "This course had a good balance of lecture and participation. The cases were the right level of difficulty to challenge the class but not discourage. The workload was well-distributed across the semester.",
    "Amazingly well-taught with great insights from the instructor. The guest speakers (employees from Yale Investment Office, founders of PE firms, senior advisors at Blackstone) are the highlights of the class experience",
    "The case-based approach was very suitable for this course, as it is a business-school like curriculum. Classes were heavily discussion focused but there was appropriate guidance from Professor Smith to introduce us to new topics. It moved fast, but there was a lot of content spanned and it kept each week very interesting. For those with a non-finance background, it was definitely more difficult to keep up since basic financial knowledge was assumed. Those without experience in Excel would certainly be at a handicap as well.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Smith is an excellent lecturer, led seminar discussions extremely well. The course is also extremely well organized. Guest speakers are probably the best part when they come in and offer insights. Weakness: Nothing really to complain about!",
    "The strengths are the professor (Professor Smith is excellent and really knows his stuff), the weekly cases (which are well-written and very engaging), and the assessments (which are fair and not overly burdensome). I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Strengths- Great intro\/ accelerated course on the topic. I learnt more in this class than I have at any other Yale class Weakness- You do the homework before understanding the material properly. Most people in it did some sort of IB or Private Equity work the summer before, definitely not an even playing field",
    "The strength of this course is the in-class discussions and business cases. Wake was a good, but demanding instructor. Sometimes this class felt overwhelming in that it assumed a level of prior business knowledge and many of the cases forced you to go out on a limb and answer questions before I even knew how to approach the issue at hand."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you're keen on pursuing a career in finance, this class makes sense. It is very real-world and practical, and most kids who take it already have banking internships lined up or are math\/econ majors. If this area doesn't interest you on a practical level, don't take this class. It is quite advanced.",
    "Yes, this is a fantastic course for learning about venture capital and private equity, especially for people who have not previously had much exposure to those fields.",
    "An absolute joy to take. I would strongly recommend this class to anybody who is interested in learning about Private Equity & Venture Capital. This class will change the way you approach valuing companies on a financial and quantitative capacity. It is a great course to fuel a student's passion for the industry and have them excited to learn day in and day out.",
    "Yes, but only if they were potentially interested in private equity. This is a course that teaches skills which are generally lacking in the rest of Yale's courses.",
    "Yes, definitely if they are interested in VC\/PE. It is a class you will want to be able to put a lot of time into in order to get the most out of it, but it is worth it.",
    "Definitely!! If you get in definitely take this class",
    "I highly recommend this course. It's a nice taste of the finance world that is hard to get in other courses. It has qualitative and quantitative aspects and was an enjoyable class to attend every week.",
    "Absolutely. I'm a typical STEM major with almost zero understanding of how PE & VC works before I came into the class. The class was a great introduction into firm's valuation, accounting for finance and business processes.",
    "Definitely would recommend this course to anyone with interest in the industry, since Professor Smith has seen it grow firsthand from nothing into what it is today. It is not too jargon filled or specialist and rather tries to give a survey of some of the most essential topics. Although there is analytical and quantitative work, it is not so rigorous so that it is the meat of the course: it is very much still qualitative and students of the course emerge with an understanding of both the work and how the PE industry functions.",
    "Absolutely. Best class I took this semester. If you want to solve business cases related to private equity and apply some modeling skills, this is the class for you. However, if you have no prior experience in finance or modeling, this class can be challenging.",
    "Absolutely. This is a must if you want to go into private equity someday, or even if you just want to understand more about basic finance, start-ups and innovation in America, corporate law, or accounting. It is well-taught without being overly difficult, and the professor is great.",
    "Few classes can boast of the rigor that this one offers. Would recommend it Credit D especially if you have limited knowledge in the topic",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is formatted like business school, with weekly cases as homework and in-class discussions about those cases- almost like a flipped classroom. This can be a foreign concept at first, as the cases are open-ended and you have to figure out a way to approach and analyze each problem. The cases are interesting are relevant; one was even on Bitcoin. There are a number of guest lecturers throughout the semester that provide industry points of view. Mr. Smith is an experienced professional and brings up novel considerations that adds depth to the discussions. He always keeps you on your toes with cold-calls and expects a fair amount of background business knowledge. The class can be demanding at times, but you learn a lot and even walk away with some helpful life advice."
