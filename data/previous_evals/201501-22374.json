    "This class focuses on some really interesting texts and movies. As an added bonus, the stimulating discussions are of course in Italian, so it is a good chance to practice speaking as well.",
    "Italian 151 is an engaging and fun class to attend. Perhaps part of the courses' success can be attributed to Rabissi's phenomenal teaching methods. If Rabissi is teaching the course, definitely take this class.",
    "This class gives you the opportunity to talk about Love, Individuality, and Revolution--all very serious themes--in Italian, which is very exciting especially if you're looking to really improve your Italian. You will watch great films, read great passages and poems, and ultimately have a great time in class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. If you want to continue to improve your Italian, both conservational and written, this is a perfect class for you."
