    "Mark Fedyk is quite young, and his lecture style could still use some work--it is often rather dry. However, he is very helpful in person, and will gladly look over drafts of your papers or midterms as many times as you want (this may partially have been because there were only around 10 people in the class). The class gives you a survey of contemporary views on the philosophy of science, some of which are simply strange and some of which seem eminently obvious. The class also introduces you to postmodern approaches to knowledge--something of which I had been unaware till then. I now know what people mean by \"social construct.\" All in all an often interesting and easy-going class.",
    "Great course--very interesting area that is actually relevant to life. The professor was great as well, and the workload was not bad at all--just readings, a short midterm, and a final essay. Too bad Fedyk is leaving!",
    "Definitely recommend if you're interested in the topic.Some of it may be a bit dry, but over all it's very interesting and relevant material, and professor Fedyk presented very contemporary and controversial issues. I felt like it's an entirely different class than I may have taken otherwise. We covered the basics but went so much more in depth into modern debates than I was expecting.",
    "Philosophy 269 is a survey of the major movements in Philosophy of Science since the Positivists.I would highly recommend this course to any student.",
    "Philosophy of Science is a wonderful course with a set of material that takes the philosophy major outside of the usual reading that he or she may have met in most other courses taken. It's a fun course with a good set of readings.Speaking as someone that started off studying physics at Yale I think all science majors should take this course.",
    "Really fun class. Completely different look at philosophy from what is usually offered. I enjoy the sciences, but I think that even people who do not care as much for the sciences would still appreciate this class.Phil 269 was listed as a lecture class, but only 9 students ended up taking it, which was to everyone's advantage. It was nice to have a smaller setting. The teaching style was very dynamic. Mark Fedyk is a boss. Mark Fedyk invented sliced bread. He's funny, well-spoken and knows his stuff. He is also very accommodating to students and their questions (inside as well as outside the classroom). If he taught another class I would take it.",
    "his is the best class I've taken at Yale. I really enjoyed the subject matter, and the nature of the syllabus allowed me to pursue my own interests that sprang from lecture, while also actively going over the required materials. This is a great course. Fedyk's a great teacher."
