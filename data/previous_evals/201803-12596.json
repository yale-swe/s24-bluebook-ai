    "By taking this course I improved my writing skills and my ability to communicate science research to a wider, non-technical audience",
    "-Understanding one's audience and finding ways to explain complicated material -Giving feedback on my peers' writing",
    "I practiced writing for a more novice audience, and got to share information about environmental topics that I find important and want people to know about. I learned to synthesize complex ideas from scientific journals and make them digestible for the average reader.",
    "I practiced my writing skills.",

    "It aligns with my expectations",
    "Aligned very well. I was expecting to gain more experience writing and translating scientific knowledge, and I did that plus much more learning that came in the form of editing other peoples' work and being part of the administrative team.",
    "The course perfectly matched my expectations. The individual tutoring sessions as well as the lecturers invited on a bi-weekly basis all helped us better synthesize and write about complex scientific topics.",
    "They completely met my expectations.",
    "The course fully met my speculations",
    "met my expectations",
    "Very well! Just what I had hoped for.",
    "It was slightly more work than I was expecting, but I also feel like I benefited a little less than I expected.",

    "aligned.",
    "Yes.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "All great! I surprisingly found the deadline pressure not a bad thing after all --it gets things done",
    "The strengths are the publication abilities. I think the social media aspects could be improved in order to increase the reach of YER. I also think that there could be more in class editing work.",
    "Strength: great class, flexible and engaging student team leading the class. Weakness: I wish we had learned about each other's articles a little bit earlier in the semester. I discovered that someone had written about similar topics as I did and it would have been great if I could have connected with her to discuss our ideas together.",
    "The only improvement I'd suggest is a slightly more systematic editing process, where the editors are reinforcing general principles of good writing in their comments. Having them say things like \"The way you use numbers here may confuse readers\" or \"Your word choice should be more precise\" could help writers internalize advice, rather than sort of revising ad hoc without taking away lessons about how to write better.",
    "The course is very organized and provides different tools to help\/guide our writing (writing exercises, online guidelines, guest speakers, etc). I really like that the instructors encourage us to visit writing tutors within Yale.",
    "-STRENGTH: The different speakers that came to class, the many editing rounds that allowed the writer to get feedback from different people.",
    "For a 1 credit course it is a lot of hard work. More credits needs to be assigned to this course.",
    "The class required many drafts before a final draft, which gave me the time to edit my article appropriately and feel proud of my work. There weren't many classes, but we had guest speakers any time there was a class. The guest speakers were all very interesting and useful for people pursuing science journalism, but I would have liked to haven taken some classes to talk about our own articles to each other.",
    "Strengths: practice writing and it looks good on your resume. Weaknesses: editing process is a little disorganized, with different editors having different opinions on the same piece which ends up being confusing. Workload was more than 1 credit worth.",
    "the meetings weren't useful for developing writing skills, but it was good to hear from other professors or professional writers.",
    "The course is a great opportunity to write and be published! Im excited to see how the new leadership team changes the format. I especially appreciate how open they are to feedback and evolution.",
    "I really thought that the course was highly efficient in the delivery of its content."

   "comments": [
    "Consider dedicating 2-3 hours for this course",
    "It can be a lot of work depending on the effort you put in to your pieces, but the result is rewarding and you learn a lot in the process.",
    "It is an amazing class to take if you are interested in learning about science communication and cutting edge research.",
    "Really engage with the editing process-- that's where the learning happens.",
    "Since I didn't have extensive writing experience and my native language isn't English, it took me a lot of time to finish my drafts. Yet, I highly recommend the course as it a great way to improve your writing skills and to learn from other writers (editors and guest speakers).",
    "Read some of the articles that YER has published as you work on your articles",
    "A great class to improve your writing, learn about new scientific findings that are of interest to you, and contribute to an exciting, growing online publication!",
    "Expect more work than it seems like it should be.",
    "the quality of feedback from editors varied greatly.",
    "Be ready to spend a bunch of time writing and editing. The more time you put in, the more youll get out of it and the prouder youll be of the published result.",
    "Read the handbook and all of the materials. Come to class with questions prepared and take the chance to get to know your fellow students. It goes fast!"
