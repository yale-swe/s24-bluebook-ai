   "comments": [
    "Great class to take if your interested in international relations. Provides a good alternative view of global politics separate from realism.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the material. otherwise the reading may be too much.",
    "It is a good survey course and covers interesting material.",
    "I highly recommend this class for anyone interested in international affairs and how international organizations function. The first part of the class discusses many theories of international organizations while the rest of the class deals with more specific examples (IMF, UN, etc). In the end, you are asked to apply these theories to actually organizations, helping to cement your understanding of both. The class has two exams (for both you are given a study guide that has all possible IDs and essay questions - take advantage of this!) and an essay. Professor Hyde is extremely helpful and the class in general was very worthwhile.",
    "Ofcourse a must.",
    "PLSC 156 is a pretty standard lecture class. It is very straight-forward and Prof. Hyde does a good job presenting the material. If you take advantage of the study guide there will be no surprises on the midterm or final.",
    "It's a well-organized, interesting course. It's a reasonable amount of work. And the professor is friendly. I recommend this course.",
    "YES! I loved this course! It learned a lot about international relations theory and Professor Hyde even delved into the current conflicts in Libya and Egypt. The readings were great (although a lot at times) and the exams were straightforward and easy.",
    "Recommend, with reservations. Interesting material, although more theory than expected. Would have liked to spend just a month on the theory of IOs and the rest on case studies like the UN, IMF, etc., rather than 1\/2 and 1\/2. Really liked the op-ed assignment, and midterm and final were fair. It was great to have the questions beforehand - emphasized the learning aspect rather than just regurgitating information. Thought it would be a lecture class but because there were only about 15 of us, Prof. Hyde turned it into a seminar class and class participation became a component of the grade.",
    "If you are willing to do all the readings and participate in class discussions, this class will be very easy for you because Professor Hyde gives a study guide with everything that could possibly come on her exams. If you know everything on the study guides you are guaranteed to do well- which makes the class quite easy. I was disappointed that I did not learn more specifics on the workings of International organisations though and I found the class boring. Only take this class if you have a genuine interest in international relations theory."
