    "Recommended if you are interested and okay with taking a hard class. If you are looking for an easy science credit, this is not the way to get it. If you are looking for a great class at Yale, this is.",
    "160 is a great introduction to the field of neuroscience. As a psych\/neuro major, I absolutely loved this class. It went over tons of material, but I felt that every lecture I was learning so much about the brain and its inner workings. However, I know that the interesting subject matter and an SC credit have attracted many students that didn't handle the course material well. The exams were entirely free-response questions, so the regurgitation necessary to get full points had to be extremely detailed. Also, McCarthy uses a lot of jargon in his lectures, which at the beginning of the term can throw students off of what he's saying. Many times, I would have to wikipedia a concept to figure out how it fit into the lecture. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this class to people who wish to really work. You definitely get what you put in, so if you're willing to study the material excessively, you'll come out of the course with a very solid knowledge of neuroanatomy, seminal discoveries in the field of neuroscience, and the interlinking of the brain itself with psychology as a whole.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you want to learn more about the function of the brain and just see some cool case studies. But be warned this class is not easy and there is a lot of memorization for the exams",
    "Be prepared to memorize a lot of details for this class. If you are interested in learning more about the brain, you definitely will in this class. There are lots of different topics if one doesn't spark your interest.",
    "The class talks about the anatomy\/cognitive functions of the brain, and related methodologies \/conventions of neuroscience. There's not much mandatory work throughout the semester, just a one-paragraph reading response due every week. But if you don't constantly preview\/review the lectures and leave everything till before the exams, as was my case, the lectures would be hard to follow and you will have a very very hard time studying for the exams! I've never studied so hard for any other exam in my entire life. I took this class because I needed a science credit but a) didn't want to waste my tuition on a gut b)wanted to explore something that genuinely interests me. The cost (energy & grade-wise) turned out to be a little too high as I came in with little preparation in biology\/chemistry. But still, I don't regret taking it in retrospect now that I have a fairly clear picture of how the brain works. So take it for a science credit if you're at least decent in bio\/chem and\/or you're willing to put in a huge amount of time memorizing brain structures\/functions\/illnesses\/experiments. Otherwise, take it Cr\/D, which could yield a much more fun experience.",
    "PSYC 160 is a lot of memorization. With that said, if you're not taking it to fill a major requirement or to get a distributional requirement (I wouldn't recommend taking this course for a Sc anyway), you should definitely consider taking it Credit\/D\/Fail. It's a great course, it's just quite difficult.",
    "This was a great class. Professor McCarthy is a very engaging lecturer, and lectures are very enjoyable to attend. The human brain is a very interesting subject matter, one in which a lot is known but so much more is unknown. There is a lot of material to study for tests, but other than that the class is pretty low key.",
    "Despite how intense this course is, you may really grow to love and appreciate the material (the way I did). I would recommend it!",
    "Solid intro-level Psychology class with an emphasis on brain function\/localization and neurobiology - though keep in mind that the course still has a strong \"introductory\" feel to it, in that many very large topics are only discussed superficially, and that much of the course feels like a list of brain regions, functions, associations, etc. to memorize. Exams are fair, though, a lot of the material is very interesting and I would definitely recommend to anybody interested in going into Psychology or Neuroscience, or anyone with a healthy interest in the different parts of the brain and some of the biological mechanisms of how our senses and perceptions work. Also, very little work outside of studying for exams, which take a good amount of time to study for - all you have to do are short weekly reading responses.",
    "A class for individuals with science background and who want a more in depth understanding of a certain field in science and not just random broad strokes. It is definitely not an easy class, there is a lot of information and it can get dry sometimes. Nonetheless, it has its interesting moments too but the midterms and finals are something one has to study for. If you do study for it, you should be fine though.",
    "Literally so much memorization. I took it credit\/D, and I'm really scared I might get a D. Readings are not much work, but there definitely is a lot of cramming right before tests. Tests were very detail-oriented, rather than deduction\/logic.",
    "very detail-oriented, a lot of material",
    "This is a very good class if you are interested in psychology and the human brain at all. However, there is a lot of information, so studying for exams take a real amount of time. However, if you are willing to put in the work required and you enjoy the subject, this is a perfect, almost must-take class for you. Weekly work is mainly just readings that you don't really have to do, but definitely help with the overall learning experience.",
    "I would recommend this class ONLY to biology majors or other individuals with a reasonably strong biology background. This course being registered in the PSYC department is misleading - as a pre-med biology major, trust me when I say that you will need a good deal of biology background to do well in this course. The pace of this class is fairly rapid and you will be expected to already know a good deal of conceptual information. If you are not comfortable with basic cell biology, you will probably not be comfortable with a good number of topics in this class. This is pretty well-reflected in the midterm averages, which were about 70%. From my perspective, however, these exams were truly not conceptually difficulty or particularly challenging - with a good biology background, good notes from lecture, and perhaps a little reading of the textbook, any student should be able to do well in this course. The course presented an interesting diversity of topics related to the normal and abnormal function of the brain, as well as more socially-related neurobiology.",
    "This class is hard, no doubt about it. While the actual work is comparable to other classes (weekly reading responses, two midterms and one final), the material is extremely difficult. The human brain is complicated, and you will need to know details--a general sweep or summary of the material will not suffice. That said, reading the textbook is not nearly as helpful as the notes that Professor M provides before each exam. These notes are a summary of important points he makes during lecture. To study, I suggest using those, and supplementing points of confusion from the textbook--but don't spend all your time reading the textbook. It is very dry, and often not very helpful. I learned a lot from this class. I took it for my major and a science credit, and because I was interested in how the brain works. Take it, but be prepared to work very hard. It was the hardest class I have taken yet at Yale.",
    "If you do not enjoy science, then you may want to be cautious about this course. It is initially quite science heavy. Nonetheless, you'll probably grow to love it in the end. I would recommend it -- as long as you're mentally prepared for a challenge.",
    "Yes, but only if you're willing to put in the work. If you're looking for just a science credit, don't take it. But you're actually interested in learning about the brain and have an introduction to neuroscience, you will have a blast. There are around 60 power point slides per lecture, so each lecture teaches a lot of information. If you let that pile up before your midterm, you will definitely regret it. Plus, the information is interesting (it can pertain to you!), don't feel afraid to study a little bit every day\/reviewing after lecture. McCarthy is an awesome professor (though his voice might be a bit monotonous sometimes...add that to 2:30PM post-lunch food-coma and Davies, staying awake can get tough.) Again, definitely one of my favorite courses this semester and it directed me towards picking my major.",
    "It was a great introduction to neuroscience and the material, while sometimes detailed and complex, is fascinating. Definitely makes me want to take more neuroscience classes!",
    "Not the most engaging class and definitely a lot to study.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, except if you don't need it for your major you should take it Credit D because the exams can get a bit rough. Very interesting course, and Professor McCarthy is a very good lecturer, but lectures are very dense. He also offers weekly review sessions, and makes study guides for each lecture. It's clear that he really cares about this course. Also, go to TA office hours instead of review sessions, because it can help to hear different explanations then the ones presented in lecture. Don't worry about studying the readings, but study the lectures\/study guides as often as possible, just so that all of the information isn't so daunting once the exam comes.",
    "PSYC 160 is required for the neuroscience track in psychology. If you're pursuing that track, you'll probably really enjoy this class and learn a lot. For other students, I would think carefully before taking this class, because though Professor McCarthy says it's accessible to non-science majors, the concepts can be really complicated, and lectures themselves can be dry and hard-to-follow. Still, this class is a great introduction to the human brain, so I recommend it to students who are curious about neuroscience and who want a more scientific approach to psychological concepts.",
    "A great introduction to how the brain works, especially its functional anatomy. I enjoyed the material of all the lectures, especially the ones toward the middle and end of the class. The lectures along with their notes are posted online, which made the class a lot easier to study for. Weekly reading responses, but the readings are usually short, about 5-10 pages, and graded by pass\/fail. Great course.",
    "It is a good class and necessary for the psych neuroscience major. However, I hear there may be some more interesting Brain classes. I didn't like the first third of the class. However, the last two thirds are very interesting. Try to review the outlines after and before lecture.",
    "This class covers a great deal of material. You cannot get behind. But if you stay on top of things, go to lecture, and learn the information, you will be fine.",
    "I took this class as a science credit (not a science or psyc major) and though it was much more difficult than it seemed from first lectures and reviews, I'm glad that I took it. For a humanities or social sciences major, this course brings in a lot of ideas from philosophy, economics, law and etc. and presents them in a pretty interesting way. Definitely NOT A GUT, don't take it unless you're willing to work (that should turn some seniors away).",
    "This is a great course, but you have to be willing to put in work outside of lecture. The workload can be deceivingly low: although the only assigned work was readings and responses, the tests cover A LOT of material so you end up spending a lot of time in preparation. The course starts out with a lot of dull anatomical stuff, but it's worth it for later in the semester when that really provides the basis for understanding some really interesting (and occasionally mind-blowing) material. I definitely recommend this to anyone strongly interested in psychology or even just in learning a different way to view the world. Neuroscience offers many bridges to discussions in the realm of philosophy, economics, language\u2013 really anything that involves people. If you're willing to put in the time, there's a lot you can get out of this class.",
    "Take it but be prepared to work quite a bit. It would help if you have interest in neuroscience.",
    "NOT A GUT.",
    "This is a legit but manageable class, and the material can be really cool (although the anatomy details can get a bit dry). Not a shabby way to get a science credit. There's no prereq, but I was glad I had taken other psych courses. Also, Professor McCarthy did weekly review sessions, which was extremely generous of him. If he keeps doing this you should GO TO THEM, they are super helpful.",
    "Do NOT take this class if you are a) a senior; b) a non-science major; and c) highly organized person who can set aside time every week to go over the slides and make sure that you're making good progress. If you're looking for an easy Sc credit, YOU WILL REGRET TAKING THIS CLASS. The course material is interesting enough and the lecturer is a good speaker and highly accomplished in his field, but the amount of material is simply IMMENSE. There's 100+ slides chock full of information in EVERY SINGLE LECTURE. The professor speaks like a machine gun. You will be tested on extremely detailed conceptual points that will require you to know not only the concept itself, but also the experimental process of obtaining the result. Half the class are pre-meds and the other half are C\/D\/Fs who eventually learn not to give a shit, so decide accordingly.",
    "I took it for my major and interests but I would recommend t regardless just because it can be both personally and professionally valuable to anyone. You'll also enjoy yourself despite how dense the material may be.",
    "A lot of reading and work but very rewarding.",
    "Overall, if you are a medical-school\/natural sciences oriented person, take it, otherwise, it is still a good course but probably not your best bet, because it is a tough course for an intro course and the tests go in a lot of small details that you have to memorize.",
    "It's a difficult course, but very interesting. Ideal for people who want to have a pretty thorough understanding of foundational concepts in neuroscience. Not so much for people looking for a gut science credit.",
    "This class is crazy hard. Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "I think a lot of people took this course for the Sc credit because they thought, \"Oh, it's a psych course; how hard can it be?\" The answer? Very hard. By the end of this course, you'll know more about the brain than you'll ever need to know (unless, like me, you're planning on studying neuroscience, in which case this is only the beginning). Lectures are chock-full of information, so skipping isn't the best idea. He does post the slides and right before each midterm, he posts notes on each lecture, but I definitely wouldn't recommend relying on that to get all the information you need. If you go to lecture, go to his review sessions, and talk to your TA if you have any questions, you should be fine. Just don't expect it to be a gut in any sense of the word.",
    "This class is so cool, and you come out of it really knowing material, really having learned. It's a lot of work though, even just to keep up, but especially if you aim to do well in the class. The week-to-week assignments aren't bad, but preparing for tests is killer. If you're willing to put in the time, I highly recommend this. It's really worth it.",
    "PSYC 160 is a great class about the human brain. I would recommend it if you are at all interested in the topic, but also willing to put in a lot of work for preparing for the midterms.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in this material and want to study a lot for the midterms",
    "This was a very good class that covered a wide range of topics related to the human brain. There is a lot of information covered in each lecture so you have to be quick about taking notes - sometimes I'd be distracted for a few seconds, then would look up and realize five slides had already gone by. There is so much covered in lecture but it is all very good, especially if you are already interested in the brain. Tests are fair and are entirely on material from lecture, but you'll have to know very specific parts of the brain and what they do. Learn the anatomy early on to make it easier on yourself. If you want to learn about the brain this is a great introductory class, I definitely recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you are at all interested in Neuroscience. You will learn a lot during the semester. It requires a lot of studying if you want to do well on the exams, but the good thing about these exams is that they ask questions only regarding concepts covered in lecture. Therefore, the book readings are not required. They might help you understand some concepts better. In addition to the two midterms, there are weekly reading responses, which are not hard.",
    "I ultimately withdrew from the course. Strength - interesting stuff, great professor Weakness - waaaay too fast, virtually no reference material outside of lecture and review sessions, so when you get behind or don't get something, it's tough to catch up. Basically if you don't get something, you're one out is to get a TA or the professor to reexplain things to you. The internet is useless for this class, in that it doesn't cover the topics. The book is useless for this class, in that it covers waaaay too much. The powerpoints are useless for this class, in that they aren't thorough enough.",
    "This class was difficult, and missing the first few readings snowballed into me having to withdraw from the course. I didn't take it seriously enough at the onset, even though I had heard that it was harder than PSYC 120 (Intro to the Human Brain). Looking back, I should have taken more initiative at the beginning, so my doing poorly in this course was certainly my fault. As long as you keep up with the readings and stay awake during lecture, you should be fine.",
    "If you are just doing this for the science credit, do not take this course. It is actually very challenging. It is a fair class - you must not only attend lecture, but actually play very close attention because the professor moves very quickly from one thing to another. Take it only if you're actually interested in the brain.",
    "Yes if you really want to understand neurology, but don't expect it to be easy. Take credit d fail if you can",
    "I didn't believe the reviews of last year's PSYC 160 that said there was way too much material to learn and that I should start studying for exams very very early, but that is absolutely true. Most of the material is interesting, but there's just too much of it to learn. It's almost impossible to pay attention for an entire lecture, which makes learning a bit difficult. Reading responses are fairly standard, but the exams are killer.",
    "An amazing course, psyc 160 provides a broad yet comprehensive coverage of neuroanatomy. It is much more like a biology class than a psych class which is good or bad depending on your interests, but if you want to learn about how the brain works on a functional systems level definitely take it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have to take it because you really want to do the neuroscience track of the psych major. The lectures are really dry and disorganized, the subject matter is tedious and full of case studies with many details irrelevant to the important info you need to learn about the brain. If you're looking to take a class that teaches you about the and have little to no knowledge about it, take Intro to the Human Brain with Amy Arnsten instead. It's way better taught, the TAs (and their sections) are great, and you will come away with a much better base understanding of how the brain works.",
    "THIS CLASS IS EXTREMELY HARD AND DIFFICULT AND REQUIRES A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE A STONG NEUROSCIENCE BACKGROUND.",
    "Don't be fooled, this is an extremely difficult class with A TON of information. You have to be extremely dedicated and put in a lot of extra time to have a decent grade.",
    "Good science credit. Interesting material. Not a gut.",
    "A HARD neuroscience class. Don't think of it as intro, think of it as all-inclusive because there's a ton of material and you'll be expected to remember tiny details on the exams. It's an exciting and fascinating course, but if your GPA matters don't take it unless you have to. Also maybe study each week post the two lectures rather than cramming. Prof McCarthy's notes on each lecture are all you need to study for the exams. Make notes on there of things you don't know then look them up. But don't try to go through all the notes without looking at the overviews, you'll end up spending time on things that don't matter.",
    "PSYC 160 is one of the core classes for the Neuroscience track of the Psych major, although there aren't any prereqs, and students from other majors could definitely enjoy it too. If you've taken PSYC 120 (Intro to the Human Brain, taught by Amy Arnsten), this covers some overlapping material but definitely builds on it. The class gave a very comprehensive overview of major neurological functions, as well as some history of the development of current theories about the brain, and methods used to studied it; we learned about sensory systems, stress, decision-making, language, split-brain patients, other neurological disorders, and more. Professor McCarthy is amazingly knowledgeable and is a great lecturer. He's also incredibly dedicated to the course, holds weekly review sessions, and is really committed to including up-to-date research and interesting case studies in his lectures.",
    "If you love science, and you love psychology, it's perfect for you. The tests and style of the class are very reminiscent of Intro Psych. Be prepared to pay full attention in lecture. I did not find the book readings to be necessary to succeed at all.",
    "This is not an easy course. Some of the terms are very complex and there is a lot of memorization. Despite this it is a very interesting course, particularly if you are considering the psych neuroscience track.",
    "Yes, IF you are willing to do a lot of work. I remember reading these and seeing oh, it's easy... It is NOT. You have to stay up to date. Review as often as you can. It is doable, but one has to stay on top of it. Incredibly interesting material, though.",
    "This is a great intro course, but it isn't for the faint of heart. Sometimes, material is really dense, especially if you don't have a biology background. I know students who didn't have that background that still succeeded, though. This course also gave me a lot of perspective on human nature through understanding the functions and limitations of the brain.",
    "The Human Brain was a great introduction to major topics in neuroscience such as language, memory, and decision-making. It was also more different from Professor Arnsten's Introduction to the Human Brain than I expected. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about how the brain works.",
    "I took this course as a non-science major looking for an interesting, \"real\" science credit. Human Brain ended up being the bane of my semester. Lectures were disorganized and hard to follow; the material wasn't presented in a way that was useful in terms of exam preparation.",
    "This is not a psychology course. This is a biology course. Very science and anatomy oriented and actual psychology is subservient. I wouldn't take this course if you're into social psych and not brain science. Very difficult.",
    "If you are interested in the very technical sides of brain activity--down to ligand-gated channels--you will enjoy the class. If your psychological interests are more based in emotion and motivation, it might not be for you. Also, the lecture was long and it was often hard to pay attention after over an hour. Exams were hard and required significant studying.",
    "A great course for anyone who is interested in the brain. The lectures can be a bit information heavy, and the tests are certainly not easy, but they are also largely fact based and don't require a ton of critical thinking, meaning if you study enough they should be manageable. Other than the tests, the course requires very little weekly work, usually just reading a short paper and writing a paragraph long response to it. If you find the brain interesting, this class will be fascinating. Professor McCarthy is a very good lecturer, clear and interesting, and even funny every once and a while. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I took this course after taking CGSC 110 (intro to cogsci with brian scholl). PSYC 160 covers so much more detail. The sheer amount of material covered in only two or three lectures is similar to the amount of material you would have to know for a midterm in CGSC 110. It's not easy, and it's a lot of memorizing. However, by the end of each midterm, and especially by the end of the final, regardless of whether you were passionate about the material or not (i became less interested in neuroscience than the initial intrigue sparked by CGSC 110), you will feel that you have an impressive command over the science of the brain. Even though this course probably changed my mind about pursuing neuroscience (i'm now more interested in comp sci), I don't regret taking it. It is a real primer of REAL neuroscience, and will orient a student with the field and its difficulties. You will get a better sense of whether you want to pursue the often-ambiguous and frustrating, but inspiring and essential, science of the brain and mind. McCarthy's notes and lecture slides are extremely thorough. To be honest, I stopped going to lecture after the first midterm and still did well. I did have to study a LOT from the lectures. The reason I stopped going was that McCarthy's lectures moved too fast for me (and I think this is true for many people). By the 15th minute, I would already be left in the dust and it would continue to be confusing thereafter. So, I instead studied the material on my own, using his lecture slides, lecture notes, and google. I scored better than the 30th percentile on both midterms; I don't know about the final yet. I expect a safe A- or a low A. I wish that the TFs were involved more. Really didnt use that resource at all. No section provided, which could have been helpful, to discuss each week's lectures and clarify ideas.",
    "\"The Human Brain\" should not be confused with Amy Arnsten's \"Introduction to the Human Brain.\" This one is an extremely challenging and comprehensive class. If you're a non-science major (or someone with very little biology background), I would advise you not to take the class unless you're up to put in a ton of work. But if you are willing to put in the time, this class teaches you an extraordinary amount of interesting stuff. Its rigorous exams and rich material forced me to learn more than I've ever learned before in a single semester. Professor McCarthy is brilliant, accommodating, and puts lots of energy into teaching this course well. The exams are hard because there's so much material, but, if you're the type of person who's willing to put time into learning it, you'll take a lot away. And Prof. McCarthy will help you at every step.",
    "As a CogSci major, it fulfills the neuroscience req and also if you want to be on the neurosci track of psych, this is a also a required class. If you're interested in in neuroscience, yes. If you're looking for an easy science credit, no.",
    "The material in Psyc 160 is very interesting and Professor McCarthy is a clear and helpful lecturer (he holds 2.5 hours' worth of office hours a week and puts notes online), but the class comes at a price. There are weekly reading responses in addition to two midterms that require a huge amount of studying. None of the material is conceptually difficult; it's just hundreds of slides' worth of memorization, but it takes a lot of time to learn all of it for the tests. If you're really interested in neuroscience or psychology, take it. If you're just looking for a science credit, I'd look elsewhere unless you're willing to work very hard and not feel especially fulfilled.",
    "Solid course. McCarthy is a funny lecturer and makes things interesting. I loved learning about all the different psych disorders caused by lesions to the brain. I did NOT love neuroanatomy, but you really need to get comfortable with that fast. Also exams are no joke, they're very thorough and sometimes ask for the smallest of details. That said, we got really helpful study guides for them. I'd recommend taking the course and forming a study group ASAP.",
    "Necessary evil, take it with friends.",
    "Great class. McCarthy rules.",
    "A very interesting course, because it goes through so many different topics, and how our brains process a variety of tasks and experiences, from language to stress to pain. Prof McCarthy does a good job of integrating different perspectives, both in his lectures and in the articles or papers we read for our reading responses. Keeping up with the material is essential, because there is so much, but it is doable if you gradually build up your familiarity with the material. The exams are short answer questions, and range from asking specifics, ie brain regions associated with certain processes, to asking you to integrate knowledge, especially on the final. Overall, a fascinating yet challenging course.",
    "The human brain is definitely a class that should only be taken by people who show a great interest in the structure and function of the brain. It requires a lot of memorization and is overall in the lectures and readings often times pretty dense. Still, after taking the class I feel like I have learned a lot and since I am premed I think it is definitely worth it.",
    "This is an interesting class if you are interested in the human brain, but it is very challenging so be prepared for that.",
    "Really don't take this class if you are not a science person or have zero interest in the brain. If you have interest then that's all you need but if not you will most likely hate it.",
    "The course covers a lot of information and localizes almost all the information you are expected to know in lectures. However, lectures can be boring at times or, even when engaging, difficult to follow, understand, or take notes on. The class was billed this past semester as a course for science and non-science majors alike\u2014I tend to disagree. It is a prerequisite for my major, and even I struggled with it at times. It's worth taking if you have to, but I didn't feel as though it was a positively life changing experience.",
    "Lots and lots of memorization, but it is fascinating and so worth it. If you start studying early and work hard, you will do well. I'm an English major who also dropped this class because I was scared it would be too hard, but I ended up with an A by working really hard! It was amazing--so fascinating and applicable to disparate realms of life\/experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Psyc 160 to another student. The class was incredibly interesting and engaging and Professor McCarthy is the best professor I have had at Yale. Take this class!! The material is very relevant and the workload is manageable.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student who would be using it for the same purpose I did, i.e. to fulfill a distributional requirement. The course would be helpful for people interested in the field as a possible major, but might be unnecessarily difficult as a course taken for a distributional requirement or for fun.",
    "If you want to look at the brain, you'll have to take this anyway, and it won't kill you like some other courses will. So go right on ahead.",
    "Great class if you're interested in the topic; a lot of content, but its presented rather manageably",
    "I recommend this course only if you are interested in neuropsych specifically. As a student more interested in the social aspects of psych, this class was very painful. And wait to take this course until the class changes to 3 50min lectures. Over an hour is way too long for way too much info.",
    "This class is a lot of work. On a weekly basis, it really will not feel like it, as there are only reading responses (mandatory), and readings (which honestly can be skipped), however there is so much material. Do not let the seemingly light load fool you into thinking this is an easy course. There is so much material presented and all of it needs to be committed to memory for the exams (2 midterms, one final). However, if you take it, the material cannot be beat, Prof McCarthy is a great lecturer and super interesting, and this proved to be simultaneously my hardest and most enjoyable course all semester. Be prepared though that the 2:30-3:45 time slot in Davies is killer (prime nap time) and many that I spoke to had troubles staying awake. Come prepared with gum\/water\/snacks to stay awake. You don't want to miss any of the material and honestly, you can't really afford to.",
    "The Human Brain is a class about the functional neuro-anatomy of the brain. It is meant to be accessible to all students, not just science majors, but if you don't have much experience reading scientific writing or interpreting scientific language, you might struggle a bit at first. If you think you're up to it, though, I would highly recommending this class -- the material is incredibly interesting, and cognitive science is as a whole is a really, really cool field.",
