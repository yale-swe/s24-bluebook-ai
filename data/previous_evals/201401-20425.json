   "comments": [
    "Fine science credit, not too hard and not too science-y. Not a riveting lecture but also not the worst.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class - it's a general overview of human life history, but the material is relevant to all of us and gives a better understanding of how and why humans have evolved to modern populations. Prof. Bribiescas is a great lecturer and makes sure we have a good understanding of and interest in the material. One discussion question set per week, but no busy work aside from that.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. It is fascinating!",
    "Really wonderful course! It was my first anthro course, and I only wish I had taken it earlier so I could have taken more like it. Definitely a science credit that, even for non-science people (like myself), would be worth taking for its own sake. It provides a great introduction into fascinating topics in humans' evolutionary and life history, getting you to really think about why we are the way we are. It changes the way you look at a lot of things in the world.",
    "It's really approachable even as a science credit, and I found it incredibly eye-opening in terms of our interactions with each other and our environment - pretty much why we are the way we are.",
    "Good class for non-majors. Not a gut, but not too hard.",
    "Yes, it's a pretty easy science credit if you need one, and the material is pretty interesting.",
    "If you need a science credit take it, it's pretty east. A midterm, a final, and weekly discussion questions. If you go to section you basically know everything you need to. The section is equally important as the class. You also get a very good foundation in human evolutionary theory, covering topics such as aging, reproduction, and primate behaviour. The course work is manageable and a very good course overall. You learn a lot about the human body. And you also dont need to do all the readings, it just looks intimidating at first.",
    "Yes! Fun and really interesting. Take this course if you are interested in evolution or human biology. If you are looking a science credit without any work, this course may not be for you, though!",
    "It is a brief introduction to evolution, and a study of why people function the way they do considering large demographic data.",
    "This class is interesting in that it puts humanity in an evolutionary context. That being said, I felt that much of the methodology used in this subject area is frustratingly unrigorous. It was difficult to really care about the material because I thought a lot of it was just static.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in Biological Anthropology or who wants a chilled down biology course for a science credit. I didn't take it Credit D, but it would be a good class to take Credit D because there's only a midterm, a final, and discussion questions. There's no curve so if you bomb the midterm, you have to work your butt off to pass the final.",
    "Basically the class takes you through the life history of a human, from birth to death. It covers so much interesting information- something for everybody. Past reviews say that the midterm and final were ridiculously hard, but the TAs have adjusted the tests to be much more reasonable, so that shouldn't be a deterrent. That's another great thing- the TAs and the professor are all super reasonable and want you to do well. The workload isn't too heavy, but the readings are pretty dull and hard to get through. I do believe the TAs have asked for feedback on the new textbook and are working to adjust the readings though, so that might be different next year. All in all, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, regardless of their major.",
    "ANTH 242 can be considered a mixture of the evolution concepts taught in BIO 104 and a discussion of various life history traits (birth rate, age of first child) that anthropologists use to study populations. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in how the study of evolution relates to the study of populations today. The Professor and T.A.s have done really interesting research and are always open to questions. The textbook can be dry but the required reading questions help solidify course concepts.",
    "A course with a broad scope, that gives great fundamental knowledge of human evolutionary biology and the ways that humans compare to other animals.",
    "Yes! Great way to get a good solid Science credit that isn't too hard, work-wise or on your GPA and teaches you things that are incredibly relevant to your life. I'm never able to focus well during lectures but these lectures were really interesting and kept me motivated to attend class and engage with the material throughout.",
    "Somewhat tough class, but decent enough if you do the readings. Attend section! It's all very interesting, actually, but it does cover quite a range of subjects. That said, it is an intro course, so the subject matter is really quite simple at the depth it is covered. Give it a shot for a non-gut science credit.",
    "Great class all around. Perfect for a non-science person looking for a Sc. Very interesting and very pertinent to being human. Why are we the way we are? How do we compare to our ancestors? How do we compare to other cultures? All from an evolutionary biology approach. Lectures are very interesting. Readings are dense but sections help a lot.",
    "Such an interesting class and a must for non-science majors wanting to get a science credit. I learnt so many new and interesting things in this class that I know I won't forget. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the development and reproduction of humans."
