    "I would recommend it, it's a important class to learn how to evaluate scientific literature",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. In addition to providing a good overview of bacterial pathogenesis, the class served as a great opportunity for building skills in critical reading of the literature, scientific discussion, and presentation.",
    "MBIO 686 is a great course for students who wish to learn fundamental aspects in microbiology.",
    "The class gives an overview of different bacterial determinants of pathogenesis and is comprised of lectures and paper discussions. I would recommend it to those interested in bacterial pathogenesis.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student. It's a great seminar that helps you read papers and question literature at the graduate level and above. Interacting with all the professors is great - the pace is very relaxed and informal enough so as to encourage questions by all students."

    "This course made me excited about the program!",
    "I benefited greatly from this course-- after taking it I feel I have a good understanding of the basis of bacterial pathogenesis. Although as a first year student I am not yet sure of my dissertation topic, I am sure that my future work will benefit from this class as I became aware of a number of useful techniques and familiarity with the literature, among other things.",
    "It provided a good overview of the different virulence determinants and will be helpful, given that I'm interested in bacterial pathogenesis.",
    "The course was particularly helpful for first year students to become more familiar with the research throughout the department. I know my research interests and my lab rotations were heavily influenced by the various professors and pertinent papers we read."
