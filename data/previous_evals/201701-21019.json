    "By the end - aside from some compound tenses which are fairly straightforward - you will know all the verb tenses in the Portuguese language (!!!). You will also learn a lot (depending on your current familiarity) about Brazilian culture. Lastly - which is critical - you learn how the language is truly spoken, i.e. differences across lusofone countries, commonly used expressions, and INTONATION.",
    "Learned how to speak Portuguese! Grammar, conversation, reading, writing.",
    "Knowledge: - of Brazilian culture: conceptions of race and ethnicity; issues related to gender; economics; politics; family; music; religion; and more. - of other Lusophone countries: independence movements in Africa (Mozambique, Angola) and related politics; Portugal's conquests. Skills: - (ordered by strength of skill) speaking, listening, writing, and reading in Portuguese. I think my language skills are at a point where I could safely tour Brazil alone and could succeed at a teacher's assistant role in a classroom setting. Insights: Race is thought of very differently in other parts of the world; one culture can be more\/less happy, more\/less honest, etc., than another culture.",
    "I furthered my knowledge in Portuguese a lot in the second semester level of Portuguese. From learning verb tenses and grammar to learning more about the history and culture of Brazil, it was an illuminating course that advanced my knowledge and fluency in Portuguese greatly."

    "So many strengths! We covered all verb tenses; built up vocabulary; had fun listening to Brazilian music, and in doing so bettering our understanding of both the sounds of the language and its usages not covered in the textbook; and much more! Nothing was particularly lacking about it, I felt.",
    "This course was lovely. We used texts, reading, and conversation to learn grammar, fluency, and vocab. A GREAT class.",
    "Strengths: Marina Adrade is fabulous, as I'll expand on in my instructor review; unfortunately, Yale doesn't have her or Fabi anymore. The course teaches Brazilian culture really well, which is fascinating. There is an emphasis on conversational skills, which is what a student should want to get out of a course like this. Weaknesses and Improvements: My section was rather large; a smaller class size would have been better. Some students aren't all that thrilled to be there and simply look to fulfill a requirement. Homework came and went - sometimes there was a fair amount, but we went some weeks without any."

    "Awww helllll yeah! Why? Firstly, while this is a language class, you will learn a ton about Brazil, as well as a bit about other lusofone countries. Brazil is a complex and fascinating place - at once struggling with deep economic inequality, political instability, and corruption; but also home to an incredibly unique and diverse culture, driven by the \"jetinho,\" of its people, which you will learn about. Secondly, if you like learning languages, Portuguese is a fascinating one. Knowing Spanish is more often than not an advantage, though in some instances it is hard to shake as you try to learn Portuguese. However, part of what is really cool about the language is its unique sounds, which don't exist in either English or Spanish. One can easily get by without learning to use these sounds correctly, simply learning spelling, grammar etc., but getting it to sound right is one of the most fun parts!",
    "absolutely",
    "I would! Portuguese is a great, fun, vibrant language to learn! Not hard if you are familiar with romance languages!",
    "An easy A and fulfillment of the language req. L2 was not harder than L1 this year. Make sure the professor is good; the two best professors (Marina and Fabi) just left. If you're interested in Brazilian culture and want to do serious travelling in Lusophone coutries, then take it. If you like a structured schedule where you can count on a good time every ~10:30 in the morning, then take it. If you have an otherwise heavy load and want a \"safe gut\" (definitely easy grades, definitely low work, pretty interesting), then take it. If you don't want to put in any effort at all, then don't ruin it for the rest of us. Important note: it's hard to overstate the importance of attendance. Sure, miss every now and then. But coming to every class is a sure-fire way to garauntee an A. You'll also get a lot more out of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking Portuguese and gaining greater fluency in Portuguese, or who is interested in Brazil and the rest of the Portuguese speaking world."
