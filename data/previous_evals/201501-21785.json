   "comments": [
    "Philosophy second semester is a bit more frustrating than first semester - the question shifts so that instead of asking large questions about how life should be lived, a lot of the texts are about skepticism and idealism. Still, it was definitely worth sticking it out!",
    "Good intro to philosophy, but not as fun as first semester of DS philosophy.",
    "Second semester philosophy was not my favorite. While first semester seemed to offer multiple contrasting personal \"philosophies,\" which gave each philosopher an importance and weight in his own right. Second semester is all building off Descartes' search for truth. It gets increasingly hard to read and increasingly irrelevant to any daily application (until the syllabus hits Mill and Nietzsche). The arguments are also a lot less easily outlined in a Step 1,2,3 fashion (or maybe that was just my section with Brenzel, who took a less \"Let's outline the arguments and see where our issues are\" approach and more of a \"Let's talk about the grand illusive cloud of philosophy\"). Lectures become crucial, along with Stanford Online Encyclopedia of Philosophy.",
    "Yes, especially if you're not interested in philosophy.",
    "This is the best out of all the DS courses. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it. If you put in the time and effort to struggle with these texts, you'll be rewarded.",
    "The philosophy class as part of the Directed Studies curriculum is a broad survey of later philosophy works from the Western Canon. There is a focus on themes like certainty, causation, and the proof of the existence of God. The professors and lecturers do a good job of connecting this part of the tradition to the works we studied last semester to see how more modern philosophers rethought or built upon the ideas before them. I would recommend this class; if you've done DS first semester, the second semester will be more challenging but more interesting. What you learn second semester will not only introduce you to several more great thinkers but also reshape the way you think about those thinkers from first semester.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Professor Brenzel characterized DS philosophy as a \"high altitude\" survey of the ideas of philosophers from Descartes to Wittgenstein. He encourages a charitable approach to these thinkers in which the student inhabits the mind, \"the thought world,\" of each philosopher. This was, in my experience, the best approach to understanding philosophy. It makes the ideas personal and more understandable than simply reading and discussing the texts with a contemporary critical lens. A critical approach is certainly useful, but the student should first understand the ideas in the way that philosopher wished to be understood. I am now seeking to pursue my education in philosophy and the human mind, and I have Professor Brenzel to thank for that."
