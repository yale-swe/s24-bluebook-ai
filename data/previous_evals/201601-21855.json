   "comments": [
    "This class is, as everyone warned me, NOT a gut. But it is an amazing class to take if you have any interest in actually learning something from your mandatory Science credit (which you should!). Prof Belperron is super happy and eager to help (go to office hours!) and genuinely wants all her students to succeed. I really, really enjoyed this class and learned an immense amount. The quizzes and midterm are sometimes brutal but curved, and the final paper is surprisingly fun to write. This class made me feel like I'm a lot better at science than I actually am. If you're looking for a science credit and you're relatively serious about actually learning things during your time at Yale, take it.",
    "Not a gut science credit!! But if you want to use your science credit to actually learn something and aren't too tied up on the grade you might enjoy this course.",
    "MCDB 103 was an amazing course! It's definitely not easy, but it is completely worth the effort. In addition to learning an incredible amount about the biology of cancer, you will also learn to think critically about scientific papers and claims. I would highly recommend this course to anyone considering it!",
    "Absolutely. If you're a non-STEM major and you're looking for a class that is a balance of interesting and challenging without being an absurd amount of work, this is the class for you. It is not a gut, but it's also not going to kill you the way that I presume Bio 101 might.",
    "A difficult science course for non-science majors but since it is taught by an excellent professor and set up so that you can succeed if you put in the work (most of the grade is based on paper and a project), I would recommend it. Plus, it is really valuable to actually understand what cancer is and what you can do to prevent it - it makes you a much more informed reader and consumer",
    "Important, interesting material but very difficult",
    "This class was one of my favorite courses at Yale so far--really interesting material, good lectures, cool projects. Professor Belperron is great, she's super enthusiastic and easy to talk to, she makes the class a really comfortable space. The workload is pretty intense\/difficult when you have work, like for quizzes or the midterm and the final paper, but otherwise it's pretty standard and doable. Overall, completely would recommend this course!"
