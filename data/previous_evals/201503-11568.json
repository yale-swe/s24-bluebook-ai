   "comments": [
    "I think it can be a very good class for certain people but I don't believe it should be a pre-requisite for other art classes, which it currently is.",
    "I definitely recommend this course with Anna Betbeze. As an art major, I was trying to put off this intro course, but I can say with confidence that you will learn so much about experimentation and visual aesthetic. You experiment with video and there is so much freedom to explore different ideas. You also get to work in groups, which is something that doesn't happen often in art courses and you learn from your class. It's mandatory for art majors, but you should definitely take it with Anna!",
    "Visual Thinking is a beautiful course. I learned loads, and it very much lent itself to exploration and discovery in multiple spheres beyond the expected, directed, or orchestrated. I would absolutely recommend this course! (It is important to note, however, that not all students take the curriculum entirely seriously, and although they think they can BS their way through an \"easy\" art course, it doesn't go unnoticed.)",
    "If Anna is teaching it, definitely take Visual Thinking! Her version of the class will have you going, \"What the heck is going on?\" for the first couple weeks, but once you suspend your disbelief and set aside your preconceived ideas about art making, you'll find that the class is one of the most exciting, engaging, crazy, revolutionary, and empowering experiences you can have here at Yale.",
    "Visual Thinking is meant to allow art majors to experiment with self-guided projects. It is not a self-study, in that it has specificity of project, yet otherwise it is a laissez-faire and democratically-run class. It is meant to be a balancing class for art majors who are simultaneously taking more directional and goal-oriented art classes, which I (I am not an art major) was not. I would recommend this course only to a student who knows that this is what he is looking for--an open-ended, free class of 'do X in whatever way you want' mentality. I was looking for an introductory art class that would teach me art skills and\/or understanding, neither of which I gained from this class. This type of teaching is not the goal of the class, and was therefore not the right fit for me.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think that overall it was a good introduction to art making and critiquing.",
    "This class was a great opportunity to delve into experimental art making through the use of different art mediums.",
    "This was an amazing class that totally changed the way I think about myself as an artist\/learner\/thinker! I would say the projects got much more interesting as the semester progressed.simple black and white paper collages seem a bit flat in comparison to weird multimedia videos with which we ended the course. This course can be taken by any student of any discipline and in fact I think this class is perfect for those who don't see themselves as particularly technically skilled. A diversity of experiences is the best thing to have in an experimental class such as this, especially with all the group work we did.",
    "ART 111, also called visual thinking, is a course that introduces you to the process of creative thinking. You complete a variety of multimedia projects that force you to consider the art making process in an unconventional way."
