    "Prof. Saiers covered an impressive amount of ground in one semester. This was a very good class.",
    "Great intro to groundwater and surface water hydrology.",
    "Overall, an excellent class. Very informative and I felt I really learned the material. Some more broad work, like learning when to apply what concepts in what situations in the field would have been helpful. Also, I would have really like to pick up more skills or better understanding of Matlab (as a transferable skill).",
    "Class should be taught every year. It is critical to people studying water resources.",
    "The course is not what I expected it to be. I don't feel as if I learned a great deal. Most of the homework assignments did not help me better understand\/apply the material covered in lecture. Instead, a significant amount of time was spent writing code for MATLAB (a program most students were expected to already be familiar with, but weren't). As a result, I spent more time trying to write MATLAB code than applying the concepts in an understandable way. I would have preferred to apply my knowledge using important calculations, conceptual ideas, etc. The material was also a bit basic, and could have included so many more important concepts in the field of hydrology.",
    "Dr. Saiers is a talented hydrologist but is a very transactional teacher. That is, he has the information and he tries to share it as though it was \"data\" and info to be imported by students. Course meetings moved along quickly and very few people asked questions, but many seemed to be struggling with the material. The hw assignments that featured MATLAB we great practice for MATLAB and learning how to model. For those whose first experience with MATLAB came in this class, like myself, there was an inordinate amount of time spent trying to learn the commands, and not as much time spent learning the concepts of hydrology. Not sure how to resolve this, as using a program is a great intro to the tools those in the industry use, but it took too much away from the concepts. Perhaps hosting a lab session or 2 dedicated specifically to MATLAB early in the semester if it is that important to learn."

    "Jim pacing around frantically in front of the room and cracking jokes. Also, learning the fundamentals of hydrology.",
    "Sort of refreshing to have a course with an almost purely technical focus. Use of MATLAB was nice. Jim is a funny guy and makes the subject matter interesting.",
    "The instuction",
    "It provides a solid scientific foundation in hydrology.",
    "Absolutely take this class. The workload is totally manageable, the problem sets and the exams are fair and you really feel like you learn a lot without ever feeling overwhelmed by the material. It also covered a lot of very useful information but at a very good pace.",
    "Lectures were fantastic and very informative.",
    "I really appreciated the practical focus on the class, and the connections between hydrology and its application to things like fracking and restoring the Everglades. Both Prof. Saiers and Jenn are really helpful and engaging, and make it possible to get through challenging (at least for non-quantitative students) material that I think has really complements pieces from FES's other water-focused classes.",
    "- clear presentation of concepts - great practice and exposure to problems",
    "Matlab!",
    "Jim is a good teacher . He is clear and communicates concepts effectively, with great enthusiasm.",
    "I liked that the course provided a solid introduction to hydrology without delving too much into the details of the derivations of the equations used. I feel like I have an understanding of when to use which equations and what the assumptions used are. I also really enjoyed learning Matlab (though that may put me in the minority).",

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "It's hard to prevent, but Jim missed at least three class sessions this semester. If this seems like it might happen, there should be some sort of contingency built in so that material is not glossed over or skipped entirely. I'm sure Jenn could have done a lecture in Jim's absence. I think a field trip would have been a valuable experience to have as part of this course.",
    "A field trip would be a fun way to deepen our understanding of some of the equations. The in-class problem set was a mess. Some people raced ahead and understood the problem quickly while others needed more time. There was no real check to make sure people got it.Even just posting answers online would help this. Also, we could use a basic Matlab crash course. We used Matlab so infrequently in class and with so little structure I feel like I don't really know how to use the program at all.",
    "I think the modeling portion of the course was really helpful. I would have liked a bit more instruction on matlab in general - many times I felt like I knew the material but had to teach myself matlab in order to have it portray results in the correct way. Perhaps some outside matlab tutorials for those of us who are not adept at modeling or a session in the library we could attend during the course.",
    "A lot of people felt stranded on some of the earlier MATLAB assignments, especially those without coding experience. It would have been useful to provide people with the general commands they might need. We talked a lot about monitoring equipment, which is useful to know. But I think it would have been even more useful to have looked at some of this stuff in-person on a field trip.",
    "It would be helpful if there are more opportunity to work for the problem solving exercise. I had never used Matlab and I devoted so many hours just for programming",
    "The problem sets did were not that helpful in exploring the concepts we discussed in class. The emphasis on MatLab in the problem sets was difficult for people with no prior MatLab experience. I often understood the concepts, but was unable come up with Matlab code to effectively solve the problem.",
    "The matlab component of the homework was sometimes frustrating enough to distract from what I was supposed to be absorbing...we didn't use it enough for it to become rote for me (having no coding experience and only Excel modeling experience), but enough to remind me every three weeks that it hadn't become rote for me.",
    "Help with the homework. Most of the time I was more hung up on MAtlab code than on the content of the problem.",
    "MatLab is a very valuable tool, but I do not feel at all confident with it, or that I have a very good sense of how an experienced practitioner could make use of it, despite 2-3 homework assignments focusing on it. I understand the desire to teach us to use the tool, but it felt like either more support and focus on MatLab should be offered, or more context as to how and when it's valuable should be given, and\/or its inclusion should be scaled back. During the homework assignments, I often felt like I was trying to apply or translate concepts I didn't yet fully understand into a language I didn't speak - it seemed (at least for me) that in trying to do both of these tasks, I got a less clear sense of the material and of the programming framework that might be applied around it.",
    "Class lectures missed should be made up.",
    "Often, homework assignments had errors in them which caused students some anguish in figuring out what was going on. More instruction in Matlab is also needed if the homework requires more advanced use of the software program.",
    "While learning about the fracking project was cool, it could have probably been covered in one lecture, with other \"easy\" lectures covering important developments in the field of hydrology, for example (I know you were giving us a break from the difficult lectures).",
    "Got too overwhelming at times. Lacked structure. And using Matlab was the worst part. There should have been tutorials for that.",
    "The emphasis on MATLAB. I understand it's a critical skill to learn, but if the professor wants to include it in the homework assignments, then it must be presented to the class in a more structured way (i.e. workshops, scheduled TA sessions, etc.). Otherwise, students are spending more time quickly learning MATLAB (and thus not retaining it) and not learning how to apply the concepts taught in lecture.",
    "I understand the reasoning behind not relying too much on Powerpoint for lectures, but when Jim wrote out equations, diagrams, etc., on the board he often made mistakes and had to go back and revise, making it really difficult and frustrating when we are all taking notes with pen and paper. In addition, it seemed like the timing of assignments could be planned better - there were some weeks when we had multiple assignments (exam, problem set, critical reviews, etc.) due at once.",
    "Over the course of the semester, 2 classes were cancelled, and 3 others seemed to be extemporaneous excursions into Dr. Saiers personal work. It was great to learn about specific applications of the concepts we were learning, but it lead to other concepts being more rushed. I would have liked more time spent on both groundwater and surface water. Either split the course into two course and go more indepth, or stick to the syllabus and give equal time to each. Cancelled classes are not fun.",
    "Integrating MatLab better should be a consideration for the time this class gets taught.",
    "I feel that a Matlab crash course could be organised for students without prior experience with Matlab, it was a very tedious process to pick up Matlab with just the demonstrations in class. Materials can be provided to improve the learning process."
