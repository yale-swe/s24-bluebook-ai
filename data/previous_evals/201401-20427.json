   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to students outside of the ANTH\/ARCH majors.",
    "I would recommend this class, it won't take up too much of your time and you will have a great time learning so much from Professor Weiss. It may be a little hard to grasp at first if you are not used to archeological terms, but with time it gets clearer.",
    "It's not a very rigorous class. I took it because I wanted to get to know archaeology a bit better and get some history perspective on environmental issues. It's incredibly unstructured and repetitive, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. Just know what you are getting yourself into. Climate changed caused societal collapses throughout history. The end.",
    "You'll learn about the relationship between climate chance and the collapse of various ancient societies. There's a lot of reading earlier in the semester, but it tapers off after the first couple weeks. The papers are reasonable in terms of length and subject requirements. I'd recommend it\u2014you'll learn a lot!",
    "I really enjoyed taking this course, and if you're looking for a humanities credit you should take this course. This class is basically about explaining why societies collapsed at different points throughout history. It presents a few of the different theories and Weiss tells us why each one is flawed. Weiss is one of the leading proponents of one of the theories to explain these collapses. Its really interesting to see this academic debate presented and then to hear one of the theories presented by the leading archeologist and leading proponent of one of the theories. Its was really interesting to get a first hand look at an academic debate, and have one of the leading theories presented by its author, Weiss.",
    "This was an interesting course, that you're either going to love or hate. I'm still not sure if I've decided which side I fall on."
