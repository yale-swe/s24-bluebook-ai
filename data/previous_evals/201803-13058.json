    "I became a much better reader and writer. My ability to locate problems in my work and to address them in revision improved significantly. I also feel like I finally began to develop a sense of taste and to be able to formulate interesting opinions about the poems I read.",
    "Much expanded view of poetic scene, of what poetry has been and what it can be. Development of fluid poetic voice. Less stalling, more engaging.",
    "I developed my writing process during the course of the semester. Having to write and edit on a weekly basis meant that I found a rhythm to writing that I have found difficult to achieve before. I think this tutorial also challenged me to experiment, and to take risks with my writing."

   "comments": [
    "The obvious strength of the course is the opportunity to work one-on-one with someone you respect and admire on a project you deeply care about. The obvious weakness is that there's never as much time as you want.",
    "Very efficiently structured--perfectly designed to develop writing skills (both prose and poetry). Instructor never missed a beat. But maybe a bit too efficient. Felt almost like a poetry factory at times, with little room for tangential discussion, which can be enjoyable and useful, especially for a young writer with less experience that needs unstructured exploration to find new pathways. The feedback I got was exceptionally useful on a poem-by-poem basis, but I rarely knew why the instructor was telling me to \"keep this,\" \"rework this,\" or \"get rid of this.\" Perhaps just personal preference, but I would have liked a bit more on the philosophy behind why certain poetic moves work and why others ring shallow. I find that, from an experienced practitioner of any craft, this is the most valuable insight one can get.",
    "I loved every minute of this class, and could not have wished for a better semester. While I think my project still needs a lot of work, I am very pleased with the work I have done this semester."

   "comments": [
    "I can't think of a single good reason not to take an independent tutorial if you have the opportunity. Why would you not want to spend a semester meeting individually with a professor you admire working on a project that matters to you? When else in your life would someone give you this kind of chance again?",
    "Yes",
    "I think that having the chance to work one-on-one with a Professor who you look up to, and who is willing to help you pursue a specific goal is an immense privilege. I would recommend an independent study to anyone who has a project they really want to work on. Finding time to work on your own projects during the semester can be challenging, and I found that simply having someone that I had to report back to every week meant that I maintained my motivation and dedication to the project. Saying that, I think that independent studies, or tutorials can often devolve into nothingness if you are not really dedicated to what you are doing. The class is taken pass\/fail, and so it can be tempting to prioritize other work, or classes you are taking for a grade. In my opinion, doing a tutorial in this way is a complete waste of your time, and your instructors, so make sure, if you want to do an independent project, that you are willing to put in the time and effort. Ultimately, you will get out whatever you put in."
