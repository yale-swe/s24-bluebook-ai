   "comments": [
    "Improved Arabic reading and writing skills. Speaking proficiency greatly improved, both the dialect form and modern standard form. Greater knowledge of Arabic literature and the main themes addressed by the texts (e.g. political history of Algeria, Lebanon, Egypt). Discussions were extremely fruitful and the diversity of backgrounds in the class definitely facilitated this - having a combination of heritage speakers and non-heritage speakers, undergrads and graduate students, international students and Americans. The opportunity to speak directly with Ahlam Mosteghanemi was truly unique and offered extreme insight into her novel.",
    "Critical reading and language improvement.",
    "My reading ability in Arabic improved, and I gained a new perspective on the social circumstances in the countries depicted in the novels we read (Egypt and Algeria).",
    "I developed a greater understanding of modern arabic literature and its significance in social reform. This, in turn, allowed me to enhance my analytical skills when reading the novels, and gain a greater understanding of the symbolic meanings conveyed by the authors.",
    "I greatly improved my reading comprehension and writing skills, whilst increasing my knowledge of societal issues in the Middle East.",
    "Although I was born in the Middle East and spoke Arabic for years, my ability to write and read in the language greatly declined since high school. I have been wanting to strengthen my Arabic for years, and when I saw this class being offered I knew it was the right way to fulfill that goal. Throughout the course, I read, presented, discussed, and debated two great books and a few short stories with my colleges and professor Jonas. I realized week by week that I started to read faster, analyze the text better, and was much more elequent during class debates."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: 1. Great selection of texts. 2. Variety of student backgrounds greatly facilitated the discussion. 3. Ability to speak to the author was an amazing experience. 4. Coordination with CMES for movie-screening helped in formulating ideas for the mid-term paper. 5. Format for reading presentation at the beginning of every class was a very useful exercise that ensured everyone was on the same page about the contents of the reading. Weaknesses\/improvements: 1. Possibly incorporate a third text to read over the semester. 2. More supplementary materials (like the worksheets provided for the second novel). Specifically, more help with Arabic literary terminology for use in papers.",
    "Material is extremely interesting. Great as is.",
    "This course had very good readings, and interesting discussion. However, it could be significantly improved by some structural changes. 1. There should be more focus on language. A small section of each week's class should be dedicated to analyzing a short passage linguistically: the grammar, diction, and style that the author uses, etc. 2. There should be more support for developing writing skills. Instead of having only two written assignments, there should be several short writing assignments so that students get practice expressing ideas about literature in Arabic. There should be explicit instruction in the appropriate language for literary criticism in Arabic. 3. A few secondary sources should be included in the reading during the semester, so that students are exposed to literary criticism before writing a research paper. 4. The workload was unreasonably high. A normal Yale course has 20-25 pages of assigned writing, while this class had a 7-10 page midterm paper and 20-25 page final paper, adding up to 27-35 pages. This made for a miserable finals period.",
    "This course was very interactive and the class discussions were very intellectual and brought many different perspectives into one classroom. My only concern was the varying levels of arabic fluency among the member of the class which at times may have resulted in some people not fully comprehending the topic of discussion.",
    "The course is extremely well-balanced, keeping me and my classmates engaged for the entirety of the semester.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of the course is that it combines reading and writing perfectly and equally."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely! A great seminar to study Arabic literature in-depth and provides opportunity for exploration of any topic you're interested in in both the midterm and final papers. Fair work load and more classes of this type should be offered.",
    "Absolutely, it was great.",
    "This class had interesting readings and discussion, and I definitely got better at reading in Arabic while taking it. The assigned reading was about 60 pages of Arabic a week, which is doable if you can move somewhat quickly, and got easier over time. One weakness is that there was no explicit focus on language or improving writing skills. The only written assignments were a midterm paper and a final paper, meaning that we were left with an unreasonably large assignment for finals period with little support. (It was hard to write a 20-25 page research paper on a book that has virtually no scholarship about it.)",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who wants to develop their arabic reading and writing skills, or to anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the social injustices in the Arab world. Be prepared to read 60+ pages of arabic a week and take notes as there is a midterm and final paper.",
    "For sure, very engaging",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone at the L5 level of Arabic because the content is extremely interesting and the course is very well-taught.",
    "Yes, definitely! My Arabic got much better throughout the semester and the books we read were very interesting and entertaining. Also, the fact that we spoke in formal Arabic made me much more able to communicate with people speaking different Arabic dialects"
