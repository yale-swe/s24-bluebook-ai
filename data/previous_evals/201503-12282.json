    "Take if you're interested in Japanese history or Buddhism. You look at a lot of statues. A lot. All statues start to look the same to OTHER PEOPLE after a while but not you because you will know how they're all DIFFERENT AND SPECIAL.",
    "I would not recommend this course. For all you art history majors looking for an East Asia credit (I know you all are because for \/some\/ reason you all concentrate in some Western art or another), you can probably get through this as it's really not that much work. But for non-majors who are just interested, stay away--quite dull, overly long, disorganized lectures.",
    "If you're at all interested in Japan, I strongly recommend this class. Professor Yiengpruksawan is an expert in the field, so you'll learn from the best, and a lot of the material is absolutely fascinating, especially near the end of the course. I felt like it got a bit dry in the middle, with about 5 weeks of Buddhist sculpture, but Mimi's lectures got me through it. You can get away with doing not very much work, as the readings aren't necessary for lecture, discussion, or the midterm, final, or essay (but prepare to have to study a lot for the midterm).",
    "Would be helpful if you had some knowledge of Japanese going into it.",
    "An excellent introduction to Japanese art. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in either art history or Japan. The lectures are well organized, the readings really interesting and the lectures always interesting. Take it!!!",
    "I'd take this class again. - You know exactly what you're getting from the beginning - readings aren't a pain and there isn't tons of it - section is engaging and interactive - exams aren't too difficult - lecture is a joy to listen to (Mimi has some fascinating things to say!) - the final paper is quite free in what it allows you to explore",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student."
