   "comments": [
    "Developed a strong base in the theoretical underpinnings of Material Culture & Materiality, research methods, or new approaches to general theoretical thinking.",
    "We learned about material culture (so...stuff) and how it interacts with race, gender, class, etc. A lot of theory about materiality.",
    "I learned about material objects and their power - it was a new frame for understanding the way the world works.",
    "I developed new understandings surrounding the ideas and philosophies of materiality.",
    "I learned an entirely new language of terminology and theory in my discipline. A really fantastic course.",
    "This class pushed my conceptions of what types of entities have agency. What types of things can be \"actors\" in the world",
    "By taking this course, I learned the theory of material culture and also learned how to apply that theory. While the readings were at times quite dense, the class helped me feel more comfortable parsing through complicated texts. The class was so interesting, and Michelle was so great in helping us work through the different concepts of material culture. I definitely developed more analytic skills and also was challenged to constantly think and attack theory head on. We did not accept thoughts presented in readings as fact but rather worked through them to come to our own conclusions. Michelle also asked that we choose our own topics for our assignments (although she always helped if we needed guidance), which made me feel even more engaged and dedicated as I had to think of and explore topics of my own choosing.",
    "Since taking this class I can't look at objects the same. I learned the importance of history and its perpetuating influence in our everyday lives. Very insightful.",
    "I think this class expanded the ways in which I analyze and seek out evidence for my arguments."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: strong introduction to materiality, research skills, and engaging material Weaknesses: because of the course being heavy on theory, could use more \"real-world\" application to ground the ideas better, perhaps a reduction on the material could allow for more in-depth discussion and analysis due to the complicatedness of some theory",
    "Michelle is herself a huge strength because she cares a lot about the students and the content of the class. I think the theory could have been more grounded in case studies overall - of course, we did some of this work, but some weeks the theory went right over my head. Additionally, the reading load was often heavy, and class discussions could be wonky if people hadn't done the same readings, but Michelle mentioned the heavy workload at the end and asked us which readings were successful, so if it's taught again, I think it will have a more realistic reading list.",
    "The presentations at the beginning of each class were a waste of class time. Someone spent like 30 minutes rehashing the readings that we (supposedly) already did. Instead, it would be more effective to have them lead the class discussion rather than summarizing the readings. Or - have it just be focused on the presenters bringing a couple of material objects to class and then we could talk about how they fit with the themes of the readings. I loved the creative midterm project and the flexibility of the final paper. Class discussion was always really engaging, but I wish we had more time. I also think the course title was slightly misleading - we focused a lot on gender, sexuality, and other issues separate from race. Additionally, it was more about materiality than material culture.",
    "I think there was too much reading. The class discussions really depended on everyones engagement in the topic, and the high volume of reading to do made it hard for some people to keep up, and therefore the conversation sometimes suffered.",
    "This course had a really wonderful syllabus--but sometimes the reading was a bit too dense or demanding. It became difficult to get through in seminar.",
    "Discussion was great. The readings could get a little long and dense",
    "The course worked really well as a seminar as it gave us time to discuss the readings in depth and work through questions or even challenge theories at times. The readings themselves were extremely interesting, were varied, and all felt very relevant. The theme of the course, though, was quite broad so it was a bit difficult to try to tackle everything, especially since every aspect of the course was so engaging. It was important to have all of the theory and examples in books in order for us all to understand the material, but the amount of reading at times could be overwhelming and made it was difficult to actually discuss everything.",
    "I think this class is very interesting and well organized, however I did feel that a lot of the reading was extremely confusing. Often times Michelle did step in and explain what they meant, but there was more than one reading I did not understand at all despite her best attempts to explain them. I totally admit that I am not the brightest student, but at times it did feel like I was not the only one left confused. It felt like she should have either chosen to spend significantly more time on those readings so we could all catch up, or skip those readings as perhaps they were too advanced for undergrads with little background in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take a class with Michelle if you can, though she said it's unlikely she'll get to teach another class before she finishes her PhD. I think the second iteration of this course (if it happens) will be better than the first, but that's how it goes. I haven't studied material culture\/materiality\/post-humanism before, so check out the syllabus if you have to make sure you aren't relearning, though it could be chance to grapple with those theories some more, which feels like a necessity.",
    "Materiality is weird but interesting. This class isn't quite what I thought it would be....",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Michelle was an engaging professor who presented the rather challenging course material in an approachable manner. Conversation was always lively but never intimidating. Michelle facilitated wonderful class culture, and created a space where I felt personally accepted and understood.",
    "Yes! Don't know if this will be taught again because Michelle is a 7th year PhD student, but if you get the chance, definitely--definitely take this course!",
    "Yes, I would. Michelle is great! She gives you the creative license to research and write about what you want, but gives you indispensable research advice and analytical feedback.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course material is fascinating and also not necessarily something you would typically spend an entire semester exploring in other cultural studies classes. Michelle was such an incredible teacher. She was genuinely interested in everyones comments during class discussions. It didnt matter that most of us did not know much about the actual theory of material culture before the class. I definitely will have insights into other topics I take in cultural classes I would not before. If Michelle teaches again, regardless of the class, you should definitely take a class with her! I looked forward to class every week.",
    "Loved this class!! One of my favorites.",
    "If this course is offered again with Michelle, absolutely take it! She's super nice, passionate, and knowledgeable! Totally a blow your mind kinda course."
