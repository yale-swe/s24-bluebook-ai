    "Skills: I became much better at cutting superfluous words and sentences from my work. A lot better! Insight: There's not as much of a distinction between \"journalistic\" writing and \"other writing\" as I previously believed. Certainly academic writing has a certain voice, but I think I came into this course equating\/conflating a very conversational, casual, or punchy tone with \"journalistic\" writing. Hearing some of Roger's comments on my work, and reading excerpts from very dynamic writers, helped me to realize that good writing can really transcend genres, and there is place for conversational tone and creative metaphor whether you're writing a blog post or a book chapter."

    "Very closely.",
    "They align well",
    "The emphasis on cutting down work to make it better--an objective I expected going into the class--really came through and was a very successful takeaway from the class for me. Now, I find myself removing superfluous words from writing that's not even slated for \"submission\" anywhere: emails to colleagues, or copy I write for work. One of my expectations for this course was to learn how to write accessibly within the bounds of specific genres: for example, how to write the news article, the blog post. Our op-ed assignment gave me good practice in distilling my argument into its critical points and organizing those logically. However, for most other pieces I wrote in this class, I'm not sure what genre or publication in which they belong. Writing pieces each week that made me ask, \"In what context or setting would someone encounter this piece in The Real World? Who is the audience, besides my professor?\" made me feel a little less engaged in the work I produced each week."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: individual opportunities for feedback on writing Weaknesses: feedback from peers sometimes felt lacking\/not substantive Improvements: weekly writing assignments should be mixed up with other type of assignments to keep things interesting and keep students learning new skills ie. revising a piece for the following week, writing in class, etc",
    "The course is very good in making you write every week, but as we talked in class, it can become monotonous and lose effectiveness after the first semester. One thing I would recommend for future classes is to better organize the readings. It was always tricky to find the new readings among a poll of past and current readings on Canvas, and to have them uploaded ahead of time, like all of them at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Strengths: I think I really strengthened my writing via regular practice the small assignments each week. This format made me feel like I could experiment or take a risk one week, trying a new style or a new approach, without it feeling \"high stakes\" like a long final paper might. If this class is taught again, I would recommend emphasizing to students even more that they can\/should take risks each week, while still incorporating the tools we learn from Zinsser and other authors. Weaknesses: Class time itself felt very slow most sessions and could have been used much more effectively. As an example: While there is merit to listening to how a piece of writing sounds, I think a LOT of class time could be saved by not reading through everyone's pieces in class. I've read everyone's pieces in advance of the class on Canvas, anyway, so it struck me as redundant. I frequently noticed students working on non-course-related tasks on laptops or phones during the class period, which I did some days as well. Perhaps a way to better engage the students during class (and outside of class time, too) is to require that everyone read their peers' short pieces in advance of class and come prepared with positive feedback and critiques, perhaps written down or in a digital format. I also think the course could benefit from a no-computer policy while students give feedback to each other--writing down commentary on a piece ahead of time could avoid the need to have the document in front of you."

   "comments": [
    "If you want a space to force you to work on your writing more regularly, I recommend this course. Roger is very available and willing to meet and give feedback.",
    "Do not be a perfectionist! A completed weekly assignment is better than a flawless weekly assignment. Do the readings! If they seem like \"pleasure reading\" or creative nonfiction and you think this gives you an excuse not to read them, know that you will read some really beautiful well-written things in this course, and writers mimic what they read. Even if you cannot find time to do all the reading one week, at least read a section of each piece assigned to get a sense of the tone and strategies employed by the author."
