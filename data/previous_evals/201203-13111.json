    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload is manageable and the material is actually really interesting.",
    "This class is excellent and not onerous. You will be responsible for leading some classes, which is a valuable experience to have in college. Studies are interesting.",
    "This a solid science credit for non-science majors, as it doesn't involve any tests or problem sets. The science involved in some of the topics is a little questionable, but most of the fields explored are really interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend G&G240 to any student -whether or not you need to fill a science credit, or just want to take an interesting class. I've been talking about this class to my suitemates for a whole semester, because I truly think it's that interesting!!",
    "Overall, a great course with extremely interesting material and two dedicated professors!",
    "Definitely take the course. It was a really great cross between mystery and geology."
