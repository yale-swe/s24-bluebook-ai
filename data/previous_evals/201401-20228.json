    "* Absolutely. Thay Quang is amazing and so accommodating. He went out of his way to get to know all of us, invited us to his home multiple time for dinner, and made everyone in the class feel welcomed Vietnamese or not. The workload is the second lightest I have had as a Yale student. One weekly 1-2 page reflection on the readings\/movies for that week which I really got into. It would take me about an hour to an hour and a half to complete this each week. You are allowed to drop (not do) 4 of the 12 responses. The final project is up to you. People did book reviews, wrote personal memoirs, made movies, performed spoken word, etc. It is up to you and Thay Quang works with you to make sure it fits your interests.",
    "You get a whirlwind tour of Vietnamese topics, with lots of time to discuss, examine and critically interrogate these topics! I would recommend it because it was a really fun course. Despite knowing next to nothing about Vietnam in the beginning, I was welcomed into the classroom, and my contributions were valued.",
    "The course centers largely on Vietnamese literature, both classic and modern, and most of our discussions drew from these various texts. I really enjoyed the format of the class. Most of the time it would be open discussion, but other times Professor Quang would prepare some background information that really illuminated the subject. Though the class doesn't require knowledge of Vietnamese, being able to read the texts in the original language was even more interesting for me, and I would strongly recommend the class for people with Vietnamese background.",
    "It's so much fun, and the professor's really cool. You learn a lot, and the workload's not too bad at all.",
    "Great course. Would reccomend",
    "Really fun readings and instructor is very kind. It would be a great fifth class.",
    "It's an in-depth course about Vietnamese culture and values, and you learn about all this mainly through readings, but there are also fantastic films that are shown in class as well. I definitely recommend this class to others, because Professor Quang guides the class towards interesting perspectives about issues and topics that we all think we already know about--but then we learn to approach Vietnamese (and Vietnamese-American) values in an engaging and different manner.",
    "This class is great. As a Vietnamese-American, I consider this class deeply formative in my experience at Yale."
