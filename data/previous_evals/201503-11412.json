    "Although the title is Naval Engineering, this is a really good intro engineering class that covers the basics of engineering concepts",
    "This is the first time I have said this about an NROTC class...but, I would recommend this course regardless if you are in ROTC or not. This course synthesized a lot of engineering concepts well and presented it in a fair manner, regardless if you were a STEM major or not. I enjoyed this course and found the material interesting\/very relevant to life beyond the Navy.",
    "Best NROTC class yet. We learned to apply principles of engineering toward understanding how the Navy's ships, planes, and submarines work.",
    "Naval Engineering briefly covers all topics of engineering that are relevant to Naval Vessels. It is much more conceptual than other engineering classes, and most of the material is taught with an emphasis on its relevance on navy vessels. It is a very fun, interesting class that will teach you a lot about how submarines, ships, and airplanes work.",
    "Best ROTC class at Yale. If you are an engineer and not in ROTC this class would be super helpful before taking thermodynamics or fluid mechanics."
