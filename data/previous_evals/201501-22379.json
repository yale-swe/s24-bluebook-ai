   "comments": [
    "This class is a complete joy!!! Every single film felt essential to the class experience. Flawlessly constructed, brilliant.",
    "Take if you are interested in film.",
    "This is by far my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. You don't need a prior knowledge in film or Italian to do well, so don't let that scare you off. The format of the class is pretty cool; you talk about the broader history of a film and the director's background for the first class, watch the movie for the second, then closely analyze it in the third. Professor Marcus knows her stuff and is a joy to learn from. The movies are great; the material is interesting, and the only homework outside of class are four short essays throughout the semester. Definitely recommend it.",
    "yes yes yes yes - definitely take this class! ESPECIALLY if you've never taken a film class before. Professor Marcus is incredibly encouraging of students' ideas and it's a very relaxed class, although it's a fairly large workload with 4 4-5 page papers and a final.",
    "Anyone who likes film should take this class! Its the perfect overview of Italian cinema, tackling all of the most historically and artistically relevant films. Penny is an AMAZING professor and really knows how to lead a class. The workload isnt too bad with four short papers and a final. Definitely worth taking!",
    "Highly recommend this course to another student! Do not graduate without taking a course with professor Marcus. If you have any interest in film or Italian culture this class will be highly rewarding. If you've never even thought about the topics, do your self a favor and take this course!",
    "Perfect second semester senior year course if you have a free slot. Not a write-off, but relaxing, really interesting, a friendly and welcoming class environment, and will give you a basic proficiency in a really fascinating great area of film you might have no experience in. You get to watch a series of classic films and hear Prof. Marcus's fantastic lectures connecting the dots between them . Papers are short, fun and generously graded.",
    "Take it, amazing",
    "This is a great class. It's a lot of fun and the films we watch are really good. The essays took some getting used to... you have to strike a balance between presenting your own ideas and reiterating points which Prof. Marcus covered in class. It's not all about being creative. Prof. Marcus is one of the foremost Italian film scholars in the world, and she knows it, so she expects you to elaborate on some of her own ideas in the essays. But that's no reason not to take the class!",
    "Take it. It is an unforgettable course.",
    "Great class. Prof Marcus is very sweet, and her enthusiasm for Italian film definitely rubbed off on the class. Before each of the 4 papers, students schedule a 15 minute prewriting session with either the Prof. Marcus or the TF, which I found immensely helpful with forming my ideas into a coherent essay. It was nice having 4 short papers, and to be able to think a little about each film and how they connect. I also learned a lot about Italian history, such as fascism and crazy things like the racial laws. Although it was a fairly large class, it was very much an interactive conversation. None of those silent moments when no one wants to raise their hand. We did some great in-depth analysis of the films, and learned a lot about the directors and periods\/trends in Italian cinema.",
    "Take it. Its fun.",
    "The class is amazing and you should take it. It's a bit of work at the end when you have to write all of the papers but overall its a great class. The movies are great and the discussion is lively.",
    "Great Class. You should definitely take.",
    "I enjoyed the four (4-5 page) paper format. keeps you from putting off all the work to the end of the semester, and forces you to really engage with each film. Penny Marcus is in love with the material, for better and worse. I wish she were more critical of the films, but maybe that isn't the role of the academic. She surely does a thorough job of analyzing them. I recommend reading her essays on each respective film as you watch it; her lectures are taken directly from them. Her lecturing ability is solid, but sometimes the nuance of her arguments is lost. I didn't read them until i was studying for the exam, and it made me appreciate her and her lectures a lot more.",
    "I would recommend this course to film OR non-film majors. I came in with almost no experience in film analysis but still found the lectures engaging and accesible. The reading is not optional, but I did not find it necessary. Prof. Marcus and Allison (the TA) are both extremely kind, and the grading takes into account the learning curve that students new to film courses must surmount. I took this class for the writing credit, but now, I feel much more competent at analyzing film and much more knowledgable of Italian history.",
    "This is one of the courses that every Yale student should take. Professor Marcus is an expert on the topic and a very good teacher. Her enthusiasm, energy and passion make the class really special.",
    "This class provides an overview of the different trends and styles present in domestic Italian cinema from the post-World War II era to the present day. It includes a weekly screening and a four to five page paper every three weeks. The class before each screening is spent providing an overview of the director, oeuvre, and style encapsulated by the film to be seen the next day, and the class after the screening is dedicated to analysis of the film itself. Help is always available, and one leaves with a thorough understanding of Italian cinema.",
    "Italian Film is a truly wonderful class and I would highly recommend it to any student who hopes to deepen their knowledge of film and Italian history. It is taught by a brilliant and extraordinarily kind professor whose passion and intelligence keep this class fresh and entertaining. The films were always enjoyable and I found myself re-watching many of them because they were so good. I had never taken a film class before this and it was a wonderful experience, especially because Professor Marcus takes the time to meet individually with her students at least 4 times throughout the semester so she can get to know them. Also, the four papers were all very fun to write and you get a WR credit from the class!",
    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. Professor Marcus gives you so much while demanding so little. She wants everyone in her class to succeed. The films are all beautiful and her lectures are equally amazing. You end up learning way more than you realize, because Marcus makes complicated arguments so darn easy to understand. Never found myself looking at my watch. Time just seems to fly by because the course is that good.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! I wandered into shopping period on a whim, and now count this class as one of my favorites at Yale. It IS a niche subject, but the niche allows for a really in-depth knowledge of the actual material. I feel as though I actually KNOW about Italian cinema, rather than a survey course. The films she selects are remarkable, and Professor Marcus introduces her class to visual and literary analysis in a subject she absolutely adores. She actively learns with her students -- there are no bad ideas, no bad questions, and no bad insights. This could be interpreted as \"easy,\" but actually makes everyone much more eager to contribute and learn with her. Could not recommend this course highly enough; one of the most interesting and enjoyable academic experiences I have ever had. TAKE IT.",
    "An awesome class. Seriously, if you are at all interested in film or Italian culture, take this class. Every film won't be your favorite but you will come away with a surprisingly deep understanding of Italian cinema and have some awesome movies to reference. Prof. Marcus is the most enthusiastic professor imaginable and her spirit is infectious. She also is one of the leading Italian Film scholars. TAKE THIS CLASS. Sometimes it gets a little annoying with over-analysis but in general it is amazing and you will get so much more out of the movies thru the background Prof. Marcus gives."
