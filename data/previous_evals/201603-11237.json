    "I obtained a very thorough familiarization with linear algebra, and learned enough calculus to hopefully ease the trauma of econometrics.",
    "I learned about linear algebra (vectors and matrices, etc.) and multivariable calculus (partial derivatives, linear approximation, Lagrange, etc.).",
    "The course covers about half a semester of linear algebra and half of multivariable calculus (basically, it does both subjects before they start getting too difficult)",
    "We learned about multivariable calculus and linear algebra.",
    "I definitely learned aspects of linear algebra and multivariable calculus that I did not know beforehand.",
    "I further developed my math skills and refreshed my knowledge of calculus, while learning more about linear algebra and multivariable calculus.",
    "Basic knowledge in linear algebra and multivariable.",
    "Introductory knowledge about multivariable calculus and linear algebra",
    "Lots of linear algebra (it was fun to be honest), and multivariable calculus (less fun but enjoyable).",
    "I learned the tenets of multivariable calculus, but I learned how to think for myself. I learned how to overcome a challenge in a field I am not comfortable in. Paying attention in class will benefit you immensely in the long-run."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is no way to circumvent the pain that higher level math brings some students.",
    "I liked the weekly quizzes, I disliked (slightly) the fact that we didn't have access to answer keys for the PSETS, and so I would improve the course by giving answer keys for the PSETS.",
    "Very interesting course, Professor Rosenthal does a good job of making the material exciting. It is obvious he has a real love for mathematics, and that love is contagious.",
    "The course was overall great, but I would try to give more emphasis on the concepts in addition to problem solving.",
    "Overall, I thought this course was very well-taught. I appreciated the structure, and the pace of the learning was rigorous, but not too fast or too slow. Given that this course is intended for economic majors and the entirety of my class planned to major or already declared an econ major, I hoped that we could see application of these techniques to economic situations or other real-life problems.",
    "Strengths: Moves at a pace that was comfortable and covered a broad range of interesting mathematical concepts Weaknesses: Did not have as strong of a connection to the social science themes as I had originally assumed it would",
    "The weekly quizzes were actually helpful, as it forced us to keep on track. The assignments, quizzes, and tests all related so it was very clear what we had to study. The textbook for linear algebra was awful, as it had no answers to the problems + the prof didn't go over all answers. The multivariable textbook w\/ answers was much better as then we could check answers to see what we did wrong etc.",
    "Strength: professor was very accessible, personable, and engaging Weakness: didn't go outside the box",
    "It's pretty well taught. I wish that the answers to the pset and homework questions are posted online.",
    "The professor is very approachable and positive. His enthusiasm and love of math is contagious, and truly inspiring. He tried his best for us to understand the material, and I really appreciated that.",
    "There is not enough room for trial and error in this course. You can't make an honest mistake without it deteriorating your grade."

   "comments": [
    "Only if needed for major.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is fair and informative.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in an Economics major but who does not want to take MATH 120. The linear algebra makes the course interesting, and the fact that Professor Rosenthal doesn't collect problem sets (instead of homework grades you get weekly quizzes- they're easy) makes the workload fairly light.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially with Prof. Rosenthal! I heard that the course used to be really hard, but we had one p-set per week and weekly quizzes (which helped a lot, believe it or not) Go to the homework sessions and office hours if you can! They are extremely helpful!",
    "Yes! If you are interested in econ, I think that Math 118 is a great class. The workload is consistent and never too much, while the class never moved too slowly. If you have a decent background in math (but have no intention of being a math major), this class is great for you. Professor Rosenthal is also a great instructor.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who feels more advanced than MATH 115 but not quite prepared for MATH 120",
    "Take it with this prof as his tests and quizzes are very fair. It's a nice overview of linear algebra and multi without getting too deep into either.",
    "Yes! Really great math course and introduction to linear\/multi variable. Professor made it fun to go to class.",
    "I think this is a good fit for econ majors who want to prepare for intermediate micro or above.",
    "If you like math but you are no math genius: take it! If you want to fulfill a requirement, also take it. If you hate math, take it too; it might change your opinion about math.",
    "First take another math course before you jump into this one."
