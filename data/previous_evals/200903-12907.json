    "Math 112 is a good introduction to calculus. I took AB Calculus in high school, but felt that I hadn't absorbed the material as much as I had wanted. 112 therefore felt slow at some times, but it was a good fit since I was taking time-consuming science classes. I think it will be much easier to go into 115 having taken 112, instead of jumping into it from high school.",
    "I would say that MATH 112 is the right class if you have never had calculus before, or you feel that your previous knowledge of calculus could be refreshed. There is homework once a week, 2 midterms and 1 final. The workload isn't overwhelming but you definitely have to keep up with everything or you'll find yourself stuck into crazy hours of the night trying to finish a problem set that you believed was easy a few hours before.",
    "If you have to take it, then you have to take it. Don't take zuckerman if you have trouble staying awake in lectures.",
    "I would never recommend it to another student because it was not useful as all.",
    "I hated this class and everything I learned. Not recommended unless it's an absolute requirement for your major.",
    "Take it as a freshman so that all of the calc you knew in high school is still sort of fresh.",
    "Do not take it if you have no prior experience with calculus as the class moves very quickly. Just about everyone in the class has some background.",
    "Seriously reconsider the reasons why you want to take this class before taking it.",
    "A good class for basic calculus.",
    "I would recommend it for someone trying to advance their learning of calculus.",
    "I would recommend MATH 112 to another student. It's a really good way to have a solid foundation for the rest of calculus.",
    "An AB Calc classDefinitely a great intro for college calculus",
    "Yes if you are looking for some basic calculus skills.",
    "Take this class if you need the class as a requirement.",
    "Only take it if you need it. The curve is rough as many of the kids are freshmen who have just taken high level calculus classes in high school.",
    "I would recommed it to a fellow student.",
    "Math 112 was a very good review for people who haven't taken in a while, but if you have never taken calculus, it will be a difficult class.",
    "It's the basics of calculus presented in a strangely complicated manner."
