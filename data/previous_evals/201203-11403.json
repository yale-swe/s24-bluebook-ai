   "comments": [
    "Speaking about the course in general (i.e., from semester to semester and not in terms of this single iteration), it does not deepen my knowledge of or interest in the discipline. If anything, it is counterproductive, disillusioning me to the state of affairs. Such counterproductivity is caused by obvious faculty disinterest in attendance, in the material, and in engaging in meaningful ways with each other and students. Lack of attention to pedagogical structure and format of the course is an additional cause.In terms of exposing me to useful and interesting source material for future research, however, the course succeeds.",
    "Very much so."
