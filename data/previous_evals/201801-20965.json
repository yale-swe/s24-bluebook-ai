    "WaO taught me to write with freedom, honesty, and attention to detail. I hadn't expected to learn so much about grammar in addition to the thematic workings of the different texts that we read, but I really enjoyed both aspects of the class! It was a privilege to receive so much attention from Anne in regards to the revision of each piece, and her comments\/insight on improving my pieces really made me a better, more informed writer.",
    "I think I became a better writer, and I learned some revising skills.",
    "I gained a vocabulary for elements of good writing, and I learned how to apply those elements to my own work. I learned to revise my writing as well as provide feedback for others. I improved my grammar skills.",
    "This is a famous class that does exactly what it promises to do: you will become a better writer by taking it."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: multi-faceted approach to personal essay writing (you won't get bored, ever), openness of classmates and professor to a variety of different topics, class structure\/schedule Weaknesses: time commitment, perhaps (although the onus is on you, the student, to make this doable)",
    "The biggest strength is that it feels like a community. The biggest weakness is that there is too much weight put on the identity piece and not enough scaffolding of that project.",
    "Strengths: Everyone is extremely committed to this class, from Anne to the other students, and this made taking it fun, enriching, and thought-provoking, and pushed me to work harder. It's also great to have a class where you not only get to think actively about writing but to discuss the nuances and ethical qualms of that process with others. Last but not least, Anne is, of course, WaO's greatest strength: I've never had another professor put so much energy and soul and time into a class and into their students. Weaknesses: No real weaknesses, per se, but sometimes I wish we had more time for discussions. Also, this class is not really a workshop. Even though you're writing, and even though a workshop component is built into class every week, the purpose of the class isn't really to discuss those pieces -- discussion happens outside.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the classroom dynamic Anne creates. She chooses the group very intentionally, and it makes a difference: you will learn not only from your instructor, but also from those around you. It is a special experience, a special class."

   "comments": [
    "No matter how hard you have to toil to perfect your essays or how difficult it may be to churn out a bearable topic late on a Monday night (since there are Tuesday deadlines), you will not regret taking this class. It challenges you in a way that embodies the heart of the Kelly Clarkson song, \"What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger\" (and, believe it or not, Anne will teach you an even better quote to embody that concept). Seriously, if you like personal essay writing even a little, apply.",
    "Definitely take the class if you get a chance to. The seminar atmosphere is really unique and cool. Anne definitely encourages this kind of problematic cult of personality she's got going, and it can be somewhat toxic if you let it get to you. But keep in mind that you know yourself better than she knows you. Don't let her cast you in any one role, and you'll be fine. Take advantage of the opportunity to explore your voice as a writer, and don't get down on yourself if she doesn't agree with every style move you make.",
    "The reputation of this class precedes it. In all respects, it lives up to that reputation. Anne Fadiman is wonderful. Shes a brilliant teacher and a caring mentor. Shes committed to her students' success, not only in the class but beyond. The class does requires a lot of work. However, the beauty about it is that it never feels burdensome. It never feels like a chore. You'll want to do the assignments. You'll want to read your peers papers and critique them. You'll want to do the readings (you often meet the authors). And of course, you want to write about yourself. This is one of the most rewarding aspects of the course: the opportunity for self-exploration. If youre interested in taking the class, apply. And if you get in, take it! Ive never considered myself a writer and had only taken one other writing course before this one. Yet, taking this course was one of my best decisions of my senior year. I say without a doubt that this was my best class I took at Yale and one of the best classes Yale has to offer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend WaO to another student. WaO isn't so much a class as an experience because its reach extends so far beyond what is done in the classroom. There are three elements that make the course both unique and extraordinary: 1. Anne. No other professor could teach this class. Anne is so generous with her time and forthcoming with her knowledge and experiences. WaO is what it is because of her. 2. Vocabulary. You might understand a concept, but it isn't until you can put words to it that its contours suddenly become visible. This class teaches you to put words to a lot of the most important elements of writing that you probably know, intuitively, are important, but might never have considered verbalizing. Having that vocabulary changes everything about how you approach the inclusion of those elements. 3. Other students. It's amazing to have this small community of other writers with whom you share work. It's just an amazing way to get to know people you might never have otherwise met and so extraordinary to be surrounded by so much talent for three hours each week.",
    "If you are admitted to this course, you cannot not take it. I personally had my doubts, to be honestabout Anne, about the cult-like reputation the class has gained for itself. And its true, the course can feel a little cult like. And its true, Anne sometimes seems to revel in that. But, truly, it doesnt matter that much. Feeling a little uncomfortable about some problematic moments in class re: race\/class\/yale exclusivity was, for me, a worthy price to pay for the single most educational class ive takenat yale, anywhere. you will become a better writer. its as simple as that."
