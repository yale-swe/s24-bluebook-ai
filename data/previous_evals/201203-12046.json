    "This class is very different depending on whether you're an upper-level history student with lots of familiarity with the names on the syllabus or whether you've never heard of any of it. To be absolutely clear: This is NOT a free-floating class in \"big ideas\" or even in intellectual history - this is a class on a very specific kinds of ideas interpreting history, within the academic discipline of history, as practiced by scholars. Don't let the title confuse you, and make sure you're actually interested in discussing scholar's opinions on each other's historiographical theories before jumping in.",
    "Professor Sood is a wonderful professor and a kind and generous individual. He is always thought-provoking and incredibly well-spoken. The heightened gravitas of his speech combined with a somewhat ironic sense of humor only adds to the allure of this class. He has put together a magisterial syllabi to trace the intellectual history and evolution of the field of historical inquiry in the past half century or so. This class should be taken by all history majors who wish to have a broad sense of historical scholarship in itself.",
    "Honestly, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.First things first: this is a course on the historiography since 1950 of the early modern world. That was super-unclear to me until about halfway through the course, partly because of my own obtuseness, but also because the course wasn't really framed as a historiography course. It's an awesome subject if you're at all interested in modernity and its attendant concepts -- capitalism, industrialization, etc.Starts a bit slow -- in the first 3 weeks, I didn't know what in God's name we were doing or why I had signed up for this course -- but it builds upon itself in such an intricately constructed way, the testament to a really well-designed syllabus. Discussions were often a bit aimless but at times transcendently electrifying. Don't be put off by Prof. Sood either -- he's got some strange habits, but he also cares incredibly deeply about the ideas and is really wonderful to meet with outside of class.I could go on and on about this course and its readings. They really made you rethink the way you understood modernity as a phenomenon. I feel I also had a pretty decent grasp on academic history as a discipline by the time we finished up. It's not always the case that you can really feel your progress from a course -- for me, I really did feel I made a big leap forward through this."
