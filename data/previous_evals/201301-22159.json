   "comments": [
    "The first half of the semester is spent learning grammar, then reading Plato's Apology after that. I wish we had translated more, but it was pretty slow going. It's a good transition from L1 to beginning to translate real Greek.",
    "Good exposure to the art of reading greek, but not entirely fun and games, especially in the first half of the course, which in our case was a review of tedious grammar.",
    "This is the second half of Greek 110. It is a lot of work, but after Spring Break you're done with H&Q and start reading the Apology which is way more fun. Chris Simon is not a great teacher, though. So if he's teaching 120, be sure that you are sure you want to take this sequence. There is no point in taking 110 without 120.",
    "If you already took Grek 110, stick with it! Reading Greek texts is very different from learning the grammar or doing practice sentences. The Apology is a good text if you're interested in Plato, but we also get some shorter passages from the Little Greek Reader. We had a prose composition aspect to the class that was awful, but from my understanding, this was not done the term prior. I was able to use Greek for my research after we finished the grammar portion of the course.",
    "Overall this course was excellent, and I would highly recommend any student willing to put in the work to take a class with Chris and Bryant, both.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "Like high-school Algebra II, GREK 120 is a curricular sock-drawer: you've got to get from Level 1 to Level 3 somehow. Grind through the grammar and look forward to the \"Apology\"; if you enjoy the latter you know you're doing okay."
