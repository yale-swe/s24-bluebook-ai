   "comments": [
    "Mat sci is an interesting course, and not a ton of work for a mech e course. I would recommend taking it if you are interested in the field, as it is a nice intro course to dabble in even if you end up not choosing the major.",
    "If you're a MechE, you should take the class. While still more work than your humanities roommate will have, by engineering standards it is more than reasonable and yet you still learn a lot. Also, the subject matter is much more interesting than I had anticipated - I hate chemistry and yet really enjoyed this class. Professor Schroers and the TA's are really helpful and great people!",
    "Great class. I took this as an engineering elective as a ChemE major and enjoyed it. Jan is a good professor, and the workload is pretty light.",
    "This was a great course and I would definitely recommend taking it. The material was interesting and the professor was an engaging lecturer. The problem sets and tests were fair.",
    "Don't take this course unless you absolutely have to. It's boring, not particularly well taught, and you don't come away feeling like you accomplished anything useful at the end.",
    "A really boring but required class. This class is not exciting AT ALL and was the most boring 75 minutes of my life twice a week. It's not hard and there's not much work, but it's really just a class you have to take. BUY THE TEXTBOOK - it helps A TON. Try your best to pay attention in class because the tests will be really easy if you do. Other people don't pay attention in class which means that the average is like an 82, but it's actually not hard to do 10 points better than that.",
    "I would recommend MENG 285 to fellow students if it is not taught by Professor Schroers. The curriculum was pretty good and, despite the teaching, I think that I got a lot out of the course.",
    "An overview of the properties and molecular dynamics of various materials, from metals to ceramics to polymers. Should probably know very basic chemistry, but otherwise very manageable material. Psets and tests aren't that bad, although psets were oftentimes very quantitative and tests were largely conceptual.",
    "If you have to take it, it's pretty painless. Mostly memorization-make sure you give yourself enough time to memorize all the material before the final.",
    "This course was relatively interesting. Much of the information on deformation and processing was covered in MENG 185 and at times this felt a bit like an introductory chemistry class. Professor Schroers covered some information which was not included in the text book which made certain sections more difficult. Overall the class is not overly difficult and a solid choice for any MechE.",
    "A very fun course. Good for anyone who wants to have a good idea on material science. I would definitely recommend for any student with a major in science.",
    "I did not enjoy this class. I would not have taken it if I didn't have to for the major. Professor Schroers is not a great professor, and truthfully, I would not have done well on any of the tests if he had not given us the lecture slides. In addition, materials science is just a boring topic. But that last part is solely opinion, someone else might find it fascinating. My lack of interest in the topic definitely contributed to my general dislike of the class.",
    "Good class. Definitely better than the Thermo class (if you aren't ABET). Jan is a great guy and super passionate about the subject. Problem sets are fairly doable and the exams were manageable if you attended class regularly and took notes."
