    "Professor Cividanes SPAN 790 Methodologies of Modern Language Teaching extensively, comprehensively and communicatively instructed its students the true goals and purposes of language teaching: facilitating their own students individual and communicative self-learning and acquiring essential cultural and linguistic competences. As such, this course enabled its students to always centralize their own students themselves and to present languages and cultures simultaneously, in order that their own students language learning consist of their learning and improving the necessary means to deepen their cultural knowledges and communicative skills. The weekly class discussions and post-practicum conversations contextualized and sophisticated students own acquisition of essential pedagogical concepts and vocabularies, such that they are able to think in terms of communicative language teaching and backward planning, when constructing a language session. Therefore, Professor Cividanes course greatly trained and equipped its students with many pedagogical and linguistic concepts and practical experiences to become a Spanish instructor."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Cividanes course truly enables students to acquire and utilize essential pedagogical and linguistic concepts and methods, via its integrating conceptual instructions and practical opportunities. For instance, Professor Cividanes kindly explicated and demonstrated essential pedagogical and methodological concepts, skills and current news concerning language teaching and in effect enabled students to increase their pedagogical and methodological knowledge on a step-by-step manner. Also, the midterm effectively solidified this by encouraging students to review and acquire these concepts and vocabularies. Furthermore, while enrolling in this course, students were able to minutely observe and practically learn from the very Spanish instructors of the Department, who exemplify and demonstrate the various modes and methodologies of language teaching and thus fortify students understanding of pedagogical and methodological practices. In fact, the practica, or 30-minute sessions, and later a 50-minute session, enable this courses students to put to practice and realize the methodologies about which they learned and discussed, especially communicative language teaching, in a literal manner. Furthermore, these practica provide students occasions for experimenting and developing their own teaching methods and practices, all under Professor Cividanes extensive guidance."

    "Indeed, I would most definitely recommend this course, since Professor Cividanes ensures that her students learn and acquire diverse pedagogical and methodological knowledges, concepts and skills and simultaneously grow as teachers and students themselves. Professor Cividanes course will introduce, sophisticate and culminate students pedagogical and methodological perspectives and experiences as teachers, because of its comprehensive, dynamic and communicative quality. That is to say, students will be able to not only think in terms of language and culture teaching but also develop their practical and pedagogical skills and encounter their own individual methods of teaching. Thus, Professor Cividanes course will most definitely develop all students into pedagogically, methodologically and culturally aware and equipped Spanish instructors."
