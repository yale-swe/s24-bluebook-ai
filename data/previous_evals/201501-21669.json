    "Do not take BIOL 103 if it's with Zhong. His accent hurts your ability to learn, but I must admit his enthusiasm is admirable. Absolutely do not take this class unless required. This class is full of pre-meds and hardcore students so be prepared to fight against the curve. Also, do not take this class unless you have taken BIOL 101\/102 because they will give you the tools to succeed. If you like pain and are into BDSM, take this class with study groups in mind. Do not brace this course solo. I mean, BDSM takes at least two. Get through these BIOL modules ASAP so you can get into real 50 Shades of Grey foreplay with upper level Bio.",
    "Chances are you don't have a choice of whether to take it or not - it's required for premed, it's required for most E&EB classes, it's required for almost all higher level bio. If you took AP Bio in high school, it will suffice, don't worry.",
    "As I have said before in my valuations for BIOL 101 and BIOL 102, Yale needs to seriously reconsider its biology placement procedures for freshmen. I definitely should have placed out of BIOL 101-104 and have no idea why I am wasting time in these classes right now. I wouldn't suggest looking at AP Biology test scores (let's be honest, the AP Biology test is a sham), but I would suggest making the placement tests more reasonable. Of course, if you're taking this class you're probably a premed or bio major, so you have to take it. Just an unpleasant experience that you can't avoid.",
    "No one takes bio because they want to. Take because you'll need to, but be ready for a class that's mediocre at best.",
    "Yes, would recommend.",
    "I'm sure Bio 103 could be a good class, as it focuses on a lot of interesting concepts and material. While it is similar to Bio 101 and 103 in format and structure, it was by far the least enjoyable of the module. Professor Zhong is a terrible professor. I'm not really sure where to begin. I guess I'll start with his slides. They were poorly organized, crowded, and not helpful. He continually said \"go read the slides.\" He seemed to have forgotten that there was nothing to read on the slides - only complicated pictures of the nervous system he included to \"show an introductory biology course that biology is not simple,\" as he repeated many times. Beyond that, he expressed no concern for his students. He said he would be happy to give us study guides after the first few weeks if we so desired. Yet, we asked for study guides and never received them. On the first day of class, he emphasized the utility of Piazza. People began frequently posting on Piazza and Professor Zhong decides to address the class about the posting, saying: \"Just google it.\" These are NOT words of a professor dedicated to satiating his students' desire for knowledge. Furthermore, students raised their hands during lecture only for Professor Zhong to never answer the question, but instead respond with \"You just need to conceptualize.\" Why thank you - that clears everything up! I think I've been a little harsh, so let me add that there was one good lecture. It was on Genetic Analysis Techniques - this was the lecture when Professor Zhong showed up 45 minutes late!",
    "As a discipline, genetics is fascinating but this course is not. Only take it if you have to for your major, you will not enjoy this class. Lectures are difficult to follow and not well laid out. Quizzes are not carefully written either.",
    "Very confusing. The concepts are super interesting, but you're going to have to spend a lot of time on Wikipedia in order to understand a lot of what's going on this course. Nothing is going to be spoon-fed to you, least of all the basic concepts that you are expected to know, but may not. It's a lot of fun, but rather frustrating.",
    "It's a decent overview of genetics and development. Don't expect to learn a lot about genetics, or a lot about genetics specifically, but rather principles that are integral to either subject.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to. If you don't have to, definitely avoid it while Dr. Zhong is teaching it. I felt like I learned very little, except near the very end of the course, where he expected us to learn some highly complex experimental procedures and ideas, and then did not include them on the exams. Speaking of which, the exams were very fair and well-written. I felt like they were graded more fairly than the exams in 101 and 102. However, they often had little overlap with what was emphasized in lectures, and I felt like my studying never helped much. I should also mention how Dr. Zhong shaped the class. Dr. Zhong is not a bad guy. I think he tried pretty hard to make this an engaging class. However, I ended up finding the organization and presentation of this class to be one of my most frustrating academic experiences this year. He emphasized a whole lot of information that was completely unconnected to the main point of the class, and ended up making things very confusing. He was largely unavailable as a resource both on Piazza and in person (he never held office hours or review sessions). I was impressed with both his knowledge of the subject, and his ability to obfuscate simple ideas.",
    "Very good intro bio course -- teaches you about experimental design and the way to think, not just memorization. However, don't buy into the \"no memorization\" speech the instructor gives you -- to do well in this course you need to know the pathways, the experimental designs, and biological terms very well, or you will be confused easily and find the quizzes and tests difficult.",
    "Chances are that you need this class for prerequisites if you are looking at this. Do not fear, this class is largely benign if 1. You work hard 2. You listen to lectures 3. You are interested in writing science (homework is a proposal) 4. You have a solid enough grasp of BIOL 101-2 concepts to take on a more complex level of biological concepts. The class actually has two portions of contents, devo bio and genetics. Both are interesting. Good luck.",
    "103 is the third course module in the intro bio series. A lot of the course logistics are the same as earlier modules. There are weekly quizzes that account for a large portion of your grade, weekly problem sets that are mostly pieces of an independent research project, and an in class final halfway through the semester. This term was the first time that professor Zhong taught the course, so his teaching style was still being refined over the course of our class sessions. Still, he is an extraordinarily competent lecturer who really knows his way around all of the material. He does teach with a sort of \"tough love\" style, which I found fine but many other students did not like, in which he does not spoon feed students the information but in a sense requires them to figure some of it out on their own. For this reason, he did not make weekly study guides, which was a point of contention between him and many of the students on piazza. Nonetheless, there was a ton of really interesting material that was taught in 103, and I highly recommend that people interested in genetics or dev. bio take this course to get a foothold on the subject.",
    "I recommend Biol 103 as the subjecrs covered are really cool and if you're curious about biotechnologies this is a great intro to that.",
    "Bio 103 is part of the standard intro bio sequence. Odds are you're taking it because you have to, but if taught by the right professor, it can be very interesting. Weekly quizzes are annoying, but force you to stay on top of the material. I would recommend this course but only if you know you're taking it with a good lecturer\/professor.",
    "The material was very interest but a little scattered and all over the place. The lectures could be a bit more clear.",
    "Biology 103 is (so far) the hardest of the modules. I did not enjoy it as a course but did enjoy the material (to a certain extent...). Professor Zhong did well and was a good professor. His slides are very detailed, best to read over them after class and make sure you understand everything in them. My TA was unhelpful. The quizzes were impossible. Overall, the class was frustrating because the material seemed easy to grasp when studying but was tested in a strange and convoluted way. Unfortunately I know you have to take this for pre-med...goodluck.",
    "You have to take it if you're premed or a bio major. Otherwise, there is no reason to take it.",
    "I heard BIOL 103 was a really interesting course, however, do not take it with Weimin Zhong. I have heard excellent things about the other professor who teaches it though. Professor Zhong is extremely difficult to understand, does not take any feedback or answer questions, the quizzes and final is ridiculous and he is extremely inconsistent with his statements in class and his actions. Your grade in the class becomes a sign of how lucky you got instead of how well you understood the information because it literally was a crapshoot. You will not receive help during this course. Good luck.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student, because I do not believe that it helps students gain a firm grasp in intro genetics. The sections for this class do not help to reinforce the material discussed in lecture and the topics are sporadic. the teaching style of the professor is disjointed and does not appeal to most learners.",
    "An introduction to development and genetics that covers interesting material in not-the-most-interesting way. (Although some lectures were very compelling, others were dry and too fast.) As a necessary class, it was definitely survivable, but I would not have elected to take it if not necessary for my major and to complete the modules.",
    "I very strongly disliked this course, but I think that was because of Professor Zhong. In general, this course was frustrating, hard to understand, poorly structured, and a huge time sink. I would advise students to only take the course if they absolutely have to, based on my experience.",
    "It's a very interesting class, but I had some complaints about how it was organized. I didn't like that the homework assignments did not help with concept enforcing. Sure, we learned to write a \"research\" proposal, but I would have preferred to learn the concepts more thoroughly in that that, seeing as it is an introductory biology course. I don't think I gained that many useful skills learning to write a research proposal. In fact, there wasn't much guidance, and the experience felt like a lot of hand-waving."
