    "It basically functions as a lecture about various aspects of ancient Egyptian medicine.",
    "don't take it unless you know a ton about the subject already.",
    "This class probably shouldn't be cross listed as HSHM- it's really reliant on knowing some Egyptian, or at the very least caring about how semantics come into play- I hoped for a more in depth analysis of egyptian medical practice based on anatomy, rather than one based on linguistics. Nonetheless, I liked the class.",

    "Intriguing material, very good professor. While the class can be a bit dry at times, take the course if you have any interest in the subject."
