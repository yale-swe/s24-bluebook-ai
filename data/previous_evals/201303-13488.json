   "comments": [
    "Lots of work, but worth it.",
    "Basically, you read a bunch of essays by famous authors--Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, David Sedaris--and try to emulate their writing strategies in your own essays. I would definitely recommend this class. It is highly enjoyable and the skills transfer very well no matter what your major is.",
    "Good English class if you like writing. It is a class where you get as much out of it as you put in it. I would recommend the class if you really want to be a better nonfiction writer or if you want to learn a new style of writing. Don't take it just to satisfy your writing credit.",
    "It is a lot of work but you do improve your writing very quickly. I would recommend taking it.",
    "Five essays over the course of the semester, and a draft of each one has to be turned in as well. The assignments were tough, but you do feel like you've learned after you've done them all. Professor Shirkhani was great! She made class fun and her feedback on drafts was very helpful. She was also very accessible, and met with me multiple times outside her set office hours to discuss my essays at length. Another plus--the readings were excellent!",
    "Engl 120 is the best course I have taken at Yale. The class is fun, not too work-load heavy, stimulating, and without you initially realizing, takes your writing ability to a whole new level. I definitely recommend the class to everyone, especially incoming freshmen. If you think you have good writing capabilities and can keep up with the 5-6 essay regiment of the semester, definitelytake this class instead of 114 or 115. I highly recommend getting a section with Professor Shirkhani teaching as she is the sweetest and most caring professor, who has no problem working with you personally and encouraging you in your writing endeavors. Though, I have heard that all of the English 120 professors are amazing. The class will force you to introspect on your life and experiences as you write some personal essays, and it will force you to grasp the styles and strategies of acclaimed essayists and learn how to incorporate such styles and strategies into your own writings. Definitely take the class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Summary: \"We read short essays and stories of various kinds- personal experiences, character descriptions, events. There was a big emphasis on humor and using the models to improve our own writing abilities. It really improved my self-awareness as a writer and inspired me to write more.\"",
    "Everyone says it's a must take - and really it should be. Take this if you can, especially with Shirkhani. She is really really great!",
    "Would recommend. A staple of your (metaphorically) expensive education; your writing will subsequently be fresher and flyer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120 to a fellow student. The workload was very manageable and I always had fun doing the assignments.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Shirkhani is the best, and your writing will improve substantially. A must-take at Yale, regardless of if you're an underclassman or not. I took it as a junior and got a ton out of it. If you're lucky enough to get in, don't leave.",
    "A great class to take if you really want to improve your writing. If you're going for the easy A, this is not the class for you.",
    "We read a fair amount of essays , about an hour or two a class, and write about an essay a week (every other is a draft). Classes are enjoyable so go quickly and discussions are engaging.",
    "ENGL 120 is a must take course for anyone who loves writing. It will change the way you read and write English. It's a challenging course and grading can be harsh but you will take away a lot from it.",
    "Yes! I would warn them that's it's a lot of work. I put in about 10-15 hours every week writing, editing, and reading for the class, but if you're willing, then yes. Take the class.",
    "If you enjoy writing and would like to take an English class that focuses on your craft as a writer then take it, absolutely, hands down, no ifs, ands, buts, or hey-wait-a-minutes, take it. It was exactly what I wanted for my first college English experience.",
    "Summary: basically you read a lot of really well-written and creative (but not fictional) essays and try to figure out how to do what they do. Would recommend."
