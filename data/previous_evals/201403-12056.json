    "Engineering of Drug Delivery is a class taught by Professor Saltzman, a leader in drug delivery technology. It is a course with incredible breadth: it introduces many of the basic concepts needed to build mathematical models of drug delivery systems, and it explores topics such as siRNA-based drugs and personalized medicine that represent the frontier of current research. I highly, highly recommend it.",
    "This was a great class. It was pretty challenging at the beginning but the work load gets easier later so you have time to work on the final project. This class does't have a final project which is nice.",
    "Yes I think it is a great class whether or not you have to take it for your major. The background prerequisites should not deter anyone from taking it. it is a really enjoyable class and you learn a lot.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for any BME student interested in drug delivery. It was such a privilege taking this course from one of the biggest names in drug delivery! Professor Saltzman really cares about his student and is always available if you have any questions or need help with anything. There are weekly problem sets and a big final project, which were definitely challenging, but rewarding. The midterm was challenging, but fair.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who is truly interested in the subject. It's not an easy A, and I would definitely recommend taking it Cr\/D\/F. You have to work of r a good grade, but the work is spread out, so it's never that overwhelming.",
    "Take this course!! Just do it. Totally worth it. Professor Saltzman is a complete boss. I learned a lot and had fun doing it.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in drug delivery. Mark and Junwei really made the course very successful, fun and interesting."
