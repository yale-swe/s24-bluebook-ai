    "This is by far the best course I have taken at Yale, arguably in my entire academic career. Professor Lui is phenomenal. Every lecture is clearly organized, and immediately from the very first introductory lecture, I knew that this class was what I came to Yale for. I left every single class meeting inspired and informed. Asian-American history is not and should not be regarded as a \"peripheral\" field of study; rather, the discussion of Asian-American history is central to American history, and you will leave Professor Lui's class with a treasure trove of information and more critical understanding of United States history as a whole, not just Asian-Americans. I highly recommend this class, and I cannot recommend Professor Lui enough.",
    "This class provides fantastic insight to Asian American history, something that most people have very little exposure to. Professor Lui delivers organized and engaging lectures-- definitely bring your laptop to take notes because she goes fast! There's a lot of reading, but it is usually interesting. The written assignments are very manageable. You do not have to be Asian American to gain a lot from this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's an overview of Asian American history, which a lot of people don't know much about. This course is great in that not many people know about Asian American history and exclusion, and this course highlights an important group of people in America and how Asians, with all of their diversity, have come to be grouped as one. There are a lot of readings, however, and they're all very interesting, but it's difficult to keep up with them.",
    "Yes yes yes yes yes. I didn't want to take Asian American history despite being Asian, but I needed a writing credit and it was the only one that fit in my schedule. I'm really happy I took this class. Being Asian American, but being on the fringe of Asian American culture, it's always been sort of hard to have an \"identity.\" While it's something I still search for, knowledge of Asian American history has put so much into perspective. This class is so amazing and I would honestly recommend it to anyone, but I think it especially hits home for Asian Americans.Mary Lui is also an amazing professor. She didn't just present a mere chronological history of Asian Americans, but she put it all into context, of the time period, political climate, and other factors. This is an incredible class. There are so many reasons to recommend it. :)",
    "This is a fantastic and very coherent course. The readings are incredibly interesting. There is a wonderful balance between novels, newspaper articles, court cases, movies, oral interviews, and historical essays. It does not just focus on Chinese Americans. It really covers every Asian American group you can think of - Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, Hmong. You spent time on each of these groups. You also get to do an oral interview final project which is fun, though difficult to write.This is just an incredibly compelling, moving, and educational course. This is history that you missed in high school, but very important history.",
    "If you're willing to read about 200 pages a week, go to lecture twice a week plus a section, and write a whole bunch, this class will be one of the more informative history courses you take at yale and will hone your ability to make a good argument based on a vast array of primary and secondary source evidence. This class raises the bar for what a history class should be. Sometimes I was overwhelmed by the amount of work I was supposed to do, but this just taught me to be more efficient.",
    "Take it! We have to understand that the U.S. is not just black and white.",
    "I would definitely recommend History 183 for someone interested in ethnicity issues in American history.",
    "Very tough class with a lot of reading.",
    "Good course for anyone hoping to learn more about Asian American history because Professor Lui does an excellent job covering a great deal of history in a short amount of time. However, it is a history class, so for people hoping to discuss contemporary sociological aspects of Asian American studies, it may be a bit dry. You don't really reach the late 20th century till the last week. Overall great lecturer and good class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class as a perspective on the history of Asian Americans. It was really well-taught, engaging material, and a good way to get a WR. A weakness was the structure of the assignments; while challenging and a great opportunity to use the knowledge we were acquiring, they were not well-spaced. The mid-term exam and paper were due 1 week apart, and the final exam and final oral history paper were 10 days apart - that made for 27 pages of writing and an exam in the equivalent of 2 weeks, so it was a lot in two separate chunks. I just thought those could be spread out better. I like the fact that the final was an essay exam - it really helped me draw the course together and come to some sort of conclusion. The weekly reading assignments and responses were manageable, but getting through entire books in a week was challenging when those were assigned. It's easily 100-400 pages of reading per week.",
    "Asian American History is an amazing class. You should definitely take it before you graduate. I think it's a great class for any student, but it's especially relevant to Asian American students' lives, and will change your perspective on history and Asian American issues. Professor Lui is great. She's not the most engaging professor, and her classes are always jam-packed with material (so they feel somewhat rushed at times), but they're definitely worth it. Lectures were never boring, and I always looked forward to the next one. Section was also extremely helpful, and I never felt like I was wasting my time. There's a lot of reading and writing, but it's definitely worth it. I read most of the readings and found them to be pretty interesting. Take advantage of Professor Lui and your T.A.'s office hours -- they are great resources and will give you really useful feedback on your papers. But be warned that the \"take-home final\" is really a 10 page paper that's sprung on you during finals week (less than a week after the 10 page final paper is due). But I really enjoyed researching and writing all of the papers for the class, especially the oral history (also, this class is a WR credit). Although you have to put in a lot of work, I cannot emphasize how good this class is, especially for someone who is interested in Asian American issues and\/or American history in general.",
    "yes i woeuld highly recommend this course to anyone",
    "I'm pretty pro-America. This course was a great way of convincing me to relinquish some of my patriotism. Some pretty scary stuff in American history and present happened, with respect to anti-Asianism, stuff that you don't hear about in media because of racial formation and other things you'll learn about in this course.If you're looking for more reasons for why America sucks, then this is your course. If you're convinced of that thesis already, then look elsewhere."
