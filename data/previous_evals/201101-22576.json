   "comments": [
    "Great class! Not on easy one but definitely worth it. Even if you think you already know a lot about global health or think the work load is too heavy, if you're interested in global health you should take it just because Kaveh is so awesome- definitely my favorite professor at Yale. Ultimately, the class has been one of my favorites over the past 4 years.",
    "There are such few global health classes offered to students, it's such a shame that this one was just not good. I was already interested in health before taking it, but I could see how someone whose trying to get an idea if they like it would be totally turned off by thesubject. It's disorganized, you don't learn anything. Get rid of the weekly response, have a final and not a final project, and try to cover a lot less material and then maybe it'll be a good class.",
    "YESThe class provides a great foundation in Global Health and covers a variety of topics, which is the great part because you don't feel like you're stuck learning one thing all semester, and it doesn't get boring.Also, this class has brought in some of the best guest speakers I have come across. I also like how well spread out all the assignment deadlines are, and how they walk you through getting the group assignment done. Never felt like I was rushing the night before a deadline to get the work done.",
    "DEFINITELY! If you are even remotely interested in public\/global health, you HAVE to take this class. It is an excellent introduction to the the field of public health and one of the most rewarding learning experiences at Yale. The coarse load is decent, two 5-page policy briefs, reading responses and a group project due at the end of the semester. However, everything is so well spaced out that it never feels like there is too much work. Kaveh is amazing and you must take a class with him before you graduate.",
    "If you're obsessed with global health issues and know that's exactly what you want to do, take it. If you don't really know, take some other class to figure it out.",
    "Interesting overview of global health that you probably already knew if you made it pass the enrollment cut. There's no systematic understanding that you gain from this course because the field is so new. Might as well take a different Yale course.",
    "I recommend this course if you are looking for an overview of global health. It involves a lot of reading but is not difficult if you have written policy memos before. There is a group project that, despite the multiple deadlines, is stressful and large. The professor is a wonderful man who is very knowledgable and worth getting to know.",
    "This is a great introduction to global health taught by a very intelligent professor. I really had very little background on global health but came away with a lot of knowledge on all of the actors and processes that were involved in approaching a global health issue and implementing an effective solution. It really opened up my eyes in some ways. I definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about how health is affected by not just medicine but by economics, politics, and culture.",
    "Wait until they greatly improve this class before taking it. I went in really excited about global health and didn't feel like I got much out of the class, and left feeling very disgruntled, feeling that everything is about politics, which I have little interest in.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who has a strong interest in global health because chances are, if you have an interest, you probably already know most of the superficial content of this class. This class is marketed as a survey foundational course, but honestly it is much less than that. It is a class for someone who has little to no experience reading or learning about global health. It is a very superficial course with arbitrary assignments, so don't expect to gain a lot from this class.",
    "Global Health is a great class, and a must-take for anyone who is planning to go into public health. Professor Khoshnood is a professor at the School of Public Health, and his approach is very distinct from that of most professors from the College- this is probably one of the most practical classes you'll take as an undergrad. Be prepared to be expected to write policy briefs and project proposals like a pro (I definitely wasn't, and it was sometimes a scary experience, but ultimately very worthwhile), and know that working in groups (especially for the big final project) is a large component of the course. There are tons of guest speakers, and while there is a lot of reading, it's not strictly necessary to do all of it, and it is almost all extremely interesting and worthwhile. Don't be intimidated if there's a high turnout and the class is capped! Fight your way in!",
    "An intro to global health.",
    "Great course, very useful survey of a range of issues\/topics related to Global Health. Well-taught, and very interesting.I would recommend this course very highly to anyone with an interest in global health, whether or not they have a lot of science\/biomedical experience.",
    "An interesting overview of topics inGlobal Health, drawing a mixture of pre-med and international studies types. Aimed primarily at freshmen and sophomores, and very useful in preparing for internships or jobs in the field of development or health work abroad. The course teaches one to question more than it provides answers, but also has a lot of practical wisdom. Writing skills for memos and briefs are sharpened to a particular style that differs from some academic papers, but will be needed in writing samples for jobs. Some guest speakers were great, others rambling. Kaveh Khoshnood and Samantha Diamond, the TF, worked well together and created a sense of community around the class."
