    "This class is a good snapshot of the major defining moments of American immigration history and some of the major issues in debate currently. I would recommend to someone who knows some stuff about immigration but wants to delve a little more deeply into the issues.",
    "Amazing class. Laura Barraclough is a sweet lady. A two hour seminar can sometimes drag, especially when it's all discussion, but the topic is interesting. I wish we had more structure. It's still a great way to get a writing credit, and I learned a lot. The workload is weekly readings\/maybe a film, but only a take home midterm, a research proposal (which makes you think about your final paper sources beforehand which is nice before cramming to get it done) and a final paper. Fifteen pages was intimidating at first for me, but immigration is so broad that it was actually a simple paper. Overall great class!",
    "Yes!!!",
    "Take AMST 383 if you're interested in the history of US Border and Immigration policy. Don't take AMST 383 if you want to study the current immigration system. The class is well worth your time for the former, not for the latter.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Immigration is one of the most important political issues confronting America today, yet most of the people involved in the discussion aren't aware of the history of how immigration policies have played out in this country. The texts you read in this class are crucial to an understanding of our current social context, and are also incredibly informative in terms of being aware of the circumstances in which minority communities have historically found themselves. People come into the class with a diversity of perspectives, experiences, and prior knowledge, so discussions are always stimulating.",
    "Great class for students without much of a background in immigration; very accessible and interesting. I wish the class had been a bit broader than what became a focus on US Mexico immigration, and expanded to be more about other U.S. immigration, but overall a very manageable and interesting class."
