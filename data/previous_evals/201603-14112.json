   "comments": [
    "I did not truly know Shakespeare before I took this course. Any lecture course on Shakespeare's tragedies and histories pales in comparison to what Professor Bromwich was able to do in class. I developed a newfound ability to not just see the plot and the themes of each play, but truly get inside the head of the characters. The final, 20-page paper for the course was also a good experience and helped me see what a senior thesis might be like. There aren't many courses at Yale about which I would say the following, but this course is undoubtedly one of them: this class was life-changing, and has made me a better person and scholar.",
    "I gained insight into prominent political ideas that were at play in Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. My analytical writing was sharpened, and I learned some political philosophy",
    "I have learned so much from this course. I took this on whim because my suitemate highly recommended Professor Bromwich's class and also because I thought it would be interesting to learn about Shakespeare from a political perspective (being a political science major myself). I read Shakespeare like any kid in the American school system but never really \"got it.\" In this course, I discovered for myself why Shakespeare's plays are so timeless, that is, relevant to contemporary life and our human thoughts and achievements. It taught me how to really appreciate Shakespeare and beyond that, how to examine and analyze literary works from a myriad of angles- political, psychological, literary, philosophical...etc.",
    "I was able to read into the political themes of Shakespeare's plays, considering each holistically and through close-reading. I developed a sense of precision in the words I use to articulate these themes, and I worked on reading into them across the plays.",
    "I used to actively dislike Shakespeare. Professor Bromwich made me think it's amazing. Got the guidance I needed to write my first 20-page paper and the confidence to do so.",
    "I learned a great deal about writing and analyzing literature, especially within the specific vein of reading Shakespeare's plays."

   "comments": [
    "This class is taught as a lecture around a seminar table with lots of reading from the text, which is great if you really want to engage with what is on the text but not great if you're really trying to figure out what it means. It didn't talk much about anything \"political\" past the first few plays.",
    "This course might be better distinguished from ENGL 201 with Professor Kastan (which I took concurrent to this class). The readings overlap a good deal, and although the teaching styles are very different, I was often wishing the POLITICAL aspects of each play were highlighted to a greater degree than they were. The course is labelled with the word political, but all I could see that was political in this course was their content, nothing about HOW we analyzed them was political in format. That said, the strengths of this course are abundant. Each play is really delved into (deeper than either the ENGL 200 or ENGL 201 courses do) and the class begins to see how to read scenes, single words, and draw rich meaning from them. The best thing about this course is how fluid it is, how one topic bleeds into another and another. It was insightful without feeling rigid. As seminars go, this is a hidden gem in the English department, not just for the plays read but for the thoroughness with which they are read. I've never felt, leaving a class, like I wanted to read all the plays AGAIN!!",
    "It's just a really good class.",
    "Strengths: intertextuality allowed the class to to trace various political concepts, e.g. the theory of the King's two bodies, rulers' obligations to subjects. The class allowed for much discussion, which provided a breadth of perspectives given the various academic backgrounds presence. Also, the writing instruction was helpful. Also, I imagine that the course was accessible to students of different Shakespeare background. The course could serve as a survey or a interdisciplinary function based on one's knowledge of Shakespeare and political theory No real weaknesses, although some secondary literature in the beginning would have been welcome. I imagine this might have strengthened class discussions.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This course was well organized and extremely well taught. I appreciated the various stresses on different facets of the material, considering more than one argument from a dramatic or a political perspective. I appreciated that we were not boxed into set interpretations of the plays but were encouraged to read the text as the text and work originally from there.",
    "Professor Bromwich is amazing. AMAZING. I could listen to him talk about Shakespeare all day. Though this class is technically a seminar, it's really more of a mini-lecture because Professor Bromwich loves to talk about the plays. Not really a strength or weakness, just something to note. That being said he speaks with so much passion that it's hard not to be swept up in his enthusiasm!",
    "As the course is a writing credit, a slight additional to the level of writing support might be good."

    "This class is great if you love Shakespeare, but be prepared to read a play a week and discuss briefly in class. You don't have to engage much in class, but the papers are kind of taxing if you opt for just the twenty page paper and not much else in the course. This is a cool CR\/D course.",
    "A great class on the greatest plays, taught by America's last public intellectual. What more could an English major wish for? I would ABSOLUTELY take this course. It won't give you the same Elizabethan context than either the ENGL 200 or ENGL 201 Shakespeare classes have, but Professor Bromwich goes so much deeper into the plays than the lectures do you won't regret it. Pretty much every word he says in class is pure gold, and I have more quotes written down from Bromwich in class than I do Shakespeare. The workload is around 1 play each week, and Bromwich doesn't race you through them; you go act by act through each play, examining individuals scenes. If you want to stand in the presence of double greatness (Shakespeare and Bromwich) and come away a more adept analyzer of literature in general, take this course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course. If you're already a Shakespeare fanatic, it goes without saying that you'll love it. If you're more ambivalent about Shakespeare, you won't be after taking this course. Bromwich is brilliant and always happy to meet (really, he's fantastic--take literally anything with him), and if you leave this course without at least an appreciation for Shakespeare (you don't have to worship him [I don't]), it's probably because there's something wrong with you, not with him. The course is faithful to its advertised political focus, but that focus never feels restrictive, nor does it stifle discussion of other, not strictly political themes in the plays. The reading (a play per week) is substantial, but by no means excessive. Writing-wise, the course requires just two papers, one of two pages, another of 20. Plus it fulfills a pre-1800 requirement for you English majors. In short, take it.",
    "Absolutely--this was a fantastic course for students with varying backgrounds in Shakespeare. You read one play a week, from Richard III to Antony and Cleopatra, and discussions range from issues of rulership, republicanism, and the intersection of drama and politics. Would highly recommend if you have background in political philosophy. Professor Bromwich is top-notch and brought enthusiasm to every discussion. He also thought through the concepts tackled in the course alongside the students, and he appropriately directed our attention to the most important sections of the plays. You have flexibility in choosing paper topic, which was useful given the varying student interests in the course. Highly recommend",
    "Take this course! This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and it makes me wish I am an English major.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! If one has any interest in Shakespeare and in looking through the lens of politics at even greater issues of character and human interaction, this course is a must. Furthermore, Professor Bromwich pushes one to pinpoint one's exact thought-- so you will be sure to leave this class as a more articulate scholar.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Bromwich is AMAZING. Take this class with him! He's passionate and enthusiastic and crazy intellectual. It's more of a mini-lecture than it is a true seminar, but Professor Bromwich has so much to say that you hardly even notice. There's just one big paper (or the option to do two shorter ones)-- I recommend the 20-page paper. Professor Bromwich was willing to work with me on it and give me plenty of guidance, and his enthusiasm made it fun!",
    "Certainly the course was a great bit of exposure to Shakespeare, led by a competent and engaging instructor."
