    "Taking this class is a joy. The books are, on the whole, very enjoyable to read, and the depth of analysis that you will reach in seminar is astounding. Professor Marcus is an incredible teacher: her passion for the subject matter, her brilliant insights, and the liveliness of the class discussions will really make these books come alive. The weekly presentations take a lot of work, so read closely and plan concise comments in advance. Still, the 13 class meetings will go quickly, so enjoy every moment. If you put a lot into this class, the payoff is tremendous.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because it offers a very deep knowledge on the major issues regarding the study of the Twentieth Century Italian Literature."
