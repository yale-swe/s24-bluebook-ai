    "If you're a prospective English major, take this class. Even if you're not a prospective English major, I highly recommend taking this class. It's a lot of reading, but totally worth it. It'll help you build a great foundation for understanding pretty much every work in the \"Western Cannon.\"",
    "Yes, absolutely. One of the best and most rewarding classes I've ever taken. What I learned in this class will stay with me the rest of my life.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially with Walsh. The grading isn't too hard, but the material is plenty challenging. Only take on this course if you're interested in investing yourself in the readings. If you are, then enjoy, this is a fun course! Wish there could be more time to spend discussing each work though...",
    "ENGL 130: Epic in the European Literary Tradition, is a comprehensive overview of many great works in the canon of Western literature that generally focuses on the epic and its many transmogrifications throughout changes in literary styles and leanings. It's not a course simply about the epic, in all its epicness -- it's about how the original epics shaped European literature and the ramifications of its widespread legacy in works centuries later. I would recommend this course to the brave college student who isn't afraid of hefty reading loads and the writing style of James Joyce; though I personally did not enjoy the texts as much as I did in Tragedy (ENGL 129), I still felt that I learned a great deal about the development of Western literature and its complex negotiations\/re-negotiations with the looming specter of legacy.",
    "Brian Walsh is a fantastic professor, and should you get the chance to take this course with him, I would highly recommend that you do so. Professor Walsh has a very good tempo, and always has something constructive to say to each student contribution in class. Look through the syllabusif these works truly interest you, then the amount of reading should not dissuade you. The reality is that this reading can be completed quite efficiently by reading an average of 40 pages a day during the week, which isn't all that much compared to most other english courses. The key is to get as much reading done on the weekend, so as to reduce your reading during the week. All considered, this was my favorite English course, as it pushed me to read works I wouldn't ordinarily read outside of an academic setting. Additionally, the themes that these works present appear incessantly in our daily lives. Lastly, Professor Walsh makes class fun by not only leading our discussions with rich historical contextualizations, but also by allowing the students to discuss among themselves, often understanding the value of peer-to-peer interactions.",
    "This class is A LOT of reading, but really engaging. I'm premed and took it in a 5.5 credit semester, so I had trouble doing all of the reading, but I enjoyed the discussions and the workload wasn't bad. (4 of 6 4-5 page essays)."
