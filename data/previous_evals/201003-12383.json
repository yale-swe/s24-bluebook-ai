   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend, especially if it's taught by Chris, who is the best. Like all theory classes, homework takes a substantial amount of time. That said, this class will teach you how to analyze Romantic music and help you better understand how composers write. If you like Romantic music (or just music in general) take this course, even if you're not a music major, which I'm not. But warning: it's a lot of work, so with a bad teacher, it could be terrible.",
    "If you're lucky enough to have Christopher White as your teacher, you'll love the class. Music Theory classes depend a LOT on your professor, so your best bet is to just shop around and look for one you like. If you don't have to take Music 211 as a required class, only take it if you like your professor - some professors can make it a lot of boring work. Chris though, makes it not-so-much pretty-fun work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The harmonic techniques covered help you to better understand and learn pieces.",
    "MUSI 211 is a great introduction to romantic era harmony and tonality. If you take it, absolutely take it with Chris White. Every topic and lecture is both extremely interesting and immensely useful in the analysis and composition of romantic and contemporary era works.",
    "I was very glad I took this class. After taking the theory placement exam, I was placed into my choice of 210 or 211. After shopping 211, I thought the course might be too difficult for me, but I stuck with it, regardless. It was the best decision I made this semester. Prior to taking this course, I had never really composed (anything), so the composition projects terrified me. However, they became the most rewarding and worthwhile activities. The final composition project was the most fun I've had doing any of my coursework. In my opinion, the subject matter of 211 is infinitely more interesting than that of 210, mostly because my musical interest do not lie in the classical or baroque periods. The material is hard, but the workload (with Chris) is manageable.Chris was an excellent instructor. His lectures were accessible and interesting, and he was great about seeing students outside of class. He is extremely understanding about helping students, but the lack of \"strictness\" does not detract at all from the material learned. I would highly recommend taking any course that Chris teaches.This was probably my most enjoyable course this semester.",
    "The course more or less covers the theory of music of the first half of the nineteenth century, focusing on Schumann and Chopin with some songs by Schubert. I enjoyed going to class and doing the assignments, but I'm not sure how much I got out of it. I liked that Chris White encouraged us in his choice of assignments to think harder and on our own about the music we listened to, but this kind of thinking is not really the focus of the syllabus, and I didn't learn very much that will help me be a better performer.",
    "DEFINITELY! You learn a bunch of new chords from the Romatic idiom, do a lot of part-writing exercises for homework, and analyze great pieces in class (Schubert and Schumann lieder, Chopin piano etudes and preludes, etc.)I loved learning the new chords, using them in model compositions, and learning how to go about analyzing a piece; that being said, the entire structure of the course depends on who you take it with. I took it with Chris White, and he's really fabulous.As far as workload goes in his section, it's pretty heavy; expect a worksheet that takes about 2 hours every class (twice a week), 2 big compositions, an analysis essay, a test, and occasionally journal articles to read.",
    "This is a great course. It\u0092s really cool to learn about a lot of things that are foundational for a lot of pieces you\u0092ve performed but more advanced that what you would have learned in 205, 210, or AP. Our focus was Romanticism\u0097mostly German, but with a healthy dose of Chopin. Basically, we learned about the development of tonality in the Romantic period. By the time we got to \u0093Tristan und Isolde\u0094 we were seeing how this development would pave the way for the collapse of tonality in the 20th century (although we didn\u0092t work on any atonal music). A lot of the course was spent on cool chords, modulation techniques, and chromaticism. We also talked about text setting. The three bigger projects were: a piano-and-voice song in which we had to set a poem of our choice to a Schubert-style lied, an analytical essay about a Schubert song, and the composition of a song incorporating a bunch of different techniques we learned about this semester. You really get to be creative, and the work is so unlike what you do for other classes! Chris White is fantastic\u0097I honestly looked forward to going to class twice a week and seeing what he would have in store for us. He\u0092s hilarious, and class is consistently enjoyable. Possibly the most fun course I\u0092ve taken at Yale."
