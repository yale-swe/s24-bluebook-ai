    "Basic macro skills and the basic math concepts behind them. Understand the basics of economics.",
    "I learned so much about how to be a successful Yale student in this class. Tolga does an amazing job keeping the class interesting, and his knowledge and experience is unparalleled in this class. He gave us so much priceless advice about how to be a student, study, and work in an efficient manner.",
    "microecon",
    "Having taken AP Economics last year, this course was perfect to reenforce my understanding the core concepts and extend them further to help me see the underlying connections not all of which I understood last year. I particularly valued the ample examples Tolga provided to illustrate the concepts, revealing how even a simple understanding of economics can illuminate the logic behind major successes and failures in business and economics.",
    "How to ask for help for QR classes, how to teach myself from the book, how to beg the teacher for help.",
    "I learned about economics on a personal scale and business\/company related level and applied my knowledge in real life examples.",
    "A good intuition for economic phenomena at the individual level.",
    "I believe that by taking this course, I've learned the basics and foundations of Microeconomics, as well as observational and analytical skills that can be applied outside the classroom.",
    "I feel like I have a deeper understanding of the basic frameworks governing economic systems",
    "This course has given me a new way of thinking that I can apply to all aspects of my life. I've learned how to make better choices and make the most use of the resources I have.",
    "I gained great economic intuition from taking this class, and I learned many ways in which to apply that intuition to my world.",
    "I gained a very good understanding of Economics basics, and now I feel ready to take harder Econ classes in the future.",
    "basic ability to visualize and understand broad economic concepts, an intro to economic math, and behavorial economics"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very organized. It is easy to see what needs to be done to get a good grade, but the trick is committing enough time and effort to do well.",
    "Teacher and textbook are all useful, and assignments are manageable. However, the end of the class was rushed, but is understandable given how at the margin Tolga values giving life advice more, which is absolutely sweet and caring of him.",
    "Strengths: Almost always very engaging. Tolga takes breaks when he notices that students are not paying attention, and will re gather the class after a momentary pause. Weakness: Sometimes he would run over class time, which makes some students late to their next class. When he realizes he is running late, sometimes he will cover alot of material very quickly.",
    "The course is well structured, and the problem sets are helpful and effective compliments to the material. The textbook is also well done, not too difficult to read, and generally clear in its explanations. However, at times the lecture moves a bit too fast and while Tolga answers most questions well, the concepts are still in the dark until I read the textbook.",
    "Strengths: small class size makes conversation and asking questions easier, goes in-depth and is very informational and makes students more economically cognizant, Tolga makes the class and material more fun with his life examples and digressions, Tolga is very open about giving help and wants us to succeed Cons: Tolga goes sorta fast during class, although the book is the best in the business it's sort of hard to understand, there are tons of students that have taken Econ AP and ruined the curve.",
    "I thought this course was amazing, I learned so much in a short amount of time. I did think it moved very quickly however especially when there wasn't sufficient focus on each topic equally.",
    "Strengths: many. Tolga is great. Easy to fall behind during producer theory because it is a lot of content, but Tolga is a wonderful educator. Weaknesses: maybe two midterms rather than one, and a little more time spent on externalities. But hard to complain with such an amazing teacher in Tolga.",
    "The strength of Microeconomics in general is that it can be seen in our daily lives. Theories we learn in class can be seen in varying degrees in everyday life. This course in particular is able to highlight this very well, the textbooks and problem sets especially. One weakness of the course in particular is that the gap between the theories and general graphs we learn and the actual problems we are tasked with solving on problem sets and exams is very big.",
    "Strengths: covers a great deal of information clearly and concisely Weaknesses: information sometimes is given to quickly or all at once, making it difficult to absorb",
    "I feel like it'd be nice to have more practice problems available, but other than that this is a stupendous course. It has convinced me of my chosen major path.",
    "This class has a very strong professor. It could be improved by having a less competitive curve.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is a small seminar so we get to understand concepts better. The weakness of the course was that there was so much material to cover so we went very fast.",
    "Very engaging teacher who understands the mind of a college freshman and makes class interesting and relevant. Nothing comes to mind for improvements. Small class size is ideal and gives the class its intimate character."

   "comments": [
    "Seminars help you learn more than lectures. Tolga is an engaging teacher, and he takes time to make things interesting with life story and drawn-out examples, which is a double-edged sword, at the end of the day. Self-study would fill any gaps left, and overall I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting, even past the material, and it is great to get to know Tolga. He makes the class worth it. Sit in the front and do the Psets and you will do fine in the class.",
    "Ipe",
    "Take it, this is a great class! I was debating between the seminar and the lecture, but I'm really glad I ended up taking the seminar. Tolga is an awesome professor. His teaching style is clear and easy to follow. He's also very available to help you out, holding extensive office hours each week for the problem sets and great reviews before the exams. It's not an easy class, but it's designed to be very fair. The exams were challenging, but straightforward and mostly based off of the notes and problem sets. The more work you put into it, the better you'll do.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The seminar offering of the course is particularly useful to allow for asking questions and clarifying understanding during the class period. Furthermore, the smaller student enrollment in the course encourages one to learn the material well, since the curve is harsher than that of the lecture.",
    "It depends how much the student is willing to work and what their previous level of Econ is. I didn't take econ before entering the class so I was entirely confused while many students easily understood what was happening. Overall yes, I would recommend, but with reservations.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was intellectually stimulating and engaging and I learned a lot. I don't plan to do anything Economics related and took this course for fun (it wasn't really fun but it was informative) and don't regret it.",
    "Absolutely. With Tolga this is a magnificent course. He has taught the course so many times and is just a master educator in microeconomics by this point. Class is engaging and the seminar makes you pay attention. From chatting with friends in the lecture, the small classroom environment really helps you learn the material at a deeper levels and prevents you from zoning out. Tolga is very kind and flexible. He will let you attend any meeting time of the section to accommodate changes in your schedule and his office hours are extremely helpful with the psets. A great man to talk to who really takes an interest in his students. The only downside is the curve. It's harder than the lecture, because it attracts students who love Econ and fewer people fall behind in the course. But it's doable even with no experience and in my opinion worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially over the lecture alternative because it is more engaging and fosters a better opportunity to develop a passion for economics.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning economics",
    "The knowledge and skills given by this course can apply to all facets of life. I'm sure that anyone would benefit by taking this course.",
    "The professor is absolutely amazing and it helped me learn microeconomics so well and to such a deep degree for an introductory class.",
    "For people who have never taken Econ before, this class is really good.",
    "Absolutely yes. Would recommend to every student.",
    "Yes definitely!! But only if that student really likes economics and\/or is dedicated to learning a lot. Talking with students who took the lecture class, you learn so much more by taking the seminar, which is great if you really want to go in-depth in microeconomics. I took the AP Micro test in high school and I could've skipped this class, but honestly I recommend for freshmen to still take it. This class goes way more in-depth than your AP Micro class went, and there is no rush to finish your econ prerequisites."
