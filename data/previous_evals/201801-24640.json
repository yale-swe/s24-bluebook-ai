The weakness of the class in my opinion was that it was a little unclear in terms of how the content was organized, although this was the first year so some growing pains are expected."

    "Absolutely! ASL is such an engaging and intriguing language to learn. Jessica does an incredible job getting students involved and truly inspires you to learn more about ASL and Deaf culture!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes! Jessica is great and always available to help. I learned a ton and my asl improved a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Despite being a level 2 class of a pilot program, there is something to be learned for people at all levels. It is a very fun and social class, which is always engaging.",
    "Definitely! The professor is wonderful and the class was interactive and highly informative.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student on the basis that they are interested in learning sign language. Otherwise, taking this class would not make sense. It is a fairly chill class that allows you to practice an interesting language.",
    "Absolutely. The instructor is amazing, and the course itself was fun, engaging, and informative. ASL is so different from any other language, and it requires you to think in a completely different way than you do in any other Yale course\/subject."
