    "A broad overview of environmental law and policy - I didn't learn any skills, but the course definitely packed in a lot of knowledge",
    "I now have a very broad working knowledge of environmental law (statutory and administrative) in the US, and some knowledge of global environmental law as it relates to climate negotiations and trade. I also developed the skills of writing a concise but well-thought out policy memo with specific recommendations.",
    "I gained a ton of knowledge about the history of environmental law as well as its drawbacks.",
    "I learned about Professor Esty's business-based approach to improving environmental regulation, though I'm not sure I was persuaded by his stance.",
    "I learned a lot in this course as a non law student. In particular, I really liked the way Professor Esty constantly tied case and law details to the broader themes we were examining throughout the course.",
    "Learned the entire history of environmental law in the United States.",
    "This course gave me a great background of knowledge in US environmental law and policy.",
    "Comprehensive background of the history and application of U.S. environmental law. Note that the class does NOT cover environmental law in an international context, save for a few lectures at the very end, all of which are connected to the U.S. system. It also does NOT teach students how to read laws and directly engage with legal materials. Instead, it provides a more practical basis for understanding U.S. environmental law and especially the court cases that have contributed precedent to the current system.",
    "more detailed knowledge about the specifics of only a few of the biggest federal environmental laws",
    "Learned a significant amount about Law",
    "How to read analytically. Deep reading between the lines to really grasp the context of the passage or the case.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester. I came in with very little context regarding the environmental law and policy makeup of the US and this was a wonderful course to get acquainted with that system.",
    "A thorough history of key U.S. environmental laws, policies, and cases, particularly since 1970. A fast history of key U.S. environmental laws prior to 1970. A fast history of international environmental treaties.",
    "This was a a very comprehensive overview of the whole environmental law landscape.",
    "I gained an understanding of the full array of US environmental laws, key environmental court cases, and general regulatory concepts\/frameworks.",
    "Overall understanding of important legal cases and statutes in environmental law, both national and global",
    "A broad understanding of key environmental statutes at the federal, state and local levels. I learned about the policy-making process and the many successes and challenges of environmental law overall.",
    "After starting this course with minimal understanding of law and policy, I gained a base understanding of the statutes, trends, and workings of environmental law. This course also allowed me to develop writing skills through policy memos and introduced me to reading law cases.",
    "I got a further understanding of the significance of environmental law and of which court cases have shaped our environmental laws today. I also now have a better understanding of how court proceedings work and what can come of them.",
    "I developed my knowledge of the history of environmental law in the United States including pivotal legislation and court cases. I also improved my ability to write concise policy memos.",
    "A history and modern context of environmental law in the united states.",
    "I learned the importance of engaging different levels of government, private entities, and international institutions when creating strong environmental legislation. I was pushed to memorize more than I expected and hope I'm able to keep that knowledge with me throughout the rest of my career. I was exposed to a method for evaluating if a policy is regressive. I was pushed to create two concise, tightly argued, policy memos and benefited from the process of researching and synthesizing that information.",
    "With zero background in law, this course gave me an initial introduction to American and environmental law.",
    "Overview of the landscape and evolution of major environmental laws in the United States and the international environmental law.",
    "I learned about the entirety of major US environmental law.",
    "Understanding of major environmental legislation in the United States and the legal basis\/arguments for it."

    "Exactly what I expected.",
    "They aligned well with my expectations and I used my knowledge from class throughout the semester to inform my policy recommendations in other classes (like Perspectives). I was surprised at how much the things I learned in ELP overlapped with what I was learning in other classes and in extracurriculars.",
    "Content aligned quite well with my expectations. It should be clarified in the description of the course that content is U.S. - centric.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One weakness, at least for me, was the fact that Esty doesn't use powerpoint. I couldn't get myself to focus for the entire class period without a visual aid and had trouble keeping track of where we were\/where we were going during his lectures.",
    "One weakness is the size of the class. The professors did a remarkably good job making it interactive, but it's really hard to actually participate when there are so many people in Bowers. Another weakness is the amount of reading - it's an impossible amount for any one person to do. Finally, it's really just unfortunate not to get any feedback from actual professors. TAs are the only ones reading your policy memos and final exams and I thought their grading could be really subjective. It would've been great to get feedback from Esty or Klee on at least one memo, and would've helped my learning (this stems from my first point that the class size is too big for that to be possible). The strengths were that Esty and Klee are really great lecturers, they have amazing anecdotes from their professional life, and are just really enthusiastic and willing to entertain differing opinions.",
    "Strength: Engaging and knowledgeable lecturers. Weakness: No structure to support students' learning throughout the course. Because it was structured like a law school class, FES students who aren't used to learning only for a massive final exam found it challenging to keep up with - and internalize - the coursework. Interim assignments would be very helpful. Also, the reading load was wildly unrealistic.",
    "I strongly believe this course should be restructured to have two 50-minute lectures and one 50-minute discussion section. Two 120 minutes a week does not ask students to analyze, critique, or substantively engage with the breadth of the material over the course of the semester. This class would benefit tremendously from small group discussions, which would improve students' learning and also help build a community of scholars committed to engaging across disciplines on the topics.",
    "Both professors were fantastic. As mentioned above, I really liked the focus on big-picture issues\/challenges. Maintaining this big picture focus was very impressive for a course where it could have been easy to get lost in the case\/law details.' My one constructive criticism is that I wish Professor Esty used slides. I know he views this as cheating, but even a list of terms and case names would be very helpful. There was several times this semester where Professor Esty would say a name quickly and everyone in my row was trying to figure out what he had said and miss the important message about why he had referenced the term or name. Even a single billeted slide stating the names and cases he was planning on referencing would be helpful.",
    "- Both professors were awesome and lectures were great. I enjoyed coming to class every time. - When studying for the final, I realized the somethings the cases were presented out of order by year. I think that when topics are discussed everything should go in order by year. One example was in regards to the regulatory takings section. We discussed the case of Dolan first then Nollan however Nollan comes before Dolan sequentially. - The two assignments are 2 page policy memos since Dan discusses how in the real world you need to write with brevity. Despite this belief, there is a TON of reading for this class. I would try to reduce the reading load - people are more likely to do the readings and learn from them if there is less.",
    "Strengths: -breadth of topics covered with overall themes to make it cohesive (eg what's working, what's not working, what does the future of environmental legislation look like, etc) Weaknesses: -this is course is a lot of material, and as a FES student I would have appreciated more explicit instruction at the beginning of the course about how to excel in a law class (eg form a reading group, take notes on cases as you go, utilize websites like Quimbee, how to write a policy memo, etc) -it was harder to follow Dan Esty's lectures and take good notes because of the lack of powerpoint. Any sort of structure of topics to use as headers (like Rob Klee's ppts) would have been helpful in organizing my notes",
    "Course is well-taught and quite comprehensive. Both instructors draw amply from their own extensive experience working in the field. Most of the classes are taught lecture-style, which fits with the content. That being said, it would have been appreciated if the professors integrated more opportunities for small group discussions that feed into a larger class discussion, rather than only opening up the floor to the entire class at once. This would allow the professors to cater to more students' learning styles.",
    "There is so much material in this class that the most important improvement would be to plan out and structure class time better, because a lot of it was devoted to specific anecdotes, and not to teaching us about important parts of the structure of laws and statutes. For a required FES class, it really is not fair on non-law students to not use in-class time effectively. Class time was usually less than a minute on most cases, and too much focused on (very interesting) anecdotes. I think also that optional weekly discussion groups with the TFs would REALLY help us to discuss the parts of laws or cases we don't understand before moving on.",
    "Not a lot of grades to ensure people are in good standing",
    "Lots of dense readings, but also necessary readings. So I would just encourage the professor at the beginning of the course to tell students to form reading groups in order to split up the readings and everyone will be able to stay on top of the notes.",
    "Both Professor Esty and Professor Klee are really great lectures and packed every class with useful materials. Having two instructors that covered different aspects of environmental law was also helpful in gaining multiple perspectives. The readings and class topics were so well organized and the casebook was a good resource to have. It would be helpful to have access to Professor Klee's lecture slides though",
    "The professors were extremely thoughtful, and engaged with the material. Their professional lives and teaching lives are synergetic, and they work hard to create a thoughtful, intense, course. More interactive \/ workshop type learning opportunities would have provided greater opportunity to engage intellectually with the material, as opposed to simply receive",
    "More content on the slides. It was good to have some slides and some not (esty) but for the powerpoints we did have, it would have been good to have more material on them.",
    "Far too much reading for every week - even just doing the required readings resulted in me either missing readings for my other classes, or suffering through multiple all-nighters just to get everything done. It needs to be cut back drastically.",
    "The course does a great job providing an overview of environmental law and policy. I really enjoyed hearing about both professors' own personal experience from their time in government. It's somewhat challenging for non-law students to get a handle on how to approach the reading, but that gets easier throughout the semester. One thing I noticed was that the TAs seemed to grade the policy memos differently from one another, and I'm not sure if the grading was entirely consistent after speaking with other students. But this was a slight quibble in what was overall a great class.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was the effectiveness of its professors, as I was impressed by the organization, dedication, and interest Professors Klee and Esty showed in this course, particularly in moments (RCRA, CRCLA) that could have been tedious under other professors. The primary weakness of this course was the incredibly broad nature of environmental law and policy, and I felt like the wide range of topics diluted the significance of each specific case or policy. Addressing this could be difficult, but I felt as though the course could have had fewer required readings from the Percival book, as the breadth of information held in its 1300 pages was overwhelming.",
    "There should of been more exams than the one at the end. The course really never pushed us to learn the material until the end of the semester.",
    "I found lectures interesting and the topics varied. I appreciate how much work went into crafting the syllabus, but the course could be improved by assigning fewer pages so that we could more deeply analyze the content. The Percival readings were too dense and challenging to cover even with a study group. I would have preferred assignments besides policy memos, such as legal memos, issue spotting essays, or if each student wrote papers on different laws and court cases and we shared all the materials.",
    "I really really wish Dan Esty would use slides, but I suppose that is not up for debate.",
    "The limited ability to discuss the material covered in class was a drawback but I understand that this resulted from the volume of material we needed to cover.",
    "Its very heavy on 3 assignments, without a process to help regularly check in that one is understanding the material. Its very lecture focused, so its hard to get a chance to really engage with the material, especially if one has no background in law.",
    "Loved the lectures. Powerpoints were not very effective tools but did required fastidious note taking. Assignments and readings may have been structured in a way to demand more regular engagement in the course.",
    "The class discussions could be structured more around legal argumentation rather than just understanding the legislation."

    "It will be overwhelming but you will get through it.",
    "Great course - highly recommend.",
    "-Organize your notes well and type them up every week so at the end of the semester you have a study guide -Write your policy memos early before the semester ramps up -Form a reading group and share notes on readings- it's impossible to do them all as one person -Pull lists and definitions of court cases, statues, and concepts as you go through the semester to help with studying at the end -Use Quimbee to read case briefs -Buy the Examples & Explanations on Environmental Law book- helpful and clear explanations of statutes",
    "Be prepared to absorb a LOT of material. Keep up with the textbook readings as much as possible. Engage with the lectures, rather than being a passive observer, and you'll learn more.",
    "Start making flashcards of cases and statutes Week#1 and do NOT fall behind.",
    "Make study groups and do the readings. If you put the effort into this class, you will learn a lot.",
    "Interact in class.",
    "International students might want to keep in mind that the course is very US-centric. However, you do learn a lot about the US legal system!",
    "To form study groups or reading groups to split up the reading assignments, so you wont spend 7+ hours a day reading 60+ dense pages. Create a list of all cases discussed in class for the final. The sooner you study for it, the better you will be ready for it.",
    "It isn't humanly possible to read everything assigned for this class. Study groups are really helpful in getting through the material and making sure that no important articles are missed. Having a clear organizational structure at the beginning of the class as to how the readings should be divided and organized will do wonders for managing the workload. I had a spreadsheet with the all the classes and readings, and in my study group of 6 people, we all wrote our names next to the readings we would be completing for that class. We also had a shared google folder with subfolders for each class that had separate documents for each of the readings.",
    "If you want an engaging course in environmental law and policy (particularly with a U.S. focus), this course is great: super well crafted and well taught.",
    "Its a basic framework that every F&ES student should have!",
    "Just be prepared for an insane amount of readings for each class. Definitely the move is to make a study group of a couple people, and have each person tackle some of the readings. Otherwise, you will not get everything covered.",
    "Share a copy of the Percival textbook and form a study group with clear expectations and group norms as soon as possible.",
    "Do not expect them to push you to learn the material because theres is only an exam at the end of the course so youre going to have to motivate yourself to learn on your own.",
    "Create a study group as soon as possible and split up the readings.",
    "Take good notes during class!",
    "Create a reading group to distribute the workload. I would have been unable to do all of the readings on my own. I would also recommend finding ways to write policy memos related to topics outside of the class that capture your interest.",
    "Stay on top of the reading and material as it moves fast and covers a very wide range of topics. You dont really get to dig into one, but will get a flavor of many topics around environmental law.",
    "If you think you need to know the major US environmental laws, definitely take it! A worthwhile class, if a little dry at times due to the nature of the material.",
    "Collating major legislation and cases is more important than detailed notes."
