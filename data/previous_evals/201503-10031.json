   "comments": [
    "She had great pastoral presence in class and guided the discussion well.",
    "Prof. Jones was easy to work with and a total joy. He lovingly facilitated the time for feedback after each us preached. He set the example by providing sincere and honest feedback, yet lovingly and respectfully. His experience and God-centered theology also enabled him to provide balanced and mature theological constructive criticism to all of us, where he saw that our homilies were theologically weak or off.",
    "Maria was very kind and honest. At times things took too much of an emphasis on her own experience and style than on the class, each outrunning their novelty by the end of the semester.",
    "Tim was a young and fresh voice in a class that otherwise felt very contrived and stale. He was supportive of diverse preaching styles and did a great job filling in for Tom Troeger. I'm very glad that I had him as a section leader. He's got a sense of humor and knows a whole lot about homiletics. He facilitated discussion, critique, and support. And he sang the Lion King a lot, which is pretty cool.",
    "I thought that Professor Tisdale always presented critique with compassion in our section. She always had instructive feedback that encouraged us to do better, and did a great job connecting student comments together during sermon critiques. She did a fantastic job facilitating a sense of community in the section and providing a pastoral presence in the context of the section. She was always open to feedback and genuinely wanted to know each of us, a rare thing for a professor at YDS.",
    "Strengths: Earned the respect of the section, gave honest feedback, encouraging leadership Weaknesses: Occasionally took too much time for her own comments at the start of section, sometimes only gave positive feedback instead of also criticism",
    "He's an amazing preacher and never hesitates to share his insights and the fruit of his study.",
    "Answered in Q 14",
    "Julie's strength at the preaching group session was her insight to see what is one's strong point at her\/his preaching, and she gave her comments on it. It was very helpful for me to improve my following preaching turn.",
    "Maria facilitated the sections nicely. She encouraged students to critique each other's sermons and then added her evaluation. The section was a very safe place to present my first sermons, in part due to Maria and in part due to the other students in the section. The feedback from all was very important and helpful.",
    "Maria was well prepared and enthusiastic in the section. She was open to listen, praise and prod us along when necessary. Our section was a cohesive unit by the end of the semester; willing to work well with one another in terms of being complementary and using constructive criticism. This is due to Maria's example."
