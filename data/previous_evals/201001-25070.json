    "A completely amazing class that will mess with your thinking. A definite recommendation to all!",
    "Summary:1. NOT A GUT2. Whomever said, in previous evaluations, that you start out with a bunch of math-heavy p-sets and then the math later gives way to more written\/philosophy work is a LIAR. The math stays; the pace is the same; if you don't like it during shopping period I promise you, it will not get better, so just go with your gut, so to speak.Humanities types:Do not take unless you are ready to WORK. HARD. On a skills-set that you probably don't have. Surrounded by computer science and math and philosophy majors. Your grade won't be great and you'll be out of your depth, pretty much the whole time.Math types:If you like the concept of infinity, take it, as the course is really rewarding to those who understand it, and I think that secretly the math kids found the math really easy, though the philosophy kids did not.",
    "If you like paradox and\/or complexity in any form at all, I would say at least check this class out. I think overall, I like the idea of the class better than the class itself, but I definitely got a lot out of it and have a whole bunch of weird ideas to think about, which more than finding a definitive answer I think I value philosophy more for.",
    "If you don't have a moderate math background, I wouldn't take this to get an easy QR: the set theory stuff can be tricky. Cool blend of philosophy and math but can get very frustrating because there's no resolution to questions. I suppose that's philosophy though.",
    "Take it! It seems hard at first with the math (if you're not a math person), but honestly, that's not really significant in the rest of the course.",
    "It's a class on several approaches to infinity. There's some math and lots of philosophy. In the first psets, you'll be asked about limits and functions, and near the end, you'll be evaluating arguments. There's a bit of everything. You'll like it. A good QR or Hu",
    "Don't take this course. The first half is math, which is easy and VERY BORING for the math\/CS kids and rather hard for the non math\/CS students (I am very impressed with non-mathers who did well on the psets). The second half is philosophy, but by this point everyone has gotten so used to zoning out or not understanding anything that it's sort of a loss.",
    "A little math-y at the beginning (set theory and finding bijections between two sets to prove they have the same cardinality). You don't really have to go to class--all the notes are provided. The midterm isn't very hard, and the final is an essay.",
    "Sure, if you're interested, take it cr\/d. If you're doing well, you can always switch.",
    "very math based at beginning, very difficult conceptually then as well as later into the course when math was left mostly behind. would recommend having a strong background in math for this course or have encountered set theory andor (but not as important) decision theory. math logic appeared to help those who were taking it at the same time (not me).",
    "If you are interested in some of the philosophical implications of pure math theory then go for it; you will not plumb everything that you could and you will be frustrated at times but it is well structured.Mixed recommendations: there are too many non-math people in the class.",
    "Not quite as good as it sounds. Some lectures are utterly fascinating, some will bore you to death. If you have a strong math background, don't take this class - you'll be bored.",
    "This is an interesting class that goes through a lot of really interesting complexities of the concept of infinity. The beginning is heavy on set theory, the 2nd half is more philosophical. I'm not really a math person, and took the class credit\/d. I could handle the math, but it definitely took some time on the problem sets. There isn't a lot of work though. I found the concepts really interesting, and I would definitely recommend it for an interesting QR.",
    "take it! totally abstract but you learn a lot of interesting stuff that will just blow your mind. yeah, the first few weeks are really mathey and incomprehensible, but the rest of the semester is fine.",
    "great for that Hu or that Qr. You'll probably learn more in section than lecture. Material is fun, but rather removed from other classes, so don't expect this to be a core field. Also check out the logic courses if that's the portion you're interested in, or game theory if that one is.",
    "Take this course, but definitely take it Cr\/D because the assignments are graded very harshly. And they don't take 2 hours like the syllabus says, they'll often take more.",
    "This is an excellent course. It has a wonderful balance of math and philosophy. The material is well organized and well taught. I loved this class. The problem sets were especially well done. They required much more interesting thinking about the ideas in the course than typical reading responses.",
    "This course tries to appeal to math and non-math types, and struggles to succeed. The material is interesting and thought-provoking, particularly towards the end, but ultimately it was frustrating and tiresome because the initial focus on math concepts went by too quickly for me to gain a clear grasp. Also, if you're a second semester senior, you will not care enough to put in the work, particularly if you're not a math person, and there's not enough to keep you engaged.",
    "It's ok. If you're a freshman\/sophomore and\/or need a QR then it's interesting to take. But experience philosophy\/ set theory students will probably find it redundant.",
    "A class that swings between being near-impossible for the non-math major and entirely do-able. I think the balance is good, though the set-theory at the beginning is rather tough and the mid-term is very difficult. However, it would be a shame if we did more set theory and missed out some of the philosophy.Take it if you want to have more mathmatical direction in your thought for any aspect of the humanities.",
    "The class material is incredibly fascinating, though the presentation leads to confusion and boring lectures. If you're interested in the inexplainable, take this class, but be prepared for uncertain grading.",
    "No.",
    "If you've ever enjoy pondering and debating abstract problems relating to infinity, like Zeno's Paradox, I definitely recommend PHIL 281. If you're a math person, the beginning few weeks of set theory may be a bit of a review, but the course eventually moves into other interesting topics (like paradoxes relating to time, space, motion, and decision theory) that are definitely worthwhile. Overall, not much work - one pset a week (takes 1-2 hours), reading an occasional paper, and writing one 5-7 page final paper. Overall, a fun, easy, and interesting course.",
    "First off, a lot of people take this class because they think it is a non-mathy way to get out of a QR requirement. While the Math portion of the class is fully contained in the first half of the class, it is set theory of sufficient difficulty that if you detest math, you should consider another course.That being said, the course overall is excellent, and while I was concerned that the beginning of the course meant that the philosophical discussion at the end of the course would be harmed, that was not the case. The class was very thought provoking, not a terrible burden when it comes to work, and overall great.The only problems was it sometimes seemed like a discussion of interesting mathematical concepts or interesting paradoxes, not always a study of Infinity. It also seemed that the set theory discussion was a little tangential. This would not deter me from recommending this course to people who are interested in both math and logical paradoxes.",
    "I would recommend Infinity to anyone who is interested in the more philosophical ramifications of math. Analytical skills, experience in set theory, and familiarity with proofs are all extremely helpful though not necessarily vital. You'll also have to endure your friends making puns about your class all the time.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. It was well-taught, but the material involved boring and, frankly, rather stupid questions, particularly in comparison to other philosophy classes I've taken at Yale. I would recommend someone interested in philosophy look elsewhere.",
    "Class felt very split between math folks and everyone else. As a math person I came to think that a lot of the philosophy was BS, although there were a few interesting situations. Lots of time spent going over set theory stuff, non math people can get in over their heads real fast",
    "I would recommend this course. Its course title is apt -- the class focuses on the idea of infinity (how to define this concept and reason about it) and its relation to other areas of philosophy (topology, probability, etc). And Professor Szabo is a very good, interesting teacher.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. In a word, it is cool. The workload isn't too bad, either. This lecture was a joy to attend, and I looked forward to it every week.",
    "A good and interesting course, but the material can get very challenging very quickly. Do not be mislead into thinking this is an easy course; the workload isn't that heavy, but it's hard."
