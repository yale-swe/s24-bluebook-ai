    "Great class, but not a gut. A quiz and a 2-3 hour problem set every week along with readings from the book and from material posted on classes v2. Prof. Gomez is great, really good lecturer and teacher.If you are interested in the future of the environment, and in the future of renewable energy you should definitely take the class.The quizzes are hard, the midterm demanding and the final really hard. But the problem sets were ok.",
    "If you are interested in this subject, this is a very interesting class - but be prepared. You have weekly quizzes that are incredibly difficult. Long problem sets. Several very challenging lab reports. A nearly impossible midterm, and an even more impossible final. And tons of minor annoying things to deal with along the way. For example, we were assigned a problem set from a book we had previously been told was completely optional and for outside reading. We weren't given any practice problems or previous exams to prepare for the final, so we all went in completely cold. Professor Gomez is a good lecturer, but his demands of the class are sometimes unreasonable. So as long as you know what you are getting into, it's worth checking out, because you actually do learn a lot of useful and important information.",
    "I would not recommend this class if you are not a science person or a science major.",
    "I would recommend this class only to someone interesting in engineering asa major. This person would not be a freshman, but rather someone who has taken a number of college level chemistry, physics, and\/or engineering classes.",
    "This is vital: DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND IN (at the very least) INTERMEDIATE PHYSICS. The syllabus was incredibly vague, and mentioned that it was a \"quantitative\" treatment of environmental science, but this clearly was a euphemism for a revival of medieval torture. The professor openly admitted to knowing very little about environmental science, and in fact borrowed most of his (very few) lessons on the environment from his colleagues (all due credit given though, of course). Don't let the prodigious cross-listing fool you: this class is MENG 101, supplemented by others' work on the environment. No more, no less. I entered this class knowing no physics, since the syllabus listed the prerequisites as \"Must have taken AP math and science classes\", which I fit. Bad move. Don't do this. I implore you. The class could have been infinitely improved had the syllabus been more clear and concise as to the actual curriculum and requirements. The problem sets were ludicrously long and convoluted, and made nearly impossible by the fact that the professor and TA refused to give us any reference examples in class or even as a simple handout. The class is supposedly geared towards \"freshman and sophomore non-science majors\", but I don't think I have ever heard a more egregious lie. Juniors and science-major sophomores populated the class, whereas, and I kid you not, every single freshman except for about 1 dropped the class by the end. At the very least, the professor had a sense of humor, but very little remorse, and more or less deferred all tutoring to his TA. Unless you have prior experience with physics and its relation to engineering, STAY. FAR. AWAY.",
    "The material and topics of this class were great, and stuff I feel is important for everyone to understand. However, it's poorly taught, so I would only recommend this class if you're probably not going to get another chance to learn this stuff. It wasn't much work, but produced a lot of stress. Very few students stayed until the end of the class. I'm glad I did.",
    "I am very interested in this material, and probably would have signed up for this course no matter who was teaching it. That being said, I would NEVER recommend this course, and I would never, NEVER, choose to take a course with Professor Gomez again.He was vague and condescending throughout the entire course. Despite the fact that the course was billed as a non-QR course, with no prerequisites, for non-science majors, the course is highly quantitative, and expects a extensive background in at least AP-level physics and chemistry.Gomez would call people out in class for asking questions, publicly humiliating them for their desire to understand the course material. Of course, asking questions is completely justified, especially given the cavalier manner in which he expects his students to instantly understand complex scientific information. I have innumerable anecdotes about his lack of consideration of his students (For example, he yelled at us as a class for not being able to find a time outside of class to meet, because he wanted to make up lectures HE had missed. Obviously the members of a lecture class won't be able to find a time that is mutual convenient, nor is it our responsibility to compensate for the professor's deficits.)His exams are horribly written; every person in the class stayed as long as possible into the final exam, largely because the exam brought up information we had never studied in class. Further, the questions were ambiguously worded and highly complex. Prof. Gomez usually either failed to understand or refused to answer the clarifying questions we repeatedly asked. When he did respond, his answers ere condescending and useless.Through this class, I learned a lot about a subject in which I am very interested. I would recommend that everyone attempt to learn this information. However, I would recommend everyone attempt to learn it somewhere else, as Alessandro Gomez is by far the worst professor I have had a class with at Yale.",
    "Do not take this class.I took this class thinking it would be a great way to take care of a science credit while learning about the science behind global warming. It was suggested that students have taken an AP chem or physics class in high school. No sweat.The first five or six weeks were all thermodynamics, which was incredibly difficult. The problem sets were insanely time consuming and I found myself doing a lot of outside research (googling, wikipedia-ing) trying to figure out how to answer the pset questions. After thermo, we spent about a day or two covering entire fields of science: wind energy, solar energy, hydro, etc. It was a lot of material.This is an intro class but many of the students were planning to major in the sciences and had take several physics or chem classes at yale. With that competition as a humanities person, it was quite difficult to do well.Many people dropped this class, having to take a W since the first midterm was after the drop deadline.",
    "A reasonably worthwhile class. The first half of the class is thermodynamics, which is hard if you haven't taken physics at Yale but pretty easy if you have. Gomez makes the thermo it real and relevant enough to be good. The second half of the class is facts on slides, which strikes me as a not great use of your time at Yale. That said, I walked away with a much better understanding of where the world stands in terms of climate change and energy future. I didn't want to take a gut science credit and this class did a good job of being challenging without being time consuming. Take it as a moderately hard science credit for non-science majors.",
    "great course, favorite one this semester. very applicable to current issues.very recommended",
    "Great",
    "Overall, I should warn you, this course can be very difficult especially if you are a non-science person, however I would recommend it if you are at all interested in the energy issue. It is a very nice introduction The first part of the class is heavy science with thermodynamics.However, the rest of the class is very palatable. To succeed, I suggest you ask as many questions as possible and go to the TA whenever you need help with problem sets. Midterms and finals can be difficult even though the class is curved so do your best to stay ahead of the class average.",
    "would not recommend",
    "It's a really informative course on the technologies that will shape the next few decades. You will definitely walk out of there with a well-rounded understanding of renewable energy options. However, if you're a non-science major, I suggest taking it credit\/D\/fail because the grading systems can freak out those who are not used to it. I think it's getting better for non-science peeps, though.",
    "This class is not worth it- it started out with about 100 people and by the end of the year had dropped down to less than 30. People even opted to drop the class with a W they were so worried about their grade. Although he curves around a B, the quizzes will massacre you- some people scored a negative two on one quiz. Furthermore, labs are ridiculous. You have to analyze 30,000 data points and make graphs. Very tedious and time consuming.",
    "NO. NO. NO. Gomez is a really bad professor. Plus the class is very badly structured. It takes something fun and exciting like environmental issues and turns it into a series of math problems and unnecessary quizzes. The first 4 weeks are spent in thermodynamics - except Gomez doesn't really teach it he just expects you to magically understand it on your own. I took a semester of thermo before this and I still had trouble understanding what he was trying to explain. Moreover he gives weekly quizzes in which he tries to test what you don't know and purposely makes them impossible. Whenever a student asks him a question or requests him to explain some concept again, his only response is that we should've understood it by now. He has no consideration for the whether or not the class understands what he's teaching or not. All tests in this class are open book and open notes but don't be fooled by that - his tests are IMPOSSIBLE. He gives problems that are NOTHING like the weekly problem sets that we turn in and yet he expects students to know how to solve them in the final. For instance, in class we vaguely discussed wind turbines and a little bit about the aerodynamics of the blades - we never solved any mathematical problem about it - but on the final he set us a 90 mark problem and asked us to figure out the exact amount of rotation on the blade of a wind turbine! He NEVER even discussed that in class but he insisted that we should know how to solve it! How? I have no idea. Basically DON'T EVER TAKE THIS CLASS. Not unless they change the professor!"
