    "The professor still often ran the course as a lecture, even though there were only 9 students in the class. I would have appreciated more time to discuss the readings in seminar style.",
    "The greatest strenght is its professor! Collado-Schwartz is spectacular and provides great discussions."

    "Yes. The history of Puerto Rico is a very tricky subject to teach but the professor did a great job!"
