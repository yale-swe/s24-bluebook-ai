    "Those looking for a mathematical, problem-solving outlet to keep a Humanities-heavy schedule finitively grounded, look no further.",
    "Take this class with Kenneth Winkler!!! He makes it extremely entertaining and easy to understand and brings a much-appreciated philosophical bent to First Order Logic.",
    "I would recommend this course only to those who are \"geometry\" people, as you'll essentially spend the semester doing proofs. Otherwise, find a different course for your QR credit.",
    "Take it. QR credit, extremely interesting and insightfull, great Professor.",
    "I\u0092ve shopped this course twice before, and Winkler is hands down the best. He is thorough and occasionally interesting in lecture (and an absolute darling when on a tangent). He broke everything down well, and drove it in with reiteration. Logic\u0092s not so bad\u0085 but there\u0092s not much to learn. It would be a decent QR if it tried to be more relevant or applied itself. Lecture attendance didn\u0092t matter. Something like 16 ungraded problem sets and one could skip up to four without losing any credit. The material is also intense\/strange until after the first midterm, then it\u0092s easy until you finish the material a week before Thanksgiving break and wait a month for the final.",
    "Good class, a lot of people take it for a QR (I didn't). Winkler is a funny guy, and he keeps it interesting",
    "If you have to take this class as a philosophy major, you'll probably find it fairly easy and also enjoyable. If you hate math, this is a pretty painless way to get a QR credit. Don't be scared away by the results of the first exam; Winkler wants students to do well and will adjust the subsequent exams accordingly. Lecture is definitely worth attending; it's more helpful to watch someone work through proofs and answer questions than study the book's examples, and Winkler keeps things interesting with his funny digressions.",
    "If Professor Winkler teaches it again, definitely take it. He's very clear and engaging.",
    "Yes- if you are looking for a non- math QR. Not a terrible workload. Don't take it lightly.",
    "Phil115 is a great course for better understanding logic. Getting used to formal languages and derivations actually helps you think more clearly and argue better. Everyone should take a class like this.",
    "It's not a gut. It has problem sets. It requires thinking. But it can really be a lot of fun if you put a little bit of time in it. For people who are interested in the philosophy, the class gets more interesting at the end. In the beginning, it's really about learning methods and getting familiar with the syntax and semantics of first-order logic.",
    "If you like logic\/quantitative reasoning, you might love this. Winkler is great and I personally found the material fun (homework was kind of like puzzle solving). A lot of people take this to be an easy QR, though, and I'm not sure it is. It does require understanding and creativity, so if you don't take it seriously it might end up being pretty hard.",
    "enjoyable. if you're taking this for the QR as most people do, you'll find it a challenging but interesting course with no mathematics and a different (and refreshing) approach to what they call \"quantitative reasoning\".unfortunately i can't imagine people taking this course for any other reason apart from as QR or for pure interest\/curiosity, if you are considering as the latter i still recommend the course, it's interesting and different to anything i've done before.though i have to add, KW makes that course, can't imagine it being as good with anyone else.",
    "Logic was one of my favorite classes. Professor Winkler's lectures were effective and often included hilarious personal anecdotes. He also made a genuine effort to get to know his students. In addition, I found the proofs to be satisfying to complete--they were hard enough to be interesting, but not overwhelming. I also think it helped me to assess how I was thinking and making arguments in my real life. Finally, the reading is exactly what is covered in class, and I never found it necessary to do. There were, however, two (manageably-sized) problem sets due most weeks.",
    "This course is like math with language instead of numbers. It's a lot of fun.",
    "I would not recommend Philosophy 115 for another freshman. It was a very difficult course, and the work, especially the reading, often got overwhelming. My inexperience also made it harder for me to approach Professor Winkler and other students for help, actions that I definitely would have done if I had been more experienced.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a QR and don't want to take calculus or anything like that. It's not very easy, but at least it doesn't have numbers.",
    "If you're looking for a non-math QR, look no further. Winkler is a great lecturer and the material is applicable in all of my academic work, far beyond just this class. Be prepared to work hard to understand the concepts, though, because it isn't self-explanatory.",
    "This class exercises the math part of your brain. The work is actually pretty fun -- compared to work for other classes, I always looked forward to doing problem sets this semester. If you think you would like the material, I definitely recommend this class -- great professor (Winkler), 'fun' problem sets... Solid all around!",
    "This course is excellent. Kenneth Winkler is an extremely engaging lecturer, and the material is interesting in its own right. Winkler encourages students to come to his office hours and he explains the subject matter thoroughly and well. Though the course contains a substantial quantitative reasoning component (the weekly problem sets require both thought and practice), Winkler's lecturing style maintains a balance between the technical and the philosophical. This course is ideal for those with a background in humanities seeking an interesting and moderately challenging QR credit. (Which is not to say that you should only take it if you need a QR, or if your background is not in the humanities.)",
    "Philosophy 115 presents you with the whole of First Order Logic. This means that you will be learning languages made of of symbols that stand for english sentences. After you have mastered how to represent english sentences in the symbolic languages, you can perform geometry-like proofs to show whether or not certain arguments are valid or invalid. Overall, the course introduces to rigorous axiomatic thought as it applies to language and arguments. I think it offers a cool window into how language and the mind works. I recommend it to someone who wants to take a class that is rigorous and mathematical, butdoesn't want to take classes in the math department. It isn't a gut class however. If all you are looking for is a QR credit, there are probably easier course offerings than Phil 115.",
    "You have to commit to studying if you want a good grade, but overall it wasn't so bad. Take it if you need a QR. Homework isn't graded but you should definitely try your best on it, because everything you learn is built off of previous topics. Professor Winkler is a good lecturer.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend it. It is a vrey interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. A lot of people take it to get their QR requirement fulfilled. It's not a difficult course, and it's a lot of fun. Prof Winkler is amazing!",
    "The logic is like Maths, but more abstract, and perhaps more manageable for those averse to numbers. The style of the work, and the type of satisfaction one derives from it, is almost exactly the same as Maths. I think my critical thinking has actually become clearer as a result.",
    "Logic is a difficult course but if you work at it, you'll do well. It's a different way of thinking about things, and it takes a while to get into the mindset. This is one of those courses where I started out doing very badly and not seeing how I'd ever get better at the subject; however, by the middle of the course, I had a grip on the material. If you need a QR (like I did), I'd recommend taking this course--the material is difficult at first but if you have a good TA and if Professor Winkler is teaching it, definitely take it.",
    "START THIS CLASS CREDIT D. Many students got rocked on the first exam, and dropped. HAving it Credit D gave me the flexibility to continue, and most students saw a huge improvement on the second test, and many switched to a grade for the distribution credit.",
    "Yes, take this course with Kenneth Winkler a.k.a. Seinfeld as he is a great guy and the TAs really care about the students. Go to lecture to learn about other stuff and go to section to actually learn the material.",
    "\"Logic: The Fundamentals of Thinking\" would be an apt title for this remarkable course. This class molds (and massages to perfection) the way you perceive and think about the world; it's a must-take for any Yale student. That Professor Winkler is a brilliant teacher with a fantastic sense of humor only helps!",
    "First-Order Logic was a good course, both from the QR and the philosophy point of view. The workload was very manageable - even though homeworks were generally due twice a week, they were less work than a once-a-week problem set usually is so it balanced out. Professor Winkler was a great instructor. His lectures were very engaging but also very well-thought-out and informative. He struck a good balance between sticking to the quantitative aspects of logic while also bringing in a lot of philosophy that related to what we were talking about, to keep things interesting. He also was great about answering questions, and explained things extremely well. Excellent professor, excellent class.",
    "Take it! Fun QR.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I selected it because of a vague interest in philosophy and a desire for a QR credit, but over the course of the semester, it became one of my favorite classes. Even doing the homework was fulfilling- challenging enough that I felt as though the completion of a derivation was an accomplishment, but not so incredibly difficult that I wanted to lie on the floor and moan. Professor Winkler brings a great deal of meaning to what might be a purely syntactic activity and he is a pleasure to hear in lecture too.",
    "Honestly, I should have dropped this course after the first exam as did so many of my classmates. I needed a QR, but this was not the one for me. I'm getting a bad grade and I'm at peace with it. There are two problem sets a week, three exams and a final, which is not cumulative. The final is way, way, way more difficult than the third exam, despite Kenneth \"Henry\" Winkler's claims. I drank heavily after the final. I thank God every day that this class is over. If your brain is wired to think this way and you can do proofs without reaching for the bottle of Jameson sitting on your bookshelf, you can probably do very well in this course.",
    "Very fun course. It was seriously very fun learning how to do logic. It's also useful for thinking through some arguments in philosophy papers. It's not especially difficult, and it's not very much work, especially in the last few weeks of the semester.",
    "This was a hard but rewarding class. I recommend this class if you are going to put a lot of time and effort into this and really want to learn the material. This is not a class to just blow off, but rather to invest in. It is difficult, but also very interesting.",
    "I would recommend First-Order Logic to anyone who enjoyed geometry in high school; most of the work is geometric-style proofs. The thought process is definitely mathematical, and you have to do a lot of problem sets, but you really don't have to do any reading, and if you get it, it's not much work. Prof. Winkler is wonderfully engaging and thorough in explaining all of the concepts, and gives great examples that link logic back to philosophy and to mathematics.",
    "Logic is fun. The problem sets were not too hard or time-consuming, and were like little puzzles. Winkler makes the lectures interesting. I do recommend this course, simply because the subject matter is enjoyable.",
    "It is difficult unless you are comfortable with thinking mathematically - the class is not listed as a QR for nothing.",
    "This is fantastically useful, practical and not too difficult. I think it improved my writing and argumentation immensely. If you grasp the elementary material well, the rest of the material falls into place very easily. Definitely take it, but don't underestimate how tricky the first test will be.",
    "I would recommend the course for someone looking to gain a small degree of familiarity with symbolic systems of valid inference.",
    "Logic is not for everyone, but it may be for you.Winkler is a great instructor, and he did his best to make logic lectures fun and interesting. Sometimes he succeeded, and sometimes even he could not make Logic fun. That is not to say I didn't enjoy the course, but I'm not like many students in that I don't expect things to be fun very often.Anyway, I would say that how students enjoyed and succeeded in the course largely boiled down to one thing: despite any overall \"intelligence,\" if a given student is logically wired, then the class is relatively easy and enjoyable. If a given student is more of the intuitive type, they may struggle (alot) and often feel lost.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it, especially if you like algebra and philosophy.",
    "Take it for a QR or if you are interested in philosophy and reasonable thinking.",
    "First-order logic is not an easy QR credit. A lot people got smoked on the first test and dropped it, but actually if you stuck with it after that, the class wasn't as tough. If you like puzzles and problem-solving, the homework won't seem that bad. Except for a couple of majors, logic problem won't have any practical application for you afterward.",
    "Logic stretches your reasoning and gives a new perspective on philosophical argument. It was challenging for me, but worth it to stretch the way I think and reason.",
    "This class is a good, simple QR that can also be very interesting - if you choose to make it so. I would definitely recommend taking it."
