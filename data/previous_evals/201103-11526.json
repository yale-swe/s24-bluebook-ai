    "Don't take it! Just trust me! Please!",
    "This is a fantastic course that covers more ground than you think would be possible in a single semester. From Newton's Laws to Special Relativity, basic ballet positions to five minute-long choreographic opuses, this course addresses salient topics in classical and modern physics, critical dance studies, and dance technique\/composition. I've never had a class that imparted so many different skills before. While some days can seem a bit scattered, that's part of the fun of the course; you learn to make new and unique connections and think inter-disciplinarily. You'll learn the physics behind ballet jumps and turns, use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to choreograph, do problem sets like you've never seen before, and read scholarly essays about dance as cultural studies. If you're not convinced, I'll just say TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "Yes! As I'm sure others will mention, there are some kinks that need to be worked out from this first offering (getting a grad student to grade problem sets so they are returned on time, perhaps cutting back a bit on the work load, etc.). However, this is still an extremely innovative and exciting way to fulfill that distributional requirement. The professors are each ridiculously qualified in their fields, and established a great working rapport with the class.",
    "For a science credit, a big ol whopping DUH.For anyone interested in unraveling some of the basic secrets of the universe, both in body and out, a lesser, but still echoing, duh.",
    "Yes. Its a big time commitment (4 hrs of class a week + a lot of group work outside class), but its a fantastic opportunity to learn physics in a really interesting way.",
    "Great sc\/qr.",
    "easy QR. easy SC. easy.",
    "Yes. you will never forget this course. You dance physics and physics dance!",
    "Yes, if you're willing to take a risk because after all, it is a pretty abstract class in a lot of ways. Definitely not just an \"easy\" QR or SC but very fun nonetheless.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! Physics can be fun! Dance is fun! The professors are hilarious and dynamic!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student! You will not be disappointed! I would caution that this class has a substantial amount of work that mustbe done outside of class (2 midterms, readings, blog posts, psets, movement studies, etc). So, if you are looking for a ''gut'' class or ''easy'' course, look elsewhere! That being said, the work is totally worth it! I had no background in dance studies and did not remember most of my physics class from high school. For me, the hardest part was the movement. When you are surrounded by some of the best dancers at Yale, it is really intimidating and frustrating to try to match them (mostly because you feel that you are slowing the class down!). Don't take yourself too seriously--don't be afraid to ask for help if you don't understand a movement. Emily has the patience and heart of a saint. Sarah too, is always available to field questions or meet for lunch in Trumbell. The amount of dedication that they poured into the course is astonishing!",
    "The Physics of Dance was a GREAT class. I learned so much, not just about the interaction of physics and dance but also just about how to become aware of the physical experience of motion. You get to choreograph a final project in a group, you also do movement studies every few weeks. One thing to know about this course: it's actually a BIG time commitment (class twice a week for 2hrs, regular problem sets, often reading responses to post on the blog, movement studies every few weeks) so don't be fooled. However, it's definitely worth it! It's tons of fun. Professors Coates and Demers are a great team.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I learned things in it I wouldn't have learned from any other class at Yale. Yale could use more interdisciplinary classes, anyway.",
    "Dance-->Physics.Mutually-informing, interdisciplinary, mind-bending.One of the most memorable classes you'll take at Yale, period.",
    "GREAT COURSE. If you love dance and are interested in how physics and dance interact with each other (in terms of actual movement and choreographic influence), this is a class you must take. Grade consists of problem sets, three midterms, movement studies, and a final. The physics-oriented problem sets and tests are fairly easy to grasp. Movement studies take a while longer to choreograph, so be prepared to put in a bit of time for that. Overall, one of my favorite courses at Yale. And a science credit, to boot!"
