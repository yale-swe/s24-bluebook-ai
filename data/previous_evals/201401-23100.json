    "Nursing 917 was an excellent guided, hands-on, immersion into advanced statistics. Classes consisted of a combination of lecture and lab, this was a very useful way to learn. I walked away with valuable knowledge that I can actually use. This was the most useful statistics class I have ever taken. I would highly recommend taking this class with Dr. Holland."
