    "The course structure changed as the semester went on, which was great, but it still seemed at times that the course was lacking structure. The lecture objectives could have been more clearly outlined in the syllabus.",
    "Class time for projects - needs to be divided in teams, I found that class time for everyone on a particular project did not teach me as much.",
    "All aspects.",
    "The course felt very chaotic to me. I know this is part of the experience, but at some point I think the unorganized pace of the course and the lack of clrity on deliverables played against the learning experience.",
    "The client projects and the pacing \/ repetition. I felt that multiple lectures simply repeated the points from the previous class, without getting much deeper (and many times, deviating into unrelated debates). Our client project was nightmarish. Coordinating with the undergraduate class is not useful. Although they are extremely talented and capable students, any attempt at working across schedules, work experience, potentially-different content or pacing of the course itself, etc, is not conducive to a group project. The roles and involvement of the TFs seemed to change over the course of the semester: much more consistency is needed there, and everyone involved should be taking the course for 3 credits. Our initial student lead had no idea how to manage a team. What really got to me however, was what was either 1) the underlying disorganization that was revealed when a litany of new actors were added into the network mix and proposal at the last second, or 2) disingenuous selective sharing of information over the course of the semester, culminating in what seemed to amount to a pre-determined funding pitch, with student work and presentations that applied lessons from the class being used and leveraged as a form of independent certification -- the network itself and institute that would serve as the hub seemed to have been known from the outset, but, as far as I could tell, was kept from both the students and the client until the end of the academic year. If this is true, then only do I find it to be unethical, but I also feel it detracts from the legitimacy of the class's work because the outcome of our network proposal was not as organic or original as we may have been led to believe.",
    "When I try to implement the concepts taught into my own life and building my own network - aside from the in-class client work - the teach was very unresponsive and seemed uninterested in helping.",
    "More info on developing group norms. Concrete conversation tactics.",
    "Think of possibility of using specific mapping tools to create maps."

    "Know that this course does not focus on communications theory. If you want a 'fundamentals of communications' class, look for somethin else. This course focuses on networks and coallition building and provides you with an opportunity for a deeper dive into systems thinking. The learning process can feel chaotic and unorganized, you'll have to deal with uncertainty. In the end, this was a very useful course with a very heartful and dedicated instructor.",
    "It is a useful class to learn about systems thinking if you have not already been exposed to it, but be wary of the end-goal of your group client project. Ours almost felt pre-determined.",
