    "This class is one of those that makes clear why C.L.R. James argued that African and Black history is world history. As well, it allowed me to expand upon my pre-existing familiarity with synthesizing the viewpoints of a range of authors, and I was able to build upon my skills in writing essays that do so.",
    "I learned about theories of diaspora and migration that have enriched my understanding of the world. Migration has always happened and will always continue. Understanding it as such allows for a more expansive idea of people and social categories.",
    "I was able to understand African migration from varying perspectives and from different historical focal points. I also learned to synthesizes several works to support my personal observations of the African diaspora.",
    "This course allowed a deep exploration of the politics of belonging in a globalized world. We questioned what it meant to believe in the nation-state and in liberalism, to subscribe to conventional understandings of geography, to be of the diaspora, to be mobile. We examined how diaspora challenges conceptions of race, ethnicity, and nation. Understanding of different historical migratory circuits between Africa and the wider world.",
    "I learned how to think about the world from a diasporic perspective, which is knowledge I definitely lacked from other academic engagements!"

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated how discussion-based the seminar could often be, even as the discussion would at times become localized to a few students. This is less an issue with this specific seminar and affects most discussion-based classes. Trying to make amends to this situation might involve infringing upon the fluidity of discussion. In this case, I would rather maintain the current structure.",
    "The course had great themes and the syllabus was well organized. Class discussion could have been much more involved and richer but that is dependent on the students who choose to take the course.",
    "The strengths were the variety of works we read that Professor Lu picked. It presented us with different forms of writing on the topic of African migration, ranging from personal narratives to pure theory work. Assigning people to lead discussions was a also a positive aspect of class because it helped facilitate conversation in a directed manner.",
    "Excellent syllabus with challenging yet interesting theoretical texts. Fascinating discussions, though I feel that fewer sessions should have been student-facilitated, as we were sometimes unprepared to lead discussions on some of the more difficult readings and required more instructor guidance. The final project was great gave us so much autonomy to explore issues of diaspora that mattered to us.",
    "I think that the responses each week could be switched up a bit as opposed to being the same form every time. Other than that, the form of the course was excellent."

   "comments": [
    "The course is designed with Anthropology and African Studies majors in mind, but I would recommend it to a much broader range of students given the breadth of topics and the even greater breadth of their implications for politics and social theory. As well as learning of the specific contexts of African political landscapes, histories, and diasporas, I learned of various logics by which societies are governed in a way that elaborated arguments made in Political Science.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially if a good number of people take it and and are dedicated to putting in the work and having fruitful conversation. I found the class discussions to be slow and dry at times, but that was because students did not seem to engage with the material or with each other. When we did have good conversation, the discussion was rich. Doing the readings and seeing people's ideas in Canvas responses made me reflect and excited about the content. In future sessions, with more engaged students, this course could be great.",
    "Yes I would! Anyone who wants to learn more about African movement, take this class!",
    "yes! to any student in any major"
