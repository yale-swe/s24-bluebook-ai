    "This is an introductory course that covers a substantial area of C++ programming. I certainly would recommend this course to another student because what this course covers is fundamental in computer science.",
    "Good course that would be better if there was a C++ precursor course. This would allow for more focus on more examples of object-oriented approaches.Would definitely recommend this course. I took it as a quick way to learn more about C++, and at the very least, it certainly has done that.",
    "Yes. Highly recommended",
    "Yes. It's a great course for new computer science students. Basic programming concepts, and appropriate amount of practice.",
    "Yes, I will recommend it to other students, It's a very useful course. People can learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend it. It is useful."
