    "For 2 semesters condensed into 1, the class is pretty much what you'd expect: heavy on grammar and comprehension, less so on speaking practice. Getting by shouldn't be a problem, but getting the most you can out of the class means being willing to dedicate a lot of time to the class. Professor Safille is strange, funny, wonderful human being.",
    "I would without a doubt recommend Spanish 145, especially with Brbara. She is a fantastic instructor and made coming to class a pleasure, which is especially important considering that we were there for two hours ever day. The workload is doable, and your Spanish will improve dramatically."
