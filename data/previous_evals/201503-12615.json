    "Take it",
    "It is a very comprehensive class, that allows you to focus on what is interesting to you. It was well thought off and the readings were very carefully selected. Prof. Halper is brilliant, and knows what he is talking about. He strikes the right balance between pushing students to produce good work, and letting them explore and find a way of learning that works for them. He is a great presenter, but he is not as good directing the discussion. Too often he felt the need to answer to all the questions, and it would have been helpful to hear what other students had to say. He felt that he needed to give \"the right answer\" too early in the discussion. I do recommend the class. The workload is not too bad: weekly readings, participation, a presentation on the topic of your final paper, and a 15-20 page paper.",
    "Great class that gives a deep understanding of the evolution of and underpinnings of Zionism.",
    "Great class, low stress, you learn a lot - pretty simple",
    "I'm not sure if this course is going to be taught as a seminar again (I think it is normally a lecture), but I really enjoyed this seminar with Shaun. Starting with the intellectual foundations of Zionist thought, we covered the history of Zionist movements and the history of Israel through the Yom Kippur War. We had a lot of great discussions, and I feel like I have a much better sense of the history of Zionism and the early history of the state of Israel. The work load was very reasonable, but I feel like I learned a lot."
