   "comments": [
    "Take it! 80% final paper and 20% participation. You actually learn a lot and question your own political beliefs based on his lessons. Every polisci major should try to get into this seminar, or any class by DeCanio for that matter!",
    "Professor DeCanio is quite entertaining. The final paper being 80% of the grade was a little daunting, but you just have to be on top of your research and everything and it works out well.",
    "A very good seminar with a reasonable amount of work! If you haven't taken a course with Professor DeCanio, you definitely should!",
    "One of the best courses that I've taken at Yale. I really enjoyed the excellent reading list, and I was able to keep up with almost all of it due to the low workload of the class. decennia is a real gem of the Poly Sci department, and would strongly recommend him. The only downsides were the final paper is worth a ton (~80% of your grade) so it was kind of stressful. Maybe a midterm paper thrown in would make the class perfect.",
    "A great course on how the political parties were formed and why. Really interesting, especially if you are interested in American Politics. DeCanio is incredible, and there is not a lot of work other than reading. Highly recommend.",
    "yes, interesting stuff",
    "Take this course!",
    "Very much discussion oriented. Interesting to listen to everyone"
