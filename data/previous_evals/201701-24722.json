   "comments": [
    "This class taught me to conduct formal analysis on art, ask questions about artwork to better understand the pieces, and appreciate a wide range of artistic movements. I learned a lot of vocabulary that, while probably used normally in the art\/art history community, was very new to me. I now feel more equipped to consume art both for its aesthetic purposes as well as for its potential political or social implications.",
    "This was my first art history class at Yale, and I learned so much about the field without feeling overwhelmed or ill-prepared.",
    "I developed a deep understanding of Latin American art, which is often left out of Euro-centric art history survey courses and overlooked generally. I developed a vocabulary to talk about the work and discuss art in a political\/historical\/social context, which included a lot of amazing hands-on study at the YUAG and at a few galleries in NYC.",
    "A survey-style seminar of Latin American art, focusing slightly more on Mexico and Brazil, through the 20th Century. Central focus on what constitutes \"Latin American Art\" and the possibilities of post-colonial, de-colonial, and global art histories.",
    "This was a great overview of Latin American Art. It was great to work with so many materials im the YUAG and I enjoyed the field trip to New York. We were able to not only engage directly with art, but to read a wide variety of manifestos and essays. As a history major, the professor was able to guide us through a new field extremely well",
    "An incredible helpful survey of 20th century latin american art & criticism. Sources and approaches the material were varied as we read from the textbook, theorists, critics, and others. I left feeling the course much more comfortable discussing modern art, a skill that can be rather complex.",
    "I got a great understanding of \"modern\" art in Latin America! We delved into many questions of representation, colonialism, curatorial and conservational practices, and more.",
    "As my first art history course, this was an amazing introduction to the field and also allowed me to learn a lot about Latin American art. I appreciated how Professor Bravo allowed a variety of historical, theoretical, and comparative approaches. The assignments were also helpful in formulating and developing a more in-depth knowledge of n topics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the diversity of readings that we are given, professor Bravo as a lecturer, and our access to the YUAG and other galleries in NYC. I really enjoyed being able to see the art in person, and Professor Bravo was great at maintaining discussions. The readings were also very interesting and provided me with a lot of background to be prepared for class discussions. Sometimes, however, they were a bit hard to follow. The weakness of this course is that I think it presupposed more expertise in the material than was indicated early in the semester. I often felt that I was not useful in terms of my contributions in class.",
    "The gallery visits, variety of texts, and class presentations made this class engaging and fun!",
    "The assignments for the course are very productive and practical - it never felt like I was just memorizing material for regurgitation. We were always asked to develop our own critical and art historical lens through writin and discussion. I also loved all the classes spent at the YUAG, which allowed us physical examples to discuss as a class and apply concepts from the classroom.",
    "The textbook was pretty dry, but overall the readings were incredibly good. Discussion sometimes veered off-course, but Professor Bravo is always incredibly approachable and accepting of new ideas. The field trip to New York was one of the best for any class I've taken.",
    "Very well organized course. Professor listened to student feeedback as well. Everyone was super engaged.",
    "I really loved the material and was excited with how many art objects we got to engage with. I wish the professor had given more overviews of the periods in class. Sometimes I felt a little lost in certain concepts.",
    "Strengtha: Great survey to approaches, good content and art, a solid variance in location and the interaction with the art itself added greatly Weaknesses: Discussion sometimes lagged as the material could be rather dense & there was a level of unfamiliarity in general among the class",
    "Loved the museum trips, and the reading responses were also helpful for encouraging engagement in seminar discussions.",
    "Strength: Great material, good mix of survey and in depth knowledge. I appreciated the visits to the galleries and YUAG. I also liked when we each had to present different course materials to classmates. Weakness: The start of the course was difficult to connect, and definitely felt more technical compared to the latter part of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but perhaps after another art history course. This class does not have any prerequisites, but I think that I would have gotten more out of it if I had been more comfortable with the artistic terminology and movements that we discussed. I often felt that my contributions to the discussions were pointless because everyone else was a lot more experienced then me.",
    "Yes! Take any class with Monica Bravo!!!!!!",
    "Yes! Take this class if you are interested in re-orienting art history along global lines and want a more inter-disciplinary approach.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone not too familiar with art history or the department. Professor Bravo is an amazing instructor, and she is extremely good at making the course material accessible and easier to digest for students who may not have an art-related background.",
    "Amazing professor and really well organized course for an overview to the subject.",
    "Ansolutely take it, both advanced and beginning students in art history have a lot to gain from the course.",
    "10\/10 would recommend! Working with Monica is absolutely wonderful, and the readings she draws in as well as the discussion questions she asks are really valuable, especially if you're studying the history of art. Latin American art is an up-and-coming field, and it's very worthwhile to study, most especially with Monica."
