   "comments": [
    "This class has a wide variety of people in it. It is a fair amount of reading and some of the readings will be boring, but it can be engaging. Professor Goldsby was an engaging instructor and I would recommend taking it with her. Take the class if you are willing to do the reading even though it may get dry at times. If not, don't. If you want a writing class, take another class but if you are looking for a lit class this one is solid. (It does depend on your instructor, however)",
    "If you want to read American lit classics, take this course. A wide variety of books. Can be a drag at times if you aren't the most enthusiastic, but worth the effort.",
    "ENGL 127 was amazing with Goldsby. The reading list was interesting and Goldsby led the class each day to great discussions. She was great at office hours if you wanted to discuss the readings or an idea for a thesis. Grading was fair and transparent, and she always gave great feedback. Just be sure to not fall behind in reading for Moby-Dick.",
    "ENGL 127 was a great glimpse into the staggering and rich canon of American literature. The texts we read were diverse in form (novels, long poems, short poems, short stories, essays) and in genre (from the classic Moby-Dick to the postmodern Pale Fire). It was a joy to look at these texts with Professor Goldsby, who is such an impressive scholar and thinker. It is such an amazing opportunity to take an intro-level class with such an eminent academictake it if you can! She gives thoughtful, detailed feedback on every writing assignment (even 3-point quizzes!) and is always willing to read or talk about your writing outside of class. She is also very down-to-earth and easy to relate to. I do wish the class were a tiny bit smaller, but given how long the waitlist was for this class it is almost a surprise that they don't expand the 18-person cap. That said, the class lived up to the hypeit would be a mistake to pass up this class. I learned so much about myself as a reader and writer, and thoroughly enjoyed just about everything we read. The writing assignments were especially well-paced and well-planned (a Whitman archive project, a few short mini-essay responses, and two long essays). We also did a reception archive project which involved researching contemporary reviews of one of the texts and presenting these findings to the class. The insights in these presentations were always interesting and sometimes indispensable. If you're at all interested in American literature and like reading, take the class. One note, thoughlook at the syllabus for each section to see which most interests you, as there is some variety among the different sections.",
    "You move through the books so fast! In many ways it seems a disservice to move through them at hyper speed but it's a survey course so you get what you get. Goldsby is a caring professor. You can tell she wants you to do well and gives you a ton of feedback on your writing. A good class, but be aware that it is an intro survey class.",
    "Definitely take this class. Definitely take it with Professor Goldsby. You will read amazing books and learn to think in new, interesting ways.",
    "The books might change every year but the reading list covers an excellent selection of authors who really shaped American writing-- you will definitely enjoy the readings, even if they can be long at times. The discussions might vary depending on the instructor\/students but a great balance of discussions and writing that will help you become an effective writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, and take it with Professor Goldsby! She is so smart and thoughtful. The course is fairly front-loaded in terms of work, but that makes a busy semester more manageable.",
    "ENGL 127 goes through novels and poetry written by American authors. Our class started with Whitman and ended with Chang rae Lee. I would recommend this course, especially with Professor Goldsby. She is a cool professor. We had both humanities and STEM people in our class, and I didn't hear a bad word about her. The reading assignments vary drastically--we went through Moby Dick in about 4 classes, so had to read over 100 pages in preparation for class each time. Then we would have maybe 10 poems by Bishop later in the semester for homework. There are two 6-8 page papers, and a few scattered short writing assignments. Our class didn't have a final, but the course itself lists a final. We also each had to give a presentation about an author we were reading sometime during the semester. Overall I loved the materials we read and enjoyed the professor.",
    "Let me tell you something. Sometimes we'd be discussing something in class, and somebody would say something, and I'd think: \"What the fuck did that kid just say? Did he just string a bunch of words together? Does he even know what he meant to say?\" Sometimes it's really hard to tell if it's you just not being at their level of comprehension, or if it's them, just making stuff up. Or maybe they're just fucking terrible at explaining their ideas. Maybe it's a bit of all of the above. Or maybe it was just 9:30am and I wasn't really paying attention anyway. Also: fuck talking about \"the ethics of the narrator-reader relationship.\" Shit's boring as all hell. Let's just each of us find the dopest sentence in the thing you read, and talk about why it's so good. Doesn't that sound like fun? More smiles that way. Gosh. Didn't mean for this to be so negative! Too tired to fix that. Just have fun and God Bless, mhm okay!",
    "This class requires a lot of writing and the Professor has very high standards. However, the readings are not overwhelming. In my class, the great majority of the students seemed to have done all the readings and actively participated in class, making for really interesting class discussions.",
    "English 127 is great. Take it if you love reading books, thinking about America in new (and, for me, more abstract) ways, and kind professors (which is not to say Prof. Goldsby is an easy grader-- she is reasonable and fair but doesn't liberally dole out As).",
    "Great class to take if you're interested in American lit! The readings are EXCELLENT (for the most part)",
    "Even if you aren't into English, you should take this class. Professor Goldsby is awesome and really easy to talk to. The assignments are really manageable (A few short essays submitted on classesV2, two 6-8-page essays, a couple of in-class quizzes and writing assigments, and one small project), and the topics are generally interesting. I really enjoyed the readings as well."
