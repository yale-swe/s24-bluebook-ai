    "This class is sort of designed to answer the question, \"What would happen if I tried to become a science writer?\" You get to meet science writers. You get to have your writing torn apart. You learn how hard writing for science is in the real world.TO future students, I would recommend not trying to take the class credit\/d. You will get a lousy grade probably, but the two students i knew who were trying to take it cred\/d had trouble. One ended up dropping it and the other just wasn't really putting in any effort. You're going to have to put in legitimate effort even to do a cred\/d, and it's also just sort of lame to do a journalism course cred\/d. No, you don't have to publish any of it, but you should want to. or you should at least want to adhere to some standard of integrity. The point is, to not fail you'e going to have to do the work, and you should want to do the work because the work is finding out people's stories and reporting them truthfully. So just take it A-F.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY. It's a ton of work but an incredibly worthwhile class!",
    "If you want to challenge yourself and learn from a fantastic writer, then take this course. You get out of it what you put in and this class does require that you put a lot, a lot of outside effort in. If you're not willing to be a go-getter in terms of reaching out to scientists and environmentalists to interview then this is probably not the class for you. You learn a lot about what science and environmental journalism requires not just from journalist's writing but attitude as well. Professor Zimmer is a great professor who clearly wants to help the students improve but he doesn't give much in the way of encouragement so don't expect someone who will be open about what he thinks works with your writing.",
    "This class is awesome! The workload feels like it could be a full-time job, but if you are into it, it is fun and you learn a lot. I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in nonfiction. This class forces you to get out of your undergrad bubble, to go engage with real people. Sniffing out stories, pursuing them and then trying to turn them into well-thought-out, compelling articles, was the most fulfilling work I did all semester, and Professor Zimmer was the best teacher I could have asked for.",
    "Highly recommend if you can get in. Gives you an opportunity to talk to interesting people and write about them. However, I highly, highly advise at least starting Credit\/D. Zimmer's grading\/criticism is harsher than you might expect, but it's very fair, very helpful in the end. You learn a lot.Take it credit\/D! Most people do, I think.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who thinks journalism might be a path for them. Your writing will improve dramatically and you will learn a lot about the challenges of engineering a story. If you're not willing to spend a lot of time on your writing or a lot of energy reporting outside of class, however, this class is not for you.",
    "Remember when you were growing up and science seemed fun? (If you're a humanities person who hasn't realized it yet, that was a lie!) And then we got to college, and realized that being a scientist requires years of tedious, hard work. That was a hard realization for me to handle. I was reeling from this malaise when I enrolled in Zimmer's Science Writing course. As it turns out, science writing is so much fun. I spent dozens of hours researching cool stuff and talking to scientists about their research. It was just as I always thought science would be. Zimmer is a great teacher (and fair warning: an incredibly tough grader). My writing skills have improved significantly. My only complaint is that now I want to scrap my other plans and be a science writer. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Summary: an intensive science journalism seminar that asks you to report your own stories. Recommended if you want to push yourself, work very hard, and learn from an excellent science writer. Even if you take the course Credit\/D (highly recommended if you care about your GPA) you still have to do the work, so only take this course if you're ready to put in the time. The reporting and writing always takes longer than you think.",
    "I recommend this class as long as the student is prepared to work long and hard, and can be self-motivated. Though I think Zimmer is a good guy, he does not offer a lot of support unless you ask for it (which I also recommend doing.) I learned a lot, though probably a course that tackles the difficulties of high-level writing as well as the difficulties of science journalism needs more than a semester to see real results.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are strongly interested and have a lot of time at your disposal."
