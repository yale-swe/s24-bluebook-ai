   "comments": [
    "MCDB 121L provided an up close demonstration of many of the concepts taught in MCDB 120 - including replication of many famous biological experiments. I would recommend this class to any student sincerely interested in Biology - especially those who have had only limited lab experience.",
    "Your basic, dry intro biology lab. I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you HAVE to because it is not fun and too much work for only .5 credits.",
    "Good complement to the lecture course.",
    "Of the two labs I've taken at Yale (the other being Dr. G's General Chem Lab), this is by far the less painful. You'll still spend a fair amount of time (more than a half credit's worth) working on lab reports, but they aren't terribly difficult and can actually be interesting if you're willing\/have the time to do a littleoutside research. There is an online lab quiz every week, but if you read and comprehend the handout Dr. Moreno provides, you're almost guaranteed an \"A\". The labs themselves are very low-stress and usually were done well within the time allotted. As with all labs, the TA can make or break your experience, so be very careful in choosing (if you're able).",
    "Very basic, but also time-consuming. Each lab took between 10 and 12 hours to complete thoroughly, and sometimes the expectations were not 100% clear. Overall, you will do well if you recognize that this class is a time-commitment.",
    "took it for premed reqs, its basically a huge bitch just because the labs are SO LONG and complicated. but actually being in lab itself is not as miserable as being in other labs like chem lab. it's usually pretty chill and fun",
    "If you don't have to take it, don't. Otherwise it's not the worst lab. It was just that you always ended up in the lab way longer than you thought you would and the reports were way too much stress.",
    "absolutely, positively, do NOT take this class unless you are compelled to because of your pre-professional program or your major. this is NOT a joke. it's incredibly time consuming (at least 6 hours for most lab reports), the labs are not interesting, you just prove things that have already been proven that you learned about in lecture, and oftentimes the labs don't even work correctly. the labs are also often very tedious. also, if you don't like your TA, drop this class like it's hot. out of five close friends that started out taking this class, four dropped it by the middle of the term, and one hates herself for sticking with it. I stuck with it because I lucked out and ended up with a fantastic TA. only take this class if you have to because of your major\/pre-professional program, and even if you have to take it, if you end up with a TA that is being a jerk about grading on lab reports, just drop it and take it another semester. trust me, you'll thank yourself later",
    "I would only take this course if required; though the experiments were sometimes fun and interesting, the work is much too heavy for a half credit course (and maybe too heavy for even a 1 credit course).",
    "If you are looking to take MCDB 121, you probably are required to do so. As such, it is not a bad course, the labs are generally interesting, if often poorly designed. Be aware that the lab reports are inordinately long for an introduction, and the focus is much more on writing than on practical lab skills. If you are looking at this as a Sc credit, look elsewhere.",
    "don't take an intro level lab if you can avoid it.",
    "Sure if you have to...not too painful, take it with a friend.",
    "A ton of work, the lab reports are extremely tedious. The labs themselves are interesting and fun, and don't take the whole lab period. Be prepared to spend from 5-12 hours on your lab reports.",
    "The class is fairly easy, but the lab reports are a lot of tedious work. It ended up being more of a time commitment than I hoped it would be, but overall not a bad experience.",
    "I would recommend it if you need a lab. It is a good, solid introductory lab. Just keep in mind that the format is very, very different from chemistry labs. Bio lab is more of a free for all with little instruction. The labs feel like busy work, and the reports are very long (16 pages approx. per week). A lot of it feels silly at the time, but it does correspond to lecture and it does help cement that information.",
    "If you can have Megan Ericson as your TA, you are going to have a great experience in lab. Otherwise, this is just another Biology lab.",
    "If you need to take it, take it. Not a class I would recommend to take \"for fun.\"",
    "Only take it if you need to. If you do, it's not too bad at all. Actual lab is really chill and the experiments and online quizzes are usually fine. The lab reports are really annoying and extremely long and tedious though.",
    "Take it but complete the labs during the weekend. Took up my entire week. Constantly needed more time to complete the labs.",
    "MCDB 121L is a pretty straightforward, intro lab course. If you've taken intro science labs before, this will not be too different. The labs themselves are not too difficult, and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed. The lab reports are a bit lengthy, but not so much that it should turn you away from taking the course. It's a cool way to see the application of what you learn in MCDB 120 lecture in the laboratory. No real complaints here.",
    "Only take this if you need it for premed or major.",
    "I'd recommend it. The lab reports can be really bad but being lab is usually pretty fun.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot, especially how to write lab reports. The lab reports were long and tedious -- mine were usually around 11 pages, 3500 words. Very time consuming. But lab wasn't terrible. It was tedious at times, and when you get out of lab really depends on your TA. My TA was super nice and helpful and lab was very chill, but we usually stayed a lot longer than other sections did. If you've worked in a lab before, then this class probably won't teach you much. It did supplement the lecture pretty well.",
    "For someone who is not personally interested in research and had to take the course for a requirement, I was very frustrated. Most of the labs took the full four hours and then we had a lab report due almost every week. On average, I'd say I wrote about 13-15 pages single spaced (but with graphs) for each lab report. This class required more work on a regular basis than any other class I think I have taken at yale. Although the work is not hard, it is very time consuming. The labs themselves were, at times quite tedious, but for the most part as good as I'd hope for. In comparison to the Chem114 labs, they were applicable and interesting. Also you were not graded on how well your lab turned out, which was a nice change. Rather, you were graded on how well you could reflect on the lab and understand why certain errors might have occurred. There were a few really cool labs including one on inheritance with different drosophila mutants. However, in general, the lab equipment could be improved.",
    "This course is beneficial in supplementing the coursework of MCDB 120. The two courses run simultaneously so that you get hands-on experience with the concepts learned in lecture. It is true that a few of the labs seem elementary, but when the background is researched for the lab reports, the link becomes clear. Do not think that this class is in any way an easy addition. This class is half the credit of a normal lecture, but it actually takes a tremendous amount of work. Lab reports are due essentially every week and tend to be 10-15 pages in length.",
    "I recommend it because the labs are very cool. Be prepared to stay upnall night doing the report.",
    "Take it, but the TA makes a big difference.",
    "MCDB121L is an introductory Biology lab that covers many basic techniques, such as genetic crosses, PCR, and gel electrophoresis and uses many model organisms such as Drosophila, C. elegans, sea anemones, and frog embryos. However, the equipment is poor so not all of the anticipated results can always be observed. This can make it difficult to write reports as thoroughly as necessary.Recommended for people who are interested in learning basic concepts before working in a lab.",
    "Take it if you need to for your major or for pre-med. Don't take it \"for fun.\" Lots of lengthy lab reports - long and brain-numbing, but not too difficult. Tough grading for the work you put in - could do a quarter the work required for this lab and get an easy A in intro macro or micro...",
    "The class in itself was slightly above mediocre, and it was a lot of work, but I found that I learned a lot about many different aspects of biological research, so in that sense it was fulfilling. Having a great TA really helps make the class that much more worthwhile, as with any class.",
    "Intro bio lab. We do many different experiments which may or may not be directly related to what is being taught in MCBD120 at the time. The labwork itself is fairly easy and the TA's make a point of going over it before we start to work. Do not leave the lab reports for the last minute. They shouldn't be a traumatic experience, but they can be very time consuming.",
    "You're probs taking this cause you have to. Which sucks. Because it's crazy how much work you have to put in for this course and then you get your lab reports back and just don't know what to do do improve your grade Having online lab quizzes was the only good part of this course. But otherwise it was just a lot of work :\/",
    "Not the best lab in the world but the material is interesting. Labs can get long and exhausting. Lab writeups are also long.",
    "SO much more work than other classes -- and it's only 1\/2 a credit!",
    "Good lab to take. Comprehensively covers basic concepts in biology. BUT be prepared to work. The lab reports are definitely doable, yet require a good amount of time and effort. It all pays off in the end, though.",
    "It sucks, but if you have to take it, you have to take it. Lab reports are annoying. But its not THAT hard, just time consuming.",
    "Not a bad lab, lots of down time.",
    "Too much work. It may be worth it.",
    "MCDB 121L is an excellent compliment to the MCDB 120 lecture course. The work load is quite sizablefor a 1\/2 credit class, but the laboratory sessions were compelling and intensive. Although sessions were lengthy, they were thorough and every student understood the material completely in order to prepare a report. The pre-laboratory quizzes were often a nuisance, but ensured that students were prepared for class. In sum, I would recommend MCDB 121L to pre-med students or science majors only if taken in conjunction with MCDB 120; the class is rigorous but manageable if approached as a 1 credit course.",
    "It's not a bad lab, and it complements the lecture course well. However, there are a ton of full lab write-ups, and they can get extremely repetitive.",
    "I had lab on Friday afternoons, so it always seemed like a drag: my school week was stretched out and capped off with 3 hours of counting fruit flies or measuring absorbancies. I guess that was a good experience though, since it taught me that I don't want to work in a lab. That said, I had a very good TA and I think the lab was well run and well taught, I just wasn't that interested in the subject matter. If you go into this lab expecting to spend a lot of time on lab reports, you should be fine. The reports are tedious but doable, and they do help you understand the material better.",
    "It's a great introductory biology course. Yes the lab reports were long but it was interesting and the labs were like mini research experiments. The class is very small and there is a lot of opportunity for partner work which made this lab fun even on a Friday.",
    "This is a really interesting introductory lab course. The lab reports can be long, particularly at first, but you are able to write them more efficiently and effectively with tine -- which is the point. The experiments are interesting."
