This let us come away with a lot of very applicable insights, but also meant that the timing of getting feedback and information from the stakeholders -- things really outside the control of the professor and TAs -- could throw projects and the class for a loop."

   "comments": [
    "Focusing on one project throughout the semester to really get involved in it and get the most out of the experience.",
    "Working with the architecture students; having a clear case study for the material; extensive class feedback on project iterations.",
    "This is a very valuable course. The interaction of architecture and FES students in this course is unlike anything offered on campus and is a tremendous asset to each school and their students. More opportunities of this kind should be offered. The topic of the course and the instructor's work really are at the leading edge of innovation in ecology and design. The instructor has a significant amount of real-world experience and examples to bring to course discussions.",
    "This course was a great learning opportunity. Working on a real world project was a great way to put into practice the ideas and theory we discussed in class. The mix of architecture and forestry students made discussions truly interdisciplinary and I think students from both schools learned from one another.",
    "Put designers and ecologist together to deal with practical project",
    "Working with architects, engaging in dialogues with a completely different mode of thinking.",
    "Chance to learn from architecture students, and to get an overview of the state of designed experiments."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures could become a bit more interactive (hands on) instead of focusing heavily on reading discussions",
    "Time-management for the class was sometimes disorganized.",
    "At times the class seemed a bit disorganized and it was unclear what was expected for particular assignments. Some of this may be the nature of the course and the challenge of ecologists and designers learning each others language and perspectives. It all came together well in the end, but ways to find clarity along the way would be beneficial.",
    "I think engaging the stakeholders much, much, earlier -- before a project is even conceptualized -- would have saved us so much time, and enabled us to hone in on a good project earlier in the course, giving us more time to refine and locate it. Clearer expectations, in general, would be helpful when you have students from so many different perspectives coming together."

    "Great practice communicating with non-scientists and trying to think creatively\/design-orientedly about environmental problems.",

    "Really interesting experience; be sure to reach out to the stakeholders or other fellows as early as you can, so you don't invest time and energy into projects that won't be workable."
