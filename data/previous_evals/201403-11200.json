    "I'd summarize the course with a metaphor. Growing up, I used to watch karate movies in which a master would so easily disarm an upstart kid because they had mastered the fundamental techniques and could, with one simple targeted strike to a nerve point, render the upstart newcomer frozen despite their fancy movements. If you can internalize the different paradigms (material, institutional, and ideas) -- where is this author coming from? why do they think certain actors are central and what do they want? how do those actors get them (often lacking)? what do we know to be true in this circumstance and what would disprove the author? -- you'll go some way to being a better consumer and critic of CPE work (or, to extend the metaphor, you'll know where the sparring partner is coming from and be able to disarm them quite effectively if needed).",
    "This is a seminar type of class that focuses on the inter-relationship between politics and economics and seeks to discern these themes in various facets of politico-economic arenas."
