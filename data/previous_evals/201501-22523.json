    "I would recommend it for anyone interested in ancient civilizations because it gave insight into how archeologists discover the fundamental lives of people in these places.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend it or not. All I can say is that it is a lot of reading, and your enjoyment of the class has a direct relationship to whom the TA is. Pros: Manassa is great, the information is interesting, there is no final Cons: life sucks if you have a bad TA, it is a large amount of weekly reading, weekly reading responses",
    "Stop! Wait a minute! This class is fantastic! I took this class on a whim, simply because I didn't want to walk up Science Hill on cold Shopping Period day and it turned out to be one of my very favorite classes. The material is fascinating, the teacher is fantastic, and the course is fabulous. There is a fair bit of reading and you will be required to write a 1000 word essay every week. If that's a bit daunting, take it credit\/D. But take this course! Trust me- you're going to love it.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in Egygpt or need to the knowledge to help your major. Otherwise probably not. Their are weekly writing assignments, but there is not a final. Just a midterm and final paper, which is reasonable.",
    "It's good, take it if you have an interest in ancient Egypt.",
    "This is a wonderful course that provides an amazing foundation in Egyptian history. The weekly readings can be very long but the lectures make the class worth it."
