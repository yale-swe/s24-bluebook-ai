   "comments": [
    "Good course if you like theory (the bodies and pleasures in the title is a reference to Foucault, if that gives you an idea). Be prepared for mostly theory, some of which is pretty dense, with some articles and films interspersed. The syllabus sometimes felt disjointed, like there wasnt really a trajectory of our discussions from week to week. Still, queer theory is cool so maybe take it?",
    "A challenging but supportive intermediate WGSS course. Strong theoretical focuses and underpinnings, but well-rounded in its approaches to the topics and a great discussion space.",
    "WGSS 205 is a foundational course - but that in no way means it is easy! Be prepared to sit with authors like Foucault and Freud for a while. These are difficult texts and you should not feel lesser for not understanding them at first.",
    "Only take this class if you love, love, love reading theory and discussing it on its own terms. Take this class if you're willing to set aside your own feelings on any one issue and instead adhere to the class' suffocating theoretical consensus. Otherwise, please spare yourself and don't take this class.",
    "Great class! A good intro to queer studies with important assignments that never feel like busy work--you will need to and want to do all the readings and responses!",
    "Absolutely. The class gives a great intro into theories of discourse and knowledge, and about sex, gender, and sexuality. Both are a must for intellectual life in the 21st century.",
    "If you put in the work, you'll have the opportunity to learn so much in this class. This course gives WGSS majors a strong basis to move forward, as it covers a wide range of queer topics with major themes and ways of thinking tying everything together. The final paper was particularly interesting and different from assignments in other classes, as it called on students to think about what the syllabus was missing and argue for what other queer topics needed to be included in the course. Overall, this course was valuable and enlightening."
