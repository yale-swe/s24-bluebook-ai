   "comments": [
    "Basic understanding of the quantum mechanical formalism, in depth understanding of what is so interesting about the measurement problem, introduction to the ongoing philosophical debates surrounding quantum mechanics",
    "I have a more complete grasp now on what philosophers of science think about quantum mechanics, and the actual history of the Bell inequality and EPR which is far more nuanced than the physics community at large understands. It is nice to have actually read Belll and EPR to know exactly what these thinkers had in mind.",
    "I learned more than I could have hoped about the broad outlines and logical skeleton of quantum mechanics! While I found some of the details of the philosophical debates tiresome, I really appreciated the chance to learn about QM and the gaps that remain in understanding it. I also did get a good crash course of sorts in metaphysics, and I had an useful opportunity to critically re-evaluate how I think about scientific theories. Overall, a really fun and informative class - especially towards the beginning.",
    "I have both gained a better appreciation of quantum mechanics and also became more familiar with its current shortcomings. The course provided the opportunity to learn different sides of the debate on developing quantum mechanics and also the opportunity to discuss with peers who are interested in the topic.",
    "Development of philosophical writing skills, seminar discussion abilities, and a much deeper understanding of quantum mechanics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course should be taught twice a week. Becoming acquainted with the formalism takes up a lot of seminar time.",
    "I think the course could be improved by having some sort of understanding check. I felt like people refrained from laying claim to understanding things, which is not conducive to conversation at a high level.",
    "Prof Miller was great. Readings were great. Sometimes class discussion could veer towards the clouds in a way that felt frustrating. Prof Miller tried to reign things in by providing printed outlines for the discussion, but this didn't seem to help much. I think the best way to combat this problem is for her to intervene a bit more forcefully and steer the conversation as it develops. In general, though she did a great job of explaining things and challenging students. Also, great structure for assignments and grading.",
    "I think the course had a good balance of group discussions and learning of the material. The requirement to post at least five discussion posts was also a good way of ensuring we got more familiar with the readings and spent the time to think critically on them. Prof. Miller also continuously collected feedback and asked for our opinions in order to keep the course engaging and interesting. This was already done in the course with Prof. Miller's handouts at class, but it could be better to spend just a bit more time giving the basic ideas of a reading so that more people will be involved in the discussions. I am not if it is feasible to spend more time or whether this would accomplish that purpose though.",
    "More emphasis on philosophy (metaphysics, etc.). We spent a lot of time getting on the same page about quantum vocab, but much less with the philosophical concepts we were floating around.",
    "Really good well-organized seminar discussion, and helpful midterm and final review assignments. The chronology was sometimes a little difficult, as some readings mentioned thoeories or concepts from later in the course, but this might not be able to be helped."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course to become more familiar with one of the deepest mysteries of all time. The beginning is tough, but once you become familiar with the math you will see why quantum mechanics is so mysterious and, ultimately, awesome. Extremely well taught. One of the strongest courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. I think it is especially important that the physics community read the real history of EPR and Bell, especially. Material is super interesting.",
    "Absolutely! Prof Miller is the best, and this class is fascinating. Take it, if only for tthe readings alone. Also, you might be surprised - even if philosophy's not your cup of tea, this is a great way to get an overview of quantum mechanics and its important debates. This will also help you be a better scientist. The only downside is that conversations can veer down rabbit holes and become frustrating. This is especially a problem for the less philosophically inclined. But this, of course, depends on your classmates. Overall, it's a great and consistently thought-provoking class with a wonderful human being of a professor and without too much work. You'll enjoy it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in understanding exactly in what ways textbook quantum mechanics has shortcomings or answer questions like: \"What did Bell's inequality accomplish exactly?\", \"What does a theory tell us?\", \"What should a theory have or how should it be?\", \"What is locality and determinism and in what sense are they related?\", \"What are interpretations of quantum mechanics and how are they different from the textbook version?\" and much more!! There will not be certain answers to all of these questions, but the thought that is put into them is certainly rewarding. The readings that accompany the course are also very interesting!",
    "Yes definitely take this class! If you are a physics person confused by, or just wanting to know more about, quantum mechanics, definitely take this class. Elizabeth Miller is awesome, the readings were interesting,, and there's a lot of flexibility in the class to make it more tailored to your interests\/level of knowledge. Would recommend.",
    "Absolutely. Although the material is hard, I believe it's both worthwhile to try and understand, as well as important for non-STEM majors to get an idea of"
