   "comments": [
    "Could be faster paced and more in-depth. A more \"real world\" analysis would have been interesting i.e. write a paper that does a complete cost effectiveness analysis.",
    "This course is excellent.",
    "The course is well organized and very relevant. I found it difficult to coordinate getting outside help on the course until it was more of a crisis situation. I understand the need for time management for both TAs but they should at least be willing to meet with people who ask for help in order to assess whether the student is indeed not \"getting it\" or is just wanting someone to hold their hand!",
    "Fantastic! This course was the best course, not only this semester, but also in my five years at Yale. The material was interesting, the professor engaging, funny, and smart, and the all the different factors combined to result in a highly enjoyable class. Wildly practical for almost everyone, no matter what field you end up going into, this course is about a way of thinking. The professor was incredibly engaging and funny, making each class a joy. I could not wait to attend lecture each week. The problem sets are truly there to help one learn, not to punish or torture. The class is flexible enough to accommodate anyone's schedule. I could not write a more favorable review than this. I have never written such glowing terms for a class, so I apologize that I don't have practice in effectively communicating my thoughts.",
    "Need to spend more time actually learning the material rather than going through studies\/research. I can't understand the studies\/research if I don't understand the concepts. Not enough time spent actually teaching\/reviewing the material. Also, the midterm was very hard.",
    "I enjoyed the material, the instructor, his engagement with the class, and his willingness to meet the needs of his students. I think it would be helpful to get more examples and practice with skills he wanted us to learn well. He videotaped the classes, which were awesome to go back and reference the lecture.",
    "Strengths - learned hard skills that will transfer to work environment Weaknesses - felt as though I didn't learn the material well enough to complete the test questions. Disconnect between the cases and the evaluations. I liked how you made the excel templates and slides available before class. It made taking notes a lot easier and it also helped me follow along during the excel examples. Thank you!",
    "This class is perfect in every aspect.",
    "Professor makes the course more interesting\/enjoyable.",
    "Its awesome. I loved everything about it. Definitely keep the Homework as mandatory. The forcing function certainly helped with success.",
    "I don't think this was a great introduction class for someone who has little experience in cost effectiveness and analysis. I felt like I needed an economics class or another business class to have understood more of the material. The midterm was ridiculous. I hate exams that have questions that need knowledge far beyond the scope of what has been taught in class, and in the reading. I know grading was very generous with these questions, but I just got more confused instead of having the topics reinforced.",
    "This class was great for learning how to make a decision tree and conduct cost-effectiveness. Video podcasts were extremely helpful for reviewing concepts again.",
    "A very fun and useful course. No weaknesses",
    "very useful, strongly recommended",
    "First of all, this is my favorite class this semester! I love the instructor's lecturing style because I find it very thought-provoking... The way how he encourages students' participation is very inviting. The course materials are interesting and learning objectives are well communicated - very well plugged in with what's going on in current public health topics.",
    "The course set up is slightly different than what I'm used to. There's a heavy emphasis on self-directed learning. You can't discuss the homework with the TAs until after the submission which I say is detrimental to the learning process, however, I did just fine.",
    "i really enjoyed the class and the course materials",
    "Thought it was a good course. Not sure if I learned much about cost effectiveness analysis, per se, but learned a lot of excel and probabilities.",
    "An awesome class! Provided insight into an area I was seriously lacking in before.",
    "Strengths- Paltiel is very enthusiastic and fun to have as a lecturer. I feel like in the end I did learn some interesting aspects of CE Weaknesses- Since the class is quite dense and quite self-taught, the topics sometimes take awhile to wrap your head around (or my head). I attended lecture but a lot of the concepts went so over my head I ended up having to carefully re-watch everything during the midterm and final. I am wondering if brining a laptop to class and following along on excel and then submitting the document at the end of class for a participation grade would be useful.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and feel like I learned a lot.",
    "A great course. Could use more fireworks, but Winslow has a low ceiling.",
    "Strengths - great lectures Weaknesses - none.",
    "I thought this class was one of my best for the semester. It was not a giant time commitment but still provided plenty of work that is practical and useful for the future. The homework is helpful in learning the material and challenging in a good way. It would be a little better if the lectures preceded the homework, but I am not sure which way is better. Struggling through the cases and then reviewing in class is helpful, so long as they are reviewed in class. Grading the homework would not be recommended since everyone is mostly learning it for the first time.",
    "Course was self-taught and lectures weren't really necessary. Wish we got more practice problems.",
    "This was a self taught course. Strengths: It is a practical course, in which you can apply what you learn in different aspects of your professional practice Weaknesses: It was a self taught course, with no feedback on your work. Before every class we had to submit a homework, and during the class the teacher would go over the homework.",
    "This was by far my favorite class this semester. I've always been intimidated by probability, but David really breaks it down so that you understand. The exams are challenging but very doable.",
    "I would suggest more homework problems that are similar to the ones on the exams. Also, it would be great to dedicate the lecture before the exam to going over the practice exam that was given to us.",
    "Very good introduction to economic\/analytic methods in evaluating public health interventions.",
    "The homework is a useful tool, and when we go over it in class as a group, it is particularly helpful. However, we did not always get to all of the homework during the class period, which made some of the homework assignments feel like an unnecessary exercise. If more attention could be paid to going over all of the homework assignments for each relevant class period, this would greatly improve the course.",
    "Really interesting and easy to digest even for a non-econ person. Really interesting supplemental perspective I gained as a CDE candidates.",
    "Useful to get an introduction to this kind of analytical thinking, and the professor was friendly and approachable. Lectures were too long, however, and the time was not always well used. Individuals with stupid questions often diverted the course of instruction, with the effect of interrupting our trains of thought and interfering with the absorption of new material. Classes also danced around providing a straightforward explanation of how to conduct the various analyses, and going back through lecture videos for an explanation was often a frustrating scavenger hunt with lots of repetition and only glancing mention of the information we needed. More formal\/formulaic explanations and study tools would be extremely helpful.",
    "I took this course because a few students in the class above me highly recommended this course. I am greatly disappointed with the course and wish that I had taken the similar course offered at SOM instead. First of all, the course material is something that needs to be taught by the professor, not self taught. The weekly assignments are like games to see how well you can teach the course material to yourself. This kind of course needs to be smaller, more hands on, and have discussion sections. The large lecture room does not work well for this course. Also, Professor Paltiel is not an effective teacher. After receiving some bad feedback on the comment cards he passed out, he asked us to give more feedback because he thought it was other circumstances that led to the bad feedback. His teaching was the cause of the bad feedback.",
    "Strengths- Great practical skills to learn (Cost effectiveness). Professor is amazing. Weaknesses- It can be difficult to master these skills if you are not quantitative or mathematical in nature. The posted readings to teach us the concepts are not the best so self learning is definitely involved. Also the midterm and final took me soooo many hours; just something to be aware of. Improvements- Give us feedback on our hw. Keep posting slides before lecture.",
    "The materials are very interesting. Recordings of the course are extremely helpful. It would have been more helpful to have handouts of the excel sheets used in class so it would be easier to follow in the lecture, instead of looking at different screens.",
    "There is a tremendous amount of self-teaching in this course. Had I not been taking a similar course concurrently, I think I really would have struggled. That said I really like Professor Paltiel.",
    "Great course. Interesting material and taught in a very thought provoking way. Enjoyed pedagogical style.",
    "I liked that we walked through the homework\/examples of how to do problems from start to finish in-class.",
    "Good course! Very well structured, builds a good skill set.",
    "Strengths: such an important skill and potentially tedious to learn, but Dr. Paitel was an amazing professor and made it fun! Weaknesses: sometimes the homeworks were difficult to do on one's own without prior knowledge--good thing is was pass\/fail.",
    "Strengths of this course -- material was useful, certainly not something that I would have learned myself otherwise. However, the first part of the course involving probability trees seemed at times redundant because I could not see myself drawing trees in the working world (outside of academia). I did find the CEA part very useful though. I would like an updated and clearer set of slides, though. The cobalt blue background was quite hard to read on sometimes, even up close!!",
    "I feel like the assignments would have been more meaningful if distributed AFTER the course material was taught, as the 'learn by doing' method made coming to class seem less effective.",
    "I thought that the course was very interesting. I had never had any introduction to the principles covered, so it was fun to realize that I really like decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. That being said, I usually felt like the classes could be half as long and the course could have been half as long. We would spend time going over material that wasn't exactly relevant, and we also had a few classes where we didn't learn any new material. I also want to take a second here to talk about the requirement for health policy students. I think this course should DEFINITELY continue to be a requirement because I am someone who, just looking at the course description, would have said \"no way.\" Yet, I loved the material covered in this course. One thing, though, is I wish that we were instructed to take this course in the FIRST YEAR. I would have loved to continue on with this material by taking Ed Kaplan's policy modeling class, but that is no longer an option for me. (It would also be nice to have something geared more toward policy students who may have less of a background with the math considering it is a requirement for the policy program).",
    "Very difficult course",
    "very nice instructor, informative content, it's also helpful and do not have much workload",
    "The way the knowledge is delivered should be re-examined. There is a lot of room for improvement here.",
    "This class provided me with tangible skills. Lectures were interesting.",
    "This course really opens your mind to a different way of thinking, and teaches very useful skills. The homework can be long and tedious, but I was happy to do every problem, since many of the concepts can be difficult to understand without going through the process yourself. I felt there was a good mix of theory, example problems, and real world application over the course of the semester."

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is an engaging instructor that presents information that is very relevant to the real-world and to studen'ts learning needs. Sometimes I found the slides presented to not be as explicit as I needed in order to get the right answers. This was more of an issue in the pre-midterm material than in the last section of the class which was more Excel based and therefore more explicit.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Professor Paltiel is a gem. I shudder to think what would have happened to this material if attempted by another professor. Professor Paltiel brought his incredible experience and humor to make this class incredible. The class is so successfully only because of Paltiel.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0excellent instructor, kept the atmosphere fun",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0I really enjoyed having class with Dr. Paltiel! He is funny, engaging and incredibly smart. Sometimes, though, I think he loses sight of HOW advanced he is and can make problems more complicated than the skill level he teaches.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very funny guy. He was considerate of students, and approachable.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Lectures after the midterm started to coordinate better with the cases. Before, the lectures were sometimes too slow, and could have covered more than one homework question. More exposure to questions prior to the midterm would be helpful so we could be better prepared for the midterm.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Yale would not be the same without this amazing professor. I am glad I had the chance to be in his class.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0very excellent",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Love him! He offers a spectrum of level of commitment to the material we are learning for each session, which is what I think a graduate school level course should be like. The class meeting time is a little awkward, wish it met twice a week with shorter session time instead.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0He is very energetic and passionate about his work. He's willing to collect feedback but slightly difficult to change based on the feedback.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0I though the instructor was great, really good at explaining the material and keeping everyone interested and involved",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very engaging with the students. Responsive, attentive.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0A lot of fun. Knowledgeable, but also not afraid to admit he didn't know something and willing to entertain new ideas.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Humorous and engaging lectures",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very enthusiastic and fun. Sometimes repetitive, but this is a class that needs it, and amazing at making up test questions",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel was great at explaining the concepts and keeping the class engaged.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0A charming rake.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is amazing. He's a great lecturer. He's very attentive to students' suggestions and gives a logical explanation behind his decisions (i.e., require textbooks vs. not require textbooks, format of exams). He also provides examples from his own work, which reinforce the lecture materials and give conviction to the relevance of the course.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is an enthusiastic and brilliant professor.This class could have easily been a difficult 2 hour lecture to get through each week but his teaching style is both effective and engaging. I would keep that all up and continue to use feedback from students to adapt the course as needed each year. The biggest thing I would call out is some of the material on the midterm and final. While I thought both exams were fair, testing on things that were clearly stated in class as never being expected to answer on a test is frustrating. If we did not have the video recordings of the lectures things may have been pretty bad. Not being able to review these things or have questions answered about them, because it is an exam, is especially challenging. In particular, I think we should have had a homework about the ROC curve because it was still such new material that wasn't fully reviewed in class, and worth such a larger portion of the test grade. Same for the two questions on the final that were \"tricky\" but 15 points each. Overall, I would happily take another course with Dr. Paltiel and really enjoyed this one.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Teacher taught material pretty well, but half of lecture was spent on non-course related material and couldve been dedicated to more practice problems.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Great sense of humor, and you can tell he really cares about student feedback.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Fun, dynamic professor, and responsive to our the class' concerns. I enjoyed the occasional lecture on his current research work.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very enthusiastic, clear, and knowledgeable. Some times the course felt it was going a little slow.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0I greatly appreciate Professor Paltiel's dynamic and engaging teaching style. I find him to be strong at explaining the material, and always willing to go over and re-exlplain everything. On the whole, I found his class to be highly entertaining and enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Amazing lecturer. Really engaging guy and he can very effectively balance his professionalism and friendliness with the students.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Energetic, friendly, good sense of humor, firm grasp on material. Slides were a mix, however, and often contained unnecessary or irrelevant information that made review more difficult. Lectures were scheduled too long, though it was good of Professor to release us early when we made it through the day's slides. A TA section would have been helpful for making sure our understanding of the methods was sound.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Professor Paltiel is very responsive to student needs and concerns. He actively seeks feedback again and again until he is satisfied with the kind of feedback he receives. As mentioned in the last response, he passed out comment cards twice because he was unhappy with some of the bad feedback he received the first time he passed out the comment cards. His teaching is lacking. He warned us that the first half of the course is more \"self-taught\". Why should I have taken this course at all is he won't teach us? Even when we entered the second half of the course, I still had to \"self-teach\" myself.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Strengths-Amazing, engaging, passionate about the topic..he is the only one that can make a topic like cost effectiveness interesting. Best professor at YSPH Weaknesses- none I can think off.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Great knowledge of subject, and able to explain concepts well. Though the first half of the course should have been more instructive.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is super engaging and entertaining (yes, I think your jokes are funny). That being said, he sometimes goes quickly through things where he could spend more time and slowly through things that we have been over several times. In all, I enjoyed coming to class, so that should say something.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0good lectures, but it was still hard to complete assignments. needed more instruction\/help with assignments.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Excellent teacher with a highly engaging teaching methodology",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very energetic, engaging and interested in his students. Great lecturer. I liked when he presented his own work to show practical applications of the subject matter. He also clearly invested a lot of time making exams and homework assignments more enjoyable through his creativity and humor.",

    "This course will probably be one of the most useful classes in my time at Yale. The skills are practical to many paths after graduation and even if they do not get applied, they are important to understand. Not everything will make sense at first but it all comes together at the end if you put in the work. Plus, Dr. Paltiel is a great lecturer and is a brilliant professor.",

    "A very interesting course regarding decisions made in healthcare with costs as a consideration. Teaches great analytical skills and analysis that will be very helpful in the future.",
    "This course teaches useful skills and ways of thinking about problems; the homework and exams are also the most fun out of all the ones I've taken at YSPH.",
    "Highly recommend!",
    "Take it!! It's an amazing course and you learn a lot!",
    "Recommend for the usefulness of the material.",
    "I would say that this class is a great introduction to decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. The cases are fun and interesting (not graded- which I think is a great policy from someone who actually did quite well on them). The midterm and final are very time consuming, but can be done in one day. I would probably recommend this class, but I think there is definitely a certain type of student who should take it, so I would be careful who I recommended to. Since I don't know where else to put this I also want to take a second to complain about the use of questions on the final exam for which we did not have appropriate instruction. While this is nice for people who are good at extrapolating\/have experience in these concepts through other courses etc.\/ it is not helpful\/should not be indicative of those students who consistently preformed well in this course and were engaged with the material.",
    "very difficult class",
    "a very good course. not much workload. nice instructor and it's very helpful.",
    "Summary: This course teaches students the balance between costs and benefits and how to navigate the terrain. Very applicable to many fields including, clinical practice, strategy consulting, public sector etc.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially for non-HPM students who may otherwise have no exposure to the subject.",
    "A very useful and practical course, I am very happy to have taken it. Recommend."
