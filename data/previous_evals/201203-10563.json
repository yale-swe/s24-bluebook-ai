   "comments": [
    "...for a fellow student? Best. Class. Ever.Absolutely; I would most especially recommend Prof. Sussman's class to students interested in inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary approaches to literature and philosophy. That is, I believe his course's approach mixes and matches the best of both worlds (namely, literature and philosophy.) And, importantly, that it does so without sacrificing the best that each has to offer. It fully engages the ''literariness'' of literature, without sacrificing it at the altar of Philosophy. And it fully engages the ''analytic'' and ''rigorous'' thinking that is characteristic of philosophy (the term 'modality,' for instance, came up a few times even in the first couple classes at the very beginning of the semester), without sacrificing it at the altar of literariness.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in learning about systems theory starting with Hegel and Kant and its application, especially if they were interested in cybernetics. There was also enough flexibility within the course to pursue other applications."
