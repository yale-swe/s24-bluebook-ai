   "comments": [
    "Great class! If you have a mathematical inclination, and even if you think you know probability, TAKE this class. You will not be disappointed.",
    "Math 241 is a standard introduction to probability theory. It could be skipped by students already familiar with some probability without too much trouble; otherwise, it is a good course to satisfy applied math requirements.",
    "Simply the best class you can take at Yale. If you leave Yale without taking Professor Zhou's course, you're missing out.",
    "STAT 241 is a rigorous treatment of probability theory. It is the best class at Yale for learning prob. theory, especially if you want to do applied math or information theory. However, this class is very difficult and a lot of work. I spent a lot of hours struggling through the problem sets (which were very harshly graded). If you are taking this class, expect it to be one of your most difficult.",
    "A good antidote to plug-and-chug AP Statistics. The first part of the course was somewhat boring, but it developed nicely into some elegant ideas - random walks, moment-generating functions, deriving some well-known distributions, etc. It wasn't extremely rigorous (very few proofs), but it was still a good course. H. Zhou is entertaining as well as clear in explaining ideas. I'm definitely looking forward to taking statistics classes in the future.",
    "Don't take it with Professor Zhou. The material is not difficult but the grading is harsh.",
    "I would NEVER recommend this class. This class was not required for my major and I took it because it sounded interesting. During shopping period, it seemed like a reasonable class. But then it goes downhill FAST. I would literally rather have a tooth extraction without anesthesia than suffer through another semester like this one. Do NOT take this class unless it is absolutely required.",
    "Great class. The class material isn't easy and the psets can be very difficult but rest assured that the exams are VERY easy. You understand probability from the most basic tenets of it and both the professor and the TAs are amazing. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in probability.",
    "Solid course. Harry is very approachable, definitely go to his office hours. He explains things pretty much clearly. The homework was occasionally difficult, but usually fairly straightforward, and there were tons of office hours, which were a great resource for the homework. Exams were easy (I think). Not a hard class and interesting if you're into that stuff, though I wouldn't say it's mind-blowing.",
    "I would recommend it because I feel it was useful for me in other classes, e.g. Physics, Lab courses etc.",
    "If you need a rigorous introduction to probability theory, this is the only way to go.",
    "Yeah, it doesn't even matter whether this class was good or not. This is probably the most universally applicable class you will take at Yale. That said, I think the structure of this particular course was disorganized. While the material itself was kept at a good level, it was difficult to keep up since the lecture notes often did not coincide with the textbook\/we didn't really have a textbook. I watched some of Harvard's Stat 110 lectures online in preparing for the midterm, and I thought the sequence of topics in that was much better organized. Looking at David Pollard's notes from last year showed that the sequence was more coherent in that year as well. However, I think Professor Zhou's advantage was his affable nature and his understanding that we were not all mathematics geniuses (unlike DP). The problems were very fair - challenging but doable. Again, I just wish that there had been more structure to the course and better reference.",
    "If you have to take it, I recommend quickly getting the gist of probability spaces, conditional\/bayesian ideas, and then compiling a list of distributions with their moment generating functions. In other words, learn the class in two weeks and then coast the rest of the term.",
    "STAT 241 explores the basics of probability, focusing on the proofs behind the major theorems. It explores basic distributions, expectation, and variance among other topics. It also tackles some of the most famous problems in probability. There are weekly problem sets, one midterm exam, and a final exam. I would definitely recommend this class for a fellow student. Professor Zhou is great!",
    "This class was pretty rad. Anyone want to open a restaurant with me called Bouffon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Noodles? We can serve:Normal NoodlesNoodles with PoissonHalf-Price Markov NoodlesAn Assortment of Noodles from the Sample SpaceBernoodlies for KidsSay we have n customers who are all desperately trying to leave our esteemed establishment at once, but the n checks get hopelessly scrambled. What it the probability no one gets his or her check back?Our head chef is sort of spastic and decides to take a random walk. Lets hope his walk doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take place in 3-space or we may need to hire another.",
    "Solid introduction to probability theory. Note what you're signing up for though. This class will serve as a useful framework for the mathematics behind probability. However, beyond Bayes Theorem, your understanding of probability conceptually won't significantly improve.",
    "Good class, but depends on who is teaching it. I am a math major, and with Zhou this class was super easy. Hardly any proofs--just a lot of applications of stuff from class. Definitely recommended if the material sounds interesting to you.",
    "A great, thorough introduction to Probability. You learn about all sorts of interesting problems and if you like math, definitely consider taking thiscourse! Probability is such an important aspect of our lives so this class is well worth your time.",
    "If you like math problem-solving and think that probability questions are fun, then take this course. You learn a bunch of cool paradoxes in statistics along with all of the major distributions: binomial, poisson, student-t, normal, etc. Also, Prof. Zhao is an entertaining lecturer with lots of funny stories, so if you're into the material you will enjoy this course.",
    "I would recommend this course. While the coursework is challenging, it is fun (if you're into mathematics). The homework can get challenging and take a lot of time to do (especially toward the end of the semester), but it is all good preparation for the tests. The professor (Harry Zhou) is a great teacher and has a great sense of humour. The office hours are very helpful and the tests are fair (but very theoretical). However, if you're the type of person who doesn't like going to class (especially since it's an early morning class), then you probably shouldn't take this course, because the lecture notes, while posted online, are not enough by themselves to get through the course.",
    "STAT 241 is an introduction to probability theory (note not a repeat AP statistics). It goes into combinatorics, various distributions, expectation, variance, and famous problems related to probability. The textbook is very difficult to learn from, but between the lecture notes, going to class, and the textbook, you can piece together an understanding of the material. The problem sets for this class are difficult to do without the collaboration of other students or going to office hours. (Harry's office hours are very helpful!) The problem sets are pretty harshly graded considering their length and the amount of time each one takes. One small error warrants 1 pt out of 4 pts off, which seems tough. The tests for this class are very fair. They just test basic understanding of the material (i.e. how to find expectation, moment generating functions etc.) and are very doable in a short time period (unlike some of the homework problems). This class counts participation, which just means attending lectures so Harry recognizes your face. Harry is an awesome professor! He is really sweet. His lectures are sometimes disorganized, which is why it's helpful to go to class and see him talk through the problem etc, but he presents multiple solutions to problems which is very helpful in building intuition about probability. All in all, solid introduction to probability and I recommend it if you want to delve into proof-based theoretical math while gaining skills that are applicable to daily life.",
    "Make sure you know what you want before signing up for it.",
    "This was a horrible class. No progression of concepts; no textbook used; unrelated homework problems to the material in class; confusing lectures... I could go on and on. If Prof. Zhou is teaching it, expect to get a different textbook from the library and teach yourself the material. Probability is by no means a difficult subject, but this class was so incredibly frustrating that you'll forget that. Not recommended unless you have to take it.",
    "Probability is fascinating; this course gets down to some ofits nitty-gritty, but is mostly obscure a lot of the time. I did not learn how to prove things, which I hoped for; much of what Harry demonstrated in class was clever rearrangement of terms, the main takeaway from which was that knowing what you wanted to show is crucial. I wish I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d taken 238.",
    "Stat 241 is a great intro probability course. Take it if you are interested in a major that requires it.",
    "A solid introduction to probability for a math major. Generally proof-based, although not as rigorous as a typical math course perhaps. Still, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balanced out by a few more real-world examples. (Who knew you could model the number of bombs falling on each square mile of London during WWII using a relatively simple probability distribution?) Professor Zhou is a strong professor, certainly better than average for the math department (although I suppose his actual department is Stats). He is responsive and generally helpful outside of class and his lectures are good. The number of students attending the early-morning lectures did dwindle throughout the semester; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re passably engaging but hardly entertaining enough to get you out of bed in the morning so make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to do the early mornings if the course is offered at 9:15 again. The weekly problem sets really are weekly\u00e2\u0080\u009412 in total\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the homework and the reviews do help on the exams, which are pretty fair. The course does not cover statistical applications to other fields, nor does it cover the use of statistical computer software. All in all, I would recommend shopping the course if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to understand the mathematical underpinnings of probability.",
    "I mean if you're probably not going to take this class for fun. . .I found the professor and his lecture notes hard to understand. He seemed like a nice guy though. Lot of grad students in the class, which isn't factored into the curve, but not sure if thats a good or bad thing. Just one of those classes you have to take if its the prereq for something."
