   "comments": [
    "This year the course was taught as a seminar as opposed to a lecture which I think was better. The course met once a week and we had two essays during the semester with no exams. The discussions were great if you did the readings and if you are interested in the subject. Professor Joseph is wonderful and I sometimes wish we had done fewer student presentations (students pair up and do a presentation and lead an activity each week) so that we could hear even more of his great insights. He's incredibly knowledgeable and always there to help and talk to students.",
    "If you have any interest in Mexico or Latin America, TAKE IT. One of the best classes at Yale on the subject, and one of my best classes ever.",
    "Take it, it's a lot of interesting information, and the professor is great!",
    "Mexico Since Independence is a fascinating course, with very interesting reading, that gives you a sense of Mexican history for the past hundred years. Since it began as a lecture, the class occasionally didn't feel fully seminar-esque; that is, the professor (or the student presenters) would talk at the class, instead of with it. But Professor Joseph is the sweetest and most dedicated professor, super knowledgeable and really motivated to connect with students.",
    "It was a great seminar. I learned a lot and there was never too much reading assigned.",
    "HIST 358J will be one of your best opportunities to really get to know Mexico and its history from a balanced, objective perspective. The discussions were extremely interesting, the reading was always doable, and the topics were very well organized. Prof. Joseph is a wonderful person, and he will make learning history an interesting and engaging experience.",
    "A great class for those interested, and really for everyone, as the class eventually touches on subjects that should interest most anyone: drug trafficking, corruption, war, economics, culture, you name it.Professor Joseph is great--even when he is demanding. The work is about average, maybe a bit more--some weeks with lots of reading, some weeks much less--one group presentation that does require work--one short paper (5pp) and one longer, semi-research one (15-20pp).A fun engaging class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to another student. If it's a lecture it might be worthwhile, but as a seminar the course is disjointed and bland.",
    "History of Mexico with a well-rounded mix of readings and perspectives from the man on the street to party leadership to international players in Mexican history. Simulations of historical moments, candid discussion.",
    "DEFINITELY recommended, if you want to learn about the world (or, a piece of it). Many will say this, but Mexico really is so close, and so interconnected to US history as well as current events. This class gives you a taste of the nuances of this relationship, and of a really rich society. Lots of cultural history as well as political; great readings and films.",
    "I highly recommend taking this class. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would have rated this seminar as Excellent but for the sole reason that there was not enough discussion in my opinion to really make it the seminar experience. HOWEVER, this was far and away my favorite class this semester, and a tie-in for one of my favorite classes I've taken so far (I just finished sophomore year). Professor Joseph is highly knowledgeable about all things Mexico, not to mention a kind and generous teacher who was more than happy to meet outside of class and give extra assistance. He took our seminar out to three meals (two at Pacifico for each guest speaker we had, and one at Mezcal for the end of the semester celebration) and I just loved him! The readings for this class are very comprehensive and aren't just cut and dry- the Mexico Reader, which we drew a lot from and was actually compiled by Prof. Joseph, includes journal entries, songs, essays, and original prose from key Mexican thinkers such as Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos and Luis Guzm\u00e1n. This class was great, I would HIGHLY recommend it. The workload wasn't too bad either- a ton of reading, but it's all interesting, and two papers, plus an in-class presentation, which was fun. Take this class!"
