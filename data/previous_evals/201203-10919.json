    "It's a great class as an introduction to epidemics (for those of us with less experience) and an extension for those with a knowledge of epidemiology. It is a graduate seminar course so the professor does expect you to come in with some background knowledge but you will survive without it.",
    "A nice survey of major disease epidemics that have occurred in Asia in recent centuries, including more recent ones in the 20th century.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the social,anthropological, political and economic implications of epidemic diseases.",
    "Yes, definitely. Also, Prof. Summers tailors his lectures to be appropriate for a variety of depths of knowledge about public health, so I would recommend the class to anyone with an interest."

   "comments": [
    "I had very little background in epidemics before this and spent most of the class learning.It is inapplicable to my course of study.",
    "The course was useful in helping me think about how governments have approached public health at various points in history, and how changes in ecology can drive disease epidemics.",
    "Not a great deal but helpful to understand how epidemic disease has broader implications for society than just a medical dimension."
