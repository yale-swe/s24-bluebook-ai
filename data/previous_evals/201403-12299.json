    "Take it if you're doing a thesis project and\/or you want to go to graduate school! Very helpful to finally get some hands on experience, not just in the lab but with running stats on your own, deciding how to approach a study, etc. A lot of work, but should be interesting to you anyways!",
    "Yes. Great research opportunity, and though the time can be a bit demanding, it's worth it for the experience.",
    "Find the right faculty advisor and this will be a great experience.",
    "I would recommend a two-semester project (475) to make sure that you have time to collect enough data and analyze it.",
    "I learned a lot from doing research. Make sure you find the right lab for you (people and the material). I worked in the same lab during the summer and that made the transition easier.",
    "Research. Plain and simple.",
    "Yes, as a science undergrad this is the most valuable experience you can have at yale, to work in a lab and be mentored by a faculty member doing research. I highly recommend doing research in a lab instead of writing a review paper. Its also really fun to spend time there working with your hands and learning different lab techniques!",
    "Yes, if you have a good mentor who will make sure you keep on task and who has guidelines for you to follow. Otherwise, it can be easy to fall behind and skip things with the plethora of other work there is to be done on campus, both academic and extracurricular."
