   "comments": [
    "I learned how to think strategically. Even if I don't always use formal models in my own work, when evaluating a theory, I will always ask myself: what are the players, their actions, and their utilities?",
    "This course was well taught and it gave my the skills to understand the fundamental concepts in game theory.",
    "I learnt about the basic principles of game theory, how to solve one-shot (\"static\") games in pure and mixed strategies; sequential games using backward induction and concepts of sublime perfect Nash equilibrium; repeated interaction games and imperfect information games (using Bayesian Nash equilibrium). Concepts aside, this class taught me how to utilise \"formal\" tools in research and develop game-theoretic answers to critical questions.",
    "I gained knowledge on the fundamental concepts of game theory such as Nash equilibrium (for pure and mixed strategies), Sub-game Perfect equilibrium, and Perfect Bayesian equilibrium. I acquired skills to solve games in static and dynamic settings, with perfect information, imperfect information, as well as those with incomplete information. Some of the major insights I developed were from the applications which were covered as part of the course, including those relating to taxation and redistribution, democratization, and explanations of war."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: An excellent mix of accessibility and rigor. Some readings were extremely easy (Watson), while others showed how game theory is actually used (Meltzer-Richards, Fudenberg and Tirole, Powell). All Watson would have been boring; all advanced papers would have been too intimidating. Perhaps the greatest strength of the course was the discussion sections. Using the allocated time to work through problems was incredibly helpful in building skills. I hadn't had a section before in which new work was assigned, but I ended up liking this system very much; it gave us valuable supervised practice every week. Suggestions for improvement: A small one: make the presentations slightly earlier, hold the review session the very last class, closest to the final. The pace in the first two weeks can be sped up, perhaps leaving more time to explore advanced topics in depth.",
    "This course was well taught by the professor and the teaching fellow. One suggestion that I have is that we connect what we learn in class (learning how to solve game trees, normal forms) with articles in the literature that use game theory but do not feature game trees and normal forms.",
    "An exceptionally well taught course, easily the best course taken this year. It begins slowly (and in slow doses), giving students time to internalise basic concepts before plunging into higher-order concepts and approaches. Having short 50 minute lectures, with precise\/crisp presentations is an excellent format. Using the section to solve problems is a great way to learn concepts with assistance from a TF.",
    "Strengths of the course included: 1. Well-organized course with focus on the fundamental concepts in game theory. 2. The problem sets were challenging but were designed in a way that improved clarity of concepts and facilitated learning. 3. The topic review provided an opportunity to analyze and critique research papers which proposed game theoretic models. I really enjoyed this course and learnt a whole lot. Perhaps, it can be improved further in two minor ways: 1. Including a session or two on how to review research papers which present game theoretic models. 2. In the final weeks the workload became a bit difficult to manage with the topic review, alongside the problem sets. If the problem sets could have concluded a bit earlier, it may have been a bit more manageable."

    "Take it if either of the following apply: 1. You're interested in non-cooperative game theory 2. You're not convinced that you'll use game theory in your own work, but don't want to be intimidated by phrases like \"Markov Perfect Equilibrium\"",
    "Yes, this course will help you learn the basic concepts in game theory. However, if you already have taken courses in game theory, you would like benefit more by taking a more advanced course than this one.",
    "If not for essential training in game theory, take this course because of its current instructor - an exceptional teacher!",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I think it is a perfectly designed course to understand the fundamental concepts of game theory. The applications included in the course are also very interesting, and the problem sets especially facilitate learning. At a minimum, a participant of the course can expect to become familiar with the basic set-up of games in both static and dynamic settings. This can, in turn, enable clarity in the thought process, especially when proposing and communicating one's own theory."
