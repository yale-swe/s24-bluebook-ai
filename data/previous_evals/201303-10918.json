   "comments": [
    "Introduction to Islamic Architecture is pretty much what it sounds like; for any student with an interest in gaining a general background knowledge on the subject, this class is a wonderful way to do so. It might be slightly frustrating for someone who already has an extensive understanding of the topic, as there isn't really enough time to delve much below the surface.",
    "One midterm, one final, one museum report paper (simple). It was good, but in hindsight I would have taken a different course. It was difficult to understand the terminology at times.",
    "This is one of my favorite art history courses at Yale! Professor Rizvi is amazing and the lectures fly by, plus I learned an amazing amount. Just make sure you start studying early- the names of the buildings are hard to memorize!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a survey knowledge of Islamic Architecture from 700 to the present. The workload is moderate, and the tests are relatively straightforward. No particular background in Islamic culture or art history is necessary, though the survey course in Islamic Society& Politics might be useful for better understanding some of the social trends that underlay the shifts in architectural style?",
    "I strongly recommend this class for anyone who wants to deal with art, architecture, and history in the Islamic World through architecture. Buildings are a brilliant way to engage topics such as these and really open your eyes to other cultures. The work load is very fair and perfectly balanced and is a great addition to anyone trying to escape the monotony of a DS, Math-Science, or intensive schedule. Professor Rizvi is one of the best people ever and her lectures are really good. The TA's are also wonderful and really care about how we deal with subjects. Overall, just do it! You will NOT regret it!",
    "This class is predominantly a lecture-based course in which you will learn a great deal about the history of what may be obscure architecture and forms, providing formal insight into wonders of this world that play the margins of the imagination (at least for students who receive the majority of their education in the West as I did). I would only recommend this class to a student who has a particular interest in the study of Architecture, architectural history, and\/ or Islam.",
    "Yes! If you have an interest in design, learning about different cultures, architecture, it is a great class and I now am so fascinated by Islamic buildings.",
    "Take it! Professor Rizvi is a wonderful professor and the course material is fascinating.",
    "Yes! Take it! It's a great art history class about a field that many people do not know enough about.",
    "I really enjoyed this class!!! I like how the class ties in contemporary issues and colonial + post-colonial architecture into the study of Islamic architecture. Section was fun, and lectures were fast-paced, but interesting and very well organized. Professor Rizvi is really great and super knowledgeable. One semester is not a lot of time to cover so much material but she really squeezes a lot out of it content wise!",
    "This is a really great survey of Islamic architecture. Prof. Rizvi is a wonderful lecturer, which is what hooked me on this course. She is so knowledgeable and approachable; she is what makes the class so good. The course moves in chronological order and covers a wide geographic area, which allows for great comparisons. The workload is not so heavy either (just make sure to read the assignments that are listed for section since that is almost all that is discussed, and it will come up on the exams). There is a fair amount of memorization, so study early (or maybe even take it Cr\/D\/Fail if you decide to take it just on a whim)."
