    "The course was a run through some of the older and more recent ways that people analyze cell signaling as a system, running through logical loops, on-off switch systems, and various algorithms for solving systems biology in practice. I would definitely recommend this to another BME student who is interested in the interactions of molecular mechanisms within cells. The course was also enjoyable and Levchenko gives you free range with your final project, which was really interesting since you can tailor your coursework with any area of your interest within cell signaling.",
    "A superb class. take it, you learn amazing stuff, get to explore a topic in great detail and basically have fun while taking a BME elective. It's a great, great way to fulfill the requirement. I recommend it to everyone. Although ours was the first time he taught this class, so it was probably easier than expected but you should still take the class.",
    "It's a good class that can be used to fulfill one's requirements. Not too stressful, but you still learn how to think about biological data in new ways. Compared to classes that are a lot of work, but then you forget it all, I think this class is very useful because it helped me to begin looking at things with a more quantitative perspective."
