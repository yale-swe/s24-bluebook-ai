    "One of the hardest classes I've taken at Yale, but definitely an important one as a philosophy major",
    "I vaguely remember that in order to take this class, you are supposed to have read the Critique before (either in DS or in the intro philosophy class). If that's true, you can probably make up your mind for yourself. When I was in DS, I fell in love with it after reading basically only the B Preface and the transcendental deduction; I didn't understand exactly what was going on, but I had some weird idea that this was the answer to all my problems, so I absolutely loved PHIL204. If you didn't have that feeling, I'm not sure whether to recommend it. The class really is just an in depth analysis of Kant's various arguments in the book; you should care about the book if you take the class. Franks is an extremely interesting lecturer, and the essays are just normal evaluations of specific arguments. What makes this class special though is the book itself; Kant is a genius.",
    "PHIL 204 was a difficult and beautiful course. Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is a difficult book, so no matter how lucidly it was presented what is difficult remained difficult. But at the summit of each difficult hill unfolded a beautiful landscape. Sometimes I saw watertight architecture while occasionally I saw a quagmire. Overall I had some taste of philosophy, a part of which was crisp and clear while some others were tangled and dizzying. I also thought Prof. Franks' lecture had a theatrical quality - probably due to the drama of the way in which the material was arranged."
