   "comments": [
    "Professor Cadieu crafted a gorgeous syllabus, offered thorough and perceptive readings, listened carefully to everything students said, did a wonderful job of drawing out comments in class in a productive way, and was clearly extremely intelligent. A truly fantastic professor! She was also extremely kind and understanding (my French was at a considerably lower level than the other students'). Nothing bad to say!!",
    "I would recommend Professor Cadieu's class to anyone with an interest in feminism, gender theories and theories of sexuality, psychoanalysis and its discontents, Deleuze (and Guattari), film, 20th-c. French literature, the uses of space in literature and film, contemporary France and especially its urban regions",
    "I would only recommend it as long as the student is completely fluent in french and quite knowledgeable in modern\/contemporary french critical theories.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in French feminisms or less well-known 20th century French literature.",
    "Yes. The class was exceptionally well defined thematically and methodologically. We learned about a topic (female figures of wandering), but we also learned how to think using a set of theoretical tools (gender theory, critical theory)."

    "It was very useful to read and discuss certain seminal works of French feminist theory. This course also allowed us the opportunity, which unfortunately seems to be fairly rare, to focus on women writers and contemporary literature.",
    "Although this course was not a survey of 20th-c. literature, it introduced me to many 20th-c. works of fiction and theory that will give me a basis for further exploration, I think. The class was hugely helpful on the subject of (mostly) French feminism, and particularly in the ways in which it incorporates or rejects psychoanalysis (Kristeva on the one hand, Wittig on the other, for example). We saw that Butler provides a third alternative, taking on culture and symbolic discourses while navigating between the Scylla and Charybdis of, on the one hand, the fantasy of a (perhaps not so) subversive pre-symbolic, and on the other, of the symbolic's dissolution. And we saw many other examples of playful approaches to \"the problem of the symbolic\" (Sophie Calle especially comes to mind). A challenging and stimulating course that has changed my perspectives and will continue to influence my work going forward.",
    "The class definitely enabled me to practice some new theoretical frameworks.",
    "We read a number of canonical works, but the balance could have been better in this regard.",
    "I am not in the French department so I cannot speak to this question directly. The course deepened my understanding of literature and cinema significantly, however, and taught me to think about gender, class, and representation in more critical ways."
