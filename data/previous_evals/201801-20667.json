   "comments": [
    "This course is certainly pedagogically much better than CHNS110 and CHNS120. I very much prefer having the same teacher during the entire semester instead of changing every week.",
    "It is a course that, by nature of the language, is very based on memorization. I like the interactive aspect of the classes but would love even more opportunities to engage in dialogues.",
    "The strengths are the close relationships with the teachers, tutorials, the presentations, and he teacher-class participation.",
    "Overall, I think this course does a great job of improving students Chinese language abilities - the only thing I feel could be improved would be spending more time on sentence structures as opposed to the story for each section.",
    "The teachers, Laoshi sun, was great and made class engaging and the learning fun. However, the class moves very fast and there is not a lot of time to properly learn all the vocab.",
    "The regular structure of how each textbook chapter is covered over six days helped me a lot to focus on learning the new vocabulary\/grammar structures. I also found the grammar feedback I got on my short essays super helpful."

    "I would definitely recommend this class. The professors are amazing, brilliant, kind, and supportive. Plus you learn so much Chinese and just by nature of meeting everyday you will exponentially improve.",
    "Yes, if the student wishes to improve upon his\/her Chinese abilities I would fully recommend this course",
    "Yes because it is taught well but you have to be willing to put a lot of work in.",
    "Yes! The workload was about the same as Chinese 120."
