    "The class content is too broad and cursory to be useful to students who have had some previous exposure to corporate sustainability. There wasn't very much \"strategy\" to this class, and it was pretty disorganized.",
    "The class was very disorganized. This was the case for many areas of the course but i'll provide a couple examples. 1) timelines were not clearly thought out as multiple assignments were due on the same day or within just a few days, 2) information wasn't distributed in a timely manner - I can think of at least twice we were given less than a week to complete or study for assignments that had a large impact on our grade because material wasn't circulated early enough in advance, including subjects for the midterm. 3) There wasn't a feel of cohesion between the lectures in the course, it just seemed like we were taught something completely different from one lecture to the next, the professors often were unable to complete a large amount of material in the slideshows because time ran out. 4) Questions we were asked to answer were very vague, sometimes with absolutely no guidance (such as debate criteria), this would be fine but the grading rubrics were then very picky, causing a situation where we either got lucky and hit the right expectations or completely missed them.",
    "Course is not practical. Very little useful information.",
    "A large portion of the course was rooted in theory and frameworks for academic thinking, at the expense of strategies for practitioners to actually implement solutions to the challenges outlined in the class. Ben spent an undue amount of time talking about FSC and SFI, the spotted owl, and legality verification. That content certain deserves a few minutes of class discussion, but it would have been far preferable to have more lectures from Marian, or guest lectures from real practitioners rather than abstract concepts and tenuous connections to real-world application.",
    "Marian is an amazing instructor. And she is so nice and really cares about the material! Cashore was really hard to follow in this class.",
    "The course was interesting. As it was a survey course, I feel like I wouldn't be able to immediately explain the steps a company should take to practice good environmental management. Perhaps that is due to the different nature of various businesses."

    "- Would have liked to see marketing\/ consumer facing aspects of corporate sustainability discussed more throughout the class. - There was a good mix of theory and examples of practice but maybe the structure of the class made it difficult to connect\/analyse the two against each other. Only through the final project did I feel I had the chance to make good use of integration. - It would be great if the content of class could be structured in such a way that it produced bundles of 'toolkits' instead of just frameworks of thinking and exposure to different cases.",
    "Aside from the disorganization, the material was very hypothetical and sometimes very difficult to comprehend. The slides were not very useful to study, as they often said one or two key phrases rather than explaining them and summarizing key points. If you didn't grasp exactly what the professor was saying the keywords meant nothing to you.",
    "The design of the course - lectures, materials, and how to relate it to real practice of corporate environmental management.",
    "Coordination between the professors to form a sense of cohesion between their ideas and lectures.",
    "Cap the class at half the current size.",
    "This course was a two-teacher course, which had its benefits and its drawbacks. While it was interesting to look at different aspects of corporate sustainability, the class was often disorganized and the expectations for students were not clearly set out. Often, many things were told at the last minute, which made it difficult to produce the work that the professors were expecting. Some of the slides needed updating and proofreading. This class was very much about the theory, and not about how these ideas are applied or actual strategies about how to apply them. Additionally, it would have been better to go more into depth in some of the topics, to better understand how they could be applied, rather than the philosophy. I went to a lecture (on sustainable buildings and the bottom line) that covered almost all of the important elements we learned in class from the beginning of the course through the midterm in about an hour and half. I think that if some of the pace was faster in the beginning, there would be plenty of time to learn about implementation skills in the course. The philosophy\/policy part of the class did not have very many examples (only the FSC vs SFI) and never really reached any conclusion. It was only in speaking to Cashore one-on-one that I truly understood what he was talking about. I know that the debates and case studies were designed to create discussion and analyze the readings,but they were a bit repetitive and were not always successful in illuminating the reading. I tihnk small group activities may be a strategy to work into the class in the future. The group projects are the culminating project of this course, and while mine was very good, because it had an actual client and material that related to the course content, i do not believe that this was the case for everyone. This is really a lost opportunity because there is a lot of potential for learning through the project. The visiting professors were interesting, and brought a more applied or experiential understanding to the topics we discussed in class.",
    "Ben Cashore's lectures were far too theoretical, and in my opinion, somewhat disorganized. I enrolled in the course for more applicable skills. Less political theory, more real-life scenarios.",
    "There was a juxtaposition between Marian's practical approach to the subject matter and Ben's academic approach. Sometimes this difference was more jarring than complementary.",

However I didn't learn as much business strategy as I had hoped. Since most of the students in this class have more environmental background than business, it may have been better to have more \"pure\" business strategy content.",

My advice to future students is to start early and ask for advice from the professors and TAs early so that you have a good direction for your project. In addition if you don't have a client or can't contact the company you're studying, reach out to alums who are working in the industry.
