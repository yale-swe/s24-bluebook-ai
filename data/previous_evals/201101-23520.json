    "Definitely recommended.",
    "I could write glowing reviews out my ass all day for this class but it would be a waste of time for everyone. Take it! Best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Learn about the reasons why wars start. So cool, definitely take it, and take it seriously so you can gain from it.",
    "Causes of War is not the first class that I have taken with Prof. Darden, but it will sadly be the last, since I am graduating. I can say without any doubt that he is certainly one of the finest professors I have had the pleasure of having in my four years at Yale, though I am led to understand that, thanks to rampant idiocy in the internal matters of the Yale Political Science department, he may not be around to enlighten other undergraduates in the future. This would be a tragedy (and a boon to wherever he may end up) because his classes are immensely rewarding. This particular course covered the causes of war from a theoretical perspective, a seemingly 'simple' exploration which raises very deep and provocative questions about political science as well as public policy. It is of course a very important question to answer - can wars be predicted \/ prevented? - and the course attacks the subject from a variety of angles, from our readings of Thucydides (Athens and Sparta) to the 30 Years War, to WWII. Of course, we also dealt with the subject more on the basis of theory alone, which was valuable of itself.The breadth of the course was great, and I really enjoyed having grad students in the class who had a lot to add - and who kept the pace and tenor intense, though thankfully we had enough undergraduates to balance that somewhat! We also had a Diplomacy 'lab' section which was also a lot of fun and helped illustrate some points from the class. This class demands serious effort from its participants, but we were rewarded with great conversations and excellent insights, facilitated by the friendly hand and great knowledge of Prof Darden, whose humor and brilliance together made for delightful class discussions. The current events from this semester (Arab Spring, Libya) also served for interesting fodder"
