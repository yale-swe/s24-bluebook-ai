    "I took it to fulfill my language requirement but i do think my spanish improved. Everyday class can be a drag but Ame really made it enjoyable.",
    "If you have to do L4, do it with Ame. She's very patient and understanding, and looks out for her students. The class is a step up from L3 at first, but not much different. Reading the novella was a good way to finish the term. Tests were crazy hard at first but got easier as the term went on. Solid class to continue learning spanish in.",
    "I would recommend the course, whether to fulfill a requirement or if you're looking to improve your spanish. Take it with Prof Cividanes--fabulous teacher.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. Even though it is frequently needed in order to fulfill the language requirement, it can still be a welcome addition to your schedule.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 140 to another student. I truly feel like I improved my Spanish skills over the course of the semester. The material was interesting, and I felt that the workload was perfect.",
    "I would recommend this course even if you have fulfilled the language requirement. It does wonders in terms of reinforcing skill and building confidence in both speaking and grammar. If possible, take it with Cividanes! She's great!",
    "Spanish 140 is a great - take it. Don't be intimidated by the fact that you have to read a novel or give a long presentation. You will be prepared to do these things. The class incorporates a wide variety of learning approaches and isn't just straight grammar review for the whole semester. We read short stories, watched films, gave presentations, etc. We had great discussions in our class as well. I would recommend you take this class with Ame Cividanes - she is wonderful. The work load isn't terrible either.",
    "Definitely take it, and if you can, take it with Ame Cividanes. Its a great way to get 1.5 credits, and although you have to wake up every day of the week, its not a painful class to go to in the least. In fact, many of the days i looked forward to going to spanish.",
    "Spanish 140 is like most spanish classes I've taken. The first half is very much like 130--slightly annoying textbook, pretty simple fill-in-the-blank type homework. The workload isn't bad even though you have homework every night. There are incremental tests and quizzes on vocab, old and new grammar and stories that you read. The second half of the semester was more interesting--we read a novela and had real discussions about it in class, you gave a substantial oral presentation (kind of daunting to think about but really not that bad to actually do). There's a lot of discussion and talking in the class, which definitely helps with fluency. Ame Cividanes is really great--professional but also very kind and understanding, really cares about your success, explains things very well and leads interesting classes that keep you involved. I would definitely try to be in her class if possible.",
    "Take it with Ame Cividanes. PROFESSOR CIVIDANES WAS AMAZING! She's understanding and really cares about her students. Moreover, she's a great teacher who really helped me learn SPanish (when I thought I already knew everything..)",
    "If you want toimprove your Spanish I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this class! It is not too much different from Span 130, except that there are formal, and pretty long, public presentations. At first these seem intimidating, but they are actually so helpful. Practice presenting publically is helpful in generally, but having to do it in Spanish pushes you to really think and make an effort to make your speaking as perfect as you can and when you can say that you've given a public presentation in a different language, that's when the language really starts coming together for you. I'd say that's the best part of the class, the mechanisms and activities are geared toward really making the language come together for you. By now you've been studying Spanish for a while, and this class makes it come together in a concrete way so you can take your language from the classroom to real life. This class facilitates that change and it's a really great feeling being on the other side of that. If you do take it, I highly recommend Prof Cividanes!!!"
