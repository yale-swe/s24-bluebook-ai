   "comments": [
    "Lots and lots of reading, but it's a great basis of theater knowledge, especially if you've taken 110.",
    "Future THT 111 students: You will learn a lot in this class and be able to speak thoughtfully about the ideas that underlie various approaches to theatre. However, if you do take this class, remember to keep it in perspective. You will think and write and talk, but you won\u0092t \u0093do\u0094 theatre and you\u0092ll watch very little of it. Theatre is an active discipline and if you\u0092re serious in getting involved in it, in whatever capacity, you\u0092ll need to find\/make other opportunities outside of this class to get active in it. Take this class if you want to enter the theatrical conversation, but don\u0092t forget to put those words into practice.",
    "I would recommend Theater Studies 111! The class provided a great foundation for theater history, and I definitely learned a lot. We read some great plays and were exposed to works of different eras and cultures. If you\u0092re not very interested in the history of theater, you may not enjoy doing the readings and discussing and writing about them, and there is a significant amount of reading, but if you\u0092re genuinely interested in learning about theater history, it\u0092s a terrific course. Professor McGinley is really engaging, and her lectures are great! Also, the other students in the class were very cool people, and it was great to get to know other students also interested in theater. (We all got to know each other well in section, in putting together our studio performance project and in study groups for the final.)",
    "THST 111 is a survey class - which means reading a lot of plays in a short amount of time. The plays are interesting, if you like plays, and they make you think about plays in a completely different way. I think one of the main goals of the class is to break down all your preconceived notions of what play-writing (and theater in general) is.If you are looking for a gut, don't take this course. It's quite a bit of work, especially at the end when you have a studio performance, a term paper and a final exam.",
    "Theater 111 is a lot of work, especially since grades are pretty condensed around the midterm, final, paper, and performance. Most people only take it to get into Acting 210, but I think that for someone really interested in theater history in general it would still be a fun class.",
    "I would recommend the class for potential Theater Studies students but not really for anyone else. While it wasn't a bad course, I just would not have taken it unless I thought I was going to major in it.",
    "Theater Studies 111 is a course with a lot of reading. That said, you're reading plays. if you already love that (I did), then you'll enjoy this course, although occasionally it'll frustrate you, because of the limited time spent on each work. Still, I found it consistently fascinating, and although it entailed a fair amount of work, it really didn't feel like work, since I was reading texts that I wanted to read anyway.",
    "It's a great class if you're looking to expand your theatre knowledge, an actual enjoyable requirement to move on.",
    "I really liked learning about the history and context of all the plays we read, and the variety of plays was great - it was broad in terms of style, but also had continuity in terms of themes and ideas. I would definitely recommend the class, especially as a continuation of THST 110 (I would recommend taking 110first since there are concepts that provide important background).",
    "This class is required for THST majors, but DON'T go into it thinking that it will be a chore. Some of my classmates complained about the overly academic treatment of theater, but go in with an open mind and you will love theater even more by the end. REALLY! This is exciting and interesting material, and it will spark your creativity if you let it. You will be able to discuss and watch theater on a whole new level by the end of the year, and the class environment is superb.Also, I can't stress this enough, DO THE READINGS!!! You may have a busy night here and there where you miss or skim one, but you will get SO much more out of this class if you do all the assigned readings. These are really excellent plays.",
    "This course requires a ton of work and, while it has a noble purpose in giving all theater students the same knowledge from which to draw in later years, is incredibly tedious. This is a lecture course in its truest form--the pace of the course is so quick that sections rarely have time to cover it all. Yes, many of the plays are fascinating and great to read, but the omission of say, Eugene O'Neill, in a canonical theater course remains ridiculous.",
    "The course is a prerequisite for the theater major, and it is a good overview of a variety of writers and theatrical forms. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not intend to pursue theater, bunt anyone who does should be familiar with the writers and plays in this course.",
    "You have to take this class if you're a major, but I ended up really enjoying it! It's not the most fascinating class at Yale, probably because it's a survey, but it's really important for aspiring actors and theater artists to read all of these plays and understand these periods of theatrical history. Professor McGinley is a great lecturer, and the TF's are, in my experience, very good (although DEFINITELY take it with Ryan if he's still doing it--he is amazing!). This class is also a great way to get to know the rest of the theater community, especially when you're a freshman. There's a lot of reading, but the midterm, final, and paper are pretty straightforward.",
    "Only take this course if you are seriously considering to major in Theater Studies.",
    "This is an interesting class which tracks Theater's history, touching on key movements and plays. It is a requirement for Theater Studies majors, so if you are thinking about becoming one, you should take this class.",
    "THST 111 is a continuation of THST 110, Survey of Theater and Drama I. The two courses are extremely similar, with two plays assigned per week, and like in 110, the workload picks up toward the end of the semester, with a performance project, a paper, and a written final test. The plays are interesting, if a bit abstract, and cover many different traditions, both Western and non-Western. The course is very focused on the historical contexts of the plays, to the point that it is more a study in theatre history than anything else. Professor McGinley is extremely knowledgeable about the time periods and a great lecturer, and she combines lecturing with bits of discussion in class. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone with a real interest in contemporary theatre history or who needs it to take higher-level Theater Studies courses.",
    "Yes, especially if you are considering a Theater Studies major.",
    "Be aware that the workload is insane. If you're taking this course for fun, you probably shouldn't. If you're doing it for the major, then good luck.You have to read two plays a week, as well as a bevy of additional theater readings. Then there's a midterm, which is hard. At the end of the semester, there's a final paper, a 30 minute studio presentation (in which each section puts on a performance of the kind of theater that they studied during the semester... about 30 minutes long, written, memorized, and rehearsed in the course of 2 weeks), and a final exam. What?! That's a ridiculous amount of work - that's 3 classes worth of work.Plus, for section, there's weekly reading responses, and each student has to give an individual presentation on a topic related to the section's focus.So, yeah, you read a lot. You come away feeling exhausted, and maybe not knowing that much more than when you started.",
    "As you probably know, this course is required to take performance classes, but that is literally the only reason to take it. Do not take this course if you don't intend to take other THST classes that require it for admission. It is not a satisfying lecture and the analysis of the material is very much lacking.",
    "A relatively good survey course, definitely better than THST 110. The thoughts\/history covered in this course are *actually* important for any aspiring theater artist, despite the many grumbles and moans from many students. You will read a lot of plays, many of them very good, but it is nonetheless a pretty demanding workload, culminating in a research paper, a studio performance project, and a fairly demanding final exam that all overlap."
