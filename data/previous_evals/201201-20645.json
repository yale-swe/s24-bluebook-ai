    "Yes, it is a key methods course in the methods sequence.",
    "It's a must for anyone wanting to write empirical papers with data. Also fun if you like math--very challenging, but satisfying once you understand it.",
    "This class is much more difficult than PLSC 500, but it is extremely useful. You will gain a much better understanding of the mechanics behind regression analysis and how to address common data problems. The problem sets also sometimes provide an opportunity to learn how to analyze data in Stata.",
    "Yes",
    "Introduction to econometric methods. Only worth taking if the student has no background on regression analysis, or if it's been a long time since the topic was studied."

    "(I'm an undergrad) But this helped me understand the techniques employed in papers I've read, and I plan to use these analytical skills in my senior essay.",
    "This class was very useful to my research because it provided me with a much better understanding of common regression techniques, along with direction on how to approach data analysis in general.",
    "Necessary foundational course",
    "It provided me methodological tools to approach my questions of interest."
