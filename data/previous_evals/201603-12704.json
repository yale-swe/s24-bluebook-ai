    "I certainly gained a new appreciation of Bosch and Bruegel through this course. I had a rather romantic perception of the two artists but this course did a good job of introducing different methods and types of scholarship that had been applied to the artists' works. I had not anticipated learning so much about artists after Bosch and Bruegel but I now realize that that is Professor Bass's specialty and she made her thesis surrounding these artists very clear.",
    "My understanding and knowledge of the artists's work, their afterlives, and scholarly issues appliled to them have improved significantly."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated that the course was structured around key arguments surrounding the output of Bosch and Bruegel, it made a fairly complex historiography clearer. I think that we made good use of our trip to New York and thought that our trips to the YUAG were productive. We had fairly fruitful conversations in front of the works and Professor Bass was good at structuring our viewing so that we were able to develop our thoughts through close looking. Because we spent a relatively large amount of time in front of the paintings, however, we really locked ourselves into a few interpretations that became fairly developed. I think that if we had spent more time going over readings we might have come to approach the works in a slightly more nuanced way. Though, I realize, again that Professor Bass had a clear thesis coming into this class.",
    "The course in its current shape has many strengths. I especially appreciated the emphasis on seeing the art in Yale's collection. The trip to the Metropolitan Museum was also very instructive and a great addition to the course. I also appreciated the high degree of structure and feedback incorporated inito the class."

    "Yes, I would.",

    "Yes, I would recommend the course to another students. The combination of classroom engagements and gallery visits facilitates learning about the topic very well."
