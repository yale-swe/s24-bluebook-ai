    "This class didn't actually exist. I went to class once, and still managed to learn a fair amount. The problem sets were pretty interesting, and you got to implement cool things. It's extraordinarily easy -- the prereqs are functionally suggestions. Take it! if you like learning thing but hate going to class, its awesome.",
    "The first class I took in the CS department, and was pretty chill. Taking 223 next semester, which I will probably get a lot more out of. If you know any C or C++, don't worry about the prereqs.",
    "Low workload. Awesome and interesting psets. Solid class for a CS elective.",
    "Rokhlin is terrible. Take it if you're a math major with a fetish for bad classes. Or more seriously stated: Lectures have no plan or organization, or whatever little plan there may be is totally disregarded in favor of monologues about the professor's fringe views on programming, his political opinions, and anecdotes about life in the Soviet Union. All this is funny until you realize that you're spending a Yale credit on this and you have no idea how to do the homework (unless you're the aforementioned math major or PhD student). There's no textbook (actually, there supposedly is one, and there's a PDF, but it isn't very relevant, and is never mentioned). I learned essentially nothing. You will rely on the TA to understand barely enough to do the homeworks (of which we had three, comprising the entirety of graded work for the class, and which are graded months late). Lecture material that does get even vaguely mentioned is frequently completely unrelated to the homework. The homework assignments are really designed for Fortran 77, so even though C is allowed, it is more difficult. The only silver lining is that for quite a few lectures near the end (though it was not announced beforehand which ones), Mark Tygert from Applied Math lectured about some statistics and probability topics. Don't count on that happening again. Bottom line, if you want a data mining class, go find the one the Statistics department offers. If you want to take this because it sounds like a gut and think you can do the homework already, I don't know why you are at Yale."
