    "Research is great! Once you've established yourself with a particular lab, it is informative and can be easy to complete a half credit, so you can still be engaged in lab discussion and keep a manageable schedule.",
    "Psyc 495 allowed me to explore different variables, subjects and how to generalize findings to a population, along with how to write IRB's for research subjects. Yes, I would recommend the course to a fellow student because it was an enjoyable way to learn more about research methods of psychology.",
    "Yes",
    "PSYC 495 is a great way to get experience in a lab without a large time commitment. Even if you're not a psyc major, it's a good way to get some exposure and see if research is the route that you want to take with your academic career."
