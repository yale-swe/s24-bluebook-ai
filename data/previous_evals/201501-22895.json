   "comments": [
    "Math 120 is a difficult class which I don't think a student would take unless they had a strong interest in math or it was required for their major, due to the amount of work involved. However, it is an enjoyable albeit challenging class.",
    "Calc 120 is a hard class but interesting if you like math.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's a prereq for many things and it's very well taught.",
    "A solid math course. Solving examples together in class was helpful, as was breaking into smaller groups. Susie was a phenomenal, caring instructor. She took every opportunity to be available and explain the material. The only thing I can think of for improving would be more physical explanations of some of the theorems we learned, and a greater focus on the intuition behind them. Overall, she was excellent. I took the class for fun-- didn't need the credit. I would probably suggest a different math class for this, though I did mostly enjoy the course, I was a bit less involved the second half.",
    "I would recommend this course if they are interested in higher level econ, physics, comp sci, or math, or something else which requires the class. I would not recommend this to someone who doesn't need the class. It is challenging, but worth it in the end to complement your other course work. And it feels great to really figure out the material.",
    "Calculus of several variables. Everything you learned in Math 115 but done in 3D and even 4D. So. Many. Integrals. I can't even keep them straight. The concepts are fascinating and the applications are many I'm sure but the course is painful.",
    "Math 120 was both an interesting and challenging course. It covers a variety of topics within multivariable calculus, anything from 3-D geometry to surface integrals. Although the course was difficult, I felt that I benefitted from it and was able to succeed with hard work. Professors were very available through office hours or individual appointments. The review sessions that the professors led before the two midterms and the final were also very helpful.",
    "Hard class, hard concepts, good knowledge I might, depends on their major and what they are looking for in the class.",
    "Hard, but worth it if you need to take it. Don't shy away from this course, but only take it if you need it. It's not easy, but if you do the PSets and work on understanding how to solve the different kinds of problems, you will be fine on the finals and you might actually learn something about vector calculus!",
    "Math 120 is a specific calculus class focusing on integrating in 3D. It has a normal workload for math and the exams are hard. It is hard to do well in this class. I would take it-- but only if you have an interest in math or need the class. Your GPA will most likely take a hit because the hard exams are not curved.",
    "TAKE ENAS 151! This class is very fast paced and is absolutely brutal if you fall behind (which happened to me unfortunately). Don't ever fall behind! Just to make things harder, they assign problem sets during exam weeks. If you want to take this class, brace yourself. Would highly recommend ENAS though. I only ever hear good things about that class whereas you get mixed responses with this one. Definitely shop both."
