    "If you want to get better at Japanese, you have to take this class.",
    "It's a class to keep your japanese level at par; no big increases in japanese skill; a must-take for students who want to not lose their japanese language skill",
    "This class is very heavy on reading and requires a lot of kanji study. You will read stories and articles in Japanese. I would recommend it to improve your reading skills especially.",
    "Of course. It's a good class. Helps you learn vocab\/grammar and improves your reading\/speaking skills.",
    "This level of Japanese will ramp up the level of reading and kanji significantly. It's tough, but here you really open up into a level where you can actually read a lot of stuff on your own, in newspapers, internet sites, even doing research in scholarly journals. It's a lot of work but worth it.",
    "4th Year Japanese is basically 3rd Year Plus. You use many of the same tools (readings, grammar picked from within the reading, kanji quizzes), but the intensiveness goes up quite a few notches. The kanji quizzes cover about three times as much material, and newspapers become your easiest readings rather than some of the harder ones. That being said, you learn a *lot*, and if you're serious about learning Japanese, I highly recommend continuing to 4th year. Just...maybe take it Credit-D.",
    "Japanese 156 02 is a moderate advanced Japanese course that covers everything from readings on the dissolution of the family to videos of Japanese anime. I would recommend Japanese 156 02 to another student because, no matter at what level one enters, the course helps one fix one's own errors, learn new grammar, and hundreds of kanji and thousands of words of vocabulary in a short time."
