   "comments": [
    "I would avoid it if your a major who can take another seminar. It was hard to pay attention in class. It wasn't that much work though.",
    "Definintly take it especially if you are thinking of writing your senior essay out of it - Krasno is an incredible advisor. There is not a lot of discussion though, if thats something you are looking for.",
    "Yes, it is a great seminar for someone interested in learning more about the UN and international relations.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about the United Nations.",
    "This class is okay. The topic and the readings are really interesting but there is no class discussion. If you are a go-getter you can talk on your own no problem, but there isn't any facilitated discussion. If there had been meaningful discussion it would have been great.Professor Krasno is wonderful because she is very approachable, helpful, and knowledgeable. If you are looking for a senior essay seminar I recommend this one because of how helpful Professor Krasno is.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the topic; you only get what you put into this class because it's easy to skate by but you won't learn anything. More of a lecture than a seminar, which is sometimes frustrating. Must take your own initiative if you want to participate and contribute because the professor does not facilitate discussion.",
    "super class - take it. krasno is fantastic. the material is current and interesting.",
    "yes, its an interesting class without too much work",
    "A general overview of the UN, much like Krasno's UN class in the spring but not as fun."
