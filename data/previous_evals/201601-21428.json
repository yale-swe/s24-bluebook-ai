    "This class was so chill. If you are an Econ and Math Major, you have to take it. Choose Networks if you want a chill senior class",
    "Definitely, even if not an econ or econ\/math major",
    "You have to take it, so not really a choice there.",
    "Faingold's section was much more challenging than Coifman's section. Although no weekly reports were due summarizing the lecture topics like in Coifman's section, our presentations were set in much greater mathematical rigor. The imbalances between sections is really the biggest weakness of this course. Depending on what you like to do, I feel like you should be able to pick a section and end up getting the same type of grade for the same type of work. Faingold's Mechanism Design section seemed like a lot more pressure, stress, and work than the Network's section. That being said, I think we did get a lot out of it. However, even if you are not required to take this class, I would say it is a nice chill way to really get into one topic. If you take it before your senior year, it could be a good way to survey a topic you might want to study for your thesis. Furthermore, if you'd like to go to grad school and become a professor, this is a fantastic way to get a first lecture in!",
    "Easiest class I've ever taken at Yale. You do one presentation over the course of the entire semester, and then you just have to go to class and turn in your notes at the end of the day. Literally that's it.",
    "A student led seminar in which students get To understand the applications of math to the real world. Great for applying the math skills you've developed in earlier courses.",
    "A gutty senior requirement for what is otherwise a rigorous and challenging econ\/math major at Yale. The course is largely dependent on the topic covered and who teachers the class. I enjoyed learning about and presenting on complex networks, and I hope the topic gets covered in future years.",
    "Take it and take it with Coifman!",
    "Take this instead of the other one if you care about applications."
