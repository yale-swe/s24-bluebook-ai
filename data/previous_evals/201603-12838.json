    "Too many strengths to list. I have mixed feelings about the lack of any final project. On one hand, it gave me more time to finish my work in other classes, which was very welcome at the time. On the other hand, the course felt somewhat incomplete. We had learned basic Python 3.0, learned how to work with Music21, and read some background lit on statistical learning and modelling. But it felt like these projects never quite converged into anything. It would have been nice to have done even a small project with Music21, or something that would give us a clear model for continuing to do corpus research outside of the class environment."
