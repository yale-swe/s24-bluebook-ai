    "I would most definitely recommend this course - it is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It's applicable to nearly all social science and humanities majors and provides opportunities for thought-provoking and engaging discussion. The course is split into four themes which keeps it focused, but all four themes gradually connect to each other over the semester. One short paper for the midterm and a 16 page final paper. No weekly busy work, only reading. You really get out what you put in, but it's easy to really become interested and get involved in this class.",
    "If you know that you're really interested in the material. Look over the syllabus and decide if 70-80% of the readings are ones you are excited about. Professor Rogers is wonderful but this course felt a little disjointed so maybe consider taking something else with him.",
    "So much reading! It's really great if you read it all \u2014 but will you? Our class was about half grad students (some of them in anthro!) which made class conversations quite high-level. As a non-anthro major, sometimes things were over my head and the disparities in understanding were sometimes pronounced. But Prof Rogers is AWESOME, so smart, helped make the uninitiated feel comfortable rather than unintelligent, explicitly stated that the participation he valued was that which sought to understand the material rather than flaunt one's understanding, let us write final papers on pretty much anything related to production\/consumption\/culture, and was great at leading seminar and ensuring I got something out of class every time whether or not I'd totally understood what I'd read for class (he was especially conscious of helping us understand the theory we read early in the semester.) Take this class if you have the time to devote to it and want to learn about some of the many facets of culture in many geographical contexts. We only cover a few facets of \"culture,\" so check out the syllabus and see if the topics covered are of interest. (your final paper can be on something outside the scope of the class, though.)",
    "If you are interested in arts and culture, I would recommend this course to you. Be warned that as a senior anthropology seminar, it is heavy on reading and writing, especially ethnographies. The Monday 9 am class time our semester sometimes meant that discussion could lag a bit. It seemed that not everyone had managed to do all the readings rather often. But Professor Rogers is great and I would highly encourage taking a class with him."
