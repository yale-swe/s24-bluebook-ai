    "Not too many surprises. L4-level Korean language class. Grading is fair and the workload manageable. The best thing about the class is the Professor and your classmates. Depending on what class atmosphere and dynamic you get, the class can be a lot of fun. There are a lot of vocab words, so be warned (but that's with any foreign language class)",
    "Yes! Especially if you want to improve your reading, writing, and speaking skills drastically.",
    "Wholeheartedly recommend KREN142 with Prof. Lee to heritage speakers!! It's a great experience and you will grow pretty close with your class.",
    "Kren 142 is a class where you'll grow your fluency, experience the teaching of one of the best professors at Yale, and grow closer with fellow students who are equally as interested in Korean culture.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend it for heritage speakers who speak Korean at home but haven't had formal exposure to grammar rules and reading comprehension. I feel like I was able to substantially improve in Korean, but also able to forge relationships with the professor and my fellow peers."
