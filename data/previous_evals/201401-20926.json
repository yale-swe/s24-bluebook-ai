   "comments": [
    "If you want a science credit in which you will learn some stuff about science that shows up in the newspapers, this is the right class.",
    "Nice science credit that's actually interesting and very manageable course work. I would recommend.",
    "Eh, it's a science credit, but wasn't great.",
    "If you're looking for a relatively easy science credit, go ahead and take it. If you actually care about science (without wanting to major in it) and get infuriated with poor topic explanations, then don't bother. This course is an attempt to give students a survey of current controversial science topics and they are way too complex to be covered by two 90 minute lectures a week. Professors do their best to make the material accessible to people without a strong science background, but instead can't help but delve into more and more details, making the material only more confusing. Exams in the class are all free response and it's never clear how much detail the professors and TAs expect.",
    "If you are already good at biology its simple, if you arent - it isnt a complete gut, but you ca get a B with minimal effort if you study for the tests well",
    "Great SC credit - not an easy A, but interesting, especially if you don't know that much about the basic topics in Biology such as Cancer, AIDS, etc. You don't have any homework (other than readings), and you do the weekly responses in section with the help of your TA.",
    "If science is not your thing and you need a science credit, this is probably the class for you. Not super exciting or engaging, but there's really very little work and it gets the job done. The final paper was actually semi enjoyable to write, too - you have so much freedom in the topic you pick so I was able to write about something I'm genuinely interested in.",
    "A good class for a non-science major, 3 tests and a final paper. A little hard to follow at times but I'd take it again.",
    "Yes!",
    "Good way to get a science credit if you take it with friends.",
    "GUTTT.. TAKEEEEE.",
    "If you need a science credit, this isn't a bad option. Do know that, yes, this class involves learning\/knowing actual scientific material. The lectures are range from meh to really good. (Sung's section of the course is on the good end). You'll learn about a wide range of topics, from genetically modified organisms to cloning to global warming to the process of creating new pharmaceuticals. The reading is VERY light - maybe 10 pages worth of articles from the New York Times, CNN, etc. Goes by fast. Section is not bad. You have to work in groups to answer discussion questions that are pretty open ended. So, not my favorite class, but there are worse options out there. Also: no required textbook. Great.",
    "This was a relatively painless and straightforward science credit until the paper at the end. With papers to write for other classes, the last thing I wanted to do was write a research paper for this. Some of the professors were also very difficult to understand, making lecture feel pointless, especially because the powerpoints were posted online.",
    "This is debated but I would say it is in fact the best way to get a science credit. It's a little bit of work but no final and nothing is cumulative and you have a lot of freedom with paper topics so you can write about something that doesn't make you want to jump out the window. Overall I'd say it was a good class, a manageable workload. Not too hard.",
    "Easy, straightforward tests. Short final paper. Definitely take it for science credit.",
    "definitely recommend! 3 exams and a paper, not much reading",
    "Yes, if you had a decent background (high school bio really helped).",
    "MB&B 105 is a great course if you have very little experience with biology. The exams are very doable with a good amount of studying and the essay at the end of the course is not too intensive. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a low-stress science credit.",
    "I think it was a good and easy science credit for non-science major. The fact that the class is taught by three\/four different professors gives you a broad perspective on the topics, but can also be distracting. They have different teaching stiles and some focus more than others on specific details and terminology, so you just have to make sure you adjust to it. The exams were not bad, as long as you prepared for them. Overall, it was a good experience.",
    "Terrible terrible terrible. Surprisingly difficult, boring and hard to follow instructors",
    "It's a decent class if you need a science credit. You don't necessarily need to go to lecture, and section is actually pretty fun and interesting. Sometimes it is unclear what the expectations are for exam answers, which can be frustrating.",
    "Solid course. Not overly easy but if you the work you will do well.",
    "Biology for non-science majors with a focus on the ethical issues that arise from advancements in biological\/bio-technical processes. Not a gut - you have to study a lot and learn concepts at both a scientific as well as conceptual level. But not particularly difficult either.",
    "Issues Bio is a great way to get your science credit out of the way, if you are a non-science major (if you are a science major, there is no reason for you to take this course). Topics are pretty basic, and if you ever took AP bio in high school, the tests will be extremely easy for you. The lectures are pretty boring, the readings you can skip, and section is actually interesting and fun. There are definitely better ways to fulfill the science credit, but this is a solid option.",
    "yes, but know that the material is extensive and you don't need to do hyper memorization for the exams, only some aspects matter",
    "Be careful with taking this class. There's almost no work associated with taking this class but when it comes time to taking the tests be sure to study diligently for 2-3 days leading up to the test. The tests can also be relatively tricky as its difficult to identify the degree of detail needed to do well.",
    "\"Issues\" approach to biology turns out to not base itself on \"issues\" but rather asks that you regurgitate miniscule factoids and make in depth scientific inferences without any prior knowledge of the subject material. The professors throw endless slides of scientific jargon without telling you WHY it is relevant to the average Joe. For example, I now know what the RNA theory is, but it most certainly does not make me a better person for it, nor do I feel like a well-informed member of society. The only professor who was even mildly entertaining or enthusiastic for students to understand the material was Prof. Sung. The class is deceiving in that absolutely no \"issues\" were addressed and no real \"debate\" took place. If anything, the professors were attempting to pound their own political and scientific beliefs into the malleable minds of unknowing History and Political Science majors. This class is NOT easy, nor is it interesting.",
    "Would recommend. Not a lot of work, good science credit for people like me who suck at anything science or math related.",
    "Good science class for non-science majors, but don't expect a life-changing course.",
    "Great science for non-science majors! Go to lecture and section and you'll be totally set for the exams. As a social science major, I really appreciated the \"issues approach.\"",
    "If you're looking for your basic not too hard science credit while getting some basics, this isn't bad.",
    "Take it.",
    "Interesting science credit. Not a complete gut, but not too intensive.",
    "If you already know quite a lot of Bio, this class won't be very difficult for you. If you know nothing like me, then this class takes effort, and is not as gutty as it seems. That being said, I think it's a great deal for a science credit. Hopefully you have a TA that is as good as the one I had (Nick Vincent) because he saved everyone in our section.",
    "Take it if you would like to finish up your distributional requirements without killing yourself in some science class. You learn stuff and it isn't too difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class for non-science majors who want to gain an understanding of the main questions in science today.",
    "will introduce you to or refresh your knowledge of biological concepts. Bacteria\/evolution, environment, neurology. There are theee modules and each has a different prof, so it's easy to stay engaged if you try. It's also really tempting to skip lecture, but you'll do much better and actually learn if you go. Only 150 min per week including section. Tests weren't hard, just start studying a few days in advance, not the night before. I also really enjoyed the final paper. Keep a running tally of topics that pique your interest over the semester, and write about something you think is cool. I wrote about distributing bioengineered rice in developing countries. Now that the class is over, I feel more responsibility to eat properly and also am more curious about the medicines\/drugs I take and how they interact with my body.",
    "I would recommend MB&B 105 as a good science credit where you'll learn about relevant topics.",
    "Decent class for an SC credit. Not that interesting unless you are into bio.",
    "I would not, I would have far preferred a more concentrated science course in which I attained actually knowledge in one thing. The level of memorization required for this course meant that it was not really a gut by any means, and in taking a \"real science\" course, I would have far preferred something else.",
    "It's a science credit that's not too hard if you actually study. You learn interesting things. I did enjoy learning about bioethical issues and biotechnology.",
    "Solid.",
    "Three short finals, and one 6-8 page essay--all in all, a pretty interesting class and a very manageable science credit.",
    "-great survey of issues related to science -minimal reading outside of class -non-science major course but NOT a gut -there is no need for section to meet physically if it is a matter of answering questions--i.e. could google doc, but 20% is attendance and submitting answers so have to go",
    "good gut science just study for midterms",
    "Explore biological processes through the lens of political issues",
    "I would say that it is not a gut and you should not take it.",
    "Yes. It was pretty easy and the information was all relevant. Some parts are hard to follow because of bad lectures and interruptions in the schedule, but overall not too bad. Definitely an easy class if you've had AP bio! The last time I took bio was a regular class freshman year in high school but I still found it manageable.",
    "Science credit. Easy enough.",
    "Yes. It is a good science credit. Take it with a friend!"
