    "Q1-2) The lectures and readings were not applicable to the projects we had to work on. The instructor didn't appropriately tie the concepts of urban ecology to how they apply to the grant he wanted us to work on. I feel like he never addressed the issue that the projects were more about emergency planning rather than urban planning. The projects and grants he has us work on WERE ABSOLUTELY NOT APPLICABLE to the course material. Q8) The instructor never connected the broad teachings of urban ecology to the work he wanted us to do. The roles of stakeholders and projects was never covered. After taking the class, I would not be comfortable saying that I understood the material covered. Q9) The instructor was not at all responsive or understanding of the students' needs. Feedback was often based on his own needs. Way too much was asked of us without providing appropriate support or time. The final semester long projects were assigned weeks before they were due, and critical information wasn't provided until days before projects were due. The TA was rarely present and provided zero support to students. She promised to act as a liaison between us and the instructor, but provided no such service. Q10) I will never work with Alex Feslon again. His manner of running this course and lack of support is the only reason this course was unacceptable. He shows very little respect for students. Lecture often ran WAY over time, he didn't care about our understanding of the work or our research interests, and assumed we were there to support his grant application. Q11-12) I would never recommend this course to anyone. A month into the course it became apparent that this was a waste of my credits. I pretty much had to suck it up and get through it. There wasn't an option to make the best of the situation. See final comment.",

    "The speakers who came in were really knowledgable and I learned a lot from them - especially folks from the Long Island Sound Study. I was disappointed when we did not have speakers in the second half of the course. I also liked the visits from CIRCA folks to see real world applications of this work. They gave us a lot of helpful feedback on our final project.",
    "It's not a difficult course. The workload isn't unreasonable. The concepts covered at a VERY broad level are somewhat applicable to my own interests. There were 4-5 lectures of solid information that I would consider informative.",
    "The applied aspect of this course- Alex was working through many of the issues with real life clients and sharing the challenges that presented with the class.",
    "This class was an excellent example of the real-life, real-time process of urban ecology. Not every aspect is established, or clear-cut, and Alex did an excellent job of walking us through the process of making urban ecology happen in the current environment.",

   "comments": [
    "The way in which the content was delivered was disjointed and unorganized. The entire course was based around the instructor's ongoing grant work. As a result, course content was not designed and delivered in a manner that was structured around the most useful or interesting subject matter. Rather, it was delivered so that student work would be relevant and practical in the context of his grant - an unacceptable strategy for teaching a course. Furthermore, the specifics of the grant itself were still very much up in the air as the semester progressed. As a result, the class did not follow a logical progression and assignments and readings were not given with any sort of reasonable notice. Rather, they reflected new (and often times last minute) developments in the grant process. In short, the entire class - including the lecture-to-lecture progression of material, and the nature and delivery of assignments and readings - needs to be restructured.",
    "This course needs to be a lot more structured. I believe it had so much potential as the only applied urban ecology course, especially under the direction of Alex, who has so much to teach us! I was initially really excited at the prospect of learning new skills about urban ecology and applying them to my work at FES. But when expectations are not set, and the instructor and TA do not know what they want, it becomes hard to take the time to work through the coursework and feel empowered to learn new things. Our final assignment was a 15 page research paper and presentation which we were assigned 3 weeks beforehand. We received our city around that time. This should have been a project assigned at the very beginning of the course so that we could apply what we learned and carry through those themes into our final proposal. Once we received the assignment, there was so much to take on that our group felt disheartened and unsure of where to start. We enjoyed evaluating our city and zone, and I think I learned the most from the final assignment... but i don't think we were able to give it the full 100% because we were assigned this project at the very end of the semester when all other classes have big projects due. We no longer have the bandwidth or brain space to take on something we didn't realize we had to. Had the expectation been set at the beginning of the semester, and a city\/zone decided earlier, it would have been a lot easier to handle and we would have created a better final deliverable. I honestly felt like Alex and Nikki had a lot on their plates and weren't able to give this course the time it needed.",
    "1) The instructor needs to provide a clear agenda and syllabus. Due dates and assignments frequently changed. We were informed about finals weeks before they occurred. I never knew what to expect. 2) Expectations and deliverables were never defined. I would work on a project, only to have the instructor change his mind and force me inn another direction to redo all my work. The TA was never present and provided no help reigning in the instructor's expectations to reasonable deliverables. Feedback and assessment of projects turned in was never provided. 3) The course was way too focused on the instructor's grant application. I was never able to pursue my own interests. The class should have been called \"Applied Coastal Resilience.\" The concepts were not adequately tied to the general theory of urban ecology.",
    "I think it moved too slowly and in not the most logical way. We covered some of the same ground multiple times, as opposed to building a foundation in urban ecology principles and working up to more specific aspects.",
    "The class needs a good dose of organization, although I think the flexibility in schedule reflected the happenings of grants, community meetings, and other emerging plays making ecology along the CT coastline happen. A stricter adherence to assignments would help mediate the the inherent flexibility.",
    "The assignments, syllabus should be more organized. Students didn't know what was expected of them until really late in the game.",
    "The format of the course seemed to be review of the specific context of the Connecticut coast and a rapid review of urban ecology topics in the last few weeks of the course along with a final assignment. The class would have been stronger if the schedule was reversed with the more general review of urban ecology topics at the beginning of the semester. More time to review and discuss those topics would also have been helpful. Students would then be better prepared to apply those topics to the project specific context."

    "In relation to the course projects: At no point was I ever certain what was expected of me in this course. There was never any feedback or evaluation of my work provided. The TA was rarely present and never added to the discussion. I felt like I HAD to provide something (literally anything) for my projects rather than actually put something together that I was confident in or proud of. Project deliverables were always really vague, and information was provided way too late. We had 2 weeks to put together a final semester long project. Then we weren't properly informed that we would be presenting in front of outside stakeholders, who tore our project apart in front of the class and the instructor when it very obviously didn't meet their expectations. I was so embarrassed. In no way was I properly informed or prepared for that work. It very seriously felt like we were used by the instructor to help him network with state agency stakeholders and help him in his efforts to develop grants. We were never given a chance to pursue our own interests, and frequently he would parade us in front of outside stakeholders so that he could invite people to come to Yale. It feels really shitty to have put that much time and effort into work only to realize what a complete waste it was. I felt used."

    "I wanted to apply my background in water management to urban settings. Urban waterways are a really diverse but incredibly important component to teach at FES, and I do not feel like this course met that need. Even for students who were more interested in urban settings than I was, I didn't feel like this course met their needs either. Everyone was confused and frustrated the entire time. This course DEFINITELY did not meet that. The course material was way too singularly focused on the instructor's interests and upcoming grant proposals.",
    "This is one of the first courses at Yale that I've actually gotten excited about. I have an architectural background, which has little sympathy for the ecological happenings. But the built environment and existing ecologies are obviously deeply intertwined and recent disasters have finally made it a contemporary issue. People and buildings are going to continue to exist in natural pathways, and we need more people figuring out exactly how to manage that. I wish there were more courses like this to help train the graduates who will be working on these problems."

Water is becoming a fundamental but scare resource in urban settings. I wanted to grasp how urban planning and use played into ways that we can manage water.

    "Absolutely not. It became apparent about a month in that this course was not going to improve and that I would not leave with an understanding of the material. The instructor was too focused on his own research to provide any meaningful connection between the projects and the course material to be helpful, despite my pursuing these discussions in class.",

    "The experience of working with a group was fine, but the assignments we were given to work on in groups were not well formulated and were given last minute. The advantage was that working in groups afforded the opportunity to divide responsibilities and deliverables, a necessity with the generally very short turn around times for assignments. The disadvantage was the general lack of thought given to the actual design of group-based assignments by the instructor.",
    "Group work was good overall. We just weren't sure of the expectations and that was evident when we discussed the final project.",
    "Advantages: The instructor isn't focused or decisive enough to appropriately answer questions or provide instructions on his expectations of deliverables and objectives. Working in a group helped brainstorm around this impediment and spread the work around. Disadvantages: Because the instructor is so vague in providing instruction, it's difficult to get the whole work group on the same page as to what the final product should include. We spent most of our time trying to figure out WHAT to do that we didn't have enough time to actually dig into the material.",
    "I had an awesome group. We worked well together.",
    "Group work gave a great venue to brainstorm, share information and build on each other's ideas. It allows a lot more ground to be covered. A disadvantage is that it takes more time to organize and move things forward. The time frame for the final assignment was a little constrained to support that process."

It has a lot of potential and Alex has a lot to teach us based on his breadth of knowledge and experience, but this class is not the forum for that.",
    "Don't. I have no hesitation, and would defend my statement, that as it is, this class should not be offered at FES. It is too unorganized and narrowly focused to help anyone at FES that is looking to apply their interest to urban systems. There is no formal instruction, feedback, or support provided to the students. The expectations are unreasonable and change too frequently. Half way through the semester I regretted wasting my credits on this course. Students should never be put in that situation. Any student that is considering this course should look for other courses, independent studies, or work opportunities where they can work in their interests to urban systems. Urban ecology is so necessary to teach at FES and has so much potential. But this course is too poorly run and taught to be considered sufficient.",
    "Be open. This class isn't perfectly conventional because it is happening in real-time, concurrent with Connecticut trying to manage the risk of its costal cities. Like anyone working with diverse parties and interests, you need to be highly flexible.",
    "You have to tolerate a level of disorganization.",
    "The class material and assignments may evolve throughout the semester. That might be a contrast to some other classes which are very similar from year to year with a schedule of lecture topics set in stone for the whole semester from day 1. If you remain flexible and ask questions, you can learn a lot from this class."
