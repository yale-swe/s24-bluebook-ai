   "comments": [
    "You learn about Malaria, Lyme, and vector-borne diseases. Exactly what it sounds like. great if you want an overview of these and to learn about them but not if you're looking for an exciting class.",
    "My feelings really fluctuated over the course of the semester. It's not super amazing, but Professor Belperron is really nice. I don't know how applicable the knowledge is to my everyday life, but if you were good at biology in high school and don't want to take intro bio, but need a science credit, this might be a good fit. You might want to take it as a fifth class so you don't feel like you're missing out on other Yale experiences.",
    "I would recommend it if you need to get a science credit. Not a gut but not a lot of work at all",
    "It does require regular attendance and effort with the readings, but is very do able",
    "Take it! you learn so much about the diseases as well as more general biological information about our bodies and the various other factors that influence and contribute to the diseases.",
    "If you are looking for an \u00e2\u0080\u009ceasy\u00e2\u0080\u009d (but not too easy, at all!) science credit, and would definitely prefer a seminar format \u00e2\u0080\u0093 go for it! If you want the freedom to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrop in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a lecture, or skip classes (which is valid!) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 then do not take \u00e2\u0080\u009cMalaria.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You cannot plan on taking this class casually; if you miss a lecture, you absolutely CANNOT rely on the posted power point to teach you the material by yourself. Nor can you fully rely on classmates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 notes. If you want to learn about a real world problem, guided by a host of biological concepts (human biology, vaccines, transmission mechanisms) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 do it. ALSO: you basically never have to do the reading. I did most of the readings, and they helped me out, but in no way is \u00e2\u0080\u009chomework\u00e2\u0080\u009d (absent big projects, studying and the final paper) requisite to success in or enjoyment of this course)."
