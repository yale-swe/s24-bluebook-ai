   "comments": [
    "You read 6 Chinese news articles reflecting modern Chinese issues such as democracy, birth control, censorship, and marriage. If you have been keeping up with China, you will probably already be somewhat familiar with the topics, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still interesting to see them from the perspective of Chinese reporters. This course will prepare you pretty well for reading Chinese blogs and newspapers. The instructor is fairly lenient, which makes for a more pleasant experience overall but may also keep you from making big improvements if you are not sufficiently self-motivated. Direct feedback on assignments and presentations is somewhat sparse, so sign up for tutorial and visit the professor during office hours if you want more guidance. Overall, a pretty good upper level Chinese course to take after completing 155 or 163.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class, not only will you learn a lot about China, your Chinese will improve greatly, no matter what level you're at when you start. I personally will hopefully take this class again!",
    "Chinese 166 is called \"Chinese Media and Society.\" I'd say every 2 weeks we receive a new text, taken probably from a blog or Chinese newspaper, that relates somehow to Chinese society. Topics have been the necessary one-child policy, the bachelor phenomenon, etc. Some of the topics discussed were inherently interesting but the class dynamic was very slow. I don't think I gained much from this class in terms of knowledge of the language. There was just so little opportunity to speak, and I felt that the texts we read in class were all on the easy side. I suppose for practical and everyday purposes, Chinese 166 is the best option around (compared to, say, the literary Chinese classes)and it's very low-maintenance. Just don't expect to improve much, especially if you went to a language program over the summer.",
    "Chinese Media and Society is a very good high level Chinese course, continuing with grammar and vocab but in a less formal, more topic-centered way than lower levels. There's a mix of reading articles, homeworks, dictations, writing essays (6 or 7 I think over the course of the semester), and presentations....it's definitely a consistent amount of work, there was something due pretty much every class. Not as much speaking as I would have liked, but the conversations and Zhang Laoshi's lectures were actually substantively interesting, which was great. I feel like I learned about China, while also improving my reading and writing.",
    "A not-negligible amount of work, but grading is pretty laidback. As one would expect with high-level language classes, what you get is as much as anything a function of how much you put into it.",
    "Absolutely. If you're in advanced Chinese and looking for an interesting course that won't take absurd amounts of time (though hard work is certainly required), this one's great.",
    "If the subject interests you and you're looking for an easy Chinese class with difficult material, do it! Most people had done study abroad\/were heritage speakers, so the course is not particularly intense. But I learned *tons* from both my classmates and Zhang laoshi.",
    "If you're interested in increasing your Chinese speaking, reading, and writing ability AND interested in augmenting your knowledge of current societal issues AND undaunted by thinking and arguing about political philosophy in a different language--this is the class for you.",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this course and the topics that we covered. I liked that we were called on a lot in class and encouraged to participate. I think Zhang Laoshi was a great teacher, especially in the way he pushed us to participate. I really enjoyed the style of the class, and the readings that were chosen. I would definitely take his class again and recommend him to a classmate."
