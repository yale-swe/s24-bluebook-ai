   "comments": [
    "This class is incredibly amazing. But what I think also contributed to this was the kind of instructor(s) we've been fortunate to have. The course also exposes the student to a wide cadre of material so one always leaves with a sense of wonder and accomplishment. I would recommend this class to another student because this is one class where the emphasis is not about getting the grammar or syntax perfect at once but rather it's about learning the natural way - having fun while engaging with the texts.",
    "I would happily welcome this class to another student. Coptic is fun and easy to learn. It will give one the opportunity to engage all possible learning styles and will be a good measure of growth in demonstrating how much one can learn in 4 months. It will expose a student to manuscripts and documents that provide context to Jesus and his disciples that are not obvious from biblical material.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot.",
    "For anyone interested in pursuing further graduate work in NT or Early Christian studies, I would recommend Coptic for the opportunity to explore texts that are often on the periphery of such studies.",
    "An introduction to Coptic grammar, literature, and scholarly resources. Highly recommended."

   "comments": [
    "The course allowed for a better appreciation of the Greek language and was a good bolster for my language profile.",
    "This course has helped prepare me for future PhD coursework and potentially research topics in future programs. Coptic has also helped me narrow and refine my conception of an academic subfield that I would enjoy working within as a future career.",
    "The course expanded my knowledge of Coptic studies and gave me ideas into how to incorporate this area of the field into my own scholarship."
