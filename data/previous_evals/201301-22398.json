    "I would recommend it for the Humanities credit. I took the class because I have always wanted to learn more about film, and it was great that it also took care of one of my HU credits. It is not too time-demanding. It worked out perfectly for my schedule. The class is graded on 3 papers and participation.",
    "333 01 is a class for anyone interested in film, the film major, or history of the 20th century. Everyone should try and take a class from professor Casetti at Yale.",
    "This is not a film-watching class. I expected the films to be a huge part of the class, but unfortunately there was barely any emphasis placed on them. I also felt like the lectures were entertaining (Casetti is interesting and fun!), but they didn't necessarily help me with the assignments, which were all based on the readings. There are only three assignments for the class, so if you're looking for a class with basically 0 work this is the class for you.",
    "Take the class. You won't regret it.",
    "See question 1",
    "you got it",
    "Easy class. The two essays are pretty easy to write and you can get away with doing VERY little reading in theclass as a result. The downside is Casetti seems disinclined to give you more than a week to write it, so it might cause problems if lots of things land on one particular week.Unless they've done some major restructuring done (which I hope they do), DON'T sign up if you're hoping to discuss the films as texts much (close analysis and all that jazz). The films seemed tacked on and were not really ever referenced in lecture or the readings much and thus it seemed most people had little incentive to actually come to them.As far as lecture, Casetti is very engaging and nice. Coming from a science major with little background in the subject, his lectures are quirky and interesting and he generally tries his best to keep the class involved. There are times when I didn't know what he was talking about, but it's all in good fun. Your mileage will vary in your section depending on your TA."
