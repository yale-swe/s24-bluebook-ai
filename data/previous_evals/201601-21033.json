    "I wouldn't take this class unless I had too.",
    "One of the more difficult classes at Yale. Much of the material is an extension of differential equations. I'm sure experience in this class is very dependent on the professor. Loewenberg is excellent.",
    "This class is tough at first, but rewarding. This is the first real application of differential equations you will have in an engineering course, and it's really gratifying when everything works out in the end and you realize that you have a totally new skillset. Professor Loewenberg is amazing at tailoring the class to fit individual students; consequently, be sure to talk with him often and meet with him after class if you have questions on the material (and even if you don't! He's great to talk to). Many times during the semester Professor Loewenberg met with us for long hours late into the night when any other professors would have gone home. In short, take this course for the ChemE major, and know that your professor is both extremely intelligent and cares about you doing well.",
    "Ceng 315 is a calculus based, math heavy, transport analysis course. I would highly recommend it to a fellow student, but only if Dr. Loewenberg were teaching it again. I would recommend it because the material is interesting and understandable. It's organization is very good and there is a very nice continuity between class, the psets, and the tests.",
    "CENG 315 is a really challenging and math-heavy course about representing physical systems using differential equations and parameters. If its taught by Professor Loewenberg again you are in good hands and will learn a lot throughout the semester. Just be prepared to study a lot and spend a decent amount of time on the psets.",
    "Transport Phenomena is one of the hardest classes for chemical engineering. If pchem lab isnt the one to deter you away from the ABET degree, this class might be a close second. The material is very difficult, and there are no good textbooks to teach you how to solve these problems. That being said, if you get the opportunity to take this class with Prof. Loewenberg, immediately snatch that up and take the class. Prof. Loewenberg is certainly the best professor I have had at Yale, not necessarily because of his lectures, but because of his perspective and attitude towards teaching. Unlike most professors, Prof. Loewenberg treats the class as a true learning environment, not a testing environment. To that end, he will help you through the tests so that you actually learn what was tested, and he will go to the end of the world to make sure you finish your homework even if that means staying up with you til midnight working one on one. I have never seen a professor at Yale so engaged with his\/her students as well as so willing to put in the effort to ensure students learn, and this is what made transport bearable, even enjoyable, this semester."
