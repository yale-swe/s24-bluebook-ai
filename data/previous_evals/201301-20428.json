   "comments": [
    "The course coheres around central themes and debates engaged and shaped by contemporary Black Atlantic Visual Artists since 1980, including Bodies, Travel, Archives, and Portraits. It is structured in such a way as to build vocabulary for engaging these and other themes as the course progresses.YES. I would recommend this course for all of the reasons I have already outlined.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing. Professor Mercer's selection of readings were well curated and flowed seamlessly into your class discussion. I learned so much in this class! I highly recommend it!",
    "If you're interested in exhibitions\/surveys, definitely take the course. If you want to learn more about Black Atlantic visual arts, take it as well, but know that the final assignment might be a little rough if you're not an art historian.",
    "History of Art 786 is a course looking and discussing black atlantic art since 1980. I have been frequently recommending this class, especially to other African American artists.",
    "I would highly recommend the course because you learn a lot about different artist and also begin to understand the structure of a survey and the insight of others thought processes."

   "comments": [
    "This course contributed extensively to the work within my discipline.",
    "This was the first time that I created a survey, so this process what very helpful in seeing the ways in which both chronology and thematic organization could construct a productive art historical analysis in a survey of works. This class also helped me deepen my understanding of the way in which theory interacts with art production. Furthermore, I appreciated the contested terrain through which we analyzed \"black\" artistic practice and positionality.",
    "It introduced me to new artists and theoretical frameworks for thinking the Black Atlantic as well as race\/\"identity\" in general.",
    "As an African American artist this class intensely deepened my knowledge on how i would like to continue my profession.There is no dissertation or research for my department."
