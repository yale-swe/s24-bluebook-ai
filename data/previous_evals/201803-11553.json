    "I reviewed different research directions at Yale.",
    "I learned about possible research directions in physics at Yale.",
    "This course exposed me to a lot of the research going in the Physics, Applied Physics, and Astronomy departments at Yale. It was a useful resource as I have yet to find an advisor."

   "comments": [
    "Could be improved by having more professors from physics come to speak (I feel like it was mostly applied physics professors or professors in other departments). Also invite the applied physics 1st years to join this seminar. It would be useful for them as well.",
    "Not more than 2 speakers per seminar, otherwise the presentations are more likely to be too broad and not specific",
    "It would be better to space out some of the talks towards the start of the year.",
    "The course is a wonderful idea, but it would be great to have a better selection over topics in physics. For example, there were very few theorists and I would have loved to see the quantum information group (Michel Devoret\/ Robert Schoelkopf) or Dave DeMille's group also represented, as they are on the frontiers of their research.",
    "The course serves its purpose quite well.",
    "The course provides a good introduction to the possible research directions at Yale. It is a very important course for those who didn't chose a research advisor yet."

    "Yeah! Helpful to get acquainted with the research going on at Yale!",
    "Definitely yes, to first year PhD students, but it's already a requirement",
    "Sure, you get pizza and get to hear about research across the department.",
    "Absolutely, for a first year graduate student I think having such a view of all the research going on at Yale is very necessary, even if he\/she has already decided on an advisor.",
    "Yes, especially if that student is still unsure of which lab to join.",
    "Yes, it is an important course for anyone who plans to do research in physics at Yale.",
    "Yes. This course is particularly useful for first year graduate students at Yale, even if they are fairly confident about their plans in graduate school."
