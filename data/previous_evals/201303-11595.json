    "Given that they were interested in the subject matter, I would. Its an incredibly broad class, but one that definitely examines narrative in an interesting way.",
    "The only reason I am giving this class the highest rating is Hagglund's section. The lectures were really really hit and (severe) miss, of course, because it depended on the professor, and also because, being a team-taught course, the professors weren't always super-dedicated to preparing their lectures (it seemed)... which can have fine results but can... not. BUT if you're a lit major you have to take this so cross your fingers and close your eyes and whisper words and hope you get into Hagglund's section! (though of course maybe the other sections salvaged this course like Hagglund's did, who am I to say)",
    "Great course! Take only if interested in the readings.",
    "You read some great things (notably: V. Woolf, Proust) in Lit 120. Unfortunately, the class is so disorganized and the quality of each lecture so unpredictable that it's hard to give it an especially positive review. Some of the professors are fantastic lecturers (Ayesha), most are good, and some are very, very bad. You really never know what you're going to get out of lecture; when the professor seemed unprepared or disorganized, it felt like a waste of time. Section was fine, and the discussions were often interesting, mostly because the books we read were just so good. If you have to take this as a prereq, then you have to take it! I thought I was going to be a lit major but changed my mind mid-semester (partly because of this class and partly for totally unrelated reasons), and I think the main reason I don't totally regret taking this class is because I had the opportunity to read and think about some good books. I definitely don't recommend it to someone just looking to try a lit\/humanities course, as you won't get nearly as much out of it as you would many other intro literature courses (maybe one in the English major?). I guess I should add, though, that from what I've heard most of the profs are good section leaders, and obviously you get out of section what you put into it. So it's not a waste!! Just don't expect it to be incredible.",
    "The lecture\/seminar setup is quite interesting--you get a little bit of both worlds, which I did think was pretty cool. The books we read were, in my opinion, (mostly) fantastic! They only taught us how to write a lit paper after we turned in the first one, which was frustrating to me. However, as a potential science major with a taste for literature, I really enjoyed the class overall. Recommend for all those who like to read!"
