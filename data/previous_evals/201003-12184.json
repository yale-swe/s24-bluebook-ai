    "Nobody really knows what digital literature is. The best way I can describe it is to say that it's avant-garde word art online. It doesn't really matter. What you need to know is that it's by far the weirdest thing you'll study in the English department, and it's also really rewarding. The workload is manageable: weekly blog posts, a short paper, and a final project, and Professor Pressman does a good job of setting benchmarks for the final project so you don't feel overwhelmed at the end. Take it, but only if you can open up your mind!",
    "I highly recommend this course - it's a fun and engaging introduction to digital literature - an area of study just really coming into recognition as a synthesis of literary tradition and new technology. The course is structured around a few digital literature readings each week relating to a particular theme\/technology - not a lot of technical or theoretical material; mostly discussion as per a regular lit seminar, but with technology well integrated into the course - weekly blog posts and final projects involving integrated tech (in concert with the very helpful ITG) as well as a midterm essay. A moderate workload but nothing unmanageable (and speaking personally - a perfect class to take credit\/D!)",
    "Definitely worthwhile; the subject matter may be pretty buzz-worthy, but the discussion and work is as rigorous and challenging as in any upper level English seminar. Professor Pressman is great--tough, but always helpful and attentive--and the syllabus contains some of the most relevant and important works (for anyone who actually cares about the currentstate and future of literature and not just its past) being taught in the English Department.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "Digital Literature is not about google books, kindles or blogs. It's about a whole world of literature you might not have even known existed. It's about recognizing what we take for granted in print literature, and both turning it on its head and recognizing the ways in which digital systems are inherently similar to analog ones. We read text video games, augmented reality poems, flash-based works, web pages and more. It's more difficult to describe than it is to experience, so get in the classroom and try it out!",
    "This is an excellent, excellent course. Prof. Pressman is one of the best teachers you will find at Yale. She is kind, encouraging, and definitely difficult. She leads excellent seminar discussions and keeps energy strong throughout the whole semester.The material for Digital Literature is fascinating and very different from anything else you will read at Yale. It is very modern (nothing from before about 2001) and strange at times, tackling issues of reader embodiment, medium-specificity, and image as\/and text. The course requires consistent energy and involvement (weekly readings, blog posts, and responses to peers' blog posts, and midterm paper essay, and a final electronic project), but it's worth it. The final project is challenging, but so much fun. You become really invested in your final product.I definitely recommend this course; it was one of my favorites at Yale so far. It's not just for English, Literature, and American Studies majors. Take a risk and take this course, since it's relevant for anyone interested in books, literature, digital media, visual or performing arts, philosophy, or computer science."
