    "Absolutely! Prof. Harrison provides an excellent approach to Schenkerian Analysis.",
    "It is a very progressive introductory course on Schenkerian analysis. It starts from reviewing strict counterpoint and ends with the application of Schenker's approach on untraditional analysis. I would absolutely recommend the course.",
    "It is very technical and advanced, certainly not for a faint of heart individual. Nevertheless, I highly recommend the experience",
    "A nice introduction to Schenkerian analysis. Won't give you mastery of the subject, but will point out good ways to get it."

    "It offers new perspectives on performance decisions. Very helpful and humbling."
