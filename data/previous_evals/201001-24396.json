   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course. It's interesting and not a lot of work.",
    "As far as the amount of work goes, there's not a lot. The material has a lot of potential to be really interesting, but for some reason it's not.",
    "Yes. Interesting, relevant and covers a lot on behavioral economics (and nudging), which I find fascinating.",
    "It doesn't seem like there are really any good econ seminars. This one is decent - very little workload, a nice professor, class participation not as relevant.",
    "Easy seminar but not the most engaging one in the world.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it",
    "I would. Its an econ seminar that not too \"econ\" heavy but incorporates the policy side in a way that few classes do.",
    "Yea!!!!",
    "Yes! It's interesting and relevant. Unlike other classes, we don't use a textbook and have the opportunity to read and discuss current issues. I would recommend this class to someone interesting in both economics and in smoking, obesity, illicit drug use, alcohol consumption, etc. However, be sure to note that you will have to use topics from years past, particularly those covered in public economics, like positive and negative externalities.",
    "Interesting material, little work. Good senior seminar, but you won't learn much."
