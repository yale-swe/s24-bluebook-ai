    "What a great course! After reading the syllabus, I thought that it would be interesting and it totally exceeded my expectations! Very interactive and thought stimulating. We had guest speakers come in to class at some points during the semester who spoke about various campus systems at Yale! The final project was extremely enjoyable. Also, very applicable to every day life.",
    "You will learn what a system is, and that it is complicated. The workload is fairly light until the end, when you have to submit 3 annotated readings per week and write\/present a 20-25 page paper for final.",
    "If you think you might be interested in an environmental career, take this class. If you are an EVST major, take this class. If you are interested in business, take this class. If you are a person at Yale, take this class. Easily one of the most practical classes I've ever taken. Everything I learned in EVST 170 will be used (I hope) in my real life.",
    "Overall, good and easy class. Reading definitely not essential, though there are interesting points if you skim through. Not too much work in general. Must be okay with a loose, laid-back format that is sometimes all over the place and with very vague requirements.",
    "Definitely take it for the material and the readings, if you read them. I learned so much from this class and at times, I freaked out about the state our world is in terms of the environment, but at other times I was newly inspired about what my role will be in the movement. Take it even though the class is pretty frustrating at times, not only in material but also in the structure of the assignments and the class. It's too open of a curriculumand grading is pretty arbitrary at times.",
    "I am fascinated by the material for this class, and glad that this critical topic is getting serious academic attention. However, this class was somewhat disorganized and repetitive. Because of the diverse composition of the class (students came from many different majors and even professional schools in Yale), the discussions were a very valuable part of this class, especially as we established a foundation for engaging the multifaceted concept of sustainability. However, the reading was often not relevant or necessary to the discussion. The guest speakers were always a highlight, giving great insight into what it is like to actually work in fields related to sustainability.As director of the Yale Office of Sustainability, Julie is very passionate about her field and does have a lot of experience to share. However, her demanding job means she has a lot on her plate, and this class is not a priority. She is disorganized and hard to get in touch with; her lectures tended to be vague and repetitive. The lack of feedback as we worked on big projects was frustrating. But, her position was certainly a boon for finding other fascinating people in sustainability industry and academia to speak to the class.Everything really came together in the final project. Despite the fact that the 25-page paper demanded extensive research and we received almost no feedback during the process, it was an amazing experience of delving into analysis of real systems and synthesizing ideas from the semester's discussions. I was skeptical of working with a partner, but the discussion we had in conceptualizing the paper was invaluable, and in the end, we could have written far more than 25 pages. Overall, I think I gained a solid foundation for thinking about sustainability and an idea of where in the field my interests lie. The most important thing about this class was the conversations it started and the questions it opened; I can see myself making a career of answering them.",
    "A discussion of what environmental sustainability really means, especially on a university campus. You will learn a lot about sustainability initiatives at Yale.",
    "I would not recommend this course until it is redesigned with a bit more nuanced look at what role \"sustainable development\" plays in our attempts as a society to ameliorate environmental issues and social harms. It was taught in such a way that I was constantly thinking of counter arguments that might be brought up by just about any other disciplines to the assumptions underlying our debate. I thought it provided a biased, over-simplified look at sustainable development.",
    "If you want to learn about environmental consulting or Yale's systems, this is the best class for you. There's about 100pgs of reading a week so not too bad. I'd say if you're interested in sustainability, take the class.",
    "An interesting, if sometimes frustrating, intro to systems thinking and a broad range of sustainability topics - for both majors and nonmajors. While illuminative at moments and excellent in pulling together a variety of fascinating experts in various fields of sustainability, this class suffered from a serious lack of focus and organization. The readings had relatively little to do with weeklydiscussion - when we knew what they were\/could access them. The final project felt meaningful, if a little high-flying, and I certainly appreciate the complexity of Yale systems to a far greater degree. Doing this class over, however, I would much rather go more in-depth on fewer topics."
