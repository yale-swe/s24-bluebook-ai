    "Climate Change in the Media has been one of the most eye-opening, engaging, fun, and useful classes I've ever taken at Yale. No, scratch that, it has been THE most useful class I've taken here. Every single session is engaging, the material extremely relevant and enjoyable to read, the guests are the most prominent, fascinating people in the environment field and the topics we study are relevant and just plain fun to discuss. My mind was challenged week after week as I got to learn the fascinating history of climate change communications, got to meet the main actors in this history, and engages with the most cutting-edge theories in the field. You come into the class expecting a great lecture and as pieces of the puzzle fall into place you just become amazed at what you're seeing. You get to learn everything from why WALL-E is an amazing piece of environmental story-telling to the strategy politicians and deniers use to question the scientific validity of climate change. It's a class that teaches you the most important lesson about environmentalism: it's not about the message, it's how you transmit this message. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this class - hands down my favorite class I have ever, ever taken at Yale. TAKE IT!!!",
    "I definitely would recommend this course if you're passionate about climate change.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It'll expose you to a whole new mindset about climate change communication, but be aware that the class might be disorganized at times.",
    "I would fully recommend CSES 310 to another student. Not only was the material new, interesting, and highly relevant, but Professor Lussier is great! He's really invested and interested in the materials and you can tell. The course is about various narrative strategies that are used for climate and science communication and how to more effectively incorporate them.",
    "I highly recommend this course (or any with Paul) to all interested in climate change. The subject matter is fascinating and Paul is very energetic and dynamic. You can't go wrong with the class, as long as you're willing to go along for the journey (it's not always the most organized). You will learn a great deal and many real world skills.",
    "Yes absolutely- the topics and questions we addressed in this class remain among the most important challenges facing our world today.",
    "If you have the chance to take a class with Paul Lussier, I highly recommend it. He has many fresh ideas about how to better think and talk about climate change, and he is extremely smart, energetic, and motivational. The content he teaches makes it worth taking the class alone. Lussier is also a devoting and caring mentor outside of class. And there are a variety of real-world project communicating climate that students can get involved in. The weakness of the class is it's logistics and organization, and it was a bit chaotic at times, but in my mind the courses other strengths more than made up for these flaws.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Amazing! I wish everyone could take this, because it's SO important and one of the most vital fields for the future. And Paul is the perfect person for it.",
    "I would recommend this course but only to students very interested in the subject already and also to those that don't mind inconsistencies in the syllabus and changing expectations as well as being a bit unorganized.",
    "CSES 310 is a tremendous course! Take it if you can. It's the type of course that demonstrates why residential college seminars are so special: an eager professor, relevant course material, and engaged students. Definitely a highlight of any Yale semester.",
    "Fascinating course, definitely take it if you get the chance. It covers topics that I wish we could present to a greater number of people, because it would be extremely beneficial, almost integral, for students hoping to work into the climate change\/environment area. The readings every week are very interesting and elucidating, although they were usually only tangentially addressed in seminar, as Paul tends to ramble on about other things (which were almost always related). Some weeks they were a bit lengthy (150-200 pages) but sometimes he would reevaluate and lessen the reading for the week. Paul is either a pretty easy grader or works with you on your assignments enough that you end up getting a good grade. Ultimately, it definitely fits the category of classes where you get out of it what you put into it."
