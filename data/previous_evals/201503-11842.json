    "I would recommend this section to another student, because I thought the topic was very interesting, and I learned about different perspectives on sexuality and gender.",
    "This class will make you analyze the deeper reasons behind the various gender and sexual norms we currently have in society. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed the class and found the discussion very interesting. We tackled important issues that I think all people should be talking about. However, I would warn people that all of the readings are shortish (around 20 pages) essays instead of novels. I think I somewhat missed beautiful literature and narratives that told captivating stories.",
    "yes, i feel like i am a lot more critical of the world around me and i am curious to learn more. it certainly impacted my academic and personal life. being more aware of the role of gender and sexuality in the world is very important to being an engaged and intentional human being",
    "It's a class about a topic, with 4 essays that basically are your grade, it's a good class to take if you want to get writing experience and also learn about a topic you wouldn't otherwise learn about.",
    "English 114 is great for learning not only about how to write more powerfully but also how to think about the world more critically."
