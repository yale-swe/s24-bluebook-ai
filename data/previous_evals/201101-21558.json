    "Tentatively yes. For my part, I loved this course, and I know the other people in my seminar section did, as well. Some things you might not get from the Blue Book description: this class is taught by a team of teachers. Basically, Mondays are lectures, and on Wednesdays you split into smaller groups led by professors to discuss readings and lectures. Professor Gabriel is the best. He's hilarious, an excellent section leader, and a great lecturer. The same could not be said for the other professors teaching the course this semester. Professor Kramer was a good lecturer, but not a good section leader. Professor Hagens was good at neither lecturing nor section leading. Those of us in my section, with Professor Gabriel, loved the class. The people in the other sections hated it. I'm thankful I only had to be with their sections on the few section days that we met as a whole class (there were only ~twelve of us in total this semester, which meant we got four-five to a discussion section, which was very nice). So: I would recommend this course, on the condition that you check out the professors first, especially if you're considering being a literature major.",
    "The only reason you should take it is if you are a Lit major. You'll get through it, but a little part of your soul will die in each boring lecture and mind-numbingly dull section.",
    "The course is a survey of poetry, drama, and a little bit of film. The relationship between poetry and performance is fascinating and if it interests you I would recommend the class. Lectures are pleasant, the workload is extremely manageable, and Professor Gabriel is sincere, funny, and pleasant. The more you put into the class the more you will take from it. I am not a literature major and I still enjoyed it.",
    "If you're a freshman or science major searching for a writing credit, look elsewhere. If you're a Literature major, I am so so so sorry. This is the price we pay for leeching all the benefits of the English major without having to muddle through Hawthorne and Spenser.",
    "Yes - take this course!",
    "The class is required for Lit majors. It isn't great but isn't terrible. The workload isn't too heavy, and I had Hagens for sections. He's a good professor--fair grader, but puts a lot of weight on section participation.",
    "I took this course for the Literature major, and I wasn't expecting much based on the evaluations I'd read. I ended up enjoying the readings and being very entertained during lecture; overall, I thought the course was enjoyable. The workload is light.",
    "I recommend that students interested in literature take the class in freshman or sophomore years."
