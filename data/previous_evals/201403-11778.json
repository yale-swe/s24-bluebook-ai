    "I would recommend the course to people interested in sexuality and theories of sexuality. There's a variety of types of readings and it offers a nice introduction to feminist and queer theory. You get out of it what you put into it.",
    "Take this class if you are at all thinking abut majoring in WGSS. It's such an amazing class.",
    "WGSS 205 is Intro LGBT Studies under an eye-catching new name. It's taught by Joe Fischel, who is brilliant and energetic. I was hoping to broaden my reading in queer studies, and the syllabus does a good job of covering a broad swath of theory (Foucault, Rich, Warner, D'Emilio, etc) while also engaging with texts that focused on lived experiences (i.e. Janet Mock's Redefining Realness, an ACT UP documentary). Joe did seem to sometimes struggle to organize class discussions within a weekly two-hour seminar block--he said that he'll be moving to a twice-a-week model next time--but that's a small quibble. This class is a really accessible and engaging way to start thinking about gender and sexuality; and even if it can't quite follow through on all its stated goals, it's still worth your time.",
    "A really solid introduction to queer scholarship and issues. It's an overview so week to week the discussions can feel a little bit disjointed, since we cover so many topics. Joe Fischel is a great professor, and a really nice guy, but he talks really fast and stresses the class out by not budgeting class time very well. Honestly, this class would be a lot better if it met twice a week rather than only one time. It's a required course for the WGSS major, and it wasn't painful at all. The assignments vary widely - we read memoirs, novels, plays, scholarly readings, and watch films, which is great. Try to be active on the Facebook group - when a lot of people post it makes for great discussions outside of class.",
    "BPSG (bodies and pleasures, sex and genders) was an incredible course! You read a good mix of really challenging but important academic text (foucault...) and easier to engage with but also important contemporary text (redefining realness, M Butterfly). Importantly, all of the reading is complemented really well by Professor Joe's help in leading discussions. I wouldn't necessarily call this a \"traditional\" seminar-style course, because there were a lot of mini-lectures incorporated, but I think that was definitely a benefit to the course. A lot of the readings were (although never too lengthy to read in preparation) extremely dense, and having a mini-lecture to reiterate and contextualize them made the discussions that ensued much more meaningful. BPSG is a really important and wonderful course that is definitely not only for WGSS majors---there were plenty of non-majors in the course and we all got a LOT out of it. Joe Fischel is an incredible professor; nobody should pass up the chance to learn from him, especially in a seminar format. On top of that, he picks a wonderful mix of readings each week, and structures each week thematically but takes great care to highlight the common themes and threads throughout the semester. I learned a ton from this course and would recommend it to anyone with even the slightest interest in gender and\/or sexuality! As far as workload goes: if you are interested in the material, this course is totally manageable. I skipped the reading one week (oops), and got WAY less out of that lesson. However, all the other weeks when I did the reading, the class was engaging, fun, and enlightening. The reading is not a TON, but it's imperative. There were also three response papers that were really short. The length was nice because they didn't take too long to write, however they forced you to really condense your argument into a page or two and not hide behind elaboration, which was a challenging but really helpful exercise for me. There is also a final paper or project that is very open ended and can be extremely fun!",
    "TAKE IT. Even if you aren't a WGSS major, take it!! You would be surprised just how much queer issues affect the every day we live in.",
    "We study a lot of theory so if that is something that interests you, take it. sometimes our conversations drift into the more practical applications of the theory"
