    "This course provides a general overview on the Ancient Maya, including archaeological, material and iconographic evidence throughout sites and general patterns and changes that occurred from the Preclassic through Postclassic periods. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Maya archaeology, or learning about the Ancient Maya and their culture.",
    "Definitely! A must take for people interested in ancient civilizations\/mesoamerican history.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless the student's interest in ancient civilization is driven predominantly by a love of archeology.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in ancient civilizations.",
    "ANTH 294 is a review of Maya archaeology and a little ethnohistory. I would recommend ANTH 294 to anyone. The Maya are an over-sensationalized group that can be discussed at the dinner table, and improving one's knowledge of them can help create better conversations about indigenous peoples in Mexico and Central America."
