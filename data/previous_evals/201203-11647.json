   "comments": [
    "A good continuation of Chinese language study at the intermediate level. I would recommend this course if you are looking to develop your Chinese language skills further, and the textbook is very entertaining.",
    "Yes, gives good foundation on grammar and structure. However, I would have appreciated more emphasis on conversational Chinese than just memorizing passages.",
    "You'll learn a LOT of Chinese in 130 if you put the work in. I would strongly recommend taking it; the teachers are very vested in your success, and it is very satisfying to succeed in the class, as well as to be able to speak Chinese at a reasonable level.",
    "L3 Chinese is great. The teachers are awesome, so don't worry about the change (if you took L1\/L2). It's a similar system to L1\/L2 in that there is a rotation, but there are only 3 this time. The textbook is for the year-long sequence, which is nice. In terms of time commitment, I felt like it was significantly less work than L1\/L2. We had week-long (ish) lessons that drew from both the print textbook and an online textbook (free). During the weeks in which the print is used, there are 2 quizzes, and during the other weeks there aren't any quizzes. This is a pretty big shift from the daily quizzes in the first year sequence. The tests are still pretty hard, but are easier to study for than last year's tests. Overall, I enjoyed the course. I'd definitely recommend it. If you're thinking about not continuing Chinese, I'd strongly encourage you to at least shop this!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Make sure you are at the right level. The teachers are good and the curriculum is as well. My Chinese definitely improved a lot.",
    "Less constant work than L1\/L2. Largely the same format as before. Much less memorization of passages. Much greater emphasis on characters."
