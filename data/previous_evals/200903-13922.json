   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a survey of Ancient Greek art and architecture and gives you a great perspective on the western canon.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in taking a survey course on a general, broad topic. The readings are engaging and easy to follow, and overall it's a great introduction to Greek art and architecture.",
    "I would say that it is good to take a Greek art class if you are an art history major, and it is a good survey course for Greek art.",
    "I recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn about the ancient world. a good intro art history class.",
    "History of Art 243 01 connects both the history and art (sculptures, painting, pottery, etc) of Ancient Greece. I would recommend it to another student, whether they are interested in Classics or not, because it is a very good introduction to art history.",
    "A great overview of Greek art. Really interesting if you are interested in Ancient Greece and\/or the western artistic canon. It is very much a survey, and doesn't go that much into depth in any particular topic. Prof. Gaifman is an energetic and enthusiastic lecturer.",
    "Take this if you're interested in Ancient Greece at all! You will be exposed to many different aspects of their civilization: history, society, religion, etc. The professor does a good job in filling in the gaps of the book which is not tedious to read at all, and memorizing slides and thinking critically will comprise the bulk of the \"work\"",
    "It is a pretty good class. I think I would have gotten more out of it if I had engaged more with the material. It is easy to let the information go by without retaining much. Professor Gaifman is a very easy grader and there is not much work for the class, but the information itself feels very important because, well, its Greek history, that stuff is important.",
    "Not a very difficult class, but a good introduction to ancient art, and Greek culture as expressed through that art (but this is not an intro to Greek culture).",
    "A general survey of Greek art and architecture with readings that are heavy on framing the entire subject and are less specific on scholarship and theories about the various periods within Greek art. There is a good emphasis on architecture, painting and sculpture and it keeps in mind the foundational aspects of Greek art for the rest of Western art.",
    "You can't go wrong with the course, but make sure you go to lecture and try to keep up with the material. Sounds obvious but it can be very tempting to the do the opposite."
