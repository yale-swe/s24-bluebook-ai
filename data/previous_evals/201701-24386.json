    "This course greatly improved my understanding of Arab politics. Ambassador Ford does a great job at tying together the recent history of specific countries with broader themes across the region.",
    "The course is a survey of contemporary Arab politics - more breadth than depth. The readings for the most part are engaging if you are at all interested in the Middle East. Apart from the readings Amb. Ford shares anecdotes and stories from his time in the State Department, which are always fun.",
    "I developed a much better understanding of Arab culture, politics and nations. This course provided context and background that I have been desperately needing and is immensely pertinent to my profession."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: It is very well organized and the readings are interesting. The presentation section of the course where students present 10-15 min on any Middle East topic of their choosing is the best. Amb. Ford suggests a few key readings - maybe 30-80 pgs altogether - before each class which is a welcome change from a professor expecting you to read 300+ pages a week. Also Amb. Ford asks that papers only be 7-10 pgs long, not an asinine length such as 20 which serves no purpose whatsoever in the real world and just makes students' lives miserable. Weakness: On the days without presentations class can become boring since it is 2 straight hours of discussion. This is neither the fault of the professor nor of the students - it is just inevitable if you have 2 static hours of going over the readings. Suggestion: I find paper writing in grad seminars not very helpful. I think class would be greatly improved if he assigned one paper instead of two and two presentations instead of one. There could be a short presentation, a midterm paper, and a final longer presentation.",
    "This course is well-structured and highly informative. It is extremely rich in content. The size was perfect for in depth discussions."

    "Absolutely. Great course; well-organized. The themes of each week both explain the long-running issues that explain politics in the Middle East, and shed light on current events. Discussions were a highlight of my courses at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone interested in a survey course on the region would benefit from taking it.",
    "Yes, if you are set on taking a seminar and have interest in the Middle East, highly recommend this course! I was completely new to the Middle East and had no background or experience so don't let that stop you either. Really well structured course and fantastic professor. The only caveat is he is a strict grader. A paper that would get an Honors in another class gets a High Pass in his. So if you care about your grade be forewarned that you will have to put in a lot of effort to get an Honors. He is strict but fair. There were 8 or 9 people in the class which I've heard is the average for his class and this makes a BIG difference. Class is more intimate and you get to know your classmates better. We had a great class with a lot of interesting perspectives and fun personalities.",
    "Yes. If you have any interest in Arab politics or culture, this course is a must."
