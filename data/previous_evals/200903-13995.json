    "I would recommend the class, particularly for Latin Americanists as it provides a new perspective on many of the historical events of that region and era.",
    "Interesting course with a large scope that allows for a variety of approaches and interests. I would recommend the course, although I would mention it is a new course so the reading list might be edited or shifted a bit in the future.",
    "Yes I would, I'd summarize it as I did above.",
    "Disease and Medicine in the Caribbean is a survey course on the history of medicine in the Caribbean area (mostly Spanish speaking), with a strong emphasis on differing historiographic approaches. Chances are you'll find something that interests you, as the course covers just about every conceivable aspect of history of medicine, from epidemiology, sociology, prostitution, public health, communism, etc. However, also expect to be pushed out of your comfort zone frquently as you learn about topics you probably have no background in. I would recommend the course if you're curious about what's going on in the Caribbean and are thinking about expanding your topical or geographical horizons."

    "The course broadened my knowledge of the Caribbean as well as the methods, sources, and historiographical debates unique to Caribbean medical history. I appreciated the professor's take on disease and medicine's influence on the Caribbean world and its history."
