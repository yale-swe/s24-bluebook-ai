    "I highly recommend this to anyone interested in doing research. It's a great experience as long as you have a good advisor and a project that excites you. While I put a lot of work into it this semester, I also found it less stressful than a typical course since there are no deadlines or exams. The paper and presentation aren't much work, so definitely take the credit if you're doing research anyway.",
    "This is the senior project class, so you will need to do it sooner or later.",
    "This is 100% dependent on your advisor and research project, so pick those carefully. And be aware that one semester goes a lot faster than you expect. Start writing early.",
    "Definitely. Obviously, it all depends on the lab so make sure you pick one with good people and preferably a professor you've had a class with before (which makes it easier to jump right into research).",
    "N\/A",
    "If you find a good advisor this class is enjoyable.",
    "This is the senior research requirement - you have to do it as a physics major, so get a good project!",
    "You have to do it, but it's not bad. Just get a project that interests you, otherwise it will seem like a chore.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student. It is a great opportunity to have academic freedom within a Yale course and develop independent research skills.",
    "Take it early and often."
