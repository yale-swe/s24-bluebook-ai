    "If you want experience with research or if you just want to learn more about how kids think, take this class.",
    "Yes, it is very painless way to fulfill the psych methods requirement. It doesn't require a huge time commitment outside of class hours and you get to design and run a developmental study in its entirety which can be super fun. The TA this semester was very very very involved with the course and design of our study so I think you should probably check out the class first to see what the TA is like before taking the class.",
    "You get to deal with little kids, and that's fun. Some of the other RM classes make you run your own study, but in this class you work as a team. I think there's something useful in being walked through the process the first time around. The final exam asked for you to display your ability to design your own study. Three hour chunks of time are rough at times, but that's the case with all RM classes. Would recommend this one.",
    "A great class! Very challenging and fast-paced, but if you are interested in research psychology and have an understanding of cognitive development, you should definitely take this class! My only suggestion would be to know stats before coming into this class.",
    "A solid research methods class for psych majors. Unlike most of the other research methods classes where you do independent research projects in small groups, we did one project as an entire class. Overall, I think that meant less work for each individual student, but we might have not gotten as much out of it in terms of learning how to design and conduct a study as students in other classes did. Professor Dunham is super friendly and approachable. This was his first year teaching research methods, so I'm not sure if the class will change in format in the future. Our grade was composed of participation, a few small writing assignments, a midterm, an in-class final, and the final report on our project. Later in the semester, you have to put in hours outside of class to run the study, but it's really not that big of a time commitment. Also, the class often didn't go for the full 3 hours. If you're interested in cognitive development, then I would definitely recommend this for fulfilling your research methods requirement. If not, I would also recommend it - you learn a great deal about doing psychological research (although maybe not as much as you would in another class?), the readings are interesting, and it ends up not being too much work.",
    "PSYC 280 is great! It\u2019s a research methods class that\u2019s taught in a hands-on manner in which the class becomes its own sort of research group working on a study that is designed collaboratively. It\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s informative, and the professor is really helpful. You leave the class with a lot of knowledge about the practicalities of designing a study, and if you\u2019re at all interested in developmental psychology, this class will definitely help you prepare for designing your thesis and designing your proposals for graduate school. It\u2019s challenging, but worthwhile. I would highly recommend it!",
    "This class started out with a lot of background reading (but not much actual \"homework\") to get everyone on the same page, then we came up with a study, ran it with kids at the museum and lab, analyzed the data on SPSS, and wrote up a report for the final. The work was very manageable, the only thing that was difficult was class was 3 hours once a week, which was difficult. People definitely got distracted and did other things in class. Hopefully they change it."
