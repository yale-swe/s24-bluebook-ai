    "This class was a good intro course for astronomy, especially if you're curious about space but don't want to engage with harder level courses. Don't be fooled though. It is definitely not a gut class and you will have to put some effort into the problem sets due every week and the exams. It's not difficult if you spend time studying the material, but the problem is that no one does. I definitely recommend going to section and lecture as Robert Zinn does do a good job of explaining the concepts. As a humanities student taking a QR for the first time, I'd say that this class wasn't too bad and I definitely learned a lot about stars, black holes, galaxies, and the universe.",
    "easy introduction to astronomy, interesting overall and very easy math. i would recommend it to learn a bit about the field without serious commitment",
    "I think this was a great class. It was very informative and I enjoyed learning about the universe and how it came to be. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. The math is not overbearing at all so any one can take the course, stem major or not.",
    "This course is a broad, general look at astronomy. If you are looking for a course that will give you a basic introduction to astronomy, look no further than this course.",
    "If you're looking at this class, you probably aren't a sciencey or mathy person. There's a good amount of math here and you'll need to do a lot of it for weekly psets. The Psets are the only homework, but they take about 3-4 hours to do properly. There are also two midterms and a final to study for. It's pretty interesting, most of the time.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, especially if you are not a science person. It's true that the math involved is pretty simple, but the concepts you have to master in order to even arrive at the math are ridiculous. The sheer amount of information we are expected to know is impossible. What's in the reading does not apply to what's taught in class which does not apply to what's on the PSets. You will be teaching yourself and googling a lot. The exams are a lot of obscure questions, while what is highlighted in class is not on them. It's ultimately a matter of luck as to if what you studied out of the vast amount of information covered is actually on the exam. The homework and exams are graded VERY harshly. I don't think anyone is trying to give you partial credit for what you do know, but to look at points where they can count you off for lacking something. (Like on the homework you can get everything totally correct on a problem that doesn't ask for any explanation, and then a TA will comment, \"but why does this work?\" and count you off a point. Even if the question is a very straightforward and simple, they expect you to explain the fucking intricacies of some equation given in class.) I have been to every lecture, many discussions sections, I take detailed notes in class, do all the PSets and do fairly well on them, I study beforehand, and I am doing dismally on all the exams. The final is in two hours and I think a majority of the class just doesn't even know how to prepare for it.",
    "Its a great class if your interested and pay attention, if your looking for a gut, its probably not good - but i would recommend it.",
    "Astro 120 is a great intro to astronomy, very interesting, but the problem sets are more difficult than you will expect",
    "I would not recommend ASTR 120 unless you DESPERATELY need a QR credit. I didn't need one and just took astronomy because I thought it would be fun --- boy, was I wrong. If you want to take astronomy, I would recommend taking Louise Edwards' seminar or another class with someone other than Robert Zinn.",
    "The material presented in this course was quite interesting and provided an effective introduction to the field of astronomy. However, if you are looking for an easy science credit, this course may not be for you. The problem sets are tedious and the exams are no joke. Many opportunities for outside help are available though, and a cool trip to the Yale planetarium is featured.",
    "A science credit that interesting but not the guttiest one",
    "Excellent theoretical introduction to astronomy and cosmology",
    "Would not recommend taking this class unless you absolutely have no other choice.",
    "Only take if you are willing to take the time to teach yourself astronomy because you don't really get taught... It's a struggle of a course. The tests are also poorly written\/don't follow the class. Be prepared for a semester long struggle if you take it. Only pro is that classes don't meet that often, and even if they did, the lectures aren't well organized so you won't learn anyway. Go to section if you're trying to pass. Good luck!",
    "Interesting material but relatively difficult for non science majors.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This class is NOT a gut-- if you're looking for a science credit, LOOK ELSEWHERE. This class is not easy, it is a lot of work; you must essentially teach yourself the entire course, as the professor does not do a good job teaching himself. Biggest regret so far in courses at Yale is taking this one-- DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Had to take this class because it's the only QR that fit my schedule. Hated it throughout the semester because it wasn't something I was interested in. Seems like most people in the class don't care much for it either. Most of the learning happened when I was studying for midterms\/finals during which I actually found some of the material quite interesting. I suppose it's a class you have to put some mental effort it to appreciate it. By the end, I do feel like I can admire what astronomers do and understand the fascination of the cosmos. That being said, I suffered through most lectures and homework assignments. Not a difficult class, but definitely not a gut either. Take it if you are not jaded and still have an interest in learning something new and feels irrelevant for the most part.",
    "The class is very interesting, but I found material to be quite dense. I came in expecting it to be slightly easier.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit, look elsewhere. The course is awful.",
    "Do not take this course. It is NOT a gut and it is not worth taking a difficult course with an incompetent professor.",
    "Like what?",
    "Gut, do if you must",
    "ASTR 120 is NOT as easy as you think it will be. Granted, it's not incredibly difficult either, but you can't do well on the exams unless you actually prepare for them (though the problem sets are definitely manageable). Professor Zinn is also incredibly dull and drones on and on about seemingly irrelevant material. If you are looking for a reasonable QR credit, I could possibly recommend Galaxies and the Universe, but I would guess that there are much more interesting and applicable science courses out there that you could take instead.",
    "Very interesting class to take, really fun QR.",
    "Do not take this class thinking it is a gut. It is not that. Go to the lectures and the sections.",
    "Problem sets every week, with two midterms and a final. A bit too much tedious work for a science class, which maybe would be justified if the content was interesting, but this course fails to follow through on that promise by spending more time on basic math and history instead of the implications of astronomical findings.",
    "I would not recommend this course, as the presentation was very dry and the problem set and final exam material was not clear or well articulated in the lectures.",
    "The class is not at all easy! The workload is really high, and so are expectations. Only take it because you want to learn about cool stuffs in Astronomy. The person who will take it for a some easy grade will be sorry!",
    "This course is not a gut Sc\/QR. You will have to spend a lot of time on the weekly Psets in order to get a decent grade. The TA's hold sections every week for PSet help that are super helpful. It is usually more helpful to read the text book to understand concepts. Zinn, tends to drag on in lectures and does not present the information in a clear way. There are weekly Psets, 2 midterms, and observation exercise at the Observatory, and a final."
