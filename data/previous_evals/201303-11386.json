    "Great acting class, not very organized, but really helpful for giving tools for actors. You do not go through each acting concept like an overview, but it is more about experiencing and growing in class. You keep a journal of observations and experiences everyday, and some performance projects and 3 responses to performances and a final paper. Easy and not stressful class.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale thus far. Maria's a lovely person and a great teacher. The workload wasn't stressful at all, projects took up a bare minimum of spare time, and yet we got a really good introduction to the basics of acting and improved a lot by the class's end.Also: I got my first Dramat part after auditioning with a side I practiced with in class, if you need another incentive...",
    "Sure, I would definitely recommend it."
