    "I really enjoyed this class. Eva is an amazing teacher, which is something I can't really say about most professors here at Yale. The subject matter is also pretty interesting, and the economics we use isn't that tough (it's basically intro\/intermediate micro, except you know what's going on because Eva is great about walking through everything step-by-step). Work-wise, the class isn't too bad either. There's participation (attendance, basically) 6 problem sets (lowest dropped), a real chill case study presentation you do in a group, a midterm, and a final. Eva gives you \"practice questions\" that double as content review (and as a de facto question bank) for the qualitative part of the exam, which is clutch. I would recommend this even if you're not that interested in the subject matter; if you are, I doubly recommend this class. It's well-taught, well-structured, and Eva is an absolute sweetheart.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend ECON 414 to any senior economics major. The course material itself is extremely relevant (e.g., IP protection, network effects, labor incentives), and Professor Chalioti does a phenomenal job of explaining the concepts. There is a bit of micro involved, but rest assured that all of the problems you do ACTUALLY inform the higher-level concepts you're learning in class. In terms of graded material, psets are extremely manageable, and exams are more than fair. If for no other reason, take it for the incredible instruction by Professor Chalioti.",
    "Would highly recommend. As long as you don't mind spending time with the material it's very doable.",
    "If you survived Intermediate Micro, this is a great course to take as a senior seminar.",
    "YES take it! Econ 414 is a really manageable senior econ class. It's a small lecture, there were 6 psets, a midterm, a really chill group project, and a final. The psets are kind of long\/hard but there aren't that many and you can work with your friends. The midterm and final are really fair; there are no curveballs and if you study the material, you'll be fine. The subject matter is very relevant, and you look at companies like Facebook, Tesla, and Apple. Also the class is half quantitative half qualitative. Professor Chalioti is so great, and the class definitely gets better as the semester goes on!",
    "Oh Evangelia...Where to even begin. She is an absolute gem of a human being - one of the kindest and most compassionate professors that I have ever met. Her class was the optimal learning environment. She taught every concept, even the confusing quantitative portions, in a clear and understandable way. I learned so much from her class, and she gave us every opportunity to go to her for help or clarification if we ever needed it. I wish I would have had this kind of enjoyable learning experience in all of my other economics classes. Although the material for this class was sometimes dull, I still enjoyed being in the class. I would highly recommend taking this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 414. It was a wonderful senior lecture! You learn about innovation, patents, imperfect markets, and more! The PSETs do a good job at helping you learn the material. The professor is also fantastic at teaching the concepts very clearly.",
    "Extraordinary course.",
    "ECON 414 was one of my most enjoyable economics courses here so far. Most of all the economics courses we have had to take for the major were very theoretical, and I have not had an opportunity to apply it to real life situations - that's what this class allowed us to do. It was really eye opening to use what we had learned in microeconomics, which at the time seemed a bit dry since it was solely math\/theory based, to seeing the potential in what we can actually do with it. Definitely take this class. It's a bit math heavy however, once you get the hand of it in the beginning of the semester, it is understandable and applicable in many of the topics. Also Professor Chalioti is amazing! She always puts her students first and was always so helpful and understanding throughout the entire semester.",
    "Pretty good class",
    "I would recommend ECON 414! The workload is not too high, though the psets do take up a fair bit of time (there are only 6). They are pretty quantitative, so if that is not your style, then this class may not be the best choice for you. It is a bit like intermediate micro applied to the tech sector and innovation (patent races, venture capital, etc). There is one case study that you have to do with 3-4 other people comparing 2 companies. The tests are very fair with no trick questions. Lastly Prof. Chalioti is super nice and really passionate about her work, and you won't find anyone better! Great for a senior looking for a chill seminar",
    "would recommend. workload is not too demanding although the psets can be kinda tedious and annoying because they involve a lot of algebra\/simplification. material is sometimes interesting tho and Professor Chalioti is really sweet and wants her students to do well",
    "A bit mathy - a lot of intermediate macro-style maximization. But it's a very interesting class, and the grading is extremely fair. Recommended.",
    "Great course. The material is a good mix of theory, quant and practical application. It is challenging, but not overly so - if you study for the exams and come to lecture, you will do well in the class. Prof Chalioti is also a really great professor - her lectures are clear and she really does care about her students and wants to see everyone do well. Highly recommended!",
    "An awesome course. Very interesting material looking into what drives innovation, covering a lot of important questions for our generation.",
    "Incredible course with one of the best instructors out there, take it!!!",
    "This course teaches you a range of topics relating to technology such as patent law, patent races, R&D investments, copyrights, licensing, pools, etc. I highly recommend this course as it also incorporates game theory and intermediate micro Econ in ways, which are things I never thought I would ever use after taking those courses. The professor is a delight and makes the math and challenging material very easy to understand. You'll be surprised by how much you can do by the end of the course. Take it!!",
    "Would recommend -- easy senior lecture with a great professor."
