   "comments": [
    "A rigorous, fast-paced intermediate Chinese language program with emphasis on key fundamentals of language. Highly recommended - Chinese at Yale is well structured and well taught.",
    "Very similar to Chinese 130. You will learn a lot of Chinese. Take it!",
    "If you're interested in learning Chinese, definitely take this. It's a pretty good class that most people seem to enjoy, but can be pretty work intensive.",
    "This class is a bit more intensive than CHNS 130, but still perfectly manageable. Time commitments are slightly higher, but a worthwhile investment. I feel much more comfortable with speaking Chinese, and feel the vocabulary we learned is in majority useful.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in progressing towards fluency! As with all Chinese language classes, there is a heavy workload, but it is well-timed and manageable. The teachers are incredible, and there is plenty of drama in the David and Helen textbook to keep you engaged. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 140 to a fellow student. It was one of my favorite classes this semester and one I looked forward to every day. The professors are all incredible and Chinese is a great language to learn."
