    "A good, easy course that will teach you about a subject you probably know nothing about. Lectures are interesting and you don't have to do the reading if you don't want to. The field trips are awesome and are the main reason I would recommend the class-you will get to see all many of the museums and resources Yale has to offer. Be warned-it's easy BUT NOT A GUT!",

    "Yes. If you have ever been curious about Egypt, take this course."
