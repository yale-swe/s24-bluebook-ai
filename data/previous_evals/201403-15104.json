    "I definitely recommend other students, both music majors and non-music majors, to take this class. I myself is a science major and I didn't know much about music theory before. I took this class just because I play an instrument and I wanted a humanity credit. But this class ended up being one of my most favorite classes. If you enjoy listening to and playing music, and want to understand more about music, this is a great course to take. The homework is not too much, and the class is very interactive and fun.",
    "If you're taking a course with Jonathan Guez, you are bound to enjoy yourself. He is humorous, well prepared and teaches excellently. As for the class itself, it's a great way to get started on properly understanding harmony. We build up from the fundamentals of counterpoint up until the subtleties of modulation, leaving the really atonal stuff for 211. Definitely worth it if you are considering it.",
    "Take it, especially with Jonathan Guez if you can. You won't regret it and you'll appreciate music on a really great level!",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in knowing the very technical aspects of music theory.",
    "210 teaches very important fundamentals but a lot of it is already covered on the AP Music exam. Counterpoint is the only thing that's really new so if you've taken the AP in highschool make sure you are at the correct placement level."
