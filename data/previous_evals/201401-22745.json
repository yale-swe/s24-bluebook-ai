   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely. It is a great summation of the current body of criticism on lyric. I understood so much more about how to confront and synthesize criticism, as well as about the lyric genre itself.",
    "English 989 surveys theories of lyric and related theories over the course of the 20th century. The course focuses on Western, continental poetics mostly in English and French. It also tracks the development of the concept of \"lyric\" in its contemporary Western usage. I would recommend this course to students who are interested in studying the trends of lyric theory, or to be acquainted with contemporary debates in literary studies."
