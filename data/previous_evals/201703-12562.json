   "comments": [
    "By taking this course, I developed skills that involved reading philosophy papers and debating in class. We learned about principles of knowledge, group decision-making, judgment formation, and the replication crisis in science.",
    "This class focuses on the social aspects of epistemology. The major focuses of the course were expert testimony, group deliberation and social epistemology in science.",
    "I hadn't heard about social epistemology before taking this course, but I'm really glad I got to take it and engage with the variety of areas that comprise it, especially given my skepticism about traditional epistemology and its applicability to daily social and political life. I especially enjoyed reading the more empirically grounded philosophy (e.g. the final paper we read by Romero), and also the engagement with researchers who's work is in political and social science. I wish we'd gotten to do more of this, but the intersection of epistemology and political philosophy, as raised by authors like Fricker, Landemore, and Brennan, were also very interesting, and I think important, to engage with."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength of this course was that the material was very practically applicable and accessible to people with interests across a wide range of disciplines. A weakness of this course was that the two halves of the course didn't seem as connected as they could've been. It felt like we shifted from taking a philosophy course to taking a science class midway through the semester.",
    "This course was extremely interesting; I would say most of the topics are well worth your time, although occasionally the class got a bit too bogged down in empirical questions (how polarized are American politics, how much does the average voter REALLY know, etc). My one criticism would be that some of the individual units cohere together much better than others. For instance, debates in the epistemology of disagreement flows naturally into debates about which experts you can trust (the first two units of the course), but is relatively orthogonal to the later material on the social epistemology of science. Moreover, debates about the replication crisis and Matthew Effect, while interesting, often felt less philosophically rigorous than stuff earlier in the class. If Social Epistemology is offered again, I'd recommend Professor Greco focus more on depth than breadth, covering a few topics really well rather than moving on to an entirely new subject every week or two. Still, the readings and class discussions were generally very rewarding, and Professor Greco was always extremely helpful in office hours.",
    "Overall, the course dealt with interesting questions, but it could have been better structured. There were ways in which the three modules or sections fit together, but at times it felt a bit disconnected. I also don't think the course would be better structured as turning any one of the given modules into a course by itself. In class, it sometimes felt like we struggled to come up with things to talk about. It could be that we didn't have enough reading, but sometimes it felt like the readings just repeated themselves.",
    "Weekly response papers guaranteed engagement with the subject matter by everyone, and the material was engaging. I have little to nothing to find fault with in the course.",
    "I liked that the reading load was as manageable as it was, while still being enough for us to cover a broad range of topics -- even if some week's readings were relatively short, there was still more than enough for us to talk about during seminar. That said, I wonder if it might have been better spending more time during the first few weeks reading and talking about epistemic relativism and related topics, especially given some of the arguments that occurred during seminar towards the end (e.g. about what 'objectivity' is, whether 'science' is the only means of objective knowledge, or what we even mean when we say something like 'science', because sometimes that refers to the institution, and sometimes that refers to the methodology). I think doing that would put the rest of the course on clearer (if not necessarily firmer) footing, and also address a lot of the questions that I think are on some people's minds when they hear about 'social epistemology' (because for me it's very natural to relate that term to Foucauldian worries about who's in control of the 'truth')."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in philosophy of science or epistemology. I found the material to be fascinating and broadly applicable, and the midterm and final papers allowed for engagement with topics of our choosing that related to the course material--for me, this was the replication crisis in science.",
    "Probably not. The class wasn't especially well structured and the discussions often ended up going in circles. I think social epistemology is an important topic and there are definitely some worthwhile things to consider, but the course just needs to restructured and become a bit more in depth.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student without reservation.",
    "Engaging topic, taught about well. Not a crazy workload: a few papers a week, although be prepared for weekly response papers about them. Highly recommend.",
    "If you're interested in learning and debating about how to trust (disagreeing) experts when you're a novice, whether group deliberation and\/or democracy tends to produce accurate epistemic outcomes, how awareness of political polarization and bias suggest that we should temper our beliefs, or how the structure of scientific institutions might lead to either good or bad epistemic outcomes (e.g. the recent replication crisis in social science), then take this course! The reading load is very manageable (1-2 papers or chapters each week), and the topics are both interesting and practically relevant. That said, do note that this is very much a course in analytic philosophy (at least when I took it). So unless you try to raise it yourself in reading responses or class discussion, it won't really touch on some things you might expect of social epistemology, e.g. the kind of doubts raised by continental philosophers like Michel Foucault about traditional institutions that produce and disseminate truth, or other post-modern \/ post-structuralist \/ feminist thinkers."
