    "TAKE THIS COURSE NO MATTER WHAT. Fight people to get in if you must. You will love every thing about this. Professor Kazdin is AMAZING.",
    "Take this course if you can. Might be hard to get in if not a psych major. Kazdin is hilarious and made class really enjoyable. Exams entail a fair bit of reading from the book, but they are not overly difficult if you study.",
    "Kazdin is a giant in the field, and also just so happens to be a phenomenal teacher. He is really engaged with this course and you were learn a TON. The course can be highly stressful at times (mostly because Kazdin is a total troll and likes to remind you every day that you won't graduate if you fail his course), but it is worth it. The behavior change project is a lot of fun, and the course essentially teaches you how to be a great parent (the short story: you can train your children with positive reinforcement even more effectively than you can with punishment, so if you want to have really healthy\/happy\/well-behaved kids you do not need to spank them, punish them, or \"teach them lessons\"--just use the reinforcement strategies that Kazdin teaches you!) a couple quick notes--first, the course is a lecture. Second, the course is not about cognitive behavioral therapy or about cognitive therapy. It's much more focused on behavioral ideas (Kazdin is a pretty strict behaviorist). Heck, it's not even really about \"behavior therapy.\" It's really about mastering behavioral learning theories (like operant conditioning) and then learning how to implement these theories in programs in order to change human behavior. The course also emphasizes experimental design and evaluation, which is very helpful if you are interested in research or if you're doing a senior project. Basically, if you're a psych major and this subject matter interests you, then you really have to take this course. Kazdin is HILARIOUS and I've learned a huge amount from him this semester. You also will inevitably become extremely close with the other members of the class.",
    "Yes, this was a great senior seminar.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The semester-long behavior project is extremely rewarding, and really helps tie together all of the aspects of the course. You should know, however, that it will be a lot of work. The upside is that Professor Kazdin is hilarious and you will look forward to going to class!",
    "Take it. It's a decent amount of work, but a thoroughly interesting and enjoyable class.",
    "This is an excellent course if you are interested in clinical psychology and behavioral therapy. Not only will you learn valuable strategies to change unwanted behavior from one of the leading experts in the field, you will also be able to conduct your own behavior change project under his guidance. The class is a lot of work, but Professor Kazdin is so wonderfully engaging that you will gladly go through with it. I highly recommend the course to any motivated senior.",
    "In this course you learn about the principles of applied behavior analysis. That is what is focused on fora almost the entire year. I would not recommend taking it if this is not your interest or if you are interested in understanding therapy.",
    "PSYC 489 was a good course, although it a bit tougher than I expected. There is no week-to-week work, which is nice, but it means that before each of the 2 midterms and the 2 papers that you might find yourself scrambling and pulling all-nighters (I know more than one person who did). If you're the type of person who can discipline yourself to get semester-long projects done ahead of time, take it! Course material was pretty cool but kind of similar to what he writes in his textbook. Oh and Kazdin is the MAN. He's so so cool! I always found myself having so much fun in class.",
    "Kazdin is hilarious and super knowledgeable about his field. That is the best part about class. On the other hand, the class is less like a seminar and more like a very small lecture. There is not very much discussion between students about anything. The lectures are basically exactly what is in the textbook (because he wrote it), so I never paid attention in lecture because I knew I could (and would have to) read the book later anyways for the exams. The exams were fine, the first one was really easy. The essays are also graded leniently. This class is very low-key, not too much work except cramming for exams. The subject of the class is pretty cool, and you do learn some things. Much of the class focuses on the behavior change project, in which you choose someone close to you (suitemate, parent, friend, etc.) and attempt to change their behavior. This project ended up being not that interesting and much of class time was wasted, in my opinion, talking about EVERY SINGLE PERSON's projects ad nauseum. I think the class could use some re-structuring. If it were more of a seminar and less of a lecture, I could see it being very interactive and interesting.",
    "This class is worth it simply for Kazdin. What a hilarious, dedicated, knowledgeable guy! and while the beginning of the class is chill to the extent where you might feel like you're not learning much, by the end of the class I felt like I had actually learned how to change people's behavior. An extremely important class for anyone planning on being a teacher, parent, doctor ... or basically anyone. One of those rare instances where a class might change how you interact with people in \"real life.\"",
    "Would recommend. Very different than most psychology classes I've taken.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. It's a life-changing course.",
    "You MUST take this class. Kazdin is one of the BEST professors I have ever had. If you're interested in this stuff, or not, still take it because Kazdin is hilarious and brilliant, the class becomes a community, and you'll look forward to it every week. The methods of behavior-change therapy are SO important and counter-intuitive, and this class will totally change your life. Did I say already that Kazdin is the best? If you like feeling like your prof actually cares about you, then you MUST take this class."
