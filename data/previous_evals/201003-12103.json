   "comments": [
    "This is a must take if you're interested in linguistics or language. It's a great foundation for moving forward and exposes the student to a number of skills and tools. In a way, you will get out of this course as much as you put into it. You can \"get by\" with relatively little, but you will get more out of the course if you make an effort to do the work (much of which is not graded or even checked).",
    "I really liked the course. I was able to learn the IPA more in depth and I learned a lot about speech.",
    "LING 120 is an okay class. It is a great way to learn everything about all the sounds of the world -- you even learn how to make CLICKS!! However, the lectures are dry, and the professor goes really fast through the slides sometimes, so it can be hard to take notes. However, the HW isn't hard at all and the final project isn't too bad if work ahead on it -- DON'T WAIT TO THE LAST MINUTE! So I would recommend this class if you are really interested in linguistics. It is a good introductory course where you will learn a lot about language and how sounds are produced all around the world.",
    "The class is really, really interesting if you have any curiosity whatsoever about how sound is produced and what sounds are like in the world's languages. However, it is NOT easy. While everything is relatively straightforward, it graded pretty stringently and not on a curve. So be prepared to work hard, and study a lot (even things that might not seem important). Also be prepared for a grade that you might not expect going in.However, as above, the material is seriously interesting and I don't regret taking it, despite it's difficulty.",
    "Yes. Take it. Great SO class, you learn an actual skill, manageable yet a lot of work. Typical Yale class.",
    "I recommend this class very highly. The professor knows what she's talking about and it's always an interesting lecture. Not too much homework at all, but you really have to keep up on your readings because I felt anything was game for the exams (which weren't horrible). I took this class as a freshman because I was already interested in the sounds of the International Phonetic Alphabet. It made me really want to continue with linguistics. Knowledge of linguistics is a bit helpful, but not at all necessary (I went in a blank slate aside from knowing some of the IPA). I ended up learning far more than I expected, including acoustic and graphical analysis of sounds, hearing\/speaking disorders, theories about syllables, air dynamics, and of course the sounds of the world's languages! It was rough to wake up early for me, but I managed because I loved the class. Take it! I rated it \"very good\" just because it was great, but I had more life\/world-view altering classes. This was just fascinating stuff, which is great also!",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in how we talk. It is expecially useful for singers, and you'll even learn about the sounds that are used in beatboxing (they're called ejectives- the professor doesn't actually say that they're beatboxing). The one caveat is that the professor talks and goes through the slides WAY too quickly to write, and she doesn't allow for computers or post slides on classes v*2. At least there are some handouts. Overall, though, fascinating course that can lead to interesting conversations.",
    "This course gives you a good basis for understanding the process of human speech, both anatomical and acoustic as well as some more interesting aspects about how it connects to ideas of language in the brain. The course is pretty manageable with workload except the final project, which is a lot of work. Great course, though, and very interesting material.",
    "This course is okay. I now know the IPA really well and can make the click sounds of some African languages. However, I was hoping for even more transcription and production practice. Sometimes I felt that we got bogged down in theoretical stuff (a risk in any linguistics course beyond Intro), but the professor is nice and there isn't a lot of work. It would be a good fifth course.",
    "This class is a very good introduction to phonetics and teaches you all necessary tools to continue in the field of phonetics and\/or linguistics. Take it if you are interested in linguistics!",
    "Yes, if you're interested in learning about sounds and want to put the work into it. One also needs to understand that there's more to it than the sounds--you have to learn the theories and the physics of sound! (VERY simple physics don't worry)",
    "Did not expect the class to be this difficult after Ling 110. Frustrating that the prof doesn't post slides, especially because her lectures move too quickly to take good notes.",
    "The most interesting subject material I've encountered in a linguistics class thus far. The lectures are a little hurried (you'll feel like you're locked in a constant Race Against PowerPoint), but I enjoyed every lecture for its content if not necessarily its delivery. Fun stuff about sounds, how to make sounds, how to hear sounds,how to study sounds...I mean, anyone with interest in Linguistics as a major is gonna take this anyway, but if you're a singer, or writer, or have ever thought languages were fun, this is a great way to dip your toes in the murky waters of Linguistics at Yale."
