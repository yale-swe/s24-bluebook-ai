    "I loved this course. It was nuanced, well-balanced, and thoughtfully planned. The assignments were fair and understandable, even for a non-FILM major. It could be improved with clarity regarding how in-depth the reading responses must be. Also, there were usually a lot more readings than felt achievable by anyone in the course, so cutting back on some of the dense theory on the syllabus might lead more people to actually read what's assigned and make references to text during the class. Professor Gregg is easily one of the best seminar instructors I have ever had at Yale, as a senior here. He knows when to step in, but is excellent at ensuring all students have a chance to speak. When he breaks into a short powerpoint about a film's importance or cultural relevance, he is extremely informative to the extent that I wish this were a lecture course! He trains his students to see from a film theorist's perspective. I have learned so much about analyzing mise-en-scene and motifs through this course, the only FILM course I have taken. Thank you, Professor Gregg.",
    "Specific but highly insightful course especially for film aficionados interested in the genre, and for queer students interested in filmic representations of the LGBTQ experience. Gregg is positive and personable and genuinely interested in other creative projects you may have in the works, related or not to the class material. Would definitely recommend.",
    "TAKE IT. You'll watch movies you never would have seen before and you learn about the history of queer representation onscreen. Fantastic!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who thinks an lgbtq film class sounds enjoyable. It is what it is. There was more Most of the films and reading were enjoyable. I had taken a queer theory class before, but never a film class and many other students had taken neither. Discussions were interesting and I felt everyone had an opportunity to contribute. Prof Gregg was very knowledgeable, kind, helpful, and made the class fun. He provided a supportive environment for everyone and fostered discussion. He could easily steer the conversation while giving us free reign. I appreciated the way the 3 questions\/comments every week steered the discussion and allowed me to share my ideas when I wasn't always comfortable speaking up in class.",
    "I do. It is expands your knowledge and allows you to learn in depth",
    "The class is a great survey of a variety of films that fit under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. We analyzed them critically and drew upon both academic and mass-media interpretations of the films and their placement within the larger scope of queer cinema history. I would absolutely recommend the class to another student, and I would make sure to encourage them to participate.",
    "Amazing class. You learn international gay history through film. Gregg is just the best. Be warned that the final paper is long, but there isn't too much work otherwise."
