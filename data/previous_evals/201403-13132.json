    "If you're interested in creative writing, interested in trying out different genres, but might not have too big a portfolio already at hand, then take English 123. It made gave me a drive to do more creative writing. Not to mention the wonders of Nalini Jones. She is so supportive, but she never showers you with compliments--she's always pushing your work, so that whenever she genuinely told me she liked something I wrote it was very meaningful. Not to mention she's fun and makes every discussion lively. Also not to mention she's hilarious, and often told anecdotes that had everyone in the room laughing out loud. I wish she were my friend in real life. I looked forward to this class every week, I loved writing the assignments, and my creative writing has improved by a factor of a hundred since I took it. I'll miss this course next semester.",
    "ENGL123 is a great way to try out creative writing in a relaxed atmosphere. The assignments were all fun, and workshopping each other's pieces really made you think about what makes a successful piece of creative writing.",
    "Absolutely. Whether you know your future at Yale will involve creative writing, or you're a senior who hasn't written anything creative since 4th grade, this class will miraculously work for you. I took it with Professor Jones, but I heard great things about the other professors too. The workload is pretty light, the readings are great, and you'll learn a good bit about playwriting, poetry, and short fiction. It's also a good mix of lectures from professors in the three areas (all were great), workshopping, and class discussion.",
    "English 123 is a great introduction to creative writing regardless of your previous knowledge. I mean that seriously - I know people with various levels of previous creative writing experience (none - lots) who loved the course and found it really rewarding. I would absolutely recommend it to another student, pretty much anyone who has any interest in becoming a better creative writer.",
    "There are three units: fiction, poetry and drama. Each unit begins with an interesting talk from a prominent professor\/writer of that genre and then goes back to seminar style. If you haven't done any creative writing at Yale and want to get some exposure to it, this is a great course and Professor Jones is especially strong in the fiction category. If you know you're not into drama and only want to write poetry and fiction, maybe look into finding a different writing course.",
    "If you want a class that will get you to write more (and to finish things), this class will do that. But if you take it with Jones, don't expect to be *taught* things about writing. You will probably become a better writer, but it will be because you have practiced for yourself and read great pieces of writing. The instructor and class discussions are not very valuable. I have heard, however, that Chapman and Deming are much better - so it may well be worth it to take the class with them. But don't take it with Jones.",
    "Take this class FOR SURE if you have any interest in creative writing. It was a great intro to all three genres (poetry, fiction, drama) and even if you think you hate poetry, you might love it after this class. That's what happened to me. The workload is pretty chill and it was fun most of the time.",
    "I've actually recommended it to several people now. It's a great course to explore in different formats of writing, rather than focusing on just one.",
    "A good intro class to creative writing for beginners. Good readings, good class structure, all professors are experienced writers. The section can be a bit frustrating since most people are having workshops for the first time. Also you spend much time reading and critiquing your classmates' works, which are not great works of literature and can sometimes leave you frustrated as to how to evaluate it and what to say to the writer. But it's a wonderful thing to try creating your own stories\/poems and drama scenes and explore the art of writing. You learn a lot about your own way of writing, thinking and even feeling.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You will learn so much from the different units and you may surprise yourself as to which unit you will enjoy the most. Many people just think of themselves as poets or fiction writers, but this class let you explore other types of creative writing in a relaxed setting.",
    "This was a great course that was flexible and well-structured. It covered a great deal of material and assigned the right amount of homework exercises so you get to challenge yourself with new material. It may have lacked some depth in each of the three areas but serves as a good introductory course. Professor Jones is an extremely compassionate, brilliant, and fun professor; definitely take the course with her if you can."
