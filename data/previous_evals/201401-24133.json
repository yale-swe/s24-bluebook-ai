    "Absolutely incredible. My advice would be that it should meet once a week for 2 hours. You just learn SOOO much. Not only SPSS and questionnaire development skills, but also how to effectively work with a group.",
    "You get to pick whatever topic you want as well as whether you want to work in a group or independently which is great. Going through the entire process of developing the questionnaire and then collecting and analyzing data is super rewarding. As ambitious as it is Marney makes this accomplishable with minimal stress. The critique seemed a little unnecessary though.",
    "great course, the semester project is a great learning experience",
    "The course is very practical in that we learn the theory behind questionnaire development and then get to actually put that theory into practice. I think this is a major strength of the course and I learnt so much. I also think the way the course is structured is very helpful, things build on each other.The only difficulty was that there was a bit of a rush to try to get expert feedback on our measure but overall it worked out fine and given the time constraints of the course I'm unsure how this could really be changed.",
    "The course is fantastic - definitely in my top favorite courses. It's a great skills-based, practical course.the lectures& other assignment (the article critique) were good compliments to the project.No weaknesses\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.love the timing of the class and having the group time blocked off at the beginning of the semesterlearned so much in the class",
    "strengths: goes in depth on aspects of questionnaire development and statistics that we were never exposed to in other classes. Marney tries to find different ways of introducing content other than lecturing.",
    "I thought that our group research project was a great experience and it wasn't too overwhelming because we were guided through each step of the process. However, I might have appreciated a bit more structure in terms of lectures",
    "This course is great because you actually learn how to develop a questionnaire from start to finish. I feel comfortable replicating these steps in the future. Questionnaires are great because you can do amazing research with a minimal budget.",
    "I really liked that we got to design our own questionnaires and own the whole process.Eventually, I understood the whole Cronbach's alpha thing, but I think the lecture on this could be improved a bit. The instructor seemed kind of bored - and I can see why if you've explained this a bunch of times - but it's really important to understand. And, I think it can be fun! Maybe with concrete examples of past projects, for example, showing their measures and what they mean.",
    "Great. I learned a lot and can definitely see myself applying these skills to the future."

She is passionate about what she does, and takes the time to ensure that we are all moving at the same pace. She keeps us interested with her stories of her own work, and is always accessible to students. Marney is also the only professor who ever discusses how to publish in class, which is something we should be exposed to more. The only improvement would be to have her teach more classes.",

   "comments": [
    "This course is just so much FUN!!! I would recommend taking anything that Marney teaches - she is just the best. My advice would be to choose a topic that you are passionate about, and to choose your group wisely because the group dynamic can really make or break the experience. Make sure you communicate with your group members about your goals, and expectations. If there are issues, don't wait until the last minute to address them. Discuss them at the outset. If there are concerns, you can always go to Marney about anything.I would also suggest trying to publish your final product. Marney will be really helpful for that.",
    "It's a fun and rewarding class. You will end up with your own dataset and potentially a publishable paperwhich Marney is more than willing to help guide you with!",
    "great course if you think you might want to design studies in the future",
    "For a fellow student I would say if you really want to learn the ins and outs of questionnaire development ( which I think is a pretty vital skill within Public Health) this course is one that you have to take. It will require work and time but will be such a valuable learning experience and one which builds hard skills that can be used throughout your career.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course! It is a great practical course for career development",
    "This course allows students to understand how questionnaires are created, and also to understand how valuable or weak current questionnaires are. This class also will allow students insight on how to write papers and publish. It's a practical and fun class.",
    "fun, good class in terms of experience in learning how to write a reliable, valid questionnaire",
    "I definitely recommend the course, but I suggest you have aproject and group in mind. With classes like this, a lot of the experience can be influenced by your group and project. What I like about this course is that you actually do learn how to develop a questionnaire and you have the chance of publishing your work. Marney is willing to help you publish, even after the class is done.",
    "Yes! Especially if you want to publish, this is a good course.",
    "Great! Would suggest this course to all students."
