    "If you already know something about philosophy and want to dig deeper, this course is for you.",
    "Take this class if you're wanting to figure out why you think what you think is in fact what you think and why you think it.",
    "This class was the greatest - take it if it is offered again. It is really more of a discussion than a lecture and the readings are very interesting. It is also incredibly well taught - they both know their stuff so, so well and have very interesting perspectives and critiques and things to say about the subject matter and philosophy in general. Also, because it was co-taught, you get the benefits of both an extremely experienced teacher (Professor Darwall) and someone who is so immersed in the literature of rationality (Worsnip). Sometimes they would play off each other (challenging each other's ideas) or they would answer questions in different ways, which was very interesting.",
    "An in-depth look at the various problems and paradoxes of the concept of rationality. If you're into this, analytic philosophy, thought experiments, or writing papers with lots of variable-filled equations in them, take the class.",
    "This was one of the highlights of my courses to date. One of the best parts of the course for me was that it draws upon a lot of different disciplines and areas of interest, so I was able to explore my personal interests further while also getting an introduction to new and related areas of study. The readings are challenging but not impossibly difficult or long by any means, and classes are divided roughly equally between pure explanation and class-wide discussion. It's probably about 35-40 pages of writing all told, split between two moderately long papers (about 3000 words each) and several shorter reading responses. One thing I would advise is that even though the only prerequisite is technically any class in philosophy, it would probably be useful to have a little bit more of a background in philosophy classes and in epistemology in particular (though the latter is certainly not necessary)."
