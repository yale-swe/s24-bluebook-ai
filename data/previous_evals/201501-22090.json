    "Take this class! The readings are seriously great and don't feel like homework at all (Junot Diaz, Dany Laferriere). Professor Ramirez is extremely passionate about the subject matter and makes the 2 hour seminar time fly by. Course load is super manageable 2 short papers (3-5) and one final 8-10 page paper with no outside research. This course is a gem."
