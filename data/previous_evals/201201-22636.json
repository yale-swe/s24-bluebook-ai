   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend it for Architecture majors or maybe Art majors.",
    "Yes, take it even if you're not interested in architecture. It certainly teaches you how to draw architecture but also to have a critical eye. Even if you don't have any drawing experiences, don't be scared to take the class. It will be tough at first and the results are rewarding. It also doesn't hurt that Victor is a great person.",
    "A lot of work. Drafting takes forever.",
    "Only take architecture pre-reqs if you are certain you absolutely want to be a design concentration architect, or else you will be giving up EVERYTHING in your life for something you don't really want. Trust me when I say that taking this class and ARCH 249 means giving up your life; sleep, friends, and other classes included. (Sometimes it was even hard to find time to shower)",
    "This is an intensive drawing and drafting course, and I would recommend it only to those students who are either committed to pursuing the major or extremely dedicated to architectural drawing. The warnings people will give you are not exaggerations.",
    "Very challenging and very rewarding\u0097if you put a lot of work into it, you'll get a lot out of it, more so than with other classes. Weekly assignments that take up A LOT of time, increasingly time-consuming and technical. Awesomely awesome if you push yourself. Non-majors who take it often are the best-performing because they don't take it for granted. Recommend it highly if you want to improve your observation skills and hand. Don't take as \"a fifth class\", not worth taking CR\/D.",
    "Drawing Architecture takes an absurd amount of time and you basically improve through practice, though you should seek specific feedback from TAs and Victor- knowing what to focus on in your next drawings help a lot. A lot of freehand- which depending on how you look at it is either more exciting than drafting or really annoying. If you are an architecture student, you are obviously taking this course. If you aren't, I would only recommend it if you are extremely interested in learning to represent space through drawing.",
    "Tons of work. You'll improve purely through repetition, though VIctor really pushes you to think critically about the projects.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn a new style of drawing. I would not recommend it to someone who has developed a style of drawing they are comfortable with and do not wish to change.",
    "Drawing Arch is a lot of work, and a lot of hard work. It's rewarding to see all of your drawings at the end of the year, though. Start the assignments early.",
    "Yes, but only if you are willing to put in the work, as it gets a bit overwhelming at the end of the semester. The first half of the semester is devoted to representational drawing and learning the different architectural drawing conventions. The second half is devoted to drafting, which is very time consuming and mentally strenuous.",
    "If you really like drawing and measuring a lot. I learned a lot through this class, even though we never were explicitly taught the how-to in drawing. We were expected to jump in and draw, which was fine, except sometimes I felt I was being judged too early and that made me enjoy the drawing less. The expectations were pretty high and the workload was often a burden. When I got in the mode though, the drawing was really enjoyable and relaxing. Even drafting was fun when in the zone.",
    "Well if you want to major in architecture you kinda sorta have to take this class. If you are not considering the major then some other drawing class might suit your needs better. It takes A LOT OF time.",
    "If you don't worry too much and have fun, you'll have a good time.",
    "I really enjoyed this class at times, and I really resented it sometimes too. It's a whole lot of work, which you'll come to expect if you plan on being an architecture major. But if you put in the (significant) time and energy, both on-site and often all through the night in studio, the results are worth it. This is definitely a class that's more about effort than natural drawing talent. Anyone can do very well in this class, and the people who did the best were not the \"most talented\" drawers, but the ones who put in the most time and hard work. To do well in this class, you should be prepared to rigorously pay attention to detail, but you should also take risks and dare to be a little innovative. Victor and our TAs always appreciated a new and creative take on assignments. All in all, I definitely feel like my drawing skills (or at least my willingness to sit down and draw...for long hours if need be) improved over the course of this semester.",
    "If you are an architecture major, relax enough to realize how amazing this class is.If you are not an architecture major, seriously consider taking this class. It is more an experience than a class. It is intense, it is time consuming, you will pull multiple all-nighters, you may let your other coursework slide a little bit in order to finish your drawings. But you will learn how to draw, and you will learn how to look at and visually dissect buildings, and you will learn to better appreciate all of the great buildings of Yale Campus, which you will spend many hours drawing. You should be ready to give yourself fully to the class and its assignments, but it will definitely be worth it.Also, Victor Agran is an incredible teacher and lecturer. His enthusiasm for architecture, his wit, his critical eye, his willingness to help students, and his ability to inspire students to continually strive to outdo themselves make the class what it is."
