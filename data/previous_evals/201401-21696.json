   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class if it is not required for you major.",
    "Obviously, only take it if you're BME. BUT, this class is not nearly as bad as what people have made it out to be. Sure, the psets take a long time to complete, but the material is all really interesting if you take the time to delve into it. It is also really useful stuff. Professor Carson definitely really cares about his lecturing. The tests are ridiculously hard though (mostly b\/c they kind of just test random stuff so you don't know what to expect). It is a tough class, but try to learn from it, and it is by far not the worst class you'll take at Yale.",
    "You are probably taking it because you have to. This class will be hard and obscure. Don't be in depressed though, because every one is in the same boat. Try to learn from doing psets. Go over class materials. Don't stress out too much. I know it's hard not to, but really, everyone is in the same boat.",
    "Be prepared to learn a lot more math than you want to. The midterm and final are very difficult and you don't get much practice for them. The psets aren't too bad in general and if you need tips, go to section where the TAs will point you in the right direction.",
    "This class is super hard and I would only advise taking it if You have to. The psets are long, the exams are hard, it just covers difficult topics. But I did feel like I learned a lot in the class that I wouldn't have otherwise. As background, I had no experience coding or with any program similar to Matlab, but I had taken ENAS 151 and ENAS 194 (multivariable calc and diff eq).",
    "I really liked this class. Professor Carson is pretty cool and the problem sets are fun to work through. I'm pretty sure I will be able to apply what I've learned in this class to real life - crazy!",
    ":(",
    "If you put on the work early, it's probably not so bad. At first the class seemed insurmountable because it's almost like learning a new language, but if you make an effort read Carson's notes it's probably manageable.",
    "This class is fast paced, introduces numerous mathematical concepts and teaches some MATLAB programming along the way. The problem sets are doable, but the Midterm and Final are very challenging. Overall, the course attempts to cover too much material too quickly which gives a superficial knowledge of mathematical concepts and programming skill.",
    "This is a fast-paced course. Knowing statistics beforehand is a big plus.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to. The problem sets are challenging, but I found that I learned the most from doing these and they provided good preparation for the midterm\/final. Bulk up your grade as much as possible in the first half of the semester. After the midterm, the pace of the course really picks up speed and the final is quite challenging, so just be prepared.",
    "Introduction to Biomedical Computation didn't really feel like an \"intro\". It is an extremely faced pace Matlab\/statistics course. Prepare to be confused a lot of the time and to work really hard. I would probably not recommend it, but I imagine most people will taking it because it's required. There is definitely some satisfaction from finally getting code to work, but there is a lot more frustration and utter bewilderment. To succeed you have to push yourself to pay close attention and stay on top of the material. If not, good luck.",
    "If you are interested in MATLAB and using computers for data analysis and model building then I absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Overall, this class is useful, if your work will involve computation or BME. Many of the examples were fun, but the multiple units of high-level statistics could be brutal, especially with MATLAB implementation. This class covers a LOT of material, and the exams can be quite difficult. Problem sets took anywhere from 4-10 hours, and they did not really prepare you for the exams. It is required if you are a BME major, but do not take this course casually.",
    "BENG 249 is an incredibly useful course that provides students a toolkit on how to use MATLAB in data analysis. I felt like it was very important to learn statistics and modelling, which are useful in any lab work. Lets be honest, any class teaching the basics for modelling and computation will be difficult to students if it is at all useful. BENG 249 is difficult, but the T.A.s and Professor are incredibly helpful (make sure to ask questions during class!) and want to help you understand the relevance of the topics. Make sure to start your Problem Sets ahead of time, they are long and doing them after class will help solidify the important parts of lecture.",
    "Yes - this course is a valuable primer that provides the more technically-oriented foundation that characterizes BME. You'll learn Matlab, some statistics, and some basic modelling. The lectures move quickly and can be confusing but help is available through TA sections. Office hours aren't a bad idea to go to either. Carson cares about his students and the smaller class size is a welcome change from the hundred+-person-lecture BME prerequisites. One of the harder classes in the major but very worthwhile.",
    "This class is stats, then matlab, then little to no bio material. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but no one taking this class is taking it because they want to. it's because they need to!"
