    "If you want a great WR course that covers the jungle & clash between the civilization and the savage take this course. You will leave with a greater appreciation for the authors and for the themes that are covered in this class.",
    "Wonderful class and a good cursory literature class for those who haven't taken one yet.",
    "Yes--I would absolutely recommend SPAN 393 to another student who is interested in learning about this genre of books (and films).",
    "An excellent literature course, however there is a lot of reading.",
    "Laid back course, interesting readings. Worth it.",
    "This class was great! A wonderful core seminar for literature majors or just a great class for anyone to take. My one warning is that there was not a lot of opportunity for student participation when discussing the texts even though this was supposed to be a seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Be prepared for a few uncomfortable comments from the professor (he has an antiquated machisto perspective), but this was an easy WR credit with really great literature to read. I hadn't considered \"jungle books\" as a sub-genre, but I loved all the novels I read for this class and I learned what to look for when I read."
