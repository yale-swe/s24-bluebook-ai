    "It's a great class with a great teacher. It's very easy after a light fellowship summer in Beijing. Though the workload is light, the material is still interesting and you maintain your Chinese. There's no reason not to take this class.",
    "I'd recommend it if you need to maintain your current level of Chinese. It wasn't too difficult and the teacher was very understanding.",
    "Take CHNS 154 if you want a laid-back Chinese class that doesn't kill you with homework and vocab. It was very enjoyable and the workload was definitely manageable. Shen Laoshi is an awesome teacher!",
    "Yes",
    "Shen laoshi is great. The material is interesting. And even though you won\u0092t be speaking Chinese often with class only three times a week, the workload is much more manageable than lower level courses. Take it."
