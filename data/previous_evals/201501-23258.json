    "Take it if you took SPAN 130 or if you tested in and want to study Spanish. The class is really good and honestly pretty engaging most of the time. It's not a huge workload but there's definitely some stuff you have to do every night.",
    "You probably won't take it if you don't have to, but I did. It was fine, but class every day was annoying. I'd actually recommend it a lot more than other classes at Yale, but only if you have a good teacher like Veronica or Diego.",
    "Spanish 140 is a solid L4 class! It meets every day, so be prepared to spend a lot of time with the material and your classmates. Homework is manageable - daily assignments, a couple of presentations, and studying for tests and exams. And the readings are pretty interesting!",
    "Spanish 140 10 really helped me to improve my language skills. My only caution is that this course is very time and labor intensive. It was not easy to fit this course into my schedule as a graduate student. Graduate students shouldn't take this course unless they are serious about learning the language."
