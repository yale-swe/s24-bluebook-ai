    "I would indeed recommend it to anyone that wants a more mathematical exposition of microeconomics. Homework was relatively easy and of reasonable length. If you understood most of the proofs from lecture, the midterms were easy--that would be a guaranteed 75 points or so. The course seemed a little disorganized at the end, but that's fine. If you have a background in math, particularly very basic real analysis, the course will be fine, and probably still so even if you don't have the background. Though, I must say, I can imagine certain results\/proofs will be confusing to those that don't know very basic real analysis (for instance, a proof might appeal to the fact that a continuous function attains a maximum on a compact set, etc. While not hard, and rather intuitive, I can see how someone would be confused seeing it in a proof).",
    "A good intermediate micro course. Building up the formalism for most of the semester was very dry and at times frustratingly so, but the last few weeks of the course (monopolies, oligopolies, auctions, public good provision) were legitimately fascinating. And in the meantime, psets are very quick, exams aren't too challenging, and section is largely unnecessary. If you have a stronger mathematical background, you can more or less get by on that alone, even if your economics background is weak. Prof. Faingold is kind and genuinely interested in the education of his students, and his weekly posting of lecture notes and slides is a lifesaver.",
    "Very difficult with a steep learning curve. First half of the semester was mostly math, and the second half of the semester was more focused on familiar topics in econ. It didn't seem like there was much connection between the earlier problem sets and the lectures\/section, but this got better as the semester went on. Professor Faingold is very willing to review topics in his office hours. Midterms and the final were not as difficult as the problem sets, but there's little direction as to what to study or how to prepare. This class makes sense if you're interested in Econ\/Math, Applied Math, etc.",
    "Mathematically based course in microeconomic theory beginning with primitive models in preference and utility, to consumer and production theory, uncertainty, risk, expected utility, general equilibrium, public goods, auctions, and more. Definitely recommend.",
    "This class was extremely interesting and learning about the mathematical principles underlying microeconomic theory was very rewarding. Furthermore, Prof. Faingold was very willing to work with students to help them learn the material. However, the class moves very quickly and, at times, Prof. Faingold did not seem to have a great understanding of what was confusing to us, versus what we already knew. Overall, however, the course improved throughout the semester and since this was the first year Prof. Faingold taught this class, I think it will be much better next year. That being said, know that this is a difficult class that requires strong math skills and that will be frustrating at times, regardless of the strength of your math background.",
    "This was an interesting course. On one hand, at times it was tremendously frustrating. On the other hand, it ended on a positive note. This course suffers from a bit of an identity crisis, and this is partially because the same person has not taught it consistently and it is not exactly clear what the purpose of the course should be. Strengths: Eduardo is a really caring person once you talk to him and does care about students. There is interesting material (especially at the end) and it felt like once he got a better feel for the class he got better at picking the correct material to teach and how to teach it. It was especially useful when he started a) posting notes on the website, and b) making nice slideshows you could review from class. weaknesses: I hesitate to be too critical because I really felt like once Prof. Faingold got a feel for the class it got better. However, there were lots of things like homework assignments that were far too difficult and that had problems that we really shouldn't have been able to solve based on what we had learned. I love a challenging problem, but if he could look and make sure this is not the case ahead of time (so we are actually getting something out of doing these tedious problems) that would be much appreciated. Nothing is more frustrating than having lots of work and then having a terribly hard pset that is in the end declared too difficult to solve. The tests were weirdly graded and not exactly useful (except for the final) in testing us on material we had actually learned. Additionally, it was very frustrating to have a textbook that was different from the notation used in class, and also not used for all of the course. This, along with the unclear expectations on homework made it very confusing and difficult to complete assignments (for the first 2\/3 of the course). Additionally, this course scared away lots of people so it was essentially a very difficult course with a curve with 13 students, which is just a terrible formula for working together etc which i wish the econ department would fix."
