   "comments": [
    "A great introduction to the foundations of early learning (language, literacy, and play). It is great to be able to observe in the classrooms and it allows you to really understand the material of the class in action.",
    "A good class, plan to wake up early to make the trip up to Calvin Hill (twice a week). The two professors are extremely knowledgable and have an incomparable amount of institutional knowledge between them. Class can sometimes amount to interesting lecturers from noted professionals in the field, which was a great opportunity to learn about different perspectives on this topic but sometimes felt a bit disorganized",
    "take it to observe children developing! don't take it if you're looking to learn about developmental psychology or linguistics.",
    "Language, Literacy, and Play was without doubt the most memorable and satisfying course that I have so far taken at Yale, and I would heartily recommend it to another student. The syllabus explores the process by which young children first develop linguistic skills, focusing on play as the medium that instills children with the foundational experiences they need to communicate and be literate. Beyond the fascinating syllabus, however, what truly marks this course as unique is that all students are required to observe for two hours per week at the Calvin Hill Daycare Centerin the three-year-olds' classroom, preschool, or kindergarten. Spending such extensive time with young children is a invaluable experience. If they enter into this process with an open mind, students can become deeply attached to their classroom community; the children begin to await the students' weekly visits, to learn their names, and to ask them to play or read with them, and the teachers also value having an additional adult presence in the classroom. In all the busyness of a Yale semester, to have the opportunity to enter this dynamic space and to watch young children grow and explore the world for the first time is a beautiful and memorable way to decenter oneself, to think about one's surroundings from a new perspective. All that said, I would caution that the students who will take the most out of this course are those who genuinely enjoy spending time and working with children. Still, that does not mean that extensive prior experience with children is necessary. Prof. Close and Prof. Horwitzin addition to the children and daycare center teachers themselvesprovide students with the initial support and \"training\" that students need to feel comfortable in the classroom. Additionally, the content of this course and experience with working with the children are such that they can appeal to an array of subjects and majorsfrom psychology, to literature, etc. I have to say that as this semester comes to a close, I am sad to think that my time at Calvin Hill has (at least for now) come to a close; I will definitely look back on this course as one of the highlights of my undergraduate career.",
    "I do not recommend this class. I don't understand the previous years' rave reviews. It does not actually teach you how to be a good parent\/educator\/person. I thought the readings are dull and the class sections are not that useful. The goals of the course are not clear, and most of the arguments are not very scientific. You do observations at the daycare center, which are fun (you see first-hand how to do good early child-hood education, and you get to hang out with the kids) and do teach you a lot about early childhood education, but the learning is all experiential. The classroom portion of this class consists of lectures on early childhood education, and I found it hard to engage with the material. Overall, I thought the class was not worth the effort."
