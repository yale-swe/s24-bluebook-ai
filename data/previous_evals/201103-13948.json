   "comments": [
    "Bi-weekly meetings, usually one used to critique weekend assignments and the other to do in-class observational paintings. Occasional slideshows and palette demonstrations.It is a good class if one wishes to have an organized framework with which to paint, but critique sessions were mostly lengthy and unhelpful. The instructor did not motivate the students much, and the time I spent painting out-of-class was much more enjoyable than any time spent in-class.",
    "More work than a gut class, but still easily doable, even if you have never painted before. Also, if you haven't painted before, it can be a little intimidating. Definitely would recommend. Lots of fun.",
    "Yes but realistically it would not make a whole lot of sense to take this as a fifth class. It's a great fourth class particularly because it is a different kind of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great art class to take, even if you have never considered yourself to be an artist. You will grow a lot as a painter and see the world with a much more artistic eye.",
    "No. The workload is very heavy, so if you're taking other classes with a big time commitment, then you might want to reconsider taking this class.",
    "Great class, but a huge time commitment. Do not take this class if you are have a heavy science\/QR schedule. The feeling of accomplishment after the long haul makes the struggle worth it - but you shouldn't have to your performance in other classes for the sake of painting. The constantly changing schedule was confusing at times. The class materials cost was also a lot higher than advertised in online course schedule. The final project was difficult and time-consuming when preparing for finals, which was difficult as the other section only had to do one painting (we did five). The class itself was extremely satisfying - everyone enrolled at different levels of experience, and everyone dramatically improved by the end of the semester.",
    "You will definitely become a better painter if you take Painting Basics, no matter your initial skill level. Painting is like practicing an instrument or a foreign language\u0097you have to keep working on it to get better. The projects are pretty open ended, but not so much so that you would feel lost if you don't yet have \"a vision.\" It is a fun class, if not life-changing.",
    "The class is a great introduction to painting for both students experienced and otherwise. The assignments can take up a fair amount of time outside of class, but they are generally enjoyable and offer a nice break from the typical homework of other courses. I was impressed by how the assignments offered a fair amount of creativity and flexibility but were still specific enough to get across a particular concept or challenge.",
    "A great painting class to take."
