   "comments": [
    "take it if you can! Don't be afraid of the extra hours in the studio",
    "Yes, it's a fun course, but other students must be aware that you need to be prepared to devote a lot of time to paint.",
    "Yes! You spend a lot of time working (At least like 5 hours per homework assignment) but it's relaxing becasue you have your own studio space, and fun when your other classmates are there!",
    "Do it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While the workload sometimes felt difficult, I came into the course with no art, drawing or painting ability whatsoever and now feel like I understand the concepts of color and value and can actually feel a sense of control in my painting. In terms of workload, there is usually one painting to be done for homework per week. While the work can be a lot, it is fairly consistent throughout the semester which means that you don't end up with work piling up at the end of the term. Natalie was a great teacher and I would definitely recommend her course to anyone who has the opportunity to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class. If you are looking for an INTRO painting class, as in you've never painted before, this is the one to take. It moves pretty quickly, but you get a great introduction to lots of different elements of painting.",
    "Painting Basics is a wonderful class if you are looking to learn some techniques and to find a great creative outlet. The homework is completely manageable and the material is fun and interesting. Overall great course!",
    "The class was very enjoyable, but at times it was frustrating because there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much teaching: more of just guidelines for what your paintings could or could not have. Producing art in itself can be very frustrating too. Having studio time and a place to produce was very nice though, and I recommend everyone to try to take an art class at some point in their life. Producing is a completely different mindset and can be very relieving and relaxing from the psets, midterms, papers, etcetera that we get bombarded with from other classes. As a side note, it can be kind of expensive: taking the class itself costs $75 or $85 from your student account, and on top of that expense, you have to go and buy all your supplies, which is ~$100, give or take $50 depending on what quality supplies your instructor expects\/you want.",
    "Great intro painting class! It was a lot of work outside of the designated class time but it was so worth it! My paintings improved so much over the course of the semester.",
    "Black and white still-lives, collage, color still-lives, color nudes, landscapes, self-portraits.",
    "I would definitely recommend Painting Basics. Like any other art class you have to dedicate a lot of time outside of class to your work but whether you are a more experienced painter or a beginner it's a great way to get some visual art into your schedule.",
    "This class is so much fun. I already had experience painting, but I do feel like I improved my skills in class. You are expected to paint outside of class, but it doesn't feel like work."
