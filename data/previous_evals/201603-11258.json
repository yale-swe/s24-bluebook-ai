    "This has been a great class for developing my ability to perform mathematical proofs, think rigorously and originally about mathematics, and examine a lot of the theoretical underpinnings of mathematics. Set theory is indispensable for anybody looking for an entry point into the philosophy of mathematics.",
    "I learned the basics of set theory and how to think about other areas of math using sets.",
    "I gained introductory knowledge of Set Theory and proof-based math, some insight into the history and foundation of mathematics, and an important but distinct method of critical thinking and problem-solving.",
    "Interesting exploration of the foundations of math.",
    "The main takeaway from this course was how to write proofs in set theory. Style, precision, and protocol were emphasized even though we didn't get far in the content.",
    "You really get good at doing proofs in this class."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting material, doable workload Weaknesses: Course moves far too slowly, didn't cover a lot of useful and interesting information from the textbook",
    "Strengths: Good textbook, and lectures work well in synergy with the readings (cover slightly divergent subjects or approach the same subjects from a different angle, but strictly speaking you could probably learn everything for the course just from lectures). Professor is a real expert. Weaknesses: Assessment of work is kind of unpredictable. Grading is very harsh and it was difficult to know how to improve. Exams are similarly hard to study for, although the take-home format ended up mitigating that.",
    "The course is taught in a logical way, starting with axioms and building up. The class moves slowly, but I don't think that's a problem.",
    "This course closely followed the textbook, which was appreciated and incredibly helpful for the psets and studying. Sometimes I could have used more direction in class: I wasn't always sure how the particular proof we were doing pertained to the larger picture presented in the textbook or in past\/future lectures.",
    "Reasonable workload. Very interesting material. At times the subject can be frustratingly rigorous",
    "Set Theory is a great way for logically-inclined people who aren't as comfortable with foreign notation to push themselves because proofs rely on expounding upon a few basic premises and can be written in plain English. Teaching was not great. Learn to love your textbook. Pset grading is very harsh.",
    "Class lectures are sometimes off topic from what we are covering in the book."

   "comments": [
    "This course is not very hard and is does not cover a lot of material. I would recommend this course to students who know what they are getting into with regard to these aspects and still are interested.",
    "I would recommend this course without reservations to any student - studying mathematics or otherwise - if the grading were less harsh\/more transparent. Given the current structure of the course, I would recommend this course to anybody with the mathematical\/logical background to take it, but I would not, for example, recommend it to students who are interested in the philosophy of mathematics but have a minimal mathematical background.",
    "I would recommend this course to math interested students. However, if you have a lot of math experience, it may be too easy for you.",
    "It's an interesting proof-based class, but I would only recommend it if someone has already shown particular interest in this subject matter. Otherwise it is a lot of work and, depending on your comfort with proof-based math, difficult to grasp.",
    "Yes",
    "Don't take this course unless it's required for your major.",
    "A fine course to learn about set theory. Many peers who hadn't done proofs (or much math) struggled. Perhaps if it were harder and more in-depth it would attract more math majors and be less bimodal in its students.",
    "I took this for my major. Having said that, I think Zuckerman is a great teacher and its a interesting subject."
