    "This was a terrible class. As someone who likes Spanish and was taking the class for fun (not for credit), I was utterly disappointed. This class flies through material, without much time to stop and appreciate it. It is also WAY more work heavy than L1; except 1.5 hours of homework most nights, and 3-5 hours on the weekends, along with 9 assessments sprinkled throughout the semester. This class is a huge time vampire, and while you will \"learn\" (perhaps not understand, but learn) a lot of grammar, there is almost no time to actually speak in class, so most people left the class knowing a lot of grammar, but still being unable to speak at a fourth grade level. If you're taking this purely for credit, it's fine, but buckle up for a lot more work than L1...",
    "It's really difficult to get an A. Do not take this class thinking it will be easy to get an A. Juliana is a very hard grader and will make your life hard.",
    "It is a continuation of Spanish 110 with more focus on listening and reading than grammar. Yes.",
    "An excellent continuation of learning Spanish. Solidifies old grammar techniques and introduces the rest of the basics (presumably to be worked on more in 130). Expands vocab further, etc.--what you'd expect out of a continuation of 110. As for recommending it, I mean, it's necessary if you want to keep learning Spanish. Definitely does its job. Rather time-intensive (given five class days a week and a moderate to heavy level of homework), but the time is necessary to really internalize the grammar.",
    "Don't take it unless you feel comfortable with introductory\/basic spanish already. The courses are not goof for people that come straight from L1 because there is no time to practice the key concepts learnt.",
    "If you're reading this, you probably have to take L2 anyway. Given that, definitely pick Juliana. She's funny, engaging, and she knows how to teach. She won't let you coast by without learning, which can be annoying at times but mostly keeps you on your toes.",
    "This is an essential part of the language requirement that prepares you for all the higher level classes very well. Aside from being a requirement, I definitely recommend it."
