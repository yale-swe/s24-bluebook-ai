   "comments": [
    "A good first class for potential EVST majors. There are two routes for this class: you are genuinely interested in the subject and you go to every lecture and do all the readings, which will end up pretty rewarding and challenging. Or, you take it Cr\/D, in which case you don't really have to show up to lectures or do the reading for section, just show up for section and do the two essays and two tests.",
    "An interesting class overall- great basis for understanding the origins of conservation and environmentalism. It's a lecture class- but there were about 20 people total. I'd recommend it- plus, I heard it gets better every year.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in the subject. I was, and I thoroughly enjoyed the readings and the class. However, don't take it if it does not interest you, because the class could potentially get very boring. Sabin isn't the best lecturer I've had, but he isn't bad. With a paper and a final, it is a fair amount of work, but not overwhelming.",
    "Great class if you want a broad intro to environmental history. Prof Sabin is a great lecturer, slides only include pictures, but he gives you a sheet of notes every class. Tons of information in this class and also a semi-heavy load of reading (all of which is not necessary to do). Good for an intro class, not so good if you really want to get in depth. 1 small paper, 1 10pg research paper, and a midterm and final. Work load isn't overwhelming.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. If you want to know the history of the States in an environmental context from the 1500s to the present this is the way to go.",
    "A good class for understanding the broad arc of American environmental history over the past 500 years. It covers a lot, but is useful for providing context for a lot of environmental events. Overall, good. I would recommend it if you are looking for this kind of understanding--especially useful for EVST major to put their own work into context.",
    "This class is not worth it. There is way too much reading, and the lectures aren't as interesting as you would hope.",
    "This is a really good class if you love the environment and history. The class takes American history and describes it in terms of how humans have interacted and changed their surrounding environment to suit the needs of \"progress\". There's not that much work and the readings are really fun and interesting. The only problem is that the professor talks really fast during lecture and his slides are only pictures so you have to be prepared to take notes. Other than that it's a great class.",
    "This is a MUST TAKE COURSE for anyone interested in the fate of humanity and the planet Earth, whether environmentalist or not. The context of global warming, energy crisis, daily consumption, and overpopulation applies to everyone. This course provides the history of America's interaction with nature since the 1500s, presented in modern literature, news paper articles, history textbooks, vivid powerpoints, documentaries, songs, comics, and intimate discussions. The reading is demanding but the grading very fair, and the lessons are undoubtedly compelling. You begin to see the power of man's philosophies, inventions, and dominance within nature in a completely new light.",
    "The is an ultimate Hu credit. The midterm is a joke - Sabin gives you a list of all the IDs you need to know, then picks a few. Our class used an email panlist, where each person researched two or three IDs and shared them, which made it even easier to study for. Going to class is probably helpful, but if you happen to miss a few, Sabin makes a great handout for each lecture which he posts online. The research paper is also a really nice assignment. It's only 8 to 10 pages, and you are given total freedom on your topic. The only things you need to be careful of are the massive amounts of reading and the surprisingly difficult essays on the final.",
    "This was a great survey class. Lectures are interesting and the readings are awesome (for the most part). I would recommend it.",
    "GREAT course. I definitely recommend it. You really don't have to do the readings as well...",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to everyone at Yale. I think that the material presented in this course is stuff everyone needs to be exposed to in order to lead an environmentally-conscious life. The class will expose you to a TON of information, and you will learn so much, whether you try to or not. The lectures requires good note-taking skills so that you can reference your notes later when it comes time to study for exams. The research paper requires a good amount of time, but since you can pick basically any topic that interests you, it should be an engaging and rewarding assignment.",
    "don't let this be the first environmental course you take if you are thinking about majoring in it. weiss's global environmental history is much better. this is more history than environment.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class. It is interesting and very applicable to everyday topics. I look at history in an entirely different way now."
