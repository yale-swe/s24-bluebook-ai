    "I learned not only SO much about Borges, but a lot of intellectual and Argentine history as well.",
    "Mastery and extense knowledge on the works and ideas of Borges.",
    "I learned how to tackle Borges' work by contextualizing him within the time of his work. Prof. Gonzlez Prez did a great job in providing historical background for all the stories we read--bringing in philosophers, literary movements, political happenings and other authors Borges interacted with. I was pressed to write a 15 page paper in Spanish, which led me to research some of Borges' work greatly in-depth.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about Borges' life along with his writing style.",
    "Writing in Spanish. Deep literature analysis.",
    "I learned about Borges and Spanish literature",
    "I was exposed to a variety of different texts from Jorge Luis Borges as well as the historical narrative of his life.",
    "I learned how to critically read and write in Spanish.",
    "I gained great insight into the art-form of the short story in general and of Jorge Luis Borges in particular. This class made me a better critical reader.",
    "A great introduction to the works of Borges as well as interesting ways of interpreting his symbolism in a modern context."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Gonzlez not only knows SO much about Borges, but loves the material. His excitement is so evident, and it is a pleasure to listen to him talk. The course is not hard: the readings are light, and there are three quizzes, a midterm, and a final essay. The quizzes can be tricky, but you soon get the hang of it. The essay was fun to write, and if you go to Prof Gonzlez's office hours he will be quite helpful and give you many suggestions. A weakness is that it is easy to fall behind, as participation is not required. The course is advertised as a seminar, but in reality it is far more of a lecture - though a great one at that.",
    "Strengths: read many stories of Borges Weaknesses: not go too in depth in stories, so not engage in in-depth analysis in class",
    "Strengths: Prof. A.G.P. (approachable and entertaining), selected readings, small class but not huge pressure to participate, Weaknesses: If you don't start the paper ahead of reading week, it's probably not very fun",
    "Prof. Gonzlez is one of the most enthusiastic professors I've ever met. He does a great job selecting the material to be read and makes sure to create an interesting conversation in every class.",
    "would likely be better in a seminar (would facilitate more conversation, sharing, in depth analysis of scenes in the texts) but if it had been a seminar I likely would not have gotten in. so hard to say.",
    "The readings are amazing. One of e best authors I have ever read.",
    "Strengths: very interesting subject and lectures, Weaknesses: didnt tend to work as a seminar",
    "The professor is a HUGE strength. Professor Gonzalez is great and very passionate about the subject. Although, the class isn't very conversation and discussion heavy which is a huge weakness. It felt very lecture like even thought it's a small class.",
    "This is an excellent course that needs no improvement.",
    "Although the class was marketed like a seminar, it felt a lot more like a lecture. That's not necessarily a bad thing because Prof. Gonzlez always had really interesting things to say, but at times it was difficult to engage with in-class discussions because they felt one-sided."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wanted to not only read but learn about Borges. The best part of the class is, without a doubt, doing the Borges readings - which are usually just short stories. With each week, I felt equipped to better understand the content I was reading due to our class discussions. It is really gratifying to only read work by one author all semester, as by the end, you feel like you really can say a lot about them. Professor Gonzlez is also so knowledgable, enthusiastic, and kind. He teaches us not only about Borges himself, but really focuses on intellectual history of the late 19th\/early 20th centuries - and even before! - to help us understand Borges' works and references, which was also great to learn about. The workload is light, so it would be a great 5th class. Just know that if you want to practice speaking in Spanish, this is not the right course for you, as it is effectively a lecture and not a seminar.",
    "Yes, great class to develop an overall understanding of Borges and his works.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in Borges or Latin American literature this is a great intro course. Class is not too hard and the professor is great. Definitely a enjoyable Spanish lit class that will not overload you with work.",
    "I would! I loved this class! Reading Borges was truly a treat and it's not an incredibly difficult class by any means either. It was a good balance of intellectual challenge when it came to quizzes, the midterm, and the final paper as well as enjoying to read fun literature!",
    "I would. I absolutely loved this course. For me, coming from a STEM and spanish double major, this was a great course to have in my schedule. I loved being able to read for class what I would have for fun. The workload wasn't heavy until the end of term paper, which took up much of my reading week. Other than that, I absolutely loved the class.",
    "certainly. hearing prof talk was a delight.",
    "Can be a bit dry at times, but Borges really is interesting. The class is more lecture than seminar, but Anbal is lovely.",
    "Yes. Borges is definitely worth reading but needs context and explanation to be understood.",
    "Yes! Borges is fascinating",
    "Absolutely. Professor Anibal really cares about his students. I really regret not going to office hours more than I did or participating as much.",
    "I would! I enjoyed the class and would take it again.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any Spanish-speaking student.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this to anyone with an interest in Borges or Latin American short fiction because all of the readings were immensely interesting and we managed to cover a lot of ground. The workload was never too difficult--just a reading or two per class--and the quizzes were nothing to stress over."
