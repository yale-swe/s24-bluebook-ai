   "comments": [
    "Great overview of the peace process, if you are into learning the very small details about what happened in the negotiations at various places along the way. The simulation exercise was a lot of work but really rewarding.",
    "TAKE THIS if you can get in. The best class I have taken at Yale - even if you do not know that much about the conflict (even close to nothing) this class is worth taking. Professor Muasher is a smart, sweet teacher who will share incredible first hand accounts of critical moments in the peace process. It is a class you won't soon forget!",
    "Professor Muasher has been at the forefront of the Middle East Peace Process since Madrid - you should take this class for his office hours alone. We read several books written by Palestinian, Israeli, American, and Jordanian negotiators, starting in 1991 and going to the present. We then drew from those readings to conduct a simulation of our own at the end of the course. The simulation, for which we had to prepare outside of class, sending memos and such during the month prior, was a really fun and different sort of class assignment. The reading is really interesting, and I learned a lot. This was Muasher's first time teaching the course so there were a few bumps, but I'm sure he'll have figured them out by the next round.",
    "Take it to learn about the peace process, if you want to work hard but be rewarded",
    "You learn about all the steps of the process, from the Madrid conference in '91 until the present, in all their details. The final project is a simulation where the different students have to take the role of the various players in the process to give a better feel for how negotiations actually work.",
    "If you are at all interested in Israel\/Palestine\/the Middle East, take this class! Despite the extensive history, Professor Muasher manages to infuse it with meaning derived from his personal experiences in seeking a solution to the conflict. The material is delivered and discussed in a completely unbiased way--all opinions are encouraged--and the simulation of peace negotiations at the end is truly unique.",
    "This was an excellent course. I think the students who were not as satisfied with it already knew a lot going into it - there is only so much one can hope to learn from a subject that is extremely \"hot\" and one has lots of expertise in it. Even so, I think given the limited time frame the simulation at the end was really rewarding and helped clarify many of the issues and positions related to the subject. Finally, professor Muasher is a sweetheart who really did give time to his students. Beware of the midterm essay though, as he is not unwilling to give low grades.",
    "This class is truly an incredible opportunity to gain a comprehensive and even objective perspective on the Arab-Israeli conflict. The simulation at the end of the semester was indisputably the most engaging academic exercise that I have participated in at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are prepared for a heavy workload.",
    "Provides a space to have an honest and direct discussion about normally charged issues. Expect to put in a lot of time and to get a lot out of it. Your classmates are knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, so you will benefit the most if you are already in these categories. Focuses on U.S.-mediated negotiations. Professor Muasher is an engaging teacher and truly an expert in his field.",
    "This was a great class! It was definitely very challenging. But I loved it. The professor did a wonderful job leading us and teaching us! He really got to know each and every one of us on a personal level which is something that rarely happens at Yale. The reading was definitely daunting, but I ended up really benefiting from it. Still, I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you don't already have a base level knowledge of the issues in the Middle East unless your really up for a challenge. This class was a lot of work, but very fulfilling.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in knowing more about the conflict. It covers the different peace attempts between Arab nations and Israel and shows the dynamic relationship between the countries.",
    "Definitely! There's a lot of reading and other work, but if you're engaged and interested in the conflict there's almost no better class. The negotiation simulation at the end of class was great. Prof Muasher is encouraging and really wants everyone to progress and succeed in his class.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with a strong interest and a background in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
