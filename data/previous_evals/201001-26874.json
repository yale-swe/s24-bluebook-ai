    "Yes it's a great class if you have any interest in the Eurasia Steppe and Archaeology! If you don't have an interest in the class, if might be difficult to get through the mounds of articles. Other than that it's a great class, and I always looked forward to the next session.",
    "It is a great class that focuses very specifically but gives you greater insight and thought in approaching much else.I would enormously recommend this class because of its organization, material and overall impact in your academic career.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The interactions with graduate students were really eye-opening for me, the material was interesting, the classes flew by, and the professor was wonderful. However, if you have NO interest in the material it probably isn't the right course.",
    "For sure, even if you don't have much interest in Eurasia, at least shop this class. Professor Honeychurch is a celebrity among those who know him and you should know him too!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend the course, especially if you are looking for a really fun and interesting introduction to some of the big themes and questions in archaeology. Professor Honeychurch is awesome too!",
    "Pretty good overview of where archaeology is now. Long final paper and lots of reading, but a good class."
