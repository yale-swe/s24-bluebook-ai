   "comments": [
    "I learned how to be a more critical consumer of both art and written art theory. I also learned many skills I can now apply to understand, compare, and write about intellectually challenging academic writings.",
    "Learned a lot on how to thoroughly read and reflect on dense texts. I've also never been exposed to art criticism, so that opened a new way of thinking about works of art and their relation to politics.",
    "This course immensely improved my ability to come up with a unique, complex argument presented using succinct language and strong evidence.",
    "This class taught me how to write more effectively and construct better arguments based on texts and pieces of literary\/art criticism.",
    "I learned to critically interpret and critique academic works in art theory and eventually make my own original contribution.",
    "You learn to tackle intense pieces with ease",
    "This class taught me about traditional art theories and we got to examine some great art scholars."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was very good at providing detailed feedback on my writing, and teaching me several ways to improve my thoughts and arguments. It also encouraged me to read with a more critical eye. The discussions were also very helpful toward understanding the material. However, this course could be improved with better structured writing workshops and more time to discuss some of the texts that we analyzed.",
    "Some of the readings felt a bit removed from the rest of the content, and the three thematic groupings felt rather arbitrarily chosen at times. On the other hand, the material was expertly delivered and dissected by the professor.",
    "The professor is always available to help you better in such an intense course",
    "I really enjoyed some of the texts we studied, especially those on contemporary art. Other texts, however, were much more difficult to understand and were very theoretical. The ready for this class was ongoing. I think this class could be improved by engaging more with artworks, and perhaps artworks in the Yale Art Gallery."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to improve your academic writing skills, then this course is an excellent fit. Not only are the topics interesting, but the readings and conversations are interesting and relevant.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, as you learn ways of looking at identity, mass culture and self-expression through art in different ways. It provides a very interesting base for thinking about art in its modern (political) context and touches on very complex ideas (i.e. commercialisation of art, art as a labour strike).",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to improve their writing and understanding of abstract art theory and criticism, but maybe not to someone who is looking for a course involving close analysis of specific pieces of art or artists.",
    "I would, but only one to whom critical analysis is especially attractive. It was very much so a preparation for that flavor of writing.",
    "Definitely. It helps you to understand the politics behind art",
    "I would recommend this course. The ongoing workload definitely did help to improve my essay writing and allowed me to become familiar with the expectations of formal argumentative writing. Going forward, I think this will definitely help when writing essays in other classes. I also found some of the readings very engaging and stimulating."
