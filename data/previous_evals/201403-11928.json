    "The Spanish faculty is the best, Spanish is awesome, take it. But if you're a freshmen start from L1.",
    "I would recommend taking this class with Pilar; I originally took it just to fulfill my language requirement but ended up really enjoying it.",
    "I would say that SPAN 120-03 is a solid class for improving conversational as well as grammar skills in Spanish. It also helps with reading and writing. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because even though class is five days a week, it doesn't feel like a chore. I always enjoyed attending class and now my Spanish has expanded so that my personality is able to come through more when I speak it.",
    "Yes, only if this is your language requirement though",
    "hard but pilar is the best!!",
    "Spanish 120 was much more intense than any Spanish class I've taken before. The professor was very good and I would recommend taking the class to another student.",
    "It does the job of improving your Spanish skills very well",
    "Spanish L2 is rewarding and gives you all you need to continue learning spanish by yourself. I can now read books like Harry Potter in spanish and I know most of the commonly used grammar."
