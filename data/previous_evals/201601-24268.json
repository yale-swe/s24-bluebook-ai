    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0I think he did a good job and provided helpful feedback on the written work I've done over the semester. He was also very helpful in discussing paper topics and in suggesting ways to narrow the focus or expand it by including more of Lewis' works.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Tyler could have included more reasoning behind his grading system, especially on the first paper, so students could bring those comments into consideration for the second paper.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Seemed engaged with the material. I did not have any interaction with him outside of class, but his comments in class were always helpful.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Tyler was largely quiet in class, and his job seemed mostly to grade papers for Beeley. I wish the expectations of the kind of paper they were wanting was more clear.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Tyler was a welcome voice in class discussion and frequently elevated the level of group discussion with his comments.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Though Tyler did not teach any of the classes, he did provide insight from time to time.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Tyler was super available to chat and left great notes on my paper. Really appreciated his comments in class, and he helped keep us all on track with his obvious knowledge and preparation.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Mr. Smith overlooked essential aspects of my first paper and assigned me a grade much lower than it deserved. I appealed the grade and walked him through each point, showing him the features of my paper that he overlooked. He acknowledged this and ultimately raised the grade half a step. However, when I asked him why the grade wasn't higher, he fabricated new reasons that were extremely vague, e.g. vividness of expression. When I asked him to please explain, he was very short with me, lied and said we had already discussed it (which we hadn't), and said if I want to pursue it any further, I should talk to Dr. Beeley. I had already been through so much with Tyler that I shouldn't have had to go through in the first place, that I just left it alone from there. Back when Tyler and I had met to discuss the things we *actually* discussed (rather than the things he claimed we discussed), he accidently admitted that my appeal of the grade made him defensive. Point by point, I showed him in my paper the very things that he said were absent. He could not respond except to say he would get back with me. Defensiveness is not the disposition of someone who can grade with integrity. Humility, fairness, and discernment are what's needed. I would have liked to give a positive review, but I must convey the things above in order to save other students from the experience that I went through with him. The behavior of these instructors does not effect only me, and I can only wonder how many students' grades suffer under their hand, while the students are too timid or intimidated to say anything about it.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Although Tyler did not loom as large as Prof. Beeley (as is expected in a class without a discussion section), his questions and discussion leadership were always stimulating and a great asset to the class.",
    "Instructor: Tyler James Smith \u00a0Very clear about everything, all expectations included. Was available for meetings RE: papers and general course progress. Contributed to class just the right amount, as well."
