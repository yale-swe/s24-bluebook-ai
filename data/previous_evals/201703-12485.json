    "Having the opportunity to learn how to read Being and Time and get used to its vocabulary is one \"skill\" which this course offered me. This course gave me the courage to face and refine my own religious convictions, to engage with it with newer eyes, and to be aware of how I as Dasein am always at issue. Every regional ontology and set of beliefs can be interrogated from an ontological perspective. I believe that that is one insight I have gained throughout the semester, and I could not have asked for more.",
    "Developed my conceptual thinking skills and my writing skills.",
    "Thorough understanding of Heidegger's Being and Time, the ideas that preceded the work, the context, the history, and the applicability of these concepts to other fields of study",
    "I learned to read a text extremely carefully. Heideggers writing is dense and difficult to understand, but this class shes some light on a strategic method of analysis.",
    "Close attention to philosophical argument; application of philosophical concepts to everyday life; intensive written engagement with a narrow question."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One issue which I have with the course is that there were no formal opportunities for a seminar-like discussion for graduate students. Logistically, I realize that this may be difficult, but it would have been tremendously helpful to have a non-Q&A-lecture forum where graduate students can attempt to vocally \"own\" their understanding of Being & Time. Also, while I understand Professor's Hgglund's insistence on a \"de res\" reading of Heidegger, often I feel that the lectures did not comport with close readings of the text. This would not be an issue, I believe, if the class was primarily about existential philosophy and time, perhaps treated thematically in relation to other authors, but it seems to me that some exegetical considerations cannot be brushed aside if the course promises to be about the book \"Being & Time\". For instance, the lectures neither went over the myth of Cura nor Heidegger's summary of Hegel's concept of time, and we only marginally touched upon Heidegger's conception of hermeneutics. Some attention to the rhetorical dimension of the work would have been valuable, I think, if we assume that philosophical truths (like literary ones) are inseparable from their form. Nevertheless, Professor Hgglund's decision to introduce Manchester by the Sea and Krapp's Last Tape to the curriculum was spot on. The two works of art were very illustrative, and I would encourage that future iterations of the class employ even more literary\/dramatic examples.",
    "I would have preferred more direct engagement with the text but I understand the benefits of the taken approach.",
    "There was too great an emphasis on the scheme prepared to help follow along with the reading.",
    "The structure and style of the lectures were very good and always highly engaging. Use of the schemas from the beginning helped to guide and clarify the reading. Answering questions helped to clarify ambiguities and make some of the material more relatable. Learning a bit more about the historical context of Heidegger's work and its interpretation by contemporary readers would have been useful."
