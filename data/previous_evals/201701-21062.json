   "comments": [
    "This was the hardest course I've taken at Yale, but it was also, I think, the best course I've taken at Yale. Prof. Levene expected really deep engagement with the text in seminar, but she was also an expert at leading discussion and asking questions that allowed students to think about how individual passages relate to each other and to broad themes of the course. The books are also wonderful, and I thought the course was well-designed in the arc it took through Plato, the Bible, Kant, Nietzsche and Heidegger. I was disappointed that we did not get to Derrida, but I understand that uncontrollable circumstances caused us to miss a couple of seminars.",
    "I had never taken a philosophy seminar prior to this course, so while it was a challenge I learned a great deal about how to think about philosophy. I learned how to interpret the work and philosophize on my own. I even learned how to find inconsistencies and parallels between different thinkers.",
    "Different perspectives on the development of modernity and how to find the truth.",
    "Above all, I learned to appreciate a different way to learn from a philosophy class, and a different approach to writing about philosophy. The texts are difficult, and answers are sham. The class purports no such thing; rather, it compels you to read and reread, and then to speak.",
    "I learned to write a philosophy paper, something my previous philosophy classes failed to teach me.",
    "This course presented us with really challenging texts, and under the guidance of Professor Levene, I learned how to approach a text that is difficult or inscrutable. Prof. Levene helped us find our way amidst difficult or convoluted jargon to gain a foothold and anchoring. Also, I learned about the development of metaphysics, from Plato and the bible to Kant and Nietzsche's Death of God, culminating in Heidegger. The array of texts gave me a variety of perspectives on the topic.",
    "I definitely gained greater insight into fundamental questions of philosophy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this class was excellent and does not need to be changed. The reading was the perfect amount, the essays were graded fairly, and the material was interesting. Professor Levene was engaging and was help to turn our class' half-baked ideas into real philosophy.",
    "The main thing that could be improved about this course is the amount of introduction\/\"setting up\" devoted to each thinker. When we got to Kant, Nietzsche, and Heidegger, I felt a bit lost as I was starting each reading. It would be helpful to have an idea of each thinker's project before we dove into the text, so that there is a mental framework into which to fit these complicated ideas.",
    "By Professor Levenes teaching style, the seminar is highly dependent on the engagement, participation, and awareness of the students of the point of learning in this particular fashion. Especially in the beginning, discussion would begin arbitrarily mid text and wander confusedly around before getting stuck somewhere. Ordinarily, I would say that added structure may benefit the class, yet it is now clear to me that such a strategy runs contrary to the aim of the class. Perhaps discussion may be more fruitful more often if an online response on Canvas is required weekly, something like the short papers that are meant to make the reading stick, but even shorter and focused on working out where to start and where to go within a text. That said, I would have appreciated greater feedback on essays; relative to other philosophy courses, comments were scarce and slightly abstruse.",
    "Strengths: Rigorous reading, great professor, multiple assignments which helped me hone my essay-writing skills. Improved: I would love if poetry could be incorporated as you mentioned had been done before, Professor Levene!",
    "The most recognizable strength of this course were the incredible knowledge of the professor and the familiarity they had with the text, enough to see where students concerns and questions were leading. However, one weakness with this class, or so I think, is that I fear that in the fear that they might impose views on students, or to deprive them of their own relationships with the text, they were hesitant to expound their own views and interpretations of the text. This is indeed a great quality for burgeoning students, but it is also nice to see where the professor stands on their relationship to the text as a person who has spoken and listened, to see where they came and how they got there. It allows the students to see a version of the trial, so to speak, and while I understand the possibility that a teacher's interpretation of the text can overwhelm, it can also be a nice sounding board to bounce off or compare ideas - a nice little island to venture to and fro with safety in what are dark and murky waters."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "10\/10 would recommend",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who really likes to think about the extremely big picture questions, such as what does it mean to exist and what is living and do we even know we are living. If you like these questions, you will like this course.",
    "A good choice for anyone interested in metaphysics\/morality. It is a true blend of philosophy and religious studies, so make sure that's a good thing and not a bad thing for you. Prof. Levene (who is very good, by the way!) allows her students to direct much of the discussion, which can be great if you have a lot of ideas\/things to say, but definitely forces you to work a little harder on your own. You'll probably want to take this only if you have some previous background in philosophy (1 or 2 courses is sufficient, though).",
    "Take the course if you care at all about the truth. You will read mainly Kant, Nietzsche, and Heidegger, with some Plato and the Bible in the beginning. Professor Levene is a fantastic seminar leader. Each class evolves organically and you will come out of each class with different perspectives on modernity and life in general.",
    "Each week until the deadline, I nearly dropped this course. Comments seldom related to each other, and if they did, they seldom went anywhere, at least in the beginning. Yet at some moment, I realized that the class had immense value because it wasn't run as lectures, or even most seminars, are. I would recommend the course and urge both patience and openness. The texts are carefully selected, but you may wish to visit office hours for a more direct interpretation than the task that befalls you in class.",
    "Prof Levene fosters great class discussions and if you speak with her about your writing will actually teach you to write a good philosophy paper. I highly recommend her class. One thing to note is that she has strong opinions about the texts, but as long as you know to stick up for your opinions in class, she'll respect that.",
    "Yes! Even if you aren't intuitively drawn to the readings, or haven't read the thinkers before, the course may help you gain an interest or even a passion for some of these works. I enjoyed thinking with the class and professor immensely. The 2h of class each week were some of the most stimulating and engaging (intellectually and emotionally) moments of my semester.",
    "Absolutely, granted they are interested in intermediate philosophy and metaphysics!",
    "Yes"
