    "Q10: This class is valuable for students with an interest in climate policy and students who wish to do a lot of policy analysis and memo writing.",
    "It was a useful class. Valuable to hear Dan's perspectives on how things happen or happened in DC, which is where I think he added most value.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students (if only Dan were teaching it again!). The class was well-structured--it started off a bit slower in the beginning and then progressed at a good pace later on. The problem set was actually quite useful for my learning, but it would have been nice to have had an extra week to complete it. Also, the guest speakers were interesting, and Dan made a serious effort to steer the topics of the class toward the interests of the students.",
    "Dan was an excellent Professor. I learned a significant amount from him. Unlike many other practitioners is class was NOT story time with Dan, and that is a good thing. Sometimes Dan was almost too knowledgable. He would often zoom passed my understanding on issues."

   "comments": [
    "The opportunity to write extensively on climate policy history and future solutions.",
    "Problem set was challenging and time intensive but useful.",
    "Dan's vast understanding on the material.",
    "Dan Lashof is great! He's extremely knowledgable, and very approachable. No other classes dealing with this course material, which is a shame that he was only here for one semester.",
    "During the semester, this was definitely my most challenging class. I often felt I was just doing my best to keep my head above water, but by the end of the semester I was surprised at how much more I understand about the key pieces of climate policy. I think the biggest realization of this happened in giving my presentation to the class. I now certainly appreciate the challenge of this class and how it allowed me to understand, and potentially participate in a sophisticated debate about climate policy (e.g. discussing price collars and floors, the pros and cons of offsets, whether the US is living up to its international commitments etc.)",
    "The insight of an experienced practitioner like yourself, the struggle of dealing with that problem set and satisfaction that came with completion, guest lecturers, and the off-the-cuff or ultra-current anecdotal material you brought to the table.",
    "Professor has excellent experience and great anecdotal stories. Really put the course materials into context!",
    "When we had discussions and Dan shared his personal experiences -- wish there was more of that."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "More preparation for the problem set would have been helpful to enhance the learning experience.",
    "Finding ways to get students to participate more. This is difficult sometimes but not impossible. It helped that student presentations were given in last few classes, as this engaged us pretty well.",
    "The one thing that I did not like was the last minute change to the syllabus to have student-led discussions. While I don't mind the student-led discussions, further advance notice would have been very helpful with all of the other things going on at the end of the semester.",
    "I thought we spent a little too much time on W\/M bill. It's a watershed bill and it showed us the a path toward comprehensive climate bill, but I felt like we could have moved through it a bit faster. The student presentations were interesting and perhaps it would have been better to organize them a bit sooner in the future.",
    "Dan's lectures are a bit arcane. Would be good to start the first 10 minutes with a very basic overview (no powerpoint, or minimal powerpoint) of the class topic, and then get into the details. Important to have the in depth knowledge, but sometimes its easy to get lost without a bigger picture.",
    "I felt as though the class was quite reticent in discussions for the first part of the semester, so I wonder if having student run classes earlier in the semester would be a good way to have people get more comfortable in class. In particular, I think it would be beneficial to have the students run classes dedicated to going through the details of the Waxman-Markey Bill. This would likely force students to dig into that material a bit more and have students visit office hours prior to the class they have been assigned to present.I felt that the problem set was way above my abilities, but also incredibly beneficial to learn. In the future, I think it would work better to have the same problem set assigned to us broken into three separate problem sets (one for each question). This would make the problem set more manageable, and allow for a learning curve. (Even if a student bombs the first problem set, they still have time to recover and feel they have developed the skill for searching for the appropriate data and more fully understanding the calculations.)",
    "The course covers an important topic, but from a teaching perspective it has a handicap in being a topic with limited history. So I would image that is restrictive on some level. In order to help work around this aspect, which I think indirectly affects student opinion about class while going through it, my suggestions are as follows:1.) I'm glad I was exposed to bills and international agreements, but I think reading less Waxman-Markey and others would be ideal if the point is to have discussion based on those readings. I'm sure others can do this, but I struggled to have discussion points to bring to class based off those readings, so perhaps less of those and a few more readings with perspective or commentary on those bills might spark better discussion.2.) I liked the guest lecturers. Having a couple more to add might be a nice way to bring in multiple perspectives\/discussion approaches when the topic itself is one that has its limits in terms of the history.3.) Maybe another week or two of global happenings could be interesting since it felt like we'd exhausted the US case a bit by the end (even though I'm sure we hadn't; just for variety's sake).4.) Refine the last group work yo had us do: I liked the last class lecture you gave, and I wonder in a sense if it could be the starting class, or come up sooner, and from that point onwards we think of the class and one group exercise to follow as a sort of lab inexploring new ideas. I know that our class presentations sort of do this but a group paper or lecture announced from the outset as one exercise where we're supposed to think of it as really lab-y and experimental, that we show you in advance so that you can provide suggestions on what kind of support material might be best, etc, could be a neat way to break free from disappointment of what's happened to date on this topic, and a way to take the optimsism of your last lecture and try to run with it.",
    "Class discussion was more difficult since many people were new to this topic.",
    "Could sometimes get too detailed and too specific into the bills. Instead of talking about what didn't work, I would have liked to spend more time talking about a path forward.",
    "Daniel Lashof is a very knowledgeable and personable instructor but some of the lectures were a bit dry. He brought in a guest lecturer that was a nice change of pace, but perhaps finding a different method to cover close readings of legislative texts would be good. The class has a broad range so I would still recommend it."

This would have enhanced the learning and made the class more interactive.Also, while we discussed anecdotal legislative dynamics, we did not discuss much theory on how the U.S. congress or presidency plays a role in policy creation. It may have been useful to develop this theoretical training more to talk about U.S. policy debate.",

I would suggest potentially more problem sets based on the readings to ensure more in-depth discussions. I might re-arrange the work in the class to look more like:\u0095 More frequent problem sets (I\u0092ve found students resent classeswith weekly problem sets). When they are not quantitative problem sets, a simple set of questions based on key points from the reading would be useful (and make that problem set due the day of that discussion).\u0095 One round of student-led classes early in the semester, in addition to student presentations at the end of the semester.\u0095 With the other added work, it might make sense to have only one midterm paper and one final paper.",
