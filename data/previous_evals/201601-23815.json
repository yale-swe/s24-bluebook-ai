   "comments": [
    "Good overview of important concepts in water chemistry.",
    "If you like environmental chemistry, this is the class for you. If you're interested in the environment and looking to better understand natural systems, this class would also be good for you, though it will be challenging. Generally, students found the class to be a lot of work, but everyone developed the skills necessary to solve these problems. I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in the material because of the great presentation of material by Desiree and the way the class is structured to ensure you master the material.",
    "An important and necessary course for student in Environmental Engineering fields. I would strongly recommend ENAS 638.",
    "A comprehensive overview of water chemistry. Difficult problem sets! But I liked that Desiree always balanced the hard science with bringing guest lecturers and talking about the real-world applications of what we were learning. Desiree is a great professor. I imagine it's difficult to bring humor into water chemistry, but somehow I found myself giggling almost every class. She also has a strong moral sensibility, which really shone through in her teaching. Lastly, even though her problem sets were difficult, she is one of the most understanding professors I've had at Yale, and was always willing to lend a hand and\/or talk about extensions.",
    "This course covers the fundamentals of water chemistry in natural water systems, with an emphasis on geochemistry. While the main focus of the course is on the fundamental geochemistry of natural waters, a secondary component of the course is provided through guest lectures. The guest lectures provide interesting research applications of the topic covered. I would recommend this class to other students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Helpful and interesting class, but complicated and a ton of work. I would recommend it.",
    "Helpful course."

   "comments": [
    "Very applicable, will be very useful",
    "Good overview of topics in water chemistry. This course helped me fine tune my problem solving skills, and practice breaking down long, complex problems into more manageable pieces. Some topics will be relevant to my research, but I think I gained more general problem solving skills from this class than relevant information for my future work.",
    "The depth in which this will play in my dissertation and research will remain to be seen, but I know it will help me professionally. My career aspirations are very closely related to and based upon the topics discussed in this course, so I know this will help me significantly in the long run.",
    "It deepen my knowledge in basic thermodynamics and broaden my view in chemistry. It provided solid knowledge support for my research and will greatly contribute to it.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of environmental chemistry by gaining a basic understanding of the fundamental principles governing the chemistry of natural waters and the methods used to evaluate the composition of various natural water systems. The material covered in this course is essential to understanding our environment and furthering our ability to asses how humans affect the environment.",
    "This course will be very helpful for my research. I learned about a number of issues that make aqueous systems complicated and how to work with\/around those issues.",
    "Unfortunetely, this course wasn't very relevant to my PhD research. However, I did learn a lot in this course."
