    "I had a great time in this class, it is very relaxed and we got to go to some cool behind the scenes yale places that I otherwise would not have had the chance to explore.",
    "I would definitely recommend Painting Time to a fellow student. Especially someone who has done a little bit of oil painting before.",
    "PAINTING Time or Painting TIME? We joked with people not in the class about what exactly this title meant, but I think we were all confused about the \"time\" aspect. Sam talked about it with us a bit at the beginning of the course, and I think a lot of it had to do with our paintings being momentous, in that they captured specific times in the environments we chose to focus on. But there are other ways to think about time that didn't get much focus in the class, and I would have liked some more frequent emphasis on the meaning of the course. But I'm probably just being a stickler for words. The class was a very good painting class, and I think anyone, painter or no, would enjoy it. As long as what you paint during the class is before you and not a product of your imagination, you end up painting whatever you want, and get helpful feedback and tips AS you paint. This is the first time Sam taught it, and if it comes around again I'd recommend it. It's one of the more chill painting classes you can take, while still getting in a lot of practice and improvement.",
    "Yes! Not a ton of work outside of class, and paint a lot every week in class."
