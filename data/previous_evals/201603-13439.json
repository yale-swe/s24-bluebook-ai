   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Strong independent research skills, historical thinking, and class engagement were well developed through the course.",
    "This was a great course! Most helpful I think was Nic's structured approach to our final papers, and this made writing a twenty-page paper about antislavery politics much more palatable than I initially expected it to be. In addition, we spent some time in the first half of the course reading primary documents in class and discussing them and how they could be useful to our own research, which Nic encouraged us to think about from the beginning of the term. Overall, the course was a very solid history seminar.",
    "After taking this course, I feel that I have an extremely good understanding of historiography, its importance, and how best to use it in academic writing, which are all crucial things to know for a history major. I have also been introduced to using manuscripts and archives as well as microform and microfiche for primary research. The subject of the class, antislavery, was also very interesting and I feel like the perspectives that Prof. Wood taught are undertaught in other classes, so this class really did give a more comprehensive story to the slavery and antislavery struggle in America.",
    "From this course, I learned how to integrate both primary and secondary sources into a paper in a way that they complemented each other. The course material was very interesting and it touched on information that I had not heard previously, so I learned many new things throughout the semester related to the material as well.",
    "Developed extensive writing and research experience; Professor Wood did a very good job of integrating training into the actual course material.",
    "HIST 107J provided me with a nuanced understanding of the American antislavery movement. It also helped me develop my historical research skills through the final paper assignment."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Solid topics week to week with fair reading assignments and generally interesting, while led and instructed, and with a high degree of independence Weaknesses: The course could've strongly been improved had more people taken the course and also the final paper being reduced in page count to the traditional 15-20 page final paper.",
    "The syllabus was very interesting, in my opinion, and it was nice that of the three assigned readings for each class each student had to read only two. The downfall of this, though, was that with the small class size, there were classes where only one or two students had read an article, which invariably led to somewhat awkward discussions. Enrollment aside, Nic was great at integrating various different types of primary documents from a wide variety of sources into the course, and this was helpful to our final paper. The reading response papers, too, were helpful in thinking about historiography and primary sources, and how we would write about these things in the paper.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Wood creates a seminar environment where all students feel really comfortable contributing to the conversation and he also made himself extremely available and resourceful over both email and office hours. The workload is manageable and fair. Weaknesses: Reading for the course was light and although that was really nice in the course, I feel like we could have benefitted from having more readings to add to our conversations. Requiring students to only read 2 our of 3 articles sometimes made for awkward discussions in class.",
    "The strengths of the course include the helpful feedback that the professor provided and the way that working on the final paper was structured. Beginning to work on the paper early on and continuing to work on it in various ways was helpful in getting a clearer view of what the final product should and would look like. The course could be improved by having all of the students discuss all the readings so that everyone can engage in conversation at all times.",
    "Strengths: interesting readings, manageable workload, and ample accessibility to Professor Wood. Weaknesses: grading seemed arbitrary at times, but that's the case for many history seminars.",
    "The course provided me with a baseline understanding of the era, but also effectively explored the complexities of the antislavery struggle through scholarly articles and class discussions. The class was well structured, especially in terms of making the research paper manageable."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, and it's too bad that Nic's fellowship ends after the spring term! This would make a great first department seminar for a history student, and even for students who are very familiar with U.S. history and history at Yale this course provided a new look at slavery and political differences in the nineteenth-century United States. The workload was reasonable, Nic gave helpful feedback during discussions and to response papers, and overall the course and final paper were very well structured. I didn't have a lot of experience with the period or antislavery in the United States, but this course was a wonderful look at the various movements that contributed to abolition (and perhaps the Civil War) and the political climate of the United States, and the historiography of these topics as well. As a history seminar, this course obviously provided ample leeway in selecting a final paper topic, but Nic's reading assignment structure also allowed us to tailor smaller arcs of the course to fit students' interests, and final papers\/presentations reflected a wide range of interests, even with only six students. All in all it was great.",
    "Yes! As a history major, I thought this was both a wonderful seminar and pre-industrial course. You get to learn about a really crucial time in America history from a different perspective and you do so in a class that has manageable readings and assignments. Prof. Wood is extremely knowledgeable and helpful so you will feel supported in the class and the material is interesting. Probably one of the easier seminars I have taken at Yale (though a 20 page final paper is no joke) but I feel like I've learned a lot, including historical writing skills that I will use beyond this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to people interested in having a small class where they can freely participate and where the professor will provide a lot of feedback throughout the semester on the final paper. The final paper makes up a large part of the grade, so the class revolves as much on the class material as on the final paper.",
    "This course is fantastic if you're interested in antebellum antislavery politics. So, if another student were interested in said topic, this course would be perfect.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think it's a great way to explore a specific historical movement, and the research paper allows students to focus on an aspect of the historical period that most interests them. Our class discussions and our trip to the Beinecke, where we looked at primary source material, really made the period come alive for me."
