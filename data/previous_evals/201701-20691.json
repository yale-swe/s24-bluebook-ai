   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton about women in America over the past 100+ years. It was really fascinating and changed my perspective on a lot of societal structures and practices.",
    "I learned a lot about gay\/trans history, which I didn't know much about before. I also learned about female leaders that I didn't even know existed.",
    "Really opened my mind to issues women have faced in the 20th century, a lot more perspective",
    "I feel like this class gave me a good and contextualized history of feminism in America.",
    "This class allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the complex, ever-changing space that women occupy in American society, both in the past and the present. Most of the events, people, and social trends that we learned about were either not covered or completely glossed over in high school history classes, so it was refreshing to learn about these topics through a new and different lens.",
    "It was great to learn about women's history decade by decade and see how much the feminist movement has progressed over the years.",
    "The first part of the course covered similar topics to my US history classes, so much of the information was familiar. However, the classes on 20th century women's movements and cultural shifts were very interesting. The class also taught me how to look for primary sources in the humanities.",
    "While I had learned bits and pieces of women's history from other courses throughout elementary\/middle\/high school which covered a lot of the information in this course, I appreciated taking a class which connected all the dots and fleshed out the outline I already had. I especially enjoyed the readings, including the articles, documents, and books, because those really delved into subjects that I hadn't considered in my classes before.",
    "I learned about the history of women's rights, as well as the status and experiences of women in the US in the 20th century. I feel like I understand civil rights activism a lot more, in particular the internal conflicts and collection of views that every movement deals with. Also, making connections between phrases (\"equal pay for equal work\") from decades ago with present-day usage was particularly meaningful.",
    "This class is an overview of US women's movements in the 20th century, starting with the movement for the vote and ending in the 1980s with abortion activism (briefly touching on more contemporary topics). Frequent use of statistics to give a sense of changing trends in culture as the decades changed.",
    "I gained new insight into the course of women's history in America and how we got to where we are. I learned how to think critically about primary sources.",
    "The course was a comprehensive look at the politics, social trends, and economics that contextualized the fight for women's rights over the past century and beyond. I gained the ability to critically analyze and question widely held perceptions about the women's movement and the stereotypes that dictated women's life in various decades. The course also helped contextualize the current wave of feminism that we experience in our contemporary society by looking at the foundational beliefs, figures and events.",
    "I learned a ton about history as it relates to women, especially about women who I had never heard of. The class gave me strength to keep going.",
    "This course was a great overview of late 19th and early 20th century history of Women in America, their struggles for equality, and the repercussions of these struggles still felt today.",
    "Taking this class has helped me to understand the historical contexts that explain womens roles in social movements. I have learned to think more analytically about social movements, and how each movement might inspire later ones.",
    "Women in Modern America taught me to critically analyze the place of women in a historical context. I developed the ability to look at a primary source and analyze its significance in a timeline of historical events.",
    "I gained a broad, yet deep understanding of the role of women in the history of America, and the movements that women played instrumental roles in that changed the course of America's history. I started with little more than a vague, general understanding of the subject, and left with a deep and nuanced idea of how women shaped America.",
    "I learned a lot about how to analyze primary sources.",
    "From this course I developed the skill to evaluate continuities in historical movements throughout time periods and then apply these similarities to current social movements.",
    "I learned *SO MUCH* about women's history in America, and I loved how Prof. Meyerowitz was able to maintain so many different points of view and balance discussing all the intersectionalities of different movements while also drawing out common threads. This course has made me think really hard about questions of gender, sexuality, and gender roles, and also about the \"progress\" of the women's rights movements and the challenges that women still face today, and seeing how those challenges are rooted historically. As a woman of color, it felt so enlightening to be sitting in the class and actually learning factual foundations behind my personal beliefs, and also being challenged to see the POV of other movements\/conservative women. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Learned a ton about historical analysis and use of primary and secondary resources and LOVED reading the first-person documents and watching documentaries from the time periods themselves.",
    "For those who have not taken a history course before, Women in Modern America does a great job of introducing students to examining and analyzing primary sources. Professor Meyerowitz and the TFs did a great job of bringing detail and nuance to the material covered, encouraging students to think critically about the subject matter.",
    "Skills applicable to thinking critically about history, social issues, connecting events through common themes",
    "I developed a broad understanding of women's movements since 1900 in the United States, and learned to question the predominant narratives I previously understood to drive those movements.",
    "I learned so much about the history of women in America! I'm so glad I know have this base knowledge of women's history to reference in the future. I feel like this is a topic I talk and think about a lot-- and now I have some hard facts to bring up in conversation!",
    "The course was a great overview of feminist history, with great detail over the decades of the 20th century, when much societal change was occurring surrounding gender roles and social norms. This class definitely provided me with strong historical background for how the feminist movement has intersected with other movements throughout history, key figures, and why the movement is where it's at today.",
    "As the first history course I took at Yale, I found it to be a great introduction to reading and writing in history, and a great introduction to Women's and Gender studies as well. Very relevant and interesting.",
    "A general sense of women's history in the 20th century and how to read primary sources better.",
    "Great overview of American movements, events, and perspectives relating to women in the last century or so. Super interesting material. Almost every assigned reading was extremely eye-opening. One of those college courses that you can say involves teaching the type of knowledge that changes the way you see life and the type you look for considering higher education.",
    "Gained a pretty broad understanding of the history of women's activism in America, learned how to write a historical paper from primary sources, learned how to analyze primary sources.",
    "I learned to distinguish between the terms gender, sex, and sexuality. More importantly, I learned how studying women's history can be a great way to understand other historical processes and trends more generally.",
    "Learned so much about womens movements in 20ty century America. Was a great class highly recommend.",
    "I learned how to historically analyze documents, craft a better argument and put together a historical narrative",
    "This class gave great insight into the history of women's rights in America. I also developed my writing and critical thinking abilities.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of women's movements in the United States, and gained a much greater understanding of how women got to where they are today. I also learned about reading primary sources and writing a research paper.",
    "I learned about the feminist movement",
    "I learned about the arc of the feminist movement and women's rights from the end of the 19th century to present day. I feel I have gained a much deeper understanding of how we've gotten to where we are today, and where we might go from here.",
    "I learned to analyze a primary text, I worked on feeling comfortable presenting and discussing in section, and I learned so much about American history and the history of women's movements in America. This course filled so many blindspots I didn't even know I had.",
    "This course was a good overview of US women's history beginning mostly around the suffrage movement. I liked that we were able to view American history through a gender lens and focus on notable female figures throughout history. The research paper at the end of the semester was great because we had flexibility in topic choice and at least for me, I could refresh my researching and paper writing skills.",
    "It filled gaps of knowledge left behind from Prof Chauncey's Les Gay. A worthy class for anyone interested in gender studies",
    "What I learned in this class was not primarily new information (even as a non-major) but the mere fact of being taught women's history as a unified subject as opposed to a series of disjoined side notes was absolutely eye-opening and incredibly valuable.",
    "A broad overview of women's history.",
    "I learned how history has shaped society's associations with sex, gender, and sexuality today. The changes and movements that were championed by women a century ago have laid the foundation of the current polemic topics today.",
    "I learned how to trace the historical paths of specific misogynistic rhetoric, practices, and policies.",
    "I learned a lot about women's history in America. This course went far beyond what I learned about women's history when I took AP United States History. It's far more complex and multifaceted. I appreciated how the course address class, race, gender, and sexual orientation throughout.",
    "This course was fantastic. It is an amazing survey course for women's studies. Prof Meyerowitz tells the story of 100 years of history very well, pointing out themes and re-evaluating some mainstream narratives that may be not entirely correct. Her lectures were always very engaging, and the assignments of the course were very conducive to learning history effectively, which as a beginner in the discipline I really appreciated. She picked out great readings - they mostly did not relate to what we were talking about in class, which was confusing at times, but they also provided an opportunity to learn more content that supplemented what we learned in class. She made a point to include instruction about primary sources, so in addition to being a course where I learned women's history I also got to learn some of the more pedagogical aspects of the discipline.",
    "I learned so much from this course. Although I have taken other WGSS\/AMST\/HIST courses, and have learned a lot about women's history in the past, I loved this course. If I could sum up the knowledge I gained, I would say that I learned a fairly comprehensive history of the women's movement, particularly with regard to the labor movement. I think I learned, to a certain extent, how to develop a nuanced historical argument, and how to better analyze primary sources.",
    "Examining intersectionality of race, class, and gender in certain issues, such as the phenomenon of the \"feminization of poverty.\""

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "a fair bit of the reading felt redundant and unnecessary",
    "This was a wonderful course that covered a lot of material in American women's history. The readings were almost all phenomenal. However, the readings rarely if ever matched up with the lectures, making for disjointed sections. Also, lectures were often white women-centric, with the occasional woman of color or queer activist tossed in. This uneven coverage felt strange as well.",
    "The readings were the best of any class Ive ever taken at Yale very well-chosen. One thing was that there was a final paper and a final exam, which was difficult time-wise.",
    "Interesting course material, but discussion and engagement are limited due to the size of the lecture.",
    "I often felt like I couldn't speak in section because I felt like only one, extremely liberal, viewpoint could be represented and I didn't always agree with the rest of the class. So I didn't speak very often.",
    "A very interesting and important class. Professor Meyerowitz is a very engaging lecturer, however the lectures could probably be improved and made easier to follow if there was more information written on the slides.",
    "Strengths: Amazing class overall!!! Professor Meyerowitz really cares about her students and about teaching, lectures are super engaging and interesting (I payed attention for the entirety of every lecture this semester!), good balance of overall big ideas, facts and statistics, and little funny and interesting anecdotes. Also occasional video clip which really adds to the lectures. Readings (granted I only did about half of them), were SUPER interesting, I actually bought one of the books which I had originally rented so I can read it over the summer when I actually have time, tests were very fair, essay questions given in advance so know what to expect, not a stressful course at all Weaknesses: Honestly can't think of any",
    "The class lectures were really engaging and interesting and the readings were cool. I think a good improvement for the course would be to help guide students through the readings more by telling them which readings they should focus on in a given week since there are so many readings that it's easy to get lost in them.",
    "This was a fantastic class! The lectures were clear, well thought-out, and very engaging. The readings, for the most part, were also a great collection of articles and documents that represented diverse viewpoints and historical moments. I thought the midterm and final exams had appropriately challenging IDs, and I think having a selection of essay prompts ahead of time was extremely helpful for preparing. I thoroughly enjoyed section because I was fortunate enough to have a wonderful class and TA (Sigma!), but I think 50 minutes was too little time to really dive into the readings and themes explored in lecture. Since most weeks had multiple assigned documents\/articles\/book passages, it would have been helpful to know which readings would be most important for section and the context of the class.",
    "I liked how we looked at\/read many different factions of women's history, making sure to never leave out women of color and their many backgrounds, queer women, trans women, etc. I never had enough time to read the full novels assigned; I had an easier time reading the documents and articles.",
    "Strengths: -Lectures well planned -Mostly interesting readings -Assignment grade distribution fair Weaknesses: -Slides should have dates and names of important figures (hard to follow along otherwise) -Very little time given to third wave feminism (last class?)",
    "The course moves very quickly, obviously, because it covers a lot of time. As a result, we didn't always go into great detail, and sometimes the information was more of a recap for me than anything new. But the upside of this speed was that I got a picture of women's movements as a whole and the enormous changes which have taken place in the last century.",
    "The course provides an important survey of women's rights and experiences in the US , from the 1880s to the present, which is often given as a supplement or afterthought in a general US history course. The material was always engaging and thoughtful. The weakness to me, is that I felt the post-1980s movements were taught less clearly. Conservative movements (\"the opposition\") were not addressed as thoughtfully, or taken as seriously, as the feminist movements; I felt like we were only focusing on pro-life terrorists or extreme views, rather than the bulk of the movement, which would have been more worthwhile.",
    "Prof. Meyerowitz is an engaging lecturer and does a great job ensuring that the class is intersectional and inclusive. I thought the magazines assignments were interesting and valuable insight into the cultural zeitgeists of the 30s and 60s, but I otherwise found section. The TAs should use more focused questions to encourage debate, because as it stands, section was basically people sprouting anecdotes or rehashing the readings. I also would suggest moving the paper assignment. Completing an essay and a final is punishing and the TAs could have given more meaningful feedback if they had more time to grade\/go over them with us afterward. I would say eliminate the final paper and have two shorter writing assignments during the semester.",
    "This course was fantastic. I really enjoyed all the readings. On the other hand, I would have loved the chance to discuss more of our readings in section.",
    "The strongest aspect was the breadth and diversity of figures\/groups\/trends we explored, especially in addressing intersectional concerns that coincide with the women's movement.",
    "Great lecture course.",
    "The lecture is great, but slides aren't posted. This can be tedious when you miss something in lecture or want to refer back to something to check for correctness.",
    "One of my favorite aspects of this course was that it looked at issues from multiple sides, so that we had to think critically about and consider nuances of each movement. Although I understand that there were certain lectures that were meant to give background or a broader understanding of the movements we were studying, I found that they probably could have been condensed. An example of this were lectures where we focused on the different types of feminism. While informative in some senses, there seemed to be some repetition that made it a bit less engaging than other lectures.",
    "I think this class had awesome lectures. I wasn't sure if I liked that we were given large exam essay questions in advance - I felt like this allowed students who weren't as prepared to do equally as well. But overall, I truly enjoyed the class.",
    "The course provides a great chronological overview of the development of women's movements, and was easy to follow and understand. Lectures were pretty well structured and easy to follow, but I think including major points in the powerpoint (more than just the outline of the lecture) could be useful for focusing learning.",
    "I wish there were fewer readings. It was hard to appreciate them all when there was so much to read. However, I found the topics very exciting. I also wish the scope of the class had been smaller because there was just so much information, it was hard to truly analyze every event or person in its historical context.",
    "This course could be improved my offering more diverse perspectives on the female experience in America as the lack of intersectionality was certainly a weakness, from my perspective.",
    "One of the weaknesses of the course may be the breadth of the desired final paper and the little amount of time\/space (in the paper) to cover it. Would have loved more guidance for it, perhaps starting earlier in the semester, and the opportunity to submit and revise a draft (although I realize that is more work for the TFs). Otherwise, this course was AMAZING. I learned so much and loved how amazing of a lecturer prof. meyerowitz was, and the range of discussion we got through in section.",
    "The material (readings, etc.) for this course were phenomenal. While still a pretty straightforward survey course, the required work for the course added a greater depth that strengthened its purpose and effectiveness. As far as weaknesses go, I may point out that the inclusion of minority movements (racial, trans, etc.) be included\/inserted a bit more fluidly. Again understanding that this is more a survey course, these groups nevertheless felt sometimes as an added thought rather than an intrinsic part of this history as it was.",
    "everything good",
    "Women in Modern America is a wonderful course. It provides a good introduction to women's history in America, late 1800s-present, and Professor Meyerowitz takes care to examine historical developments from multiple perspectives. She also covers topics with nuance, complicating many of the preconceived notions that students enter the course with.",
    "The exams were a huge weakness in my opinion. The format of receiving the questions in advance then writing essays was not actually testing knowledge or application but just memorization ability.",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic. Well organized, fascinating lectures, great TFs, fair assessments. Highly recommend.",
    "I did think the grading of the midterm was a bit arbitrary. The requirements were very specific but not necessarily articulated to the students beforehand. Providing a rubric for the assignments would be helpful.",
    "Very well structured and organized lectures. There was too much reading, which didn't let me read them all closely enough. I wish there had been more history of non-white women. I felt the second exam could have been an in class exam.",
    "It felt like there was a lot of reading for the course, but at the same time the reading was very helpful for better understanding the context of the lectures. I felt like I got a lower score than expected for the midterm, and it would be helpful if there were one or two sample questions given out beforehand with expected answers so that I could better understand what was expected of me.",
    "Prof. Meyerowitz is a fantastic lecturer. I was always interested in the topics we covered during lecture, and actually wanted to do many of the readings!",
    "Really basic intro to women's history. This can be bad or good for some. For me who knew nothing, it was good, but I don't know about anyone else.",
    "The class was a very interesting overview of the history of women in the US. I really liked that there were dedicated lectures to the history of the gay\/lesbian movement, and the transgender movement.",
    "Strengths: interesting, straight-forward lectures at a good, mid-level pace that never feels overwhelming Weaknesses: Grading feels a little undetermined, maybe more guidance on writing ID's and essays",
    "The structure of the course with 4 big assignments, each worth 25% of the grade was nice. The end of the semester felt a little rushed because the 10 page paper was due only a week before the final.",
    "Strengths: - extremely well taught and organized - material was intersectional and interesting - enjoyable class overall Weaknesses: - class sometimes felt too structured and rigid",
    "Super interesting and inspiring. I wish the readings had related more directly to the class lectures. I also wish the class had been more focused towards intersectional feminism.",
    "Excellent course! Lectures and readings were so interesting! Workload wasn't too bad. I think instead of a midterm it could have been more beneficial to write an assignment in response to one of the books, maybe Firebrand and the Firstlady. More writing would have been nice!",
    "Because the topic is so broad, there were many readings or events brought up in class that were only partially covered\/described. Fine-tuning the required readings would be helpful (only requiring the most helpful niche documents, while focusing more on generalized accounts to reinforce lecture material.)",
    "This class was very well organized and insightful. I really enjoyed the flow of this class and how it was structured. I would say there are no weaknesses",
    "This course was extremely engaging and interesting. The structure of having lecture twice a week and discussion section once a week was really conducive to student learning. Additionally, the reading assigned for this course was really interesting and manageable.",
    "This course seems like one that has been carefully crafted and really, perfected, over time. It was the perfect mix of reading, super interesting lectures, and student research. I loved that the paper topic was open-ended, and I always looked forward to my discussion section. I think there could be one additional magazine assignment. They were really fun to research and discuss.",
    "The course readings are really fantastic, particularly the primary source readings. The section was good but the discussions were not very rigorous. The lectures were always interesting, and the exams and assignments were very fair. I think the course could be improved with more attention paid to how to engage in probing discussions.",
    "I think the content of the course was interesting but the format in which it was delivered could be improved. Much of the readings and the lectures overlapped, but we did not pay equal attention to them and the lectures were more like general overviews. I liked the content and all of the readings though, especially primary sources.",
    "Reading selection is good and varied but lectures could be less white-feminism heavy.",
    "It is at times too survey-based, I wish we got more in depth with much of the content. But it is very interesting, I just wish the level of engagement was higher.",
    "Professor Meyerowitz is a wonderful, wonderful lecturer. Her lectures were definitely the best thing about the class and I actively looked forward to it every time!",
    "The course does a good job covering the general themes, but the readings could be discussed a bit more in lecture.",
    "The lectures were very well planned. I also enjoyed the wide range of information that we learned both inside and outside of class. The readings were GREAT! However, I didn't appreciate having a final paper AND exam in the last few weeks of class. I also don't appreciate how the exams are organized. Instead of offering possible essay questions (and therefore implicitly encouraged students to memorize several pre-planned essays), perhaps there might be more short answer questions? Or might the final exam include one essay instead of two?",
    "An okay course. Most of it is super intuitive, which can be nice but also is ultimately just a little pointless at times. Exams were very detail-oriented, but the lecture slides weren't posted online and often jumped around, so it was hard to get specific names (often weren't even written on the slide) or terms.",
    "The lectures were great, and the expectations of the course were always very clear to me. Prof Meyerowitz is extremely knowledgeable, and tries really hard to be intersectional in her presentation of history (although she did not always succeed with this, she raised some interesting questions about mainstream historical narratives). The content of the class is VERY important because it is a deep history of America and the status of women since the late 1800s. We learned briefly about the trans rights movement, we talked about welfare and the feminization of poverty, we talked about legal battles and women's activism, etc so it was a very comprehensive survey course.",
    "Lectures were consistently enjoyable, insightful, and always very organized. I often found that there was an overwhelming amount of reading, which required me to prioritize some of the reading to the detriment of rest. The final research paper and magazines assignments were engaging. The most interesting part of the class - and the part that was most new to me - was the history of social movements.",
    "I think the lectures were great and well-organized, and I loved the readings. The only thing I would say is that I wish we had fewer readings. I liked the actual readings we did, and I would not change the amount of reading, but if we were to read, for example, one book a week with a few primary sources, rather than parts of 2 books, 2 journal articles, and a primary source, I feel like I would have been better able to fully understand the content of the readings in a deeper way.",
    "Discussion sections were very helpful, lectures were engaging, and the readings were interesting and informative. I wish discussion sections were actually longer because there is a lot to talk about!"

    "Definitely recommend to everyone!!! Even if you are a STEM major like me, take this if you've never taken a women's studies course before - it will make you see history and our current society in a totally new way. Cr\/D if you have to. There is a midterm, final, and final paper that you can write on literally anything you want. Just make sure you go to class because 1) you need to actually pay attention to the lectures to get all the information and 2) it will be the most interesting 50 minutes of your day.",

    "Yes, I highly recommend this course! It's super fun, the readings are great, and it's not that hard!",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "Wow, what an incredible class. The class is so thought-provoking in its coverage of topics that were largely overlooked in high school history classes but are highly relevant today. Prof. Meyerowitz was an excellent lecturer -- not only was she humorous and engaging, but she also provided compelling arguments in every lecture. The readings, for the most part, were interesting (some more so than others) and fit well with the topics covered in lecture. Although it was a bit annoying to have both a midterm and final exam as well as a final paper, the exam questions were always very fair and the class overall quite manageable, especially as a first humanities\/history class. Women's perspectives and struggles are so often missing from history classes, and as someone who hadn't really given women's history much thought before going into the course, I think I gained so much, both in terms of actual knowledge and a new way of viewing the world around me. For lack of a better, less cheesy word, this class was honestly life-changing. Please take it!",
    "This is a great class for learning about women's history in the US over the last several decades. You get to learn of the progression of feminism over the years and learn about many different types of women and women's groups, including women of color, queer women, trans women, etc.",
    "I went into this course worried that I wouldn't learn anything because a lot of the material in the first half of the syllabus seemed familiar. However, we covered a lot of interesting material in the second half of the semester that I would have never learned on my own. The midterm and final are very reasonable, and the final paper is on a topic of your choice. My TA was great and Professor Meyerowitz is very receptive to having students stop by (although make an appt first).",
    "Definitely take this course. Every student needs a comprehensive knowledge of women's history, and this course is extremely interesting and well-organized.",
    "I think Women in Modern America was a very solid introduction to women's movements in the 20th century and as a history major I appreciated the focus on historical rather than theoretical study. The lectures were interesting and the lens of women's history was cool but there was some overlap with AP US. If you go to the first lecture and like the class, go for it! Prof. Meyerowitz is really kind and has always been helpful when I asked her questions after class.",
    "Best class I've take at Yale.",
    "Yes - it's a great large history lecture and Professor Meyerowitz is engaging and passionate, which makes it such that you never want to miss lecture. The content is relatively straightforward, but you will certainly deepen your understanding of feminist politics and history beyond what you might learn in a high school US history course.",
    "Yes, one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. Meyerowitz is fabulous, the material is important, and the assignments are really fair.",
    "Yes! I would recommend the course to anyone interested in the subject. I would further recommend that people not particularly comfortable with history writing or analysis to take it cr\/d\/f.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot and the readings were interesting. The workload was also very manageable -- exams were straightforward and we knew which essay questions to prepare for ahead of time, and having the final paper due before reading period began made my reading period a lot easier, this is a good 5th class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. Apart from being very important to our society today, the class is very objective and presents multiple sides of arguments.",
    "Women In Modern America is a great class on a subject that does not receive enough attention. The history is interesting, and is very new to many students who have not received any formal education on the development of American Women's movements. It's one of the best history courses I've taken at Yale, and is well structured and interesting the entire time, while not being a huge time requirement.",
    "Yes! The information is necessary to understand the current feminist movement in its historical context. It's also necessary to understand the current state of women in America!",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student as I found it to be boring at times, though many others found it to be fascinating. Because I was already familiar with much of the content I did not always find it interesting.",
    "YES YES YES YES PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS! If you are a woman or genderqueer or WHATEVER YOU WILL FEEL AFFIRMED and enlightened and Prof. Meyerowitz is simultaneously inclusive and challenging in her lectures. She does such a great job of balancing between personal narratives and trends of the time, and really has wonderfully spaced lectures between the historical content about evolving questions around gender and feminism and social and political movements, moderates and radicals, and touches upon all these thought-provoking questions. IF YOU ARE A GUY, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take this. You will not regret it. While it was AMAZING being in a class that was like 80% women and having a section that was all female and majority women of color (what a wonderful, wonderful space for discussion that was academic and personal all at once), I would love for men on campus to develop perspectives towards women's rights and the challenges that women have faced accessing spaces of power. The readings were honestly very enlightening and brought up questions about body image, sexuality, political values, and challenges in very specific parts of the women's rights movements (ex. the evolution of judgment and prosecution of rape cases), and the primary documents read for section each week were very interesting. The ID's on the midterm and final can be difficult, but the class overall was not too hard of a workload and really, really interesting. I'll remember it for a long time.",
    "Yes! I truly enjoyed it and felt like i got a lot out of it, even though it was a more basic survey of women's history. If you really engage with the material and in section, you add so much more dimension to lecture that became a genuinely enjoyable learning experience.",
    "yes learned a lot",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. The class is very interesting, Professor Meyerowitz is an engaging and thoughtful lecturer, and it is not exceptionally difficult. A must-take for any student interested in American history.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and it was a very good intro into thinking about women and gender studies, or just as a study of history.",
    "Highly recommend this course. An easy midterm, final and final paper. Essay prompts for the midterm and final are posted in advance. Engaging lectures by a fantastic professor. Strong TFs. Overall a great, easy 5th class for anyone interested in learning about US women's movements.",
    "Yes! I wish all students had to take this course. Professor Meyerowitz is a good lecturer and the material is so important.",
    "Yes! Very interesting, not too heavy of a workload, and super valuable for everyday life.",
    "Absolutely! Great for anyone.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was a great overview of feminist history, with great detail over the decades of the 20th century, when much societal change was occurring surrounding gender roles and social norms. This class definitely provided me with strong historical background for how the feminist movement has intersected with other movements throughout history, key figures, and why the movement is where it's at today. Section is often interactive and people are eager to contribute constructively, which is nice. Professor is great, but there should be a stronger review session or an equivalent before the midterm and final, as so many topics are covered.",
    "Yes! A great introduction to women's and gender studies in the US.",
    "Not really, maybe for those who are taking the major WGSS otherwise there are certainly better classes.",
    "Yes! This class was really interesting and I would recommend to anyone who wants to know more about women's history.",
    "Yes! Favorite class this semester. Lectures were always super enjoyable!",
    "I would recommend this course. Interesting material (although basically white women) and manageable load.",
    "I would definitely recommend Women in Modern America. Professor Meyerowitz was an engaging professor and the readings were excellent. They complemented the lecture material very nicely.",
    "Would recommend! Straightforward history lecture course with a midterm, final paper, and a final. Extremely manageable workload about some fascinating, often understudied history.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! Such a wonderful course, important for any person to know. I felt as a female I have a better sense of where we have come from in terms of our rights and I have a much better handle and context for present day arguments and challenges.",
    "Yes. The content was extremely interesting and valuable to any American. I now see the world in a different context. Taking this class has made me more aware of the history and trends of gender culture in America.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I took this class as a STEM major needing a humanities credit, and I am SO SO glad that I did. Professor Meyerowitz is incredible, and I looked forward to every lecture with her. She's a great speaker, and her slides are mostly pictures with either context or examples. Her lectures are incredibly organized (each one begins with an outline of the day's topics), she always started and ended exactly on time, even with interruptions or technical difficulties (seriously her pacing is amazing). She also played several videos for us during class, both documentary clips and historical film clips, that were all really interesting. She also tries to stay relatively neutral\/unbiased, and presents both sides to the various political discussions covered in class (ie. in historical arguments and dealings with protective legislation). She also asks that people try to come meet with her at least once during the semester--would highly recommend doing this! She is such a kind and interesting person! I didn't really know what to expect when I scheduled a meeting with her, but we ended up having about an hour long conversation, just about course (and final paper) topics I was particularly interested in, any questions or concerns I had, and just general personal introductions and backgrounds. The topics covered follow a fairly neat timeline from the late 1800s through present day, although with more in depth focus on each decade from 1910 through 1970. Generally, this included major discussions and themes of the women's movement in each of these decades, along with issues, successes, key figures and events, and general historical background. The lectures also covered the different issues faced by WOC and queer women in these decades, both as the related to the larger women's movement\/issues, and as they were uniquely faced by these groups. This included both distinct issues\/efforts and the struggles of these women with and within the larger women's movement (basically, discussing historical lack of intersectionality of the feminist movement). It was really nice to see and hear about some of the lesser known groups and figures of various movements, and also to learn about some of the overlaps and connections between them and the more 'mainstream'. The workload is all reading, plus two magazine assignments and a final paper. The reading load is a little unbalanced at times--some weeks it would just be a document or two and other weeks there would be several articles and chapters out of the required books(and, in one case, an entire book). While you can probably get by without doing all of the reading, it is really interesting and does help introduce more context or insight into the themes discussed in class. If anything, I wish I would have just spread the reading out more on my own instead of doing just the assigned readings on lighter weeks. The magazine assignments are really simple--just finding a magazine article from a particular time period relating to one of the themes of the class from that week and giving a brief summary of what it is and why you chose it (and being able to discuss it in section). The final paper is ten pages due at the end of the semester over any topic relating to the course; this wasn't bad, but I personally could have used some more guidance in choosing a suitably focused topic. The research itself was really interesting though, and you are open to pretty much whatever topic you want. There are two exams, one midterm and one final (noncumulative, and yes, on top of the final paper). Each one has a few IDs of key figures\/events\/themes from the readings and lectures (you get to pick a few out of several listed) and essays based on the more major themes of that half of the course. She gives you a few potential essay questions before the exam, then on the exam you are given 2-3 of those essay prompts to choose from, so you can prep before.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Even if they are not a history major, the class is super interesting and a great look into women's history. It is well organized and planned. There is a good bit of reading, but they are all interesting.",
    "Great course! A nice overview of women's history with accessible lectures and a easy workload.",
    "Yes! Regardless of major I think everyone should take this course! It is really interesting and provides important information in an extremely engaging way.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course as a great introduction to WGSS and fresh look at recent American history. Professor Meyerowitz is great at getting information across concisely and effectively, and many of the readings are pleasurably eye-opening.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The workload was very reasonable; every reading was fascinating and clearly added something unique and important to the syllabus.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a friend. I am so grateful for what I've learned in it, and I think it's important for anyone to repair the blindspots they might have surrounding women in US history. It also gave me a fresh perspective on women's roles in other movements, like the CRM. The readings are really fun and it's a rather low-pressure addition to round out a tough schedule.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think everyone should take a women's studies course, and this is a pretty relatable and interesting one. I would particularly recommend this course to people not in the major because it is a really accessible history\/WGSS\/Am Stud credit and imparts important information while also providing guidance about things like paper-writing and primary source analysis for those that might not have a lot of experience in the humanities.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely take this course--the professor is great, and you really gain a lot from learning about women's history.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about the issues surrounding gender, sex, and sexuality and how they have progressed throughout history.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in gaining knowledge about feminism, the women's movement, and the various counter-movements.",
    "Yes!",
    "Meh. Take it if you need it, or if you're really interested in the subject. I took it just to broaden my horizons (English major here) and found it didn't really challenge me, and was more busywork than actually engaging material. But definitely not bad.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone and everyone! Despite your gender or academic interests, it is so important to understand American history and hear stories that do not reach our ears in high school. The course is not too difficult, and you can make of it what you want. The readings are fascinating, and very rich and diverse in content - they add so much to the course and I would highly recommend doing them even if they don't always come up on evaluations.",
    "There's some overlap with other WGSS history classes, particularly lesgay, but the material on social movements is particularly interesting (and relavant). Prof. Meyerowitz is an engaging and organized lecturer. There is quite amount of reading (often multiple scholarly articles and several primary sources a week) which is mostly doable if you can space it out.",
    "Yes!! Meyerowitz is extremely smart and the lectures are very interesting. The workload is manageable, the tests are reasonable, and the essay allowed for a lot of creativity. Women's history is so so interesting and often neglected in other US History courses, and this course provides a new context for a lot of events that many of us have already vaguely learned about. The course also provides a lot of context for why things are the way they are today (not directly in lectures but you sort of gather that on your own) and is a great lens through which to examine the present. Take this course!",
    "Absolutely. Very interesting material and I feel as though I developed strong reading, writing, and speaking skills over the course of the semester."
