    "Question 1 - Hard to answer this question since we rarely had readings to do, but when we had them, they were relevant and helpful.",
    "The course was insightful about UN, their work and recent climate change negotiations. The Instructor was excellent while the TA was exceptional. However, the field work i.e. internship with UN Missions was bit of a mix bag. Although it was a good opportunity, there was nothing happening at UN so it was bit quiet. Based on discussion with my supervisor, the UN would be more active during the Fall session.",
    "Professor Lee arranges for excellent internships at the UN and presenting to UN ambassadors is quite amazing. You learn a lot from Professor Lee's very general style."

   "comments": [
    "I suppose the best part of this class was the times when we had the chance to interact with Ambassadors at the UN. I really enjoyed having conversations with them and visiting the UN.",
    "As a student interested in working with UN, it was certainly an eye opener of how the UN runs. The small class, class discussions, interaction opportunity with Ambassadors and International Organization heads and internship opportunity were the highlights of the class.",
    "It was designed as a professional course and it was successful in this regard.Experience with UN is also a plus.",
    "Helping to shape a little piece of the UN. We were able to give a presentation to UN ambassadors and that presentation included the Chinese which is quite amazing.",
    "Improved understanding of international environmental policies."

   "comments": [
    "This course does not have any structure. It should be more thought out and a syllabus should be mandatory.",
    "The internship placement (missions) must be given a re-thinking. Firstly, nothing much is happening during spring at the UN and secondly, the mission I was working with had three interns so my supervisor didn\u0092t have any work to assign for me. However, I did manage to attend the Commission on Status of Women (CSW) as a part of my internship.",
    "Sometimes Professor Lee is a bit unclear about what he wants, but when you focus down on a subject it really helps to understand the topic. The struggling helped us to really put out great products."

    "The TA was exceptional and very insightful.",
    "Fran and Professor Lee are wonderful. Fran put in many hours of work."

    "This course fits into my overall program because I'm studying sustainable development policy but there was a huge emphasis on climate change and that wasn't as applicable. They said the class could focus on any type of policy we were interested in, but it didn't end up that way (I think due to the backgrounds of the Prof and TA)",
    "Yes. As an international student, the course was extremely useful and part of my academic goal.",
    "This course will prepare me well for my goals to become a diplomat."

    "I took this course to learn about UN policy and to have an internship with the UN. I never gotto have an internship at the UN and was extremely disappointed about this.",
    "It was in part my interest to understand UN as an institution, their effectiveness and climate change negotiations.",

    "No. I learned about policy from the Prof, but each student was promised a UN internship and that was my main reason for taking the class. It did not live up to my expectations in that I was not given an internship.",
    "Yes.",
    "It very much lived up to my expectations and I hope to take the course again.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I worked with one other person on our final project and we worked well together. Advantages were that we could divide and conquer the workload. There were not any disadvantages.",
    "I had the opportunity to work in a group of two. This was helpful as each individual brought different ideas and knowledge to the table.",
    "Clearly sometimes people put in more or less work depending on the group, but generally it was a positive experience."

   "question_text": "For students taking this course, what advice would you give them?",
   "comments": [
    "I would say that if you get an internship, it's probably a great class to take. But, expect that there is little organization to the structure of the class.",
    "The class is exceptional for understanding how the UN works. However, it emphasizes too much on climate change negotiations and little on development or other sectors of UN.The instructor is excellent and very insightful and always pushing you to build ones learning about the climate change negotiations past, present and future. One point which i admired about the instructor is pushing us to look into the problems in more practical sense rather then academically approach.Btw, just be ready to invest time and know about the climate change negotiations in and out.",
    "Go to the UN early in the semester and get a pass to the UN immediately."
