   "comments": [
    "Professor Schwarz is an excellent lecturer. He keeps the class very interesting and brings in relevant anecdotes. His demos (although simple) are actually pretty interesting. Moreover, he's a pretty funny guy.The only downside to this class would be that the midterm and final were incredibly difficult - more difficult than most of the other engineering exams.",
    "I would recommend this class to Engineers because I think it is really important to understand how different materials work in different applications. I would warn students though that the test cover a lot of material with no review to cover what is the most important. The problem sets aren't bad, but the memorization for the final is pretty brutal. You do learn a lot about materials through this class though and professor schwarz brings in some cool demos!",
    "Definitely not one of the harder MechE classes. A good class even if it's not required for your major, but you need to be interested in learning about materials.",
    "mat sci is one of the more pleasant mechanical engineering classes, not that that says much. final exam was really hard though in my opinion. p sets are pretty straightforward though",
    "If interested in materials science without a rigorous math component, would recommend this course.",
    "The course was very good. Professor Schwarz made the lectures entertaining and the material was very interesting. The material is mostly conceptual. The problem sets were sometimes a little long and were mostly writing not computation. The exams were the same way.",
    "A really fun class with lots of really fun and interesting material. Be warned however that the midterm and final are ghastly difficult. Especially since the midterm was like a final but with much less time to complete it.",
    "Great course! I recommend it if you think you're interested. I found the material really interesting, especially towards the end of the course when we got to ceramics and polymers.Prof. Schwarz is a great lecturer. He's very funny and has a lot of good stories about the history of materials and about the concepts he's teaching which help show you why what he's teaching is important.",
    "Overall, Materials Science gives a general overview of material classes, choices, structure, and use in history and modern society. You NEED to have the book if you want to be able to understand things completely (for reference), but the lectures give you a wealth of real-life examples and topics to get the information engrained in your head. Professor Schwars was a great lecturer and really tried to teach us everything he could. If you like chemistry, engineering, or learning about how to build, this is an excellent class to take.",
    "Kinda dry with long lectures although udo is not a bad lecturer. tests seem absolutely impossible and very different (much more conceptual compared to computation-heavy psets) but in the end, not that difficult"
