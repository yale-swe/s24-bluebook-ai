    "If you are willing to deal with the workload, have lots of exposure into a lot of new things in an intense and fast-paced manner, then definitely go for it",
    "A great discussion-based literature class. Madeleine is a wonderful teacher. Not the best class to take if you want to improve your writing skills, as most of our time was spent discussing the literature. Otherwise, I wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "This course provides an excellent survey of some of the most important literature in the European canon. I would recommend it to any student with an interest in English.",
    "Overall, English 129 provided a solid survey of tragedy plays ranging from The Iliad, through Ancient Greek and Roman plays, middle age and renaissance plays, and a final several modern plays of the 19th and 20th centuries. With five students in this section, class discussion revolved around dissecting a different play or section of play (for Shakespeare) each day; we constantly attempted to define what a tragedy was and what elements contributed to tragedies as well as how different tragedies differed from each other. We wrote four essays, where we chose between 3-4 prompts provided Madeleine. I would recommend this course to a student interested in broadening his\/her appreciation for Western literature, and more importantly someone interested in asking questions about the human condition, the purpose of life, and the role of tragedies in society."
