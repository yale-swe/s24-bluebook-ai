    "Take it! Great to fulfill senior psych requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to seniors filling their psychology requirement. The workload is very manageable and Professor Lockhart is great.",
    "It's a lot of work but worth it. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. The course looks at families and considers optimal conditions and risk factors for psychological disturbance for multiple family members.",
    "Awesome class where you will learn a lot about clinical psychology and how psychological issues impact not just the person but also the family. Weekly responses to thought questions, a brief (~20 minute) presentation, and a long final paper are the main course assignments. Absolutely nothing negative to say about this course!!",
    "Great class. You meet once per week and have really open discussions on the readings (which are pretty interesting too).",
    "The seminar is stress-free. Professor Lockhart doesn't even expect you to take notes, so it is nice to be able to just sit and listen. There are weekly reading responses, a presentation, and a 20 page paper. Great seminar to take to fulfill your senior psychology requirement.",
    "Would definitely recommend. 1 thought question per week, final paper. Really enjoyable classes where a lot of interesting discussions happen.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get in!! Class itself is fun, and you learn so much about families and how important they are in development. This was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Yale."
