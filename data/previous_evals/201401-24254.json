    "Everything you ever wanted to know about real estate.",
    "I recommend this class to people who have some experience in real estate already. If you don't have any background at all, be prepared to be lost during parts of some lectures. It probably won't affect your overall grade though. The guest speakers are awesome, and to get the most out of talking to them, I think it helps to have some background in real estate, even if it's just a vague general interest. If you don't, I recommend reading some books about the financial crisis like All the Devils are Here, Too Big to Fail, etc. The professor is awesome and very willing to meet for individual conversations outside of class to talk about about career, senior thesis ideas, etc.",
    "Absolutely. It's a fascinating class on a very relevant topic, and Powers is an incredible instructor. Workload is decent, grading is very very fair, and speakers are super cool (Dan Mudd, former CEO of Fannie Mae; people from Goldman Sachs; Yale University Properties, etc). Weekly reading responses, two 5-7 page papers, and one 15-20 page paper",
    "Take it! For anyone interested in urban studies\/real estate, this class is a gem. One of the few urban studies courses where you'll learn about how one actually goes about working in the field and changing cities.",
    "Take it. Great opportunity to ground your liberal arts education in some real world application. Class is a mixture of philosophy behind real estate (jefferson, de soto, etc.) and real world application (financial crisis, private equity, etc.). Take it for the readings. Take it for the guest speakers. Take it for Professor Powers. Take it.",
    "This class is a really great introduction to real estate, both the history of property and current investment practices. I am not going into finance (unlike most of my peers in the class) and I absolutely loved it. I feel like I really learned a lot about a subject that has helped me understand more about the world that we live in. I would absolutely recommend you take this class. Professor Powers is wonderful and really tries to come up with a syllabus that is dynamic and interesting, and you will get a lot out of it. It is a lot of work though-- reading and responses, as well as three papers. But worth it!",
    "Are you interested in taking at the intersection of liberal arts and real estate? Then this is the class for you! A very well done course that should be the model for other liberal arts courses to incorporate practical aspects that can help us get jobs after graduation!",
    "Mr. Powers is a visiting lecturer but his class is no less intellectually demanding than any other Yale class. He is a very nice person but has also spent many years in the business world and thus has little patience for nonsense. This class includes visits from many excellent guest speakers, including the AG of Maryland and Dan Mudd, the former CEO of Fannie Mae. The material is composed of two distinct segments - the first 75% of the class focuses on more abstract philosophical conceptions of property, land use, eminent domain, etc. The latter 25% is more technical and focuses on real estate finance, which can be difficult to understand for those who have not had previous exposure to finance, though Mr. Powers does a good job helping students through it. Grade in this class is based on weekly reading responses, two 5 page papers, and one 15-20 page final paper.",
    "I loved it. I went into it not knowing much at all about real estate but now I actually have a pretty good understanding of its technical and political elements. The workload is pretty normal (which is good!) and the final paper can actually be pretty fun if you choose the right topic.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student interested in real estate, or even someone who wants to understand society from a new vantage point. I think what makes this class so successful is the way real estate permeates our lives: this class allows you to realize its importance, and the stakeholders involved in setting the agenda for real estate development in the future. The readings and two mini papers allow you to better understand the course material, and the final paper allows you to expand upon the class concepts, integrating real estate into your own academic or personal interests. The speakers also made the class so interesting. Lauren Zucker, VP at Yale's Office of New Haven and State Affairs, kept us on the edge of our seats for two hours, which was incredible.",
    "Please take this course. Also, please take it with a good reason for wanting to take it; you won't get anything out of it if you don't (and, in a more blunt sense, you probably won't get into the course in the first place). Whether you're looking to be an international real estate magnate or just to be an informed citizen, it's a privilege to be in this class."
