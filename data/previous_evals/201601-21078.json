    "Great way to see what your other CogSci major friends are researching for their senior theses. This class is mandatory, but it's an easy credit. Just make sure you try to do your presentation early on so you don't have the pressure to present the same week you're working on important thesis work.",
    "This course is the perfect opportunity to get involved in one of the awesome research labs associated with the CogSci department. A great way to do research related to your senior thesis.",
    "It was a good way for me to explore my Cognitive Science theme when I could no longer find classes particularly relevant to the topic. The flexibility also helped me think about my thesis.",
    "Directed Research is an incredible opportunity and I would encourage anyone considering it to do it. As long as you have a professor who can provide strong guidance and a project that you care about, it is well worth the time and energy that goes into crafting and executing your own research plan. Professor Knobe was the most incredible advisor I could have asked for!",
    "Research is an awesome thing to do if you can find an area that interests you and a professor\/grad student who are happy to help you along the way. If that's the case, then 100% do it!",
    "A really chill way to earn credit for doing 10+ hours of research in a lab each week. Also good for trying to get involved with a specific lab that may later advise you on your thesis!"
