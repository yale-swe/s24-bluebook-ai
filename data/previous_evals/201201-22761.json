   "comments": [
    "Definitely take the class if you've either taken the first three semesters of Latin at Yale or took the AP in high school and need to fulfill your language requirement. It's difficult and the translation takes up a huge amount of time, but it's quite fun and all the work makes the in class discussions much more rewarding. I highly recommend taking Professor Peirano's classes in general!",
    "This course provided good practice reading more complex Latin prose while also exploring the interesting question of invective and insult in literature. Furthermore, Professor Peirano is fantastic and is certainly reason enough to take any course, regardless of its topic.",
    "I'd recommend this class. Watching Cicero insult people is fun and helps you improve your Latin, your understanding of Roman senatorial society, and your understanding of how invective works all at the same time. Classes consist of some in-class translation, followed and interspersed with discussion. You will get help with your grammar if you need it, but there is enough discussion of the texts as literature that it doesn't get boring. Professor Peirano is a delight.",
    "Take it. You have to be willing to work hard and be on top of things pretty much all the time, but it is a very good and enjoyable class."
