   "comments": [
    "Good senior seminar. 3 psets, 1 final project which isn't that difficult, and a tough midterm. Psets are simple, midterm was tough, final project just takes a little time. Definitely would take.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. The material is very interesting, the workload completely manageable, and the class is well-structured and well-paced.",
    "Highly recommended, course is not too heavy on the workload and Arkolakis is a great guy. Covers many models of international finance that were interesting.",
    "A fascinating course taught by a great teacher; Prof. Arkolakis put a lot of effort into making sure our term papers came out well, and I feel like I learned a lot in the process.",
    "i would. very interesting, good amount of work\/blend of work",
    "Yes take it as an econ seminar. No regrets!",
    "It's ok if you need a 400-level to graduate. It's really not too hard although the paper is harder than expected and took a larger chunk of time at the end of the semester. Most people are seniors who don't know or care what they're doing, so there were some juniors who ruined the curve.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. It's a solid introduction to international finance. You will walk away with a better understanding about exchange rate determinants, trade balance and current account dynamics, currency and international financial crises, and other interesting topics related to international finance (see syllabus). If you're going to take this course, start talking to Professor Arkolakis early on about the final paper topic about which you'd like to write.",
    "Recommend",
    "Overall, I would not recommend Econ 407 to a fellow student. While International Finance is certainly an interesting topic, this class was more difficult than expected. Problem sets, while there were only 3 of them, were pretty difficult. Also, the final paper at the end was long, especially because it was 1.5 spaced and hard to write and you are going against a lot of junior econ majors who are overachievers and do more original projects on STATA. Greek chocolate was pretty good."
