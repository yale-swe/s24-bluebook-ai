    "Great overview of cancer epi. Wish there would be more cancer biology.",
    "strengths: covered a wide range of topics, and never got dull because we often learned about two completely different topics in the same week. There was a wonderful overlap with both Epi II\/ Measurement issues which I found to be very beneficial to really hone in on certain conceptsweaknesses: I think that some of the lectures may have been a little challenging for people without a science background to fully understand",
    "The course was very informative and did a good job of covering all aspects of cancer epidemiology. The guest lecturers were extremely interesting.",
    "Great introduction to cancer basics and various types of the most common cancers. The assignments were thought provoking and interesting.",
    "Enjoyed the breadth of topics discussed in this course. As a lot of the lectures are from faculty outside the course, at times some lectures were not as beneficial as others.",
    "Interesting guest lectures, but sometimes too technical instead of focusing on the broader message",
    "I thought this was an extremely interesting and beneficial course that reinforced epidemiological concepts while providing new and interesting information and perspectives on cancer epidemiology.",
    "This course provides a great overview of topics in cancer epidemiology. I liked how the course was structured and most lectures were clear and concise. Dr. Cartmel's presentations were particularly informative. I would have liked a little more discussion (15-20 minutes at the end of class to discuss the readings), but overall the course was very strong."

    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Brenda was great at facilitating knowledge through bringing in speakers with specific knowledge of different cancer types, and she did a great job in her lectures as well providing background and depth about cancer in general.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel was a great instructor. She really wants her students to do well and learn this material.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Has first-hand knowledge about cancer research and selected interesting guest lecture topics.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel is such a sweet, wonderful professor. Her lectures were very interesting, and she chose fantastic speakers to complement the course.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel is very knowledgeable and responsive to students. I always enjoyed attending her lectures and learning about the research that she and other Yale faculty are involved in. She provided hard copies of the lecture notes, which was great since it discouraged laptop use and encouraged student engagement. With her experience in cancer research and personable teaching style, she makes this course interesting and rewarding."
