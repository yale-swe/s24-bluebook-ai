    "I would summarize the course as a tour through the key substantive themes in American Politics with a nice mix of current work and influential concepts. It won't give you everything you need on any one topic, but it'll give you a great sense of what is out there and where you need to go if you want to learn more about it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a foundation understanding of American Politics. I would be more likely to recommend the course with the knowledge than Jacob Hacker is continuing to teach it.",
    "It's a great class if you're interested in the American Politics subfield."

   "comments": [
    "The course helped deepen my knowledge of the profession by presenting material on a variety of important topics. Paired with that type of syllabus, the structure of the written assignments allowed me to pick and choose the topics I thought I wanted to learn more about. (Except that some of my favorite topics were in the last two weeks of the semester, by which point I wanted to be done with the essays.) In the end, I got a nice survey of the discipline and deeper knowledge in several of my areas of interest, which is a great outcome for an introductory course.",
    "I appreciated the relative focus on political development. I'm afraid I might not have been exposed to this field without this class. That said, I have no intention of pursuing its further study."
