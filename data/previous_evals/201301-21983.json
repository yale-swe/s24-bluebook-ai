   "comments": [
    "Good, not great seminar. Snowden is better in lecture halls than in a small room. Readings are long, mainly interesting. Class discussion is not well led. Do not take as your first seminar (you will not be prepared for future seminars\/senior essay).",
    "If you are interested in the topic of the history of malaria, then the seminar will be an enjoyable one. If you have no or only borderline interest, you will probably hate it. It was a nice, small-class setting if you are interested in public health. There is a large amount of reading (~1 book\/week), and there are reading responses for each book, so be prepared to work. The 20 page term paper replaces a final, which is nice, but don't leave the paper to the last week! Professor Snowden nicely organizes the class so that by the second half of the semester, you are mostly jus working on your individual research topic and the paper as opposed to classwork.",
    "Only take this class if you are truly interested in malaria. After a couple of weeks, there is not that much more to discuss.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. With the exception of a term paper, the work load is manageable and it is one of the most interesting and relevant topics in current global health!",
    "A good class that provides an interesting and varied look at the wide impact that malaria has had in global history. Professor Snowden is a kind and knowledgeable professor. Class discussions were not always facilitated in the most fulfilling way, but were still an enjoyable experience. The paper was very fulfilling to work on. Overall, a great choice for a junior HSHM seminar.",
    "Good class",
    "This was a great course and Professor Snowden is a wonderful professor. I was a little bit disappointed that the course did not focus very much on current policy implications and led to very few conclusions regarding malaria in the world today. It became slightly repetitive in the course material, and I would have enjoyed seeing Professor Snowden speak more rather than other students in the class. That being said, it was a wonderful learning opportunity on an interesting subject.",
    "This class is a very comprehensive study of malaria in multiple continents and time periods. It is a reading-intensive class, yet doing the readings allows you to develop your own ways to link the diverse material.",
    "Not the best seminar. Professor Snowden has been teaching this course for a while so we could tell that he was becoming bored with the course itself as well. Many of the readings are long and boring. Take it if you have a specific interest in malaria. The final paper is the biggest chunk of the course so you have the opportunity to explore an aspect in the global crisis of malaria through your paper.",
    "If you are interested in malaria or public health, I think this course would interest you."
