    "Class discussions were often productive but we didnt always discuss all of the readings. I especially enjoyed Kafers Feminist Queer Crip but we usually didnt spend a lot of time talking about the theoretical issues brought up in that book. I enjoyed the classroom culture as well. All the students were very engaged and respectful of each other.",

    "Yes, I hope Yale offers more disability studies courses in the future. Its a field of study that often isnt addressed in other courses",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Disability studies is such an important field that is too often understudied, and Professor Rogers does an excellent job with the contents of her syllabus."
