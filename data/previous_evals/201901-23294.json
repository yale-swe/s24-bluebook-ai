    "How to model groundwater flow and contaminants in groundwater. Basic concepts for groundwater treatment remediation and how to conduct groundwater studies",
    "I improved my understanding of groundwater flow and processes, and was introduced to techniques for modeling these processes. I will now be able to understand groundwater issues and the science that is used to discuss these issues at a higher level than I had before.",
    "Coming from a geology background, I had some knowledge about the geologic characteristics of aquifers, however I did not know anything about the ways that water or contaminants moved through those aquifers. This course taught me the importance of groundwater flow, groundwater quality, and how to model those variables (so cool!)",
    "MODFLOW hydraulic modeling and general understanding of groundwater flow and contamination",
    "Learned how to use groundwater modeling software, which will be very helpful in my future career",
    "We learned about groundwater in a theoretical, concept-based way, as well as applied that knowledge through use of computer models.",
    "I gained a theoretical and practical understanding of hydrological systems. These subsurface systems have direct implications for surface activities, and surface activities have both direct and indirect effects upon these subsurface systems. This class helped me to understand these interactions.",
    "I learned how to evaluate and address some environmental issues related to underground water by quantitatively describing the processes of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. Also, I got familiar with the MODFLOW modeling software.",
    "It was a good introduction to how groundwater and contaminants move and the most common modeling software used to study those.",
    "hydromodeling",
    "I learned about groundwater along with its reference in hydrology and the importance of mapping groundwater flow. The class taught me how to use groundwater flow mapping software such as modelmuse and modflow. It was a very interesting class.",
    "Useful grondwater modeling skills",
    "Principles of groundwater and contaminant movement.",
    "Hydrological modeling skills and insight into issues in hydrology, namely related to fracking and groundwater",
    "I learned how contaminants move through groundwater systems and how water flows through systems. I also learned a new groundwater modeling program, ModelMuse.",
    "Gained understanding of groundwater hydrology, contamination & remediation. Learned how to model groundwater flow, analyze problems, and test solutions in MODFLOW.",
    "The ability to use current groundwater modeling approaches to construct and study the movement of water and contaminants. The class is an introduction only, but you still learn valuable fundamentals in using Modflow and related programs.",

   "comments": [
    "Very well",
    "Not so well. After speaking with professors and classmates from the forestry program, I was under the impression that this class would be highly useful for an aspiring field forester or forest manager. I am not sure that much of what we discussed in class could apply very directly to land management. However, as a student and professional in the natural sciences, I am thrilled that I had the chance to finally take a hydrology class and learn about groundwater flow and management.",
    "This class aligned with, and exceeded my expectations. The assignments directly related to the skills I was building, and gave me resources to look back on when I might use these skills in the future.",
    "Exceeded",
    "aligned well, I learned even more than I thought I would taking this course",
    "Far exceeded. The class was great for a thinking about broad concepts and then applying this concepts in practical settings.",
    "The materials were comprehensive and I got all that I expected from this course. We spent more time than I thought on solving practical hydrological problems with MODFLOW, which was quite rewarding.",
    "I came to the class to learn hydrology. I learned hydrology.",
    "more laid-back and less content than expected",
    "Yes they did",
    "Very well.",
    "Very well!",
    "It was more computer\/modeling focused than I would have liked. I enjoyed the theory most.",
    "Very well! The class goes into depth on all topics mentioned above. By the end I felt confident using MODFLOW, but perhaps would need a bit more practice with it to solve real problems (it's a complex and not very intuitive program).",
    "The course matched my expectations with its focus on modeling as well as some broader discussion about the fundamentals of groundwater behavior.",
    "It aligned well. The combination of lectures and running models was very good.",
    "The skills and insights gained aligned well with my expectations, but I hoped to learn a little more during the semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The assignments were very helpful but some of the instructions for homeworks involving modflow could be improved. The tutorials for modflow were very useful and clearly a lot of work was put into them, but they do need to be expanded a bit more. It's hard to find certain settings\/parameters in Modelmuse and there's a lot of room for error when setting up the model site which causes more downstream errors when you run the models etc. It's also challenging because you can't easily search online for help using modflow\/modelmuse.",
    "Strengths - the lectures. Jim is an incredibly interesting lecturer with a great passion for the material, and it's a blast to listen to him speak about the materials on the whole syllabus. Weaknesses - the homeworks. I know this is an ancient and somewhat useless complaint of students, but I didn't feel that the homework really helped me too much as a hydrologist. Most of what I was doing while working on the Modflow problem sets was fighting with clunky software and trying to find a computer that would run these programs. I felt that my understanding of the concepts of the course may have been better reinforced by balancing out these problem sets by studying for an exam or writing up a case study.",
    "I think the main strength of the class was the way that lectures focused on theory and the homeworks were modeling based. This gave a wide base of learning and application.",
    "More MODFLOW work in class would help to translate the theory to practice of modeling and make the homeworks both more accessible and more meaningful. As it was, we did theory in class and struggled with technology to get homeworks done, so often the actual purpose and result of the model was lost.",
    "I see no weaknesses, I thought the way it was taught was very engaging as well as informative. homeworks were challenging but also manageable",
    "The class was engaging and went at a good pace. There was lots of support on the problem sets and outside of class.",
    "The organization of the course allowed students to access readily the material. The problem sets were helpful exercises in working through the concepts discussed in class. I especially enjoyed juxtaposing concepts with the field studies on which Dr. Saiers, Mario, and other students are working.",
    "This course does a good job of exactly what it promises--it introduces students to the study of how water moves through the ground. I appreciated that Jim made the problem sets related to real-world problems that students will have to solve when we go into the professional world. This class was interesting but not mind-blowing--a good knowledge building course that is relevant for students focusing on water resource management.",
    "add more content",
    "The professor was very enthusiastic and made each lecture fun and engaging. The homework was time-consuming but not too challenging. I liked that there were no exams for the class.",
    "Go more in depth in the content of the course",
    "Really enjoyed the case studies we explored in class. Using MODFLOW is neat, and I respect that it can be difficult to integrate class discussion and homework modeling. I learned from both even though they at times felt disconnected.",
    "There's a high learning curve for the software, and I am not sure how much I will use it in the future. Instead, I liked learning the theory and looking at diagrams of groundwater movement most.",
    "The course content is presented in a clear, well-organized, and digestible way. All in class MODFLOW tutorials were great, and the PDF copies were essential for doing the assignments. I liked that our learning was tested with homework assignments instead of tests and papers, however, I wish there were a few more assignments. The assignments are challenging and doing poorly on one can have a big impact on your grade. It also would have been nice to learn how to work with shapefiles in MODFLOW.",
    "The groundwater modeling was interesting and appropriately challenging. There were times when the tutorials and related materials\/videos could have been better organized to allow students to move\/learn more quickly; this is especially true of the first modflow tutorial which took too many classes (partly because students weren't paying attention during the demonstration). I would suggest more quick videos and students then replicating the work on their own. I enjoyed discussion of the groundwater principles, outside of modeling, but many students lacked familiarity with the fundamentals which made the lectures move slowly. Perhaps requiring students unfamiliar with groundwater to read introductory material would allow the bulk of the lectures to move more quickly and therefore go more deeply into content.",
    "The strength of the class was the combination and models and lectures. The course would have been stronger if we had more assignments and\/or a group project.",
    "Strengths are that there is little assigned reading, class is engaging, and the homeworks reinforced lessons we learned in class. The only weakness is I wish we went into more detail about groundwater hydrology."

    "Think about what you want to get out of the course. Even though Jim is an awesome teacher, you should really have an interest in understanding and modeling groundwater hydrology if you are considering taking this course.",
    "Take it! The assignments take time, but are worth it and rewarding.",
    "Use the MODFLOW tutorials and office hours!",
    "You don't need previous knowledge, it's taught in a very manageable way so that technical things are broken down for you to understand",
    "This is a really great class! The workload is manageable, Dr. Saiers is engaging, and the skills you learn are immediately useful and applicable.",
    "Definitely take it. Dr. Saiers asks provoking questions that force students to consider hydrological systems in new ways.",
    "I would like to recommend this course to students who are interested in hydrology. The knowledge and skills gained from this course would really facilitate relevant research.",
    "If you are going to work with water and need to know how it (or anything that could contaminate it) moves through the ground, you probably should take this class. If not, you probably don't.",

    "Good course for people interested in hydrology and learning about how to model concepts.",
    "It's not easy, but a good way to learn more abotu groundwater systems. B e willing to spend time with a computer program.",
    "This class is great for anyone interested in water or land management. I may not ever use MODFLOW in my career, but it definitely helped me understand the concepts taught in class.",
    "It is a water modeling focused class. If you want to begin to build a concrete skill in using and interacting with groundflow models take this class. If you would like a high level review of the principles of water take \"watersheds\".",
    "Go for office hours and ask Jim any questions you have. He likes helping students.",
    "This class is intended for individuals interested primarily in water. I do not encourage students that are interested in understanding how water relates to land management and wildlife to take this course.",
    "Take it! You'll learn some hydrologic modeling and basic groundwater hydrology concepts and equations."
