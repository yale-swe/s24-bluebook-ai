   "comments": [
    "This was definitely a rigorous course that exponentially increased my Spanish abilities. This class covered a lot of material, and Prof. Leon did an incredible job making sure we all understood what was being taught. I feel like I am at the point in my Spanish education that I would be more than able to just \"survive\" in a Spanish speaking country, but really be able to understand and communicate in an efficient manner.",
    "I learned many advanced grammar topics and improved my ability to speak Spanish. This course also does a wonderful job of allowing students to analyze art and writings in Spanish.",
    "This class covered more complex Spanish grammar and vocabulary. It also emphasized discussing and reading literature.",
    "I definitely walk out of this class having learned so much Spanish, probably more than I learned in 6 years of pre-Yale Spanish. This was my first semester of college Spanish and I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by my ending level of ability. I think I am able to speak nearly fluently now and my writing and grammar have improved exponentially. I am going to Spain this summer and feel confident in my abilities to hold conversations and communicate with Spaniards.",
    "My proficiency in oral communication definitely improved in Spanish through this course.",
    "I learned how to speak, write, read, and understand Spanish at an advanced level.",
    "I feel more confident in my ability to speak Spanish and more confident in reading and writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that this course is a very well rounded Spanish class. We not only spoke and listened to things in Spanish, but we also read original Spanish texts and explored concepts that related to actual culture and ideals of Latin America. The only weakness I could provide is the amount of busy work that came in the form of homework. Some assignments spanned up to 2 hours of just multiple choice and fill in the blank questions which weren't necessarily helpful or exciting.",
    "The L4 Spanish course is so wonderfully organized. You will never be confused as to what is due or what homework you have. The grading system is very fair, and the topics studied are interesting. Professor Leon also does a great job of allowing students to practice their Spanish in class. The biggest weakness was probably the videos and short films from the textbook, which were either childish or strange.",
    "I think the class does a great job of diversifying the class structure and the homework to remain engaging and to teach different skills. I also like how the nightly homework helps solidify the class topics. One weakness is that toward the end of the semester, the amount of homework is so much higher than near the beginning. It could be distributed better.",
    "I think a strength of this course is the daily nature of the class. We have homework pretty much everyday and we are required to talk in class every single day which is the basis of great language learning. I really can't think of many weaknesses for this class.",
    "At times, the online homework felt unnecessarily long.",
    "I think the Spanish Department does a fabulous job of teaching courses methodically, and I really don't think this course could be improved much except by eliminating some homework activities that feel useless (the Supersite videos of Eric and Johnny).",
    "This course does a great job of encouraging students to speak in Spanish consistently and helps to greatly improve speaking skills. It doesn't spend quite as much time working to expand reading and listening skills. Writing is emphasized.",
    "The course had a lot of work in the beginning, from an hour to two of homework per night. The work kind of tapered off, but did not become easier. It was also difficult to know what would be expected of us on assessments."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course with Prof Leon if you are committed to learning Spanish. She is a stern teacher at times, but she tried her very hardest to help you understand the material. It can be intense at times, but the fast paced nature of this class definitely keeps it interesting and fun.",
    "If you really want to know how to speak Spanish, take this course! The L1-L4 Spanish courses are absolutely delightful. Yes, there are lots of daily tasks and assignments, but you really become immersed in the language, and the grading is very fair. All of the L4 professors are wonderful as well (Yale's Spanish dept. may be my favorite on campus!).",
    "I would recommend this class. It teaches the material in a way that is easy to understand and teaches more than grammar.",
    "I think this is the quintessential class to take you from being a good Spanish student to being a Spanish speaker. From talking to a lot of people, L3 and below were very similar to high school classes where a student could get great grades but really not be able speak. However, this class really puts you in an environment where you have to be able to communicate and understand high levels of Spanish. I would most certainly recommend this class to students who are ready to take the next step in Spanish.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need it for your language requirement. It's basically just a lot of busy work and then a little bit of building on what you already know.",
    "Yes! If you're looking to improve your Spanish a) there's no other option but b) this is a great course!",
    "This is a good class to take if you're interested in continuing to learn Spanish. It can have a lot of busy work at times, but it is overall fairly interesting and a lot of feedback is given on how to improve."
