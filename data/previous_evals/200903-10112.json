   "comments": [
    "You get to read a diverse range of articles and writers. You learn to fact-check, write profiles, and short-sketches. A lot of deadlines get pushed around and are at the discretion of the people you're interviewing. It's also really cool to be able to glean knowledge from accomplished writers.",
    "Yes! It's a great opportunity to take a writing class that's a bit more informal than others, and offers some exposure to the world of magazine journalism.",
    "This course is a great way to get to know Magazine Journalism. You skype with current journalists, read their pieces and learn how to do reporting on your own. The only warning i'll give is that you have to rely on other people for your big assignments. Schedule your interviews early. Contact interviewees asap and be prepared to write some drafts with your back against the deadine. Jake is wonderful and is really dedicating to helping you get what you want out of the course.",
    "If you want to take a class with a working journalist then yes, take this class. If you want to improve your own writing, you won't do so drastically. But Jake gives a lot of good industry advice too.",
    "Absolutely! This class is for three kinds of people: those who want to hone their skills at writing stories of magazine length (1500-5000 words) and tinker with their style, those who have had very little journalistic experience but love to write and want to see if they enjoy writing in a journalistic mode, and those looking for a small, fun writing seminar. This is a great course with a great, laid-back instructor who goes by his first name and cares about what you have to say.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who would like to pursue a career in journalism; you will make great contacts and learn from industry experts. That said, if you don't plan on making your career in the field, the class can be somewhat tedious. Be prepared for creative writing assignments, but a hugely unorganized class. Professor Halpern loves himself and makes this apparent throughout the class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if it were offered again. Prof. Halpern is wonderful: he is very approachable and helps with any problems in your own writing. He brought in tons of other journalists to talk to us, and our assignments were great.",
    "This course was delightfully practical! None of that bollocks essay-writing--we were out in the field, getting dirty. I thought that the seminar format was also really helpful to getting feedback and advice on writing and how to craft a piece.The guest speakers at every seminar meeting were awesome. It was really cool to see the variety of journalistic styles and to hear the writers' crazy anecdotes, and it was helpful to ask their advice on various issues as they cropped up during the semester.My one concern about the course was how the workload was not evenly-balanced. There was nothing wrong with that (other than obvious end-of-semester frustrations) except for the lack of forewarning...the situation kind of crept up on the whole class and we thought we were going to flip out, having to turn in every single graded piece on the last possible day.Overall, though, this course was a lot of fun and I would recommend it to students who love to write, even if they haven't tried journalism before.",
    "The class familiarizes you with current magazine writers while you analyze what makes their pieces work and what doesn't work. You also will work on your own writing in small pieces before working on three longer articles. I would definitely recommend the class to people thinking about careers in magazine journalism.",
    "If you love to write, take it.",
    "This class was amazing! We got to talk to tons of famous writers in person and on Skype, write fascinating articles about being embedded with New Haven city workers, and read New Yorker articles for homework. Professor Halpern was so truly dedicated to the class, always available for help outside of the classroom; he offered really substantive comments on all of our work."
