    "you're taking it because you have to. for being a class about WATER, it's the DRYest subject material in the world.",
    "I would recommend it to a student interesting in chemistry. It has real life practicality and is not too difficult.",
    "I loved this course. The course material was very interesting and taught (in my point of view) in an understandable manner. The problem sets went over the material from the week and were a bit tedious (although the problems in general easily get this way as they often involve a good bit of repetition), but they were never boring or overly complicated. Professor Benoit was very understanding about student concerns and time constraints and tried to work around these. Overall, a very good course. I very much enjoyed when the course material was brought into real life concepts and the only way I can think to improve the course would be to do this a bit more (although it is already a part of the course).",
    "Kind of boring in the beginning because all you do is calculations. But then you learn to love calculations and you realize how cool the graphs are."
