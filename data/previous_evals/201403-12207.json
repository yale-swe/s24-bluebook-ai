   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic course. The material may seem dry at first, but if you put in the effort, you will be amazed at the depth and richness buried in the great texts of history and politics. It is a lot of work, but the books are worth it, and the course is definitely worth taking.",
    "I would summarize this as a survey course in many histories and political treatises from writers from classical antiquity to the medieval period. I wouldn't recommend this course to another student because it is very tedious with the exorbitant amount of reading and unfulfilling writing assignments.",
    "I found the literature we read in this class to be less accessible than the readings in the other two DS courses. I would have liked to have more historical context to the works we read this semester--especially the more philosophical works. That said, I loved reading some of the more philosophical works through the lens of historical and political thought. I also feel that I grew tremendously as a writer in this class.",
    "I would recommend it, but with reservations. Take it if you are a serious student that is committed to completing the readings, reviewing the works, and genuinely want a solid foundation in the humanities. Students in Historical and Political Thought, as with any DS class, should not procrastinate on writing essays or readings. As a student, there also is the responsibility of checking in and making sure you are \"getting it.\" There are great resources online that can aid comprehension and analysis of the works.",
    "If they want to do DS, there is no reason to dislike H&P.",
    "This class can be summarized as a fairly broad but intense survey course of Western Historical and Political Thought. The readings, discussions, and lectures were all very interesting and worthwhile. Overall, a great class and I would highly recommend it to all.",
    "Yes I would recommend. Cultivates a private relationship with historical & political thought ... not as a scholarly field but as the science of peoples & their nature.",
    "DS is usually billed as a tour of the Western canon, and I think that the tour metaphor is actually quite apt. First, as with any tour, you must keep in mind that you are seeing highlights, a selection of sights based on what has survived. However, these books did not endure because they were superior to their peers; they endured due to a lot of factors that don't say anything about their quality. Second, the books on this syllabus are indeed like the Leaning Tower of Pisa or Mount Rushmore or the Eiffel Tower because they are landmarks that I first encountered in the form of a cartoon or an off-hand reference on a TV show rather than as a monument erected for a specific reason in a specific place at a specific time. I knew the books on this list by the cultural memes and one-liner summaries that they spawned, and it was exhilarating to get to read the books for myself and see what had been diluted or filtered out by the time I first heard about these books. For example, I first met Emperor Nero as the figure on the Little Nero pizza boxes in the movie, Home Alone, but after reading about the horrors of Neros regime in Tactiuss Annals, I can no longer just shrug off the implications of featuring that particular historical character in a pizza brand. I would recommend DS Fall Historical and Political Thought as long as the student is committed to reading every page of these works. You dont have to read every page with the same attention to detail and not every page will be equally annotated, but one of the skills that DS teaches is sensitivity to density and significance, (ie learning which passages to skim and which passages to explicate) and you can only acquire this capacity if you read the works in their entirety.",
    "All in all, H&P with Professor Thompson was the most rewarding DS section I had. Professor Thompson encouraged us students to maintain a flowing discussion among ourselves, while she used her few interruptions to keep us well focused. She was also clear with the necessary and possible approaches to the formalities of essays and seminars. If you are willing to do the readings, her section will guarantee focused discussions and clear directions on formalities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student who is interested in history and politics but does not have a background in Plato, Aristotle, or other historians and political thinkers. We cover many thinkers, go in-depth in important areas, show connections between thinkers, and have really great paper prompts to answer!"
