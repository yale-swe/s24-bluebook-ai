    "Interesting survey class. Easy for non-architecture majors, required for architecture majors. Gives you a language with which to discuss architecture and a new way to look at the structures we inhabit every day. Readings aren't really required or discussed, you'll have to push yourself to learn to draw. You won't know how you're doing until you receive your final grade because the only grades are 2 projects, weekly drawings, and an essay, none of which we received grades for.",
    "Great class for those who want to major in architecture and for those who don't. With no tests, finals, or papers it really could be taken as a gut by a non-major. Weekly drawing assignments w\/ one day of section a week. This class is 2 lectures a week. You can put as much or as little as you would like into the drawings.",
    "Intro architecture is a great lecture for anyone even remotely interested in architecture or drawing and buildings. We only have weekly sketch assignments and one short paper and one final project (or a paper). It's fun and a nice break from problem sets and papers in other classes",
    "If you are interested in architecture as a major, you obviously have to take this class. If not, I still highly recommend it. The lectures and readings (which you never have to do because they are referenced in almost none of the assignments) are general enough to be accessible but detailed enough to convey the passion of architecture.The workload is very manageable - one sketchbook assignment a week, though there are one model-building project, one group project, and the final project (design a lampshade made of paper), which can be all-nighters depending on how much you care about the work and how well you plan ahead. The results of the final project, though, are very beautiful, and it is fantastic to see the designs of all your classmates, even those who are not artistically inclined, come to life.",
    "If you have ever had any interest or curiosity for architecture take the class. The lectures were engaging and on a variety of subjects, the readings were interesting (though you probably won't do all of them) and the assignments were fun. While the time commitment is at times a bit more, you will be compelled to do the assignment well anyway.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's very eye opening--I feel like I see everyday things so differently now.",
    "It's a good class. I took it as a 5th class, credit-D-fail. It was definitely very manageable, but be prepared to put some time into a few of the homework assignments.",
    "Great course. For me, I took it because I wanted to try something different. Be ready to do a lot of drawing. It can be very rewarding, but also tough when you go into section and see how good everyone else's drawings are. You don't really have to do the readings.",
    "I would recommend this course. Great summary of different architecture themes. I loved the sketchbook assignments. The projects were challenging but fun, and you could invest as much time in as the effort you have.",
    "I have no artistic\/architectural capabilities, but I enjoyed this class as a Cr\/D option. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone--humanities or science nerds a like will find this class enjoyable!!! Prof. Purves is so great to listen to, and the readings are extraordinary.",
    "If you love drawing and are interested in learning more about space and about how buildings work (aesthetically, functionally, etc) this is an amazing class -- I took it as a senior and it was a great way to relax and have fun while trying out a new discipline",
    "I really enjoyed intro arch. Generally liked the homework assignments (except for a couple) and actually really liked lecture. It was really easy material that you kind of already knew, but was interesting to learn more about.",
    "Great lecture, even if you're not a potential architecture major. Prof. Purves is an awesome lecturer and teaches so much. You walk out every day noticing things you didn't notice before. Changes your view on the environment that surrounds you.",
    "Architecture 150 is a great opportunity to begin to understand architectural theory and history. The focus of the work is not on the academic aspects of Architecture but rather the practical and creative growth in Architecture. I would absolutely recommend this class to a classmate whether or not that person plans to pursue architecture.",
    "Great survey of architecture. Purves\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lectures are great. He goes through all of the topics in architecture in a way that makes sense to someone who has never studied anything architecture related. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a junior majoring in something else, but I enjoyed this class a lot.Be forewarned, there is a lot of drawing. Basically, all of the assignments involve drawing. So, you have to be happy spending a few hours just sketching each week.I found the readings kind of abstract and inaccessible. But they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a huge part of the course.",
    "Definitely take this class!!! Regardless of whether or not you think you can draw. If you really feel like you can't draw, take it credit\/D because Prof. Purves is a fantastic lecturer and the classes are really worth going to. I found the examples of New Haven \/ Yale architecture to be especially interesting since after leaving class you could walk around and look at the buildings with new perspective. You won't learn much about specific periods of architecture, but you will learn about light, form, structure, and other fundamental concepts in architecture. Again, can't recommend this class more.",
    "A great class to draw buildings around campus and learn about architectural structures. Don't have to do the readings although they are interesting and there are not that many assignments. The final project is really difficult however and the crit is tough. Take it if you want to put in the work.",
    "Great lectures with interesting drawing assignments.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have even a remote interest in architecture or drawing. Assignments are almost all in the sketchbook. Lecture is stimulating. Don't be worried if you are a compsci physics or engineering major - most of my section was too!",
    "An EXCELLENT introduction to architectural principles and design. Professor Purves is AMAZING. You will not regret you took this course.",
    "Amazing class. Great lectures (though they were a little early in the morning), really cool assignments, and good critiques by TAs. One of the best parts about it was definitely the way it impacted just walking around campus - especially because we often used Yale buildings as examples of the different parts of architecture we talked about. This really does make you see a whole lot more than you did before. Section was also cool because you could see what other people did with the assignment. I saw my drawing, building, and spatial thinking skills improve so much just in the space of a semester, and everyone's growth was visible in the work they did in section too. This class made me even consider the major when I had no idea what the subject was about before, but since the major is so tough and has a ton of requirements, I decided against doing it. Even so, I'm definitely taking more classes in this department because this was SO AWESOME.",
    "Weekly sketch assignments, one 3-page paper, and 2 projects. For anyone who has an interest in architecture, it is worth taking. You show your sketches at section and no matter how much time or effort you put into the assignment, there is always something wrong with it. Professor Purves shows a lot of Yale architecture in lecture - you will gain a greater appreciation for the buildings around campus. If you want a break from reading responses\/problem sets\/papers, take this class with an open mind and it will be a lot of fun.",
    "ARCH 150 is definitely one of those \"take before you graduate\" classes. The professor is incredible, as are the TF's. The class is very eye opening, and helps you see buildings in a new way, especially those on campus. So worth the 9:25am start!",
    "Typical introductory class, but with horrible sections. The drawing assignments, however, can be fun.",
    "definitely take it even if you don't want to major in architecture",
    "strongly recommend for anyone interested in architecture",
    "Veryrefreshing and enlightening class for a non-art\/non-architecture student. But its important to have serious TAs. My TAs were extremely irresponsible, did not teach us anything, did not give us thorough assessments, they even forgot to ask for our final notebooks at the end of the year, so my experience was severely damaged as a result.",
    "You get to sketch and write one paper! Think visually! It's a class I;m really happy I took.",
    "Recommended, but consider Cr\/D due to the grading uncertainties. ARCH150 helps you develop a different system of tracking and recording your thoughts than is taught in other departments.",
    "The class is a great introduction to certain aspects of Architecture. However, very little of the architectural theory and history from the lectures was used in assignments, and section felt more like a drawing exercise than anything to do with Architecture.",
    "ARCH 150 was a great class that I would definitely recommend. Obviously, it is a requirement of the architecture major, but even for someone considering a major in architecture, or for someone simply interested in the subject with no intention of majoring in it, this class is interesting, easy to follow understand and enjoy, applicable in life, and teaches useful skills.",
    "I recommend this course for all majors who are interested in design, buildings, or cities, and who want to exercise their ability to visualize space, to render what you see with different mediums, or to make connection between form and function.",
    "It was a great lecture class. Even if it's your first architecture class, or your fifth, it'll still be incredibly interesting and will change the way you see \/ think about spaces.",
    "yeah, its a really good class definitely take it. probably not even that much work if you start the drawings and projects before the last minute. this is a class where you get out what you put in. i put in the bare minimum amount of effort and wish i would've really got into this class, so... take that as you will. good class",
    "I shopped this class last minute to fill my schedule and would highly recommend it to anyone who does not abhor drawing. I took it not intending to pursue architecture as a major and was amazed at how it still applied and informed other classes I was taking. It applied to my environmental studies class in the context of land use history and it improved my analysis of the built environment in an american studies class. Through this class I learned to notice and appreciate the environment around me--built and natural.",
    "Yes, i would definitely recommend this course. It is very comprehension to understand the basics of architecture.",
    "Arch 150 is a nice introduction to what aspects go into the planning of architectural works. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take it if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care enough to get up for the class. While you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never really be tested or graded or anything on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the lecture, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll miss what is the actual meat of the course. The drawing assignments almost always take way longer than you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think, so try to start them early. That way, they will actually be fun. Start them like Thursday night and the course just becomes stressful and annoying.",
    "If you are at all intereste in architecture you should take this class. The workload isn't too bad, the lectures are interesting, the TAs were great, and it gives you a better eye through which you Can appreciate Yale's beautiful architecture.",
    "Professor Purves is a god among men. Take the class.And do the reading. Even if you don't have to.",
    "yes . Good course for anyone who is interested in architecture , real estate , urban planning etc etc"
