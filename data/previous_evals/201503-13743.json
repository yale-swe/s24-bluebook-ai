    "A class that's incredibly interesting about a very unique topic, and worth taking if you have any interest in english or reading or writing or stories",
    "Absolutely take this class! Seriously, do it. It is an amazing class and you will leave with a ton of new favorite readings and short stories and as a much better writer. There are weekly readings and two writing assignments that are not too intensive and generally fun. I would have been very upset if I had missed out on this course. I looked forward to it every week!",
    "a great study on fiction; such diverse works, all beautiful. never felt like a burden to go to class, everyone was engaged and it was so lovely!",
    "This is a class that focuses on magic and myth in literature, and how you can use similar techniques in your writing. You read great authors, but don't write that much. I would recommend it to a student who enjoys reading magical writing, because that is the majority of what you will be doing in this class.",
    "A great intro to creative writing with low cause of stress",
    "This course blends workshop and analysis incredibly well. Courtney is an amazing professor: so smart, thoughtful, and committed to making every one of her students' stories stronger. I've never received so much in-depth, valuable feedback on my work from any other professor. And the readings are so so great, too. Take the class; it's such a gem!",
    "Highly recommend to anyone interested in bettering their creative writing skills or looking to expand their reading and writing genre horizons."
