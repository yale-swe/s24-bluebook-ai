   "comments": [
    "I felt I knew the faculty well after the course but not the profession so much. It would have been nice to have a bit more of an introduction to American Studies- a history of the field, necessary readings, etc.",
    "I respect the hesitancy to define a canon of disciplinary texts central to American Studies as a field. Nevertheless, there are trends at play in our interdisciplinary discipline and I think it would be helpful to incorporate more interdisciplinary discipline training\/reading in the course. I am thinking here of key eras (myth and symbol) and publications (Cultures of US Imperialism). While we can argue against any one text being considered canonical at the expense of another, it is unreasonable to deny that there is a terrain to the field of American Studies that has been marked by certain authors, concepts, and publications.I am looking forward to Matt Jacobson's US Cultural Historiography course next term; its structure, assignments, and the skill set (e.g., reading practices especially) it develops seem vital to graduate level success in American Studies."
