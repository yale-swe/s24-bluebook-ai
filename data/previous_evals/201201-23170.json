    "Margaret Clark is super nice and clearly an expert in her field, but the class was a little disorganized. Lectures weren't great--I never understood what she was talking about. Interesting information (although much of it was common sense), but it wasn't presented in a great way. Four exams and a paper, no final. Exams were fair and paper was simple to write.",
    "Easy class, to the point of possibly being not worth taking. The material is really interesting, but sometimes it felt far too obvious. Emotionally intelligent people will know almost all of this already; the textbook just gives formal names\/studies to back up phenomena most people notice already. Lectures were boring, but it was an easy fifth if that's what you're looking for.",
    "I recommend it if you need classes for your psychology major. If you are not looking for a psychology class I do not recommend it, it is very boring.",
    "Amazing class! Thus far, my favorite class at Yale. Very interesting and if you study sufficiently for the exams they are fair. Professor Clark is awesome and it's a really cool class.",
    "Very good class, isn't overly difficult as long as you do the readings, tests ask very specific questions but you can prepare accordingly after getting a feel from the first test which can be counted for less",
    "Covers highly interesting material that is relevant to a college-age population. Could have been better organized, but overall a not too hard and interesting course. Take it!",
    "I would recommend it as a Credit\/D class. Some test questions are confusing, and grading is was a little unclear until the end of the course. However, the information is interesting and easy to understand.",
    "Psyc 126 is a terrific course. If you have any interest in psychology or in the way that we form and maintain relationships (of all kinds), and the effect those relationships have on our lives, then you should take this course. The textbook is AMAZING, and the reading assignments are not too long or difficult. Lecture is dry, but Professor Clark is really nice and likable and the content is really fascinating (the course content is not boring, just the way that it is presented is dry). The project was really fun. Exams also were fair--just study up on the lecture slides and readings. The course is kind of what you make of it, but I definitely loved it and if this appeals to you at all then taking it is a no-brainer.",
    "The topic is pretty interesting, but isn't exactly the most enjoyable especially if you want a gut. You have to do all of the reading for the tests (which isn't a ton), which honestly makes the classes more interesting, but caught a lot ofpeople off guard especially at the beginning. The grading is pretty generous, but the lectures aren't the most engaging.",
    "Yes, very fun psych class, especially for psych majors who love this stuff.",
    "This course is demanding but worth while. You will learn an incredible amount about romance, desire, friendship, personality, and sociality in general. This course helps you to be a better relationship partner and to build a more meaningful social life for yourself. This is not a gut-- the 4 exams and a paper will definitely keep you on your toes. However, as long as you keep up with the reading (which is extremely manageable) you won't struggle with the workload at all. I would recommend this class if you are curious about the human social existence and want to understand how your social experiences compare to others and what may be driving your decisions about how you interact with the important people in your life. The course is really a lot of fun!",
    "I would recommend psych 126 to another student. The work load is totally manageable although you have to do the readings to do well on the exams. The professor really knows her stuff and cares so much about helping everyone do well on the course and letting you know where you stand grade-wise. The class can be easy to zone off in but the lecture slides give you much of the info you need and if you listen the topics are great. One suggestion, if you want to meet with the professor, be persistent. She's very busy and can sometimes be hard to get a hold of but it's worth it for the help she'll give you when you do meet.",
    "Definitely shop it and take it if you like the first few lectures. The book is well written and very interesting and the research paper at the end is fun! 4 non-cumulative tests and a 5 page paper so there's a lot of continuous work but not a lot at any point of time.",
    "This class is not a gut if that is what you are looking for. A very interesting course, especially the book. Take it if you are genuinely interested in relational psychology",
    "You get to read a book that covers absolutely fascinating material, but it's accompanied by horrific lectures. They are slow and dull, and only occasionally cover topics that the book doesn't explain far more in-depth and in a clearer fashion. The prof is smart though - the exam questions are 50% book and 50% lecture, so you are kind of forced to go to lecture. However, the exams are pretty fun: there are 4 of them, all non-cumulative, multiple choice and short answer.You also have to write a really easy paper, no more than 1000 wordsAll in all though, I would recommend it. You learn useful stuff (from the book), and the grading and workload are fairly easy",
    "I honestly would only recommend it to someone with a vested interest in relationship psychology. Otherwise it will get boring fast, especially if you don't really believe in the effectiveness of trying to quantify something as nebulous as relationships.",
    "This course did an impressive job of bestowing legitimacy onto a topic that many people likely don't take very seriously at first. The lectures did a good job of both presenting illustrative studies and summarizing the key points instead of simply doing one or the other. It would have been helpful if the lectures followed the textbook readings a little more closely--sometimes the lecture would present a concept during one test period, only to have the textbook readings present the same concept during the next test period.4 tests (non-cumulative, no final; 1 data analysis project",
    "I liked the class. You really need to do the reading, but there is not that much and it is usually pretty interesting. The lectures are not that great, but you do not need to go really.",
    "I recommend this course. The professor takes heavy measures to ensure her students' success.",
    "I picked this class because the topic sounded really interesting. unfortunately, the lectures really weren't. The textbook was actually the best part. by the end of the semester, lecture attendance was way down, which to me is all the indication you need that the class wasn't as great as people were hoping.",
    "This was my first psychology course at Yale, and I very much enjoyed it - the material both in lectures and readings was interesting and definitely relevant to everyday life and relationships in general. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student; though the tests were tricky at times, once I got the hang of the types of questions it became a straightforward and entertaining social science course.",
    "i wouldnt recommend it",
    "Not unless you're willing to do all of the readings. Boring lecture, a lot of readings, and the tests are 75% outside readings.",
    "It was a very fast paced intro level course. Interesting material and readings.I wouldn't recommend this class for another student. The material sounds fascinating, but it becomes very dry. It is an intro level course so it is a lot of material with little time spent covering each.",
    "The course gives great information on relationships that is extremely interesting. I'd recommend taking the class because the information gained is great to apply to everyday life. It made me reevaluate my relationships with my friends and family, and my behavior towards other people. However, the grading seemed ambiguous all semester and students didn't receive perceived grades or course standings until the last week of class. The midterms vary in difficulty, so nobody should go in expecting an A from Professor Clark.",
    "It's a pretty interesting class if you base it on the readings (Intimate Relationships, Miller- a very good textbook!! Very easy to understand and to relate to!!) but otherwise it can be pretty boring. It doesn't have a final though, and the tests were relatively simple. Also, the final project was actually really interesting and fun (you come up with a hypothesis in relationship science that you'd like to test, then you conduct a series of surveys and studies and see if your hypothesis is supported).",
    "I'd recommend the class if you're looking for diversity in your schedule, as I was. The amount of coursework isn't terrible, but be prepared to study (quite a bit) for four tests throughout the semester and write a final paper. Tests are not cumulative though, so that helps. Prof. Clark is really nice but sometimes the lectures are really boring because we just need to learn\/memorize data.",
    "A lot of overlap with Psych 150 Social Psych, just a warning.",
    "A nice way to get to know your habits. I found it interesting, but do not underestimate the class. The specificity of the questions can be surprising.",
    "The material is really interesting and the textbook is great (if a little expensive), but it needs a lot of work to be a more effectively taught class.",
    "The professor is quite boring and nothing really gets said by the end of lecture, but the book is interesting.",
    "Interesting course, most of which is common-sense and you probably already know if you have social interactions at all. It was cool to be able to use psychological terms to explain these common-sense phenomenon though, and great to see how your everyday observations are supported by psych studies. Course is extremely manageable - 4 exams (all MC, very reasonable and easy to do well on), one 5-page paper that involves evaluating your own hypothesis about attractions and relationships (super easy to do as well). Take this class if you need a 5th class that won't be too stressful. Reading the textbook was like reading a Cosmo magazine or something..enjoyable.",
    "If you need an easy class with minimal work\/studying required, this is a good class. However, don't expect lectures to be super fun. I was considering being a psych major before this class. Now I'm not.",
    "I would not recommend this class. While the material is interesting from a social psychology perspective, the course was extremely poorly organized, making it hard to engage with the material.",
    "Messy slides, tests that unfairly depict my understanding of the material, yet a fun textbook and an interesting clicker-based aspect of the class. I would recommend this class to people who can't get into any other psyc classes, whether that means without PSYC 110 or because the others are full. Otherwise, do not take this class.",
    "A great course on a subject that influences everyone's life. All the material is interesting and relevant, so you can't be bored. I find that it has helped me realize why my relationships with people are the way that they are. The class is taught very well and actually presents and tests the material in a way that allows you to learn a lot and do well if you put a reasonable amount of time and effort in. Probably less work assigned than in other classes, but because its all interesting and relevant to the course, I end up doing the same amount of work and reading for this class as other classes, because I actually want to and know that the reading is important for the class and exams.",
    "Take it! It's lovely to get to know the info.",
    "This was a great class to take credit\/d. Interesting material, you don't really need to go to lecture.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! You will learn a lot about the nature of relationships!",
    "Do not be enticed by the clickers.",
    "Yes.",
    "Good class, fun, easy, and VERY relevant to life! Prof says it's not a how-to class but it definitely helps in the relationship department :)",
    "I expected this class to be fun, but I was disappointed by how boring the class was.",
    "Good class, not very hard just 4 tests and paper",
    "Attraction and relationships was a fun class to take. The book by Miller is a very interesting read and the material covered in class is relevant to most people. The workload is reasonable. With four exams (no midterm\/final) and a research paper (only 5 pages long) the class is not difficult. The class is open to non-psychology majors as well.",
    "YES!! I loved this class. So fun, not that much work, and the subject matter is extremely interesting. It is cool to evaluate your relationships with what you learn in this class. It actually helps you be a better friend and significant other.",
    "I would recommend the class. A lot of the information is common sense or easy to grasp.",
    "yes",
    "It is a course filled with interesting and revelvant material. I would recommend it because it is very applicable to every students life.",
    "Honestly, I thought this class was a waste of time. It's a nice idea, but lectures were boring and the exam questions were trivial (more designed to see if you did the reading and came to class than to see if you understood the topic). It was an easy class, but I'm still annoyed that Iwasted a credit on it.The text book was decent though (Intimate Relationships by Rowland Miller), but I wish I'd just read it on my own instead of taking the class.",
    "Lecture, four exams, textbook reading, and a short paper. The textbook was relatively interesting, kind of like reading a dating magazine but with psychological science, and the readings were short. The paper was also easy.",
    "good class",
    "Psych 126 is taught exactly like an intro psych course should be taught. There is a ton of help if you want\/need it and tests and readings are totally doable. In fact, the book was so interesting! It was something I would pick up in my spare time as light reading--no kidding. Everyone should read it whether they take this class or not. I absolutely recommend taking this class though. The grade break down makes it easy to do well, 4 non-cumulative tests and a 5 page paper, each 20%.",
    "I recommend taking this class if you're interested in learning about attraction -- I took the class C\/D and really enjoyed it.",
    "Awesome class. So applicable to life. Fun to read and study for. TAKE IT.",
    "boring",
    "The book is phenomenal. The material is interesting. Easy class. Just not taught terribly well. Wished it was more interesting",
    "Psych 126 was a really good introductory course into a very specific area of psychology. The concepts were really interesting (and applied to relationships outside of romantic ones). The readings and course book were very easy to read. The midterms were very straightforward, as was the project. In fact, the only frustrating thing about this course would be some of the lectures which seemed a bit unorganized. Professor Clark isa good professor and was very helpful, especially when it came to the project. There were some lectures though where more time was spent on fixing the \"clicker questions\" rather than going through the actual powerpoint. Overall, the class wasn't bad, in fact it was a pretty interesting \"gut\" class, so if you really need a SO credit, this might be a good pick.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because it's extremely applicable to everyday life in addition to being interesting. Not too challenging for people who have not taken psychology before.",
    "No. Do not take this.",
    "Attractions and Relationships is a great way to analyze relationships and learn about how individual actions and personal qualities impact and determine relationships. I would recommend the course because it makes you think about your own relationships as well."
