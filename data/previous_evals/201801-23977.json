   "comments": [
    "Ok. Interesting material but very basic. Would be stronger if we went deeper and learned more about women and children.",
    "Covers interesting topics, but could be a lot more culturally sensitive.",
    "It's a very important course about a very interesting topic, but the lecture format and the slides were sometimes a bit dry. The assignments kind of brought us out of our routine which was nice. Overall, it was a really good course but I wish it was just a bit more engaging with more course discussion.",
    "I liked the assignments. They were all very interesting! I didnt like the assigned readings.",
    "This course provided a good overview of major maternal and child health issues in the United States. It was interesting and informative, with assignments that provided more concrete and transferable skills than many other HPM courses.",
    "Strengths: - Professor was excellent. I came away from this course knowing important concepts about maternal & child health that I know will be so valuable as I move forward. - Lectures were engaging. In particular, I appreciated the no laptop policy and the fact that the professor and TA provided hard copies of the slides so that we could follow along and take notes. - Assignments allowed us to apply concepts learned. Weaknesses: - Only weakness I could identify was the timing of the final two assignments. Final draft of testimony and final exam were in the same week, which became a little overwhelming on top of work from other classes and the thesis. I think it may be beneficial to space these out more (perhaps by having the draft of the testimony that was due two weeks prior as the final)",
    "It would be interesting and beneficial to add in a community-based component to the course where we would get to go to different sites.",
    "The structure in which this class is taught leaves students wanting. While I understand there is a lot of material to be learned, a powerpoint and lecture style classroom for 2 hours is not engaging. I did appreciate the class assignments as they are good deliverables.",
    "Great introductory class to maternal and child health. Professor Lee is a fantastic lecturer! In terms of workload- if the timeline of the assignments had been moved up earlier it would have been easier to manage during finals. The first assignment wasn't due until March and could be moved up to some time in February. This way the due date for the last assignment doesn't fall around the same time as the final exam. It also would have been nice to have a chance to discuss everyone's testimonies, seeing as they are such a big chunk of the grade. The final exam itself didn't seem to be representative of the class. There is just so much information given throughout the semester (which we also don't really use for the reports either) and to have to regurgitate for an exam seems silly. Overall, a very enjoyable course.",
    "enjoyed the assignments, felt they were useful and graded fairly. Glad we had class discussions to go over assignments as it was very interesting to hear other students work. Final exam seemed really arbitrary. Would recommend doing 4 projects instead of 3 and exam. If concern is knowing basics, i.e. low birthweight threshold, have an assignment in the first month of class that focuses on this. I respect the no laptop rule, but do not print out slides. Having them online is enough. Felt like a huge waste of paper and not worth the TAs time.",
    "Great course, very thorough and engaging instruction. I really enjoyed taking it.",
    "In general relevant and interesting topics and helpful assignments The printed handouts are not very environmental friendly. Plus, no laptops at all is a rigid requirement. I suggest restricting laptop use to only class related activities (no checking email or do other social website chat or shopping should be allowed), but laptops can be used for taking notes or searching for definition and relevant info. No introduction of each student at the beginning of the semester, no finished introduction even at the end of the semester Little chance to interact with fellow students. The workload is greater\/much greater than other class (three written paper with one final exam). Can change one of the assignment to a group project in the future",
    "I really felt like I was able to get a better understanding of laws that affect women and children in the USA. I found the topic on immigrant health very refreshing because I feel like that is not focused on very much. I also appreciated the opportunity to be able to learn how to write a testimony. It could be improved on being a bit more interactive instead of just listing off facts. Studying for the final was very challenging because there was so much information and it was hard to know what would be prioritized. It also would be important for us to dedicate more time to marginalized communities and the disparities they face in the realm of women and children."

    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Good, caring, but didn't really teach anything other than basic material that most people interested in the subject area would already know.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Clearly passionate, but needs to use less personal anecdotes as well as be more culturally competent, particularly in reference to race\/ethnicity.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Dr. Lee was really nice and informative, she really knows her stuff. Sometimes the course was a bit dry because of her lecture format, but other than that she was a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Very kind and passionate!",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She cares a lot about her students and adjusted the course to student feedback and current events very effectively. She is always coming from a good place and is a well organized lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0The instructor was excellent. I learned a lot from this course.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Strengths: - Warm, approachable, and very knowledgeable, which made both learning about and discussing these topics meaningful. - 5-minute break in between the two hours for lecture was helpful for concentration. Weaknesses: - Wish that there were more opportunities for roundtable discussions, similar to what we had when discussing our assignments.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She was very flexible with the schedule and brought in a very good guest lecturers.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Clearly very passionate about her work. Approachable and encouraged student participation. Some lectures were very repetitive.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She is so knowledgeable and genuinely cares about her students taking away lessons from the course. She is passionate about the class and that shows in her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0In general, great, passionate and focus However, felt there were always to much to cover than time allows.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Teacher welcomed questions for the most part. Appreciated how she was very passionate about the topic. Just a greater focus on issues that marginalized communities face would be vital (i.e. more on health of undocumented immigrants, racial disparities in various domains of health) and handling these topics with acute sensitivity. However, I appreciated that when there were moments of oversight she was open to making changes. Sometimes the feedback on certain assignments didn't feel the most relevant\/helpful (i.e. comments on grammar versus content)"

   "comments": [
    "Not recommend unless you have no existing knowledge about the health of women and children.",
    "Provides a good overview of governmental structures and issues. Overall more work than I would have liked. The assignments focus too much on aesthetics\/graphics. I spent far more time trying to figure out how to format my briefs than I did on the content, which would have been more useful and educational.",
    "It was a nice course, I'd definitely recommend for anyone very interested in maternal\/child health. It might be a little dry for anyone who's not really interested.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "This course has a low workload but high learning to be gained - the professor did a great job breaking down complex topics to make them digestible and creating interesting and relevant assignments for the real world. Great for students who want to pursue a career in MCH, and also for those who are just personally interested in the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students.",
    "Take this course. You will learn a lot of valuable concepts and trends regarding maternal and child health in the United States, as well as public health efforts toward improving maternal and child health.",
    "I would recommend! This is essential information for everyone interested in health policy. I would especially recommend for men as our class was entirely women (despite the fact most policymakers are men).",
    "Definitely! One of my favorite courses at Yale so far",
    "Great course, but expect heavy workload with no laptop access during the class I would recommend the class",
    "Overall, learned a lot of factual information about the history of laws pertaining to health of women and children. Unfortunately, I cannot say I would recommend it because it was hard to know what to study for on the exam, the information was not presented in an engaging way most of the time (mostly listing off facts), it could have been more interactive, and there were some moments of oversight (but still appreciate her willingness to acknowledge that)."
