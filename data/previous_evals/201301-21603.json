   "comments": [
    "Take it! You'll hear it be described as one of the \"softer\" MCDB classes, but that's not really the case (at least not you think it means). Nowhere near as intense as cell bio or anything, but still challenging and interesting enough to keep you in line for the whole semester. Two midterms, homework, quizzes (those two are annoying...), and a final, so pretty standard. Professors and TAs are great for the most part. Bacteria are cool! Yay!",
    "Take it if you want an upper level MCDB course. The workload is manageable and the midterms are not too difficult.",
    "really good class. should take!",
    "If you're interested in biology then yes! This is a great course on a very interesting topic. You learn a lot about different ways of studying microbes and about how microbes interact with humans.",
    "This is a chill biology course compared to some of the others. The topics are usually pretty interesting but as with most science classes the curve is still harsh.",
    "Pretty good survey course. A lot to remember. Always be wary of competitiveness.",
    "This is a medium-sized class compared to other MCDB lecture courses (like repro bio). Like other bio classes, there is a bit of memorization involved, but the course emphasizes critical thinking in designing genetic screens or metagenomic screens. That's what I really liked about this course. The professors (Slack& Wagner) are super awesome, and the TAs (Brad and Sarah) are fantastic as well. This has been one of my favorite MCDB classes here.",
    "I would recommend Microbiology to a fellow student. As an MBB major, I have been unhappy with many of the MCDB courses I've taken. Subject material often seems interesting, but the course often turns into loads of memorization and a lack of emphasis on the scientific method. This course is a great combination and allowed for good practice for experimental thought. Additionally, the course is only a moderate amount of work. That being said, you should definitely take the time to really study. Although the subject material is not particularly difficult, the exams can be tricky if you don't know it.",
    "You will learn a lot of really recent and developing information about micorobes. It's definitely worth it to take this class if you are interested in medicine- whether it be human or animal.",
    "Good glass and interesting material. If you're looking for an upper level bio then I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A good class on the biology of bacteria as well as bacterial pathogenesis and applications of bacteria for biology research, with a few lectures thrown in about other subjects related to microbiology (including a few lectures on viruses and a lecture about malaria). Thesubject matter is interesting and the workload is fairly manageable. The class feels a bit disorganized at times, and the class doesn't have very much of an overarching narrative, but it is still a good class, worth taking for a bio major.",
    "It's a lot trickier and more challenging than you might hear. Definitely be careful.",
    "Microbiology is by far one of the best and most well-taught classes at Yale. The co-teaching works flawlessly and both Professor Jacobs-Wagner and Professor Bascom-Slack are phenomenal instructors with their own unique style. Professor Bascom-Slack is a treat. She wants students to learn effectively and it is evident that she has spent a lot of time figuring out the best way to do that. By the time the final had come around, I was so comfortable with the material because of her teaching style. She draws from modern studies in microbiology and pushes students to really grasp what she is teaching and build upon it. Further, she is extremely nice and approachable. One of the best professors I have had at Yale. Professor Jacobs-Wagner is wonderful. She is intense, but in the best way possible. She lays down the foundation of bacteria thoroughly and clearly, and she works hard to make sure the material is understood by everyone. The course builds perfectly, starting from the ground up and moving seamlessly between new topics. Other biology professors could learn many things from the way this class is run. If you're even considering it, take it. You don't even need to have a remote interest in microbiology. Trust me, by the end you will. An excellent upper-level MCDB course.",
    "Misleadingly tough class. Liked the material but te grading was Really harsh.",
    "This class was good and interesting. Don't go into this class thinking you will be learning about specific pathogens. You more learn about the overall patterns and mechanisms used by microbes. A good introduction, but you will probably leave wanting to know more.A big focus was on bacteria, with not as much info on fungi\/protists\/viruses.",
    "This course wasn't as easy as I expected, you have to synthesize and put together concepts to do well. It was a great learning experience in the class though.",
    "Yes good biology course for pre med students. One of the better ones.",
    "The class is an excellent course in the study of microbes, they hit all the major fields of study we could realistically expect to do in a semester and the class doesn't have any glaring weaknesses. The professors are great and the TAs (utilize them!) are great at answering questions. Overall a great course, you learn a lot, the environment was kind of chill (small class size), and it was a perfect upper level elective for the MCDB major.",
    "A really enjoyable class. The number of students for this year was more than in previous years, so the class dynamic was likely different, but it was still a great course. Interesting topics and well taught.",
    "I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a biology elective. Prior study of genetics and biochemistry will help out a lot.",
    "An interesting class.",
    "Microbio is a good class. It's not overly difficult, and the professors are great. Overall recommended.",
    "Solid biology course; bacteria are very interesting",
    "Great intermediate-level MCDB class. It was extremely well-organized, and I feel like I learned a lot from it. Professors Christine Jacobs-Wagner and Carol Bascom-Slack are amazing and both are excellent lecturers. It's also less work and generally easier than the core MCDB courses that I'm used to (like Cell Bio or Biochem) - two midterms and a final, no psets, occasional weekly quizzes or homework. Overall highly recommended if you're looking for a MCDB elective.",
    "This class is pretty good. It's not a lot of work for a biology credit and you learn some pretty useful things (opinion of a non-biology major). Professor Bascom-Slack's teaching style can be a bit annoying at first, but you get used to it after a while. If you want the textbook, just rent it or borrow it or something. You won't use it very much."
