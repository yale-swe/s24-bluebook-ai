    "The grammatical structures, workload, and in-class activities are a lot more intense than L1, however, if you do all the VHL, reading, and videos assigned, participate in class often, and practice for the exams duly, your Spanish will improve dramatically and you will do well in the class.",
    "I would recommend Span 120 02 to another student, especially with this professor. The course is extremely well organized and you will further your knowledge of Spanish while also appreciating the beauty of the cultural.",
    "Standard second level Spanish class. Your Spanish will improve a lot.",
    "SPAN 120 is a more difficult progression of SPAN 110, which adds more of a focus on group activities and stories. The grammar and vocabulary progress normally from L1, but the tests are more difficult."
