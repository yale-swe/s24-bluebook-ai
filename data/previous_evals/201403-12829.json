    "The french program at Yale is the best. You learn more than you think you would get out of in an introductory class.",
    "Intro French is NOT for the faint of heart: the weekly tests can be really stressful and the daily homework can be a lot as well. However, you learn a ton about French and from what I've heard, there really is no bad person to take it with!",
    "I would recommend this course if someone is interested in learning the language.",
    "The way this course works is that you essentially have about an hour of work a night, and a weekly test. This means that if you start falling behind (which is extremely easy to do) you will have a difficult time catching up. The weekly tests are pretty stressful and are wildly varying in difficulty. That said, if you commit to getting all of your work done on time (easier said than done) you will learn really fast. There is a lot of participation required in class, so you will want to be alert and prepared.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. It is a lot of work, but if you put in the effort is a great introduction to French."
