    "It's a good class. If you want to get a better understanding of what it means to be both an actor and a writer you should take this class.",
    "If you want a creative, life changing, and inspiring event in your life, take THST 210 with Deb Margolin. The shining moment in the course (though all are shiny) is the final performance project. Unlike other sections, you not only prove your worth and improve your ability as an actor, but you also liberate yourself from the restraints of the industry and just create and act yo' own pieces as director, writer, and actor. It is amazing.",
    "Great, great class! If you're looking for conventional scenework, stick with Connie or Joan; if you're looking for the best class of your life, take it with Deb. She's eccentric and unorthodox, but loves every one of her students. in addition to acting, she focuses somewhat on writing, which i THOUGHT i wouldn't enjoy because it wasn't something i was interested in, but i have totally changed my mind. Deb is amazing, take any and all of her classes!",
    "If you have the chance, you simply must take it. No questions, it must be done.",
    "Yes, take this class and take it with Deb. I had reservations about the section before it started because I had heard that it could be more like therapy while the other sections drilled acting. Don\u0092t worry\u0097Deb is absolutely fantastic. She will give you moments in class that change the way you look at acting and change the way you look at the world. Seriously, I\u0092m not being hyperbolic.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for another student. Deb is wonderful and her class is such a safe and nuturing environment to explore both as a performer and as a person.",
    "Awesome! Take it to improve, and take it to experiment. It's truly wonderful."
