    "1The readings were minimal but the ones I did read were great and mostly anecdotal stories rather than academic, which was a nice change of pace.2,3,4--The workload was very reasonable and perfect for the course expectations. it mostly involved field trip preparation, one presentation, and weekly lecture responses. These assignments\/projects were very useful since they literally helped the class move forward. This also helped the pace move properly. Having a small class was perfect because everyone was equally involved and had time to pursue a topic of their choice and present it5,6,7--THE FIELD TRIPS WERE FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!8,9,10--Chad was great in the class. Compared with other courses he teaches this is where he really shines! This course and his teaching it are very valuable!"
