   "comments": [
    "This course is an overview of rational choice, game theory, electoral politics, and strategic decision making. It explores real-life examples like the 2016 election season, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and coordinating meet-up times\/locations with friends. Professor Svolik is exceptionally coherent and delivers lectures that solidify your understanding of the topic, even if you did not do the reading. But the readings are fascinating, relevant, and absolutely necessary if you intend to leave the course with a solid understanding of how decisions are made democratically and strategically. Professor Svolik is also very accessible and genuinely cares about his students take this class!",
    "Best class at Yale",
    "Great course and prof. Learned so much. Svolik elevates teaching to a new level.",
    "A great course for anyone interested in politics or game theory. The course covered a large variety of topics and built the analytical tools to evaluate other scenarios. A great fifth class!",
    "Good class, not overwhelmingly difficult. I would recommend as a good introduction to game theory.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It has some very interesting readings and the classes are interesting at the same time."
