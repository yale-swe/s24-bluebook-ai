   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I believe that some of the concepts are important to understanding the field of organic chemistry.",
    "yes, i would definitely recommend the course",
    "How structures and functional groups result in several trends for organic compounds.Yes.",
    "The first three months we covered one chapter per month: Ch. 1, 2, and 3 in Anslyn and Dougherty, respectively. The last month, we covered Ch. 4 (supramolecular chemistry) in a couple of weeks, and the last few days of class we covered about a chapter a day (kinetics, LFERs, acid-base chemistry, etc.) If you are planning to use organic chemistry in your research at all, you're probably already very familiar with all the subjects covered in this course. I would not recommend this class unless you are really required to take it, because we did not learn anything of substance - the topics were only covered very superficially and I don't see how we can apply anything we learned to our research problems.",
    "I would say that it is not like the undergraduate organic chemistry course that I have taken. We did not focus on reaction pathways and their mechanisms. We focused more on molecules and how substituents and solvents changed their behavior. I would recommend this course to other students but warn them that it might not be what they expect of an organic chemistry course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Good overview for understanding the basic principles of physical organic chemistry.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in either theoretical or experimental aspects of chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student in organic chemistry.",
    "Overall as I took the course I would not recommend it to another student because I don't think I really learned much from taking this class. I think if improvements were made it could easily be a very valuable course.",
    "Advanced Orgo is a typical Physical Organic Chemistry class. I definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "CH 518 was essentially a physical organic chemistry class with emphasis on conformational analysis. I would recomend this course to any students interested organic chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course highly to another student, and I feel that the content of this course is vital toward a successful career in chemical research."

   "comments": [
    "I have taken a similar course in my undergraduate experience and I was rather disappointed with this course. The class moved slowly and the conceptstaught were not difficult to grasp. I was expecting much more from this class.",
    "",
    "The course allowed me to better understand how certain techniques and structural motifs could be used to explain reaction trends. Things covered in the textbook (but not the course) will probably be used to help with reaction rate determination\/mechanistic explorations for my research.",
    "The topics we heavily focused on aren't pertinent to my research interests. Focusing on binding interactions and conformational analysis is great for those who are interested in topics such as rational drug design. However, these topics are generally unimportant for a student in my area.",
    "Being a chemical engineer I believe that it gave me a stronger foundation in chemistry that others in my field might not have. Thanks to it I will consider such things as substituent groups, solvent effects, and steriochemistry in my work.",
    "Most material covered in the lecture was review.",
    "Again, the first half of the semester was valuable and I thought I learned many things that are valuable to me as a first year graduate student. After that point I did not feel that I learned many things relevant to my research as an organic chemistry student - it was too theoretical. I would have at least expected to cover Molecular Orbital Theory in detail but we never did.",
    "Looking forward, I assume this course will be invaluable given the type of chemistry I am interested in.",
    "I will use the material learned in this course throughout my PhD study, and I feel that this content forms the basis of vital knowledge for any chemist."
