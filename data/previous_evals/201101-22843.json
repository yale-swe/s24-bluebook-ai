   "comments": [
    "This course talks about the systems in place that distribute and manage aid flows between developed and developing countries. It also discusses some recent hot topics in aid such as microfinance and cash transfers.",
    "Yes, If you are interested in the topic. Readings are sometimes a little dry, but overall a good class.",
    "This course concentrates on thinking about different models of aid. Get ready to draw numerous models of aid on the white board. I would absolutely recommend this course. The material is incredibly relevant and important today, and the course is well taught.",
    "A great overview of development. Take if you're interested in the issues, but don't expect the class to be life changing. It's mainly a good way to understand problems and concerns that you already know about from a more academic perspective. A relatively broad subject matter.",
    "Politics of Development Assistance provides a comprehensive introduction to a wide variety of issues pertinent to the foreign aid industry. You learn the key arguments for and against aid (Easterly,Sachs, etc) as well as the different methods and challenges of providing aid. I definitely got a lot out of this course, and for that reason would certainly recommend it to another student. Professor Simon is awesome, so if you're interested in the subject matter, I would definitely give this class a go.",
    "Its a good broad overview of the subject. It can be very interesting if you put in the work to do the readings. It helps to have some experience with development in a particular country to match the general knowledge the course gives you.",
    "The course provides a solid background for understanding the current development system and its flaws-- definitely worth taking for anyone considering related work or research post-grad. Also, Prof Simon is extremely nice and accessible.",
    "David Simon is a cool guy but this class is a waste of time. Nobody does the reading and you just sit there for two hours every week listening to everyone's mildly interesting summer experiences about building a sustainable latrine in Bhutan. If you are genuinely interested in the subject, read Jeffrey Sachs, William Easterly, and Dambisa Moyo and call it a day.",
    "Great course! I knew very little about how development assistance before taking this course. However, Prof. Simon made the material very approachable and enjoyable. If you are looking for a fun, not too work intensive seminar with a welcoming environment, this is your class. However, beware that many people want to get into this class, so make sure that you go to the first day of class and get on the list.",
    "Yes, it's pretty interesting and not too stressful."
