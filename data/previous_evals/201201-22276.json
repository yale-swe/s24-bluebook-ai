    "Professor's Hill's class is famous (infamous?) for its idiosyncrasy within DS. While I don't think that his teaching style is leagues beyond any of the other professors, I do think that his class offers a unique insight into a way of reading these works that you wont get anywhere else.",
    "Absolutely. Especially for those interested in majoring in the Humanities or Social Sciences. Hill provides a fundamental understanding of Western Civilization.",
    "This course wonderfully shows the development of political philosophy in Europe, especially social contract theory and the rise of ideologies. Highly recommend doing this course to have a good understanding of how great thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke, Tocqueville, Marx etc viewed the role of the state, the sovereign, tradition. A basis for understanding all modern political questions and debates.",
    "Some of the reading is long, but do it anyway. Especially in Spring H\/P, every page is worth it.",
    "Hill is God.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS.",
    "Yes, its a great course for understand the history of western civilization and for better understanding of the present and what the future may bring. A great course for anyone considering a career in politics or anything related to it."
