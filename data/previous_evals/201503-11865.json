    "I would recommend English 120 to the student who very much enjoys writing. In the class, you write five essays modelled off the styles of other successful essays written in the modern era. The writing process can become very stressful if you are used to A range writing grades after not much effort, as applies to the high school experience of many. The standards are simply higher in this class than anything I was used to. Furthermore, the essay topics might likely force you out of your comfort zone as you are asked to interview someone, describe a new place, and critique our culture. But, if you are willing to put in the effort, your writing will drastically improve. In class, the debate is less heated visa vie a course that reads for topics instead of for styles. You will debate how the author makes her point, not whether the point has any merit. If you are a freshman looking to take the class and youre on the fence, know that there are a good number of sophomores who take it, and sometimes I got the sense that these were the ones most prepared, having a slightly less stressful time in the course.",
    "English 120 is a class that is as difficult as you make it: whether you're writing first drafts and then turning in revisions, or whether you're pouring over every word, you'll get out what you put in. If you're here to think about your writing, and you're ready to be challenged, then this is the right class. Class readings aren't extremely time-consuming, and while each class is different because of the kids that make it up, teachers are always ready to help you and give you feedback, and meeting the different writers and minds is interesting. If you're inclined towards the humanities or just think of yourself as a good creative writer, this is the right class to throw yourself into.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to improve writing skills.",
    "You will close read for craft and you will as a result become a better writer. I felt like it prepared me for upper-level writing classes, too.",
    "I really enjoyed English 120 and would recommend it to another student. It's more on the creative writing side and some of the writing is about yourself, so some introspection and willingness to share personal details is required. I think English 120 pushes you to try out different styles of writing (the interview essay comes to mind), and the readings are really inspiring in content and craft.",
    "ENGL 120 is an AMAZING course, for both English-lovers and English-haters. It's a unique introductory course that studies the art of creative nonfiction--the articles you see in publications, the short stories you read from well-known authors, etc. The idea of close reading allows you to appreciate the strategies and writing styles of different writers, and allows you to easily apply these studied skills to your own writing. You will definitely come out of ENGL 120 with a HUGE improvement in your writing skills, and you'll have a deeper appreciation for another side to literature that you might not have considered before. It's very much a class based on modern writing, and ENGL 120 builds the skills sets you need to improve your writing for any context. Plus, it's class with a great syllabus, and the variety of units makes sure that there is something interesting for everyone.",
    "I would recommend English 120 to any students who wish to become better writers and readers of the type of writing that dominated most of the sources of information on which they tend to rely.",
    "A very worthwhile class to take; it really does help improve your writing and you are exposed to so many wonderful articles that help you shape your own style of writing.",
    "I'm a STEM person, not a great writer, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Part of it was my fellow classmates were amazing - insightful, passionate, funny, and with a variety of viewpoints. I was very nervous for workshop but it ended up as one of my best memories from this semester due to all the kind, funny, and helpful comments. I imagine that taking the same class with a friend would be fun because you get to know your classmates on an interesting level by reading each others' personal essays. Gina was amazing. She thoroughly comments on your first drafts and often will look over second drafts. She's innovative - the class ended with a humor reading involving a live class Twitter feed. She often tried to maintain a neutral, I-can-see both sides stance in class and I think if she had played devil's advocate more often our class discussions could have been even more exciting. I loved how she gave a bit of time in class to review our close-analysis sections. When she comments on your first draft, make big edits or cuts to these sections - there was one final essay that I got back with very similar comments to my first draft even though I thought I had made the necessary edits. My writing certainly improved during the course and my eyes were opened to the possibility of STEM writing. Unless there is a particular 114 topic that really catches your attention, I would recommend taking 120 among the two. If you're like me and a STEM person, use your strengths to your advantage and pick a STEMy topic for one of the essays. In short, one of my STEM professor recommended that I take this class over intro bio, and I was glad I did."
