    "This course was my favorite of the semester. I feel as though I learned a lot and have a much better understanding of economic theories and how to read and interpret economic studies.",
    "This is a great course. I enjoyed learning more about economic theory as it applies to health, as well as learning more about how to take a critical look at research papers and evaluate them. I enjoyed the core content as well as the open discussion format of the class. I felt I was able to learn a lot and gain other perspectives that I normally wouldn't have in a more rigid-lecture based course.",
    "One of the best courses YSPH offers. No complaints at all, except when students give their final presentations, I wished there had been some instruction given as to how to present their work, such as: Slides are not your summary notes; They are 'visual effects' to make your points; Don't use small fonts; Don't show many pieces of information at the same time; Show one line at a time, etc.. Of course, the 'content' was the focus of this class and not how it gets packaged and delivered..",
    "The class is enormously helpful if you have a background in economics or have taken an economics course - but it is still doable if you don't. I really enjoyed the course and learning from a lot of students in it as well as from the professor.",
    "This was my favorite class at YSPH so far!",
    "-- This was an excellent class, with regular opportunities for class discusssions and direct interaction with the professor (i.e. education). -- The professor invited feedback from students on the content and teaching style of the course during the semester, which was both rare for a professor to do and greatly appreciated. -- My recommendations for the next iteration of the class include potentially having 1 or 2 weeks where there is a single, concise reading which all students are required to read, do a writing assignment on, and discuss in class, so that there is a class where every person has done the entire reading in depth (to bolster the already excellent class discussions). -- Because my classmates had a range of interesting background knowledge, I might have enjoyed an occasional opportunity (maybe 10 minutes every other week, for example) to split into small groups to work through a thought problem or policy question. The class was already small; but if time permits, doing small-group case studies can also be valuable. -- The final presentation and paper were a positive aspect of the class that allowed me to really work through a specific question of health economics. -- I felt that if the material were changed out, I would take this class again in a heartbeat because the format of it worked so well.",
    "Strengths Small class size that engenders discussions",
    "Good course, great subjects for discussion. Benefits highly from small class size with open discussion.",
    "This is a brilliant course. It provides an understanding of economics, from an epidemiological perspective and teaches you to understand and dissect economic papers (something I could not do before). Professor Busch is a caring and dedicated instructor. Classes were spent discussing complex topics and debating the economic landscape in domestic healthcare. I emerged from this class an understanding of economics as a tool to persuade policy makers to pursue a given agenda. Professor Busch was objective and encouraged different perspectives, challenging what I had assumed to be 'the solution'. I have come out of this course humbled."

    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Great professor. One of my favorite courses I have taken at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Excellent.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is a great professor and taught this course extremely well. I really enjoyed being in her class, she explained complex economic topics in an understandable way and made health econ literature more accessible. She also encouraged a classroom atmosphere where you could ask any questions to her or to each other.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan has been my favorite professor so far. I love her! Incredibly knowledgeable and kind.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is warm, knowledgeable, and an excellent educator. She skillfully and thoughtfully guided our class through a variety of engaging and relevant health economics topics. Who could ask for anything more?",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0She is very supportive and receptive to suggestions",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Professor Busch does a great job allowing for a fluid discussion to take place each week, and creates an open environment where contrasting opinions are valued.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Professor Busch is one of the most caring instructors I have ever had in my life. In her, I felt I had someone to turn to, no matter the difficulty (academic or personal) and no question ever felt too ridiculous to ask. I particularly like how she deconstructs a question that is asked her. This is a leaf I took out of her book to good effect - her thinking is strategic, objective and clear. Definitely a role model."

    "Definitely a course every person at YSPH should consider taking!",
    "I highly recommend this class, especially if you have background knowledge of economics and are interested in understanding the market forces behind our health care system, and the behavioral aspect of decision-making for health care. The class will give you the opportunity to look critically at the latest research in the field, and either conduct research of your own or review the literature in a specific topic of your choice.",
    "Very good course!",
    "Be sure to have an understanding of epidemiology and microeconomics before taking this course. Armed with these, the course will be enjoyable and will challenge what you think are the solutions to the domestic healthcare debacle. This course will stretch your mind and force you to think in new ways. Enjoy!"
