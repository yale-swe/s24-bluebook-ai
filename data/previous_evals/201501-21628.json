    "You definitely have to do more work to write your thesis in as a separate credit than you would just writing it in a seminar. The page requirement is much longer. Just something to consider, I'm very happy with how mine came out and I needed the credit anyway!",

    "Your thesis will never be the final product you want it to be, but its an excellent expedition into academia and knowledge production."
