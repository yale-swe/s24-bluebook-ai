   "comments": [
    "Exploration of the problems in reconstructing a portrait of the historical Jesus. Gets you to think like a historian about an important religion icon, whose actual life it is sometimes to divorce from the mythology that surrounds it. Definitely a fascinating approach to an already fascinating topic. Readings are well-directed. Dale Martin always has a number of interesting observations and connections. The reading is not much at all if you enjoy the subject.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Martin is amazing and the material is fascinating. Even if you've has no background at all in the subject, you'll still reach a certain level of comfort with the material after a few classes",
    "Take this class. Even if you don\u0092t know anything about religion, Christianity, Jesus, or the Bible, the Historical Jesus is an incredible class. Be the end of the seminar, you\u0092ll love Professor Martin, have a fundamental knowledge about Christianity, and understand methods of determining historicity. The material is fascinating, and Professor Martin is an engaging seminar leader.There is a good amount of work. While the weekly reading was completely manageable, the four writing assignments (5, 10, 6, 8 pages) were quite a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend anybody to take this class, and at the very least to shop it to try it out! The class really gets you thinking about Jesus and what you can historically say about him (and anything in general), and you'll see him in a completely new light. You also become really intimate with the Gospels in the bible and get to see what many ordinary people miss when reading them. Not to mention that Professor Martin is a lot of fun and made every class go by super fast and super fun.Probably the best class that I've stumbled into, ever.",
    "It's an interesting class that challenges how you look at the Bible and Jesus. As a Christian it made me think hard about what I believe and why. You also need to be open minded about the way Jesus and history is treated. Overall i liked the class and feel like it is one of the few classes that has actually made me a better writer.",
    "You might not want to take this if you already took New Testament with Prof. Martin, because there's a lot of overlap. You also might want to opt for that class anyway if you're interested in early Christianity, Jesus or the New Testament, because NT is a much more thorough look at all of these things. This class is a very limited exercise of using textual analysis to infer little things about the historical Jesus. We conclude that very little of what's in the Bible can be said to be \"almost certainly\" historical, so there's really not that much there! Prof. Martin does tell us fascinating things about how the historical Jesus informs his faith (he is a postmodern who does not believe in worshipping the historical Jesus, but rather the \"revealed\" Jesus of modern popular knowledge), but remember this class is an exercise in historical criticism, not an exercise in faith or the study of Christianity, for that matter. Come to the class with an open mind!!",
    "I would recommend it, but with the warning that you will cover a lot of detailed information\/minutiae, and you need to be very interested in the subject matter to take the class. You also shouldn't take this class if you're not comfortable with ambiguity, as most of the questions we ask have no definitive answers. That said, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.",
    "Yes, this was a fascinating class, probably my favorite of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It's a good writing credit because you get to try different kinds of writing, so it's not just churning out paper after redundant paper-- each paper is something new and interesting.",
    "This is a great course. If you were raised Christian, it will teach you to look at the Gospels in a more critical way, if you were not raised Christian, it will give you an interesting perspective on the basis of the religion."
