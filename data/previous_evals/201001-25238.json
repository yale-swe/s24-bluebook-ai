   "comments": [
    "It's great for those interested in the subject matter. It's a very narrow course, so if you don't like the first and second classes, you won't like any of them.",
    "I would say that this class is a nice way to someone who wants to take some sort of Judaic Studies class to be exposed to an environment where you get to talk about Jewish texts in a low pressure environment. There was almost no work all semester long, until one very big final paper that was very frustrating to write because it was incredibly open-ended and the expectations were pretty unclear as to what we were supposed to do. It was also a little hard to have a 2 hour class that started at9:20 in the morning, and Professor Fraade could sometime go on and lose us a little. However, I did enjoy the class, the subject matter was interesting, and it was a great way to fulfill your language requirement if you don't want to start a new language from scratch and already know Hebrew.",
    "An interesting introduction to the academic study of Rabbinic texts. You definitely learn a lot about how the Midrash works and its textual intricacies. Class discussions often dragged a little bit. But Professor Fraade is such a kind and patient teacher! He is very willing to meet outside of class, e.g. to discuss your final paper. Weekly preparation is minimal but the final paper (15-20 pages) takes a significant investment of time and thought.",
    "This was a great class for anyone interested in studying an ancient rabbinic text - you get to learn about it both from a religious perspective and an academic one."
