    "This course contributed immensely to my dissertation in that it greatly helped me to focus my ideas and start writing sooner than my usual habit, which had been to wait until I had all the research completed before beginning to write. I found that I can actually synthesize ideas much more quickly by writing very soon after I read a source, rather than waiting to compile all my materials. The skill of writing quickly is one that I will need to continue to develop both in my work as a graduate student, as I continue to work on my dissertation, and in my eventual career as an academic. For me, this was the most valuable part of the course."
