    "The 4x8 3 axis mill was down for the MAJORITY of the semester. That little fact almost rendered the entire course useless (as it was almost entirely about digital fabrication). Eric and I got madcam working on the small mills but had we not done that my entire project would have been impossible with the equipment available. This is completely unacceptable as I came to this school in large part for the promise of getting to use these machines (it was down for the majority of last semester too).",
    "yes.",
    "The large mill was down for most of the semester and that really limited us and frustrated the process. The small mills have an ongoing error problem that seems to be unresolvable, forcing us to slow down our milling jobs to an incredibly slow speed, thus making already-lengthy fabrication processes take an even longer time, even days.",
    "Yes.",
    "fix the mills or create a training regiment that will make for better usage.",
    "The $200 allowance was not adequate. The course required fabrication throughout the semester as well as a large final project. In order for each student to truly explore every possible means of fabrication, the stress of budget needs to be mitigated."
