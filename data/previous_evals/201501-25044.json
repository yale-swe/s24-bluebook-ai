    "This class is much more difficult than L1, but you will learn a lot! Professor Seymour is amazing.",
    "\"Introductory\" spanish taught at an intermediate level.",
    "Definitely would recommend this to another student. Well-taught and I learned a ton of Spanish in the process.",
    "If you are taking spanish 2, I would definitely recommend taking it with Terry Seymour. You will really learn how to speak and understand spanish in her class. Throughout the entire semester, I never heard her speak a word of english, and she expected the whole class to do the same. This was very challenging but ultimately very rewarding because by the end of the semester, not only did I feel like I had improved a lot, but I could see that everyone else in the class had too. It was fun to go from awkward, stilted exercises at the beginning of the semester to having actual conversations with each other and Prof. Seymour."
