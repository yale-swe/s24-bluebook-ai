   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course because I suspect most of the kinks of this first semester will be worked out in coming years.",
    "If this course were changed into a lecture format, I would strongly recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Prof. Mercer explained early in this seminar that it was intended to be called \"Post-Pop Art and Black Culture\" over what it is called in the Bluebook. This is a very suiting title, as most of what is discussed in the course is the work of African American artists since the Pop Art movement, and most of that work deals with how black culture is signified. This is not a particularly easy course. It moves quickly and is the sort of seminar where the professor spews ideas (although they are fascinating ideas) at you for 75% of the class time, then expects you to comment on those ideas, and is discouraged when you can't do so quickly and with precision. That said, it is a great way to learn, and to get into the rhythm of thinking that is necessary to be a thoughtful critic of contemporary art. This class has a final paper, a midterm paper, a short written assignment, a midterm slide test, and weekly readings of about 75pages. I would say that my experience with this course was a little rough, but a lot of that had to do with me, and a lot of that had to do with the fact that it was the first time that Prof. Mercer ever taught this course. I'd recommend this course if you're interested in African American art, or in contemporary art in general.",
    "yes, if you're interested. Professor Mercer is extremely smart, but know that it's more like a lecture than a seminar. The workload isn't bad and the readings are AWESOME.",
    "Amazing syllabus. Professor Mercer is very knowledgable, but he treated the class like a lecturer when only 8 people were in it. I wouldn't recommend the class because of his teaching style and personality. He is cold, harsh, and he doesn't encourage creativity or discussion. I wish I hadn't wasted time trying to get to know him. He also has no regard for Yale norms and assigned an absurd amount of work during midterms and finals. He was inflexible when we tried to tell him. Fascinating material though.",
    "This is one of the few courses that does not look at African American art and culture as being on the margins of the canon and would definitely recommend this to a fellow student. Few art history courses address a contemporary moment and the presence of artists of colors."
