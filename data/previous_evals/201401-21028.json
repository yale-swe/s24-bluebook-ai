   "comments": [
    "Excellent course, better than Romantic Poetry due to a better balanced and more in-depth syllabus. Magnificent poems carefully arranged and effectively taught. Reasonable workload, difficult grading. Be ready to spend the first third of the semester with a focus on pre-Victorian works.",
    "Only if you are interested in this kind of poetry and if you are ready to work hard on the essays and reading. If you are, this class is amazing, and Professor Brisman is very nice and insightful. But some of the reading is long and the essays are tough.",
    "Take it, even if you have no interest in Victorian Poetry, because Brisman is incredible. He will make every poem matter to your life. His anecdotes are hilarious, and he does a great job of picking up on each students' quirks and taking advantage of those to make sure everyone contributes something interesting. Not a lot of work either -- three seven-page papers, no final.",
    "Taking a course with Leslie Brisman should be a requirement for the English major, and this course in particular highlighted his absolute brilliance. Certainly one of my top-five favorite courses at Yale, if not my favorite. TAKE IT! While the quality of the course certainly depends on the other students in the class, this year the discussions were some of the most illuminating of my time at Yale.",
    "English 412 is a great course for those who are interested in Victorian Poetry. There are certainly other ways to fulfill your pre-19 Century english major requirement, so only take this course if you have an interested in the material and have at least some understanding of what Professor Brisman is like."
