   "comments": [
    "This is a very good course if you are interested in anatomy, though it is mostly memorization-based and does not require any real integration of ideas. If you are looking for a course that links culture and human form, this isn't the one for you. This is more of a hard-facts anatomy class: the eyes are here, the nerves are here, take the tests, repeat. No need to think too hard about most of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to others. However, if you are an Anthro major looking for an interesting course, consider taking it Credit\/D. There is not much of a curve because crazy pre-meds take the course as well. Engaging lectures and lab time make the course worth taking though. You have to study\/memorize to do well on exams.",
    "This is an anatomy class that focuses on function and organizes things by embryonic development, which makes learning all the information more manageable and interesting. Be prepared for a lot of learning on your own in addition to lecture.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a great introduction to anatomy and is manageable. Studying for the tests is basically all memorization, so if you put in the time, you should be fine. That being said, there is A LOT of things to memorize. The professor is also really great and the time in lab is really interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is fascinating, not just for pre-meds.",
    "This class is exactly what it sounds like. And it's great! About half the time is spent with in a lecture while the other half of class is spent looking at real specimens. It is hands-on and Professor Sargis is a great teacher. There are 4 finals throughout the semester and nothing during reading or finals period. The finals are straightforward if you spend the time preparing for them. If anatomy is something you are interested in and you're ready to memorize a lot of information, this is the ideal class for you.",
    "I highly recommend this course to people who just want a crash course in human anatomy and are into memorizing a lot of material.",
    "A lot of straight memorization, but you can go more in depth if you want and you get to play with bones and the cadaver. If you're an Archaeology major, it won't complement osteology as much as you might expect but it's still worth it.",
    "Recommended if student is willing to put eh time into memorizing and understanding material.",
    "Human Functional Anatomy is truly a hidden gem of a course at Yale. It fulfills a social science credit while being completely hard science-based. There are only four exams, all equally weighted. They range from very manageable to challenging, but they are always fair. Professor Sargis is one of the most enjoyable, down-to-earth, and coolest professors at Yale. He works hard to supplement what can be wrote memorization with clinical applications (read: pre-med intrigue) and very brief historical accounts of anatomical discovery. The lab portion of the course is valued highly by Professor Sargis and you will spend time reinforcing lecture material by looking at a plastinated cadaver and various primates. However, with the scope of the course, the class size, and the quality of the specimens, the labs are exploratory and without impact on grade and honestly, without impact on one's understanding of the material. That being a said, I highly recommend this class to anyone really, specifically those interested in a comprehensive overview of anatomy, in the human body, or in a really well-taught, manageable science course in an anthro disguise.",
    "Take this course! Just trust me :)",
    "If you're at all interested in anatomy, take this course. It's a broad overview of human anatomy, but you learn key details about important systems. I don't know how difficult it is compared to other anthropology classes, but if you're a science major, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised by the tests -- they can cover a lot of information, but if you study, you'll do well. The best thing about this class is that it's pretty small (only about 20-25 people by the end of the semester), and Professor Sargis is a good lecturer and is not intimidating -- if you have questions, he seems happy to answer them.",
    "Anthro 299 is a heavy memorization based course. I would not recommend taking this course with a 5 credit (all for grades) or greater course load. I would only recommend taking it with 4 credits or 5 with a credit D. I think it would be a great Credit D course though.There isn't much outside work, but trying to memorize everything takes a really really long time. So, it's especially time consuming. The exams were fair though.",
    "I thought this would be a good class to take as a pre-med because it would prepare you for medical school. I was right in that it taught me how not to study in med school. If you're good at wrote memorization, then you'll do well in this class. However, there's not much clinical anatomy\/physiology if that's what you're interested in. It's great that there's no written homework; all you have to do is study for the four non-cumulative exams during the semester.",
    "This course is perfect for anyone (I mean ANYONE) who is remotely interested in the human body and how it works. I am a pre-med, but I would've enjoyed the course even if I weren't. Professor Sargis works very fast through lectures to get to the lab work, which is much more exciting and worthwhile anyways. If you stay somewhat on top of the lectures before and after the class, you'll be totally fine...as is the case for any class at Yale I suppose. His lectures are thorough, his tests (only four equally divided ones) are totally fair, and we covered a lot of ground. The only thing that would've made this class way better would've been more guest lecturers! Definitely one of my favorite courses so far at Yale (as a junior).",
    "I would recommend this course. It's incredibly useful, whether you're pre-med or not (which many students weren't!). The memorization takes time, but it is definitely doable. Prof. Sargis is great and the guest lecturers are as well."
