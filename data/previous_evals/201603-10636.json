   "comments": [
    "I developed my own scientific research project! I piloted my methods, recruited test subjects, and performed data collection.",
    "I learned the improtance of planning out research and working independently in a lab.",
    "Stats and data analysis, community ecology, time management, making engaging graphic representations. A ton of great stuff!",
    "I've never done anything like a thesis before, so this whole experience is new. I've learned what steps I need to take to make a successful scientific paper, and am working on time management skills in order to space out all the work I need to put in to finish this thesis.",
    "This system is really not well-suited for reviewing research courses...okay, this \"course\" was a semester of my senior project. This semester mainly involved my statistical analysis and sample processing, so, surprise, I learned more about statistical analysis and sample processing. I also participated in a small-scale poster session, so I learned how to make a poster and present it at a session. Generally good \"how to do science\" skills.",
    "With no class time, I worked on self-motivation and time management. Also, I improved my R skills and I gained more practice in writing scientific papers.",
    "How to go through the entire process of a scientific research project. I learned in depth about what is required for the research, experimentation, data analysis, and paper writing steps."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Many of my friends in other majors had a bit more support and communication with other seniors. I would have appreciated at least one or two meetings with the other seniors\/ advisors in EEB to talk about what we were doing, talk through issues, and share any exciting results.",
    "I think one of the strengths of the course is that it gives students a playground to really explore their scientific interests. I think the one weakness is that it is very difficult to track how muhc time you are spending in lab. Often times PIs are unaware of the requirements for this particular course and I often found myself dedicating 20 hours per week instead of 10 which is what the class requires.",
    "I'd love to hear more about what other students are doing, though I guess I'll find that out next semester during the poster presentations. But, nonetheless, having a more cohesive, in-touch cohort would be nice.",
    "This doesn't really feel like a course to me since meetings, while organized for us, weren't biweekly or even weekly. Our level of work depends on what we're doing for our thesis and who we're working with. I appreciate the check-in meetings I had with my mentor. However I feel like it was easy to put work for my thesis in the backseat since my other classes were more of a priority at the moment. But that's something I would have to work on myself.",
    "Again, this is absurdly variable by adviser, but I guess I can review the universal course requirements. In general, it's a good way to do research in a way that makes it a part of your schedule rather than something you have to find time for on top of everything else. The proposal at the beginning is a good way to get your thoughts in order. The review at the end feels a little silly, because your adviser already knows where you're at with the project and Marta doesn't actually need to know the specifics, but I suppose it can be a good way to get your thoughts in order at the end as well.",
    "It's up to the student how this course goes. Choosing an interesting topic helps make it something that a student will want to work on. Also, picking a good advisor is key to making this semester run smoothly.",
    "A bit more structure would be useful (esp. clearer expectations and deadlines).",
    "The strength is that the course has you doing work that a grad student or real scientist would be doing. It allowed me to see what steps they go through in order to reach a final paper that may be published. There are no outstanding weakness, as what you get out of the course largely depends on the student and what project he\/she is working on."

   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would if they are completing the BS requirement in EEB.",
    "It's a great way to do personal, directed research, so yes, do it if you're after some personal directed research. The really important part is finding an adviser whose subject area and organization style you like. Honestly, everything else is secondary to that--having your own strong ideas about a topic is a bonus, but not actually necessary.",
    "It is very rewarding to be able to complete a thesis project and even if it isn't a requirement, I would strongly encourage completing one. It will be better if the student starts thinking about this before beginning the semester.",
    "It can definitely be a rewarding experience if you are legitimately interested in your project and willing to put the time into it. Your grad student is also extremely important as he\/she will be the main source of feedback and help throughout what turned out to be a pretty difficult and involved process. It is overall a great experience if you are looking to work in the field or go to grad school for science."
