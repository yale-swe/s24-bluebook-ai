   "comments": [
    "Great course, Dave puts in extra effort to keep the students engaged in a subject that might otherwise be very very dry. Definitely a good course to take regardless of whether or not you're G&G, and the trip is dope.",
    "It's a great class, although a bit tough if you have no geology background. However, I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to develop a passion and love for geology and learning in general! You don't need to be a geo major, just an interested person willing to put in the work!",
    "YES! Definitely take this class - it's one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. The final paper is a bit of work, but the trip is great, and other than that the assignments are fair.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Global Tectonics for everyone who is somewhat interested in Geology. (...but don't take the class JUST for its spring break trip.) You'll learn a bunch about the theory that helps explain plate tectonics and the resulting geological formations, and during the spring break trip you can use this to take a look at some stuff in the field yourself. The workload was really low during most of the semester with no tests and pretty straightforward and short psets, but the final paper can take up a good amount of time. This is especially true if you're not a geology major, but Dave Evans is very accessible and pretty good at helping you if you're struggling with the geological literature and its specific terminology. The only thing that's kinda annoying is that we didn't get any feedback grade-wise during the semester (i.e. I know 0% of my final grade as I am writing this evaluation right now...) Grading was 50% for psets and 50% for the final paper. This year's spring break trip went to Barbados. Possible destinations for the next years apparently include Death Valley and southern Spain.",
    "Tectonics was a pretty interesting geology course, the work load was fair, and the lectures were reasonably interesting. But thats not why any chooses this course. Choose this course for the amazing spring break trip it offers. Its totally worth it!"
