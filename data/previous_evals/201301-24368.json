    "Yes, would definitely recommend. Too bad he's leaving!",
    "Learn how America manages its relations with the world",
    "The course was a review of American diplomacy in the Middle East over the past 60 years or so. It was seminar style. There was a student presentation every week. There were 100-300 pages of reading per week. The course culminated with a simulation and a long research paper. I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Yale should try to get Professor Crocker to come back to Yale permanently."
