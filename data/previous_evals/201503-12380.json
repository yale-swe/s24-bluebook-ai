    "Math 222 is a class anyone interested in STEM should (and likely has) to take. It is a fun class and is more concrete than any of the upper-level calculus classes. This is a pre-requisite for many majors\/pre-professional tracks so students may not have a choice, but this is a good class for anyone who enjoy quantitative reasoning and mathematics.",
    "This is a class that you can get by without going to lecture and watching the material on MIT OCW. Not a lot of people showed up for lecture. Didn't learn much from the class, and you only get through half of what the whole course should be about. As with any Yale course that suggests learning applications, you don't learn applications. Watch out, some people taking the class all ready know linear algebra.",
    "Linear Algebra with Applications is a great introduction to learning about linear algebra. There is a great focus on the computational aspects of linear algebra and how it can be applied to many types of interesting applications.",
    "Its boring but not that hard. Just don't do the psets the night before they were due. With Manas, we only had 6 psets through the semester (so once every two weeks).",
    "If you don't have to take it this class is not useful whatsoever.",
    "I think Manas tries hard, but is not the best instructor. I and most of the class had to watch khan academy or gilbert strange videos.",
    "Be prepared to do your learning outside of class. Linear algebra isn't hard, but it is not taught well. I would not take it unless required. Also it is a foundation course and thus doesn't have many real world links.",
    "Linear algebra is an extremely useful subject, and this is an excellent introduction to it. I'd recommend supplementing what you learn in class with Gilbert Strang's online lectures on MIT OpenCourseware.",
    "Manas was a very kind professor. Linear algebra, when taken in the big picture, is not a difficult topic, though it can seem confusing if not explained well. There were bi-weekly psets and the exams were fair, if a little rushed in hand calculations. Overall an okay class, and not as difficult as some of the other math courses at Yale..",
    "This is a great course for a linear algebra credit. I don't think the same professor is teaching it next semester so YMMV. The workload was definitely on the light side, maybe one homework assignment every two weeks that took about an hour or two. But I would say that even though it was on the light side it was adequate for the course. I didn't feel that I needed to drill the concepts we learned for hours and hours with more homework. Overall, easy course if you put in the work.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course you're either trying to do math, computer science, or engineering. As an engineer this was possibly the easiest class required for my major. Everything about this class is conceptual, the actual math behind it is very very simple. With that being said Manas is a horrible teacher and I don't think I learned a single thing from him in class. Just read the book and watch Gilbert Strang's videos on line and you'll be fine. Honestly, if you could just go to class when homework is due and on test and quiz dates and do just as fine. But if you're a stem major definitely take this class, it's an easy A with average amounts of work.",
    "Sloving linear equations using mateices.",
    "Take it if you have to or want to learn a little bit of linear algebra without proofs. Is a low stress class but definitely study for the quizzes and midterms and final",
    "If you want a solid introduction to a really cool area of mathematics, take this course! It's not too difficult, especially is Manas is teaching. There were PSETs due every other week, which provided a perfect pace for the course. The lectures were not stellar, but if you use the MIT open courseware video lectures, they follow the textbook and this course's lectures perfectly.",
    "This is a basic class on linear algebra. It is all about matrices and solving systems of equations. The applications weren't a huge focus, but you can see how important linear algebra is to computer science, physics, etc. The material is super cool-- I definitely recommend.",
    "Pretty solid course. I had to do a fair bit of independent learning, but the professors and the TAs provided a lot of support. Also, Manas has a \"learning is more important than grades philosophy,\" meaning he grades very gently with lots of bonus points. Great introduction to Linear Algebra and not too much work. The problem sets are only due every other week, although they vary widely in difficulty (peaking mid-semester) so be sure to work in advance.",
    "I would recommend math 222 if you want a decently fun math course but I do think you must work a little harder outside of class by watching the MIT videos and looking at the pdf slides Gilbert Strang has.",
    "The course is not much work, especially if you try and stay on top of the class material. Linear Algebra isn't too difficult and will become very interesting at times. The material is certainly very useful and will have many applications to a lot of fields. The lectures are unfortunately not very clear, but you will be able to learn the material on your own individual time. Good course overall, as you learn math skills applicable to a lot of fields."
