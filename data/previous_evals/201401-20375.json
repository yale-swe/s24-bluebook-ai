   "comments": [
    "Great lectures from Della Rocca. I wish the readings were assigned according to a schedule rather than ad hoc emails. The syllabus should be shortened. Certain philosophers (e.g. Malebranche, Conway) should be removed so that more focus can be placed on Hume and Kant. I felt that not enough time was devoted to the more \"important\", and definitely more interesting philosophers. Overall though, a good introduction to the modern philosophers.",
    "Intro to Modern Philosophy is a survey course that spans several centuries of philosophical thought. This means that the texts aren't always in conversation with one another. Most of the philosophers we read are very concerned with theology, which is not particularly interesting to me - but that's the nature of the time period. We read pretty short excerpts, and spent relatively little time on each philosopher. I find philosophy classes about a particular topic more interesting. That said, Michael is a fantastic lecturer. Lectures are comprehensive and engaging, and the TAs were very helpful. Relatively easy course.",
    "Good overview of many philosophers",
    "Good course. Fun. Not too much work. (most students probably didn't do most of the reading). You learn a lot and it could open you up to philosophy. This is a good course to get your feet wet in philosophy.",
    "Intro to Modern was a great course! I found the subject matter much more interesting than in Intro to Ancient (Phil 125). I feel like a learned a lot this semester, but was never too overwhelmed with work for this class. I would definitely recommend the course, especially if Della Rocca is teaching it again.",
    "AN INCREDIBLE COURSE. MDR is one of the best professors I've had. He's a leader in his field (a Spinoza expert!!), and is so dynamic and helpful and kind. I was incredibly touched by the fact that by the end of the semester, he managed to learn almost everyone in the course's name, despite the fact that it was a rather large lecture. TAKE IT if you possibly can (even if you're not a philosophy major!!).",
    "It is an overview\/intro course, so you mostly focus on broader themes. The materials is interesting, but I would have not taken this course unless it was required for the Philosophy major. If you do take it, do so with Della Rocca - he is great!",
    "Great class if you're truly interested in philosophy. The papers are hard to write, and there isn't a ton of instruction on how to write a philosophy paper, though it is an introductory course. I wish a lecture had been dedicated to just explaining the process, or maybe an optional session or something. The final was fair, and you could definitely do well if you gave it the time it deserved.",
    "If you have to take it for the major - otherwise, take a more in-depth class that covers less material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. The reading can be difficult and isn't absolutely necessary, but going to lecture is, since it is easy to fall behind. The workload was fairly light, and you walk out of the class feeling like you learned something.",
    "PHIL 126 was a great class, really interesting material that was always explained well by Professor Della Rocca. It was much more interesting that PHIL 125. The reading was never too much, and there are only two papers, which are both graded fairly. Professor Della Rocca gives out study questions for the final, which are super helpful.",
    "Intro course that takes you through Descartes, Leibniz, Malebranche, Berkeley, Locke, Hume, Kant, and a few other philosophers. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Great survey course, not that difficult but introduces you to the \"who's who\" of the Early Modern world. Two 6 page papers and 1 exam weighted equally.",
    "A good class to audit. The reading was never really necessary and also very unclear as to what to read. Again, you do learn a lot in lecture, but thats really where the bulk of your info comes from. I'd recommend it for a general introduction to philosophy but to really ask deep questions then perhaps take a more specific philosophy course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student interested in philosophy. Michael Della Rocca is an extremely clear lecturer and makes complicated material very easy to understand. Each lecture follows a clear structure, which is also nice.",
    "Modern Philosophy is a wonderful survey course that provides a remarkable amount of depth. Professor Della Rocca is a superb lecturer. He is incredibly engaging, witty, and devoted.",
    "Great class! Della Rocca is a fantastic lecturer and teacher. He's very approachable and great at explaining complicated topics.",
    "This was a blazing touring of philosophers from Descartes to Kant, and I would recommend taking the course if this period of philosophy is of interest to you. By discussing majors works by these philosophers, you'll touch on lots of big issues in philosophy (mind-body problem, causation, identity, God). Since it's an intro course, you don't really get as into the texts as you might like (or maybe not doing so is your thing). In fact, lectures and sections never went into textual analysis, so you could get by just attending lectures and section. It's not a lot of work at all. I'd recommend taking this class before any further classes in metaphysics or seminars\/lectures dedicated to any one of the philosophers covered in the course. Understanding the dialectic\/philosophical landscape in which questions were first asked and arguments were made is crucial to appreciating philosophical arguments.",
    "Really wonderful lecture course. Professor Della Rocca is one of the best lecturers I've come across during my time at Yale (I'm a senior). He engages his students, moves through the material succinctly, and does a killer job elucidating philosophical ideas in layman's terms. The course itself was pretty great, too. As someone who has never taken a Philosophy course, learning about the metaphysical early modern philosophers was really eye-opening as so many of the questions they pose are provocative to this day. MDR does a wonderful job of making philosophers' ideas discernible and distilling the major differences between the philosophers of the course. I'd totally recommend the course to anyone (of any major) with a passing interest in the subject.",
    "A lot better than Ancient Philosophy. It starts a bit dull (you go over like 3 proofs of God's existence), but once you get to Leibniz, this class gets really mind boggling and interesting. The amount of reading is perfect, and the essay questions were definitely very inviting and--sometimes--fun to write about!",
    "I would recommend modern philosophy to everyone. If you\u2019ve never taken philosophy before and just want to check it out and know what it\u2019s about, this is the perfect class to take. It\u2019s not difficult but it will show you how philosophers ask questions and it will introduce you to some of the greatest thinkers of the early modern period. If you\u2019re very interested in philosophy and have a background and want to major in philosophy this class perhaps might be a little easy for you but it\u2019s required for the major so you have to take it anyway. In summary, everyone should take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I went into the course thinking I would learn something more akin to the meaning of life, etc, but that isn't at all what modern philosophy gives you. Instead of being disappointed that I wasn't going to get eternal wisdom from Descartes et al, I really learned how to think philosophically about things and analyze metaphysical arguments logically. It's also just a great class to take if you want to know what the big philosophers thought about certain topics but don't want to read all of their works by yourself -- these are concepts everyone should know, and professor della rocca gives amazing, amazing lectures that sum up the main points very nicely.",
    "Survey of philosophers from Descartes to Kant. If you really want to know more about them, take it; but otherwise not a particularly rewarding course.",
    "PHIL is a great introduction to the most important early modern philosophers in a historical context. The class is useful for philosophy majors as it covers essential thinkers in the discipline, but it is also useful for non-majors in that it covers thinkers who have been widely influential in the development of modern science and academic history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. There are very few cons."
