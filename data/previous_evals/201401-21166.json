    "Yes! DS is awesome.",
    "yes, great intro to philosophy, but be warned that philosophy writing is a different sort of writing than English papers and history papers and if you haven't done it before this class may take a bit more time investment",
    "This is a really good and interesting survey of Western philosophy in a very noncompetitive, generally inexperienced environment. It's also a good place to learn to write a philosophy paper.",
    "2nd semester DS philosophy is tough- not necessarily in terms of the quantity of reading, but in terms of the difficulty. However, the material is very interesting and the lecturers are just fantastic. Overall, a great intro to modern philosophy. Definitely recommended.",
    "Second semester philosophy is a really exciting class - the works are really in conversation with each other and the ideas become much more complex and interesting. Aaron Norby is a wonderful professor - he explains the texts, including the really hard ones like Hegel and Kant, incredibly clearly, and he leads a very animated, productive, and fun discussion. He is also a very fair grader and gives lots of helpful comments on the papers. I would highly recommend his section to any student.",
    "Absolutely do it. Kant is crazy, but it's all so worth it.",
    "DS Philosophy second semester introduces more epistemology and normative ethics, and the texts become more complex but much more enjoyable! Highlights for me included Hume and Kant. If you are taking DS Phil and want to improve and have an enjoyable section, take it with Aaron Norby! His section will give you a strong grasp of the texts, and Aaron also encourages debate and discussion of the texts. You will walk out with a great introductory grasp of the texts. He gives good feedback on papers, and his blind feedback will help you improve on each paper.",
    "Directed Studies wholly depends on the teacher and the class. If you have Professor Norby, you're set, and I would advise you to take the class. If anything, shop the class and see how you feel."
