   "comments": [
    "We were able to identify and unpack the popular concept of ethnic homogeneity in Japan.",
    "This seminar was perfect because I learned to ask discussion questions and moderate a discussion better. I also learned how to prepare and give a presentation. In terms of the material itself, I absorbed a lot and was able to apply it to other courses I was taking this semester. I went in with little knowledge about Japan and left feeling more educated on the culture and intrigued to learn more.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of various minority groups in Japan, from ethnic minorities to religious and sexual minorities. Thanks to this course, I was inspired to write my senior thesis on one of the minority groups we studied. Moreover, I was able to gain insight on the writing and methodology that is required in anthropology.",
    "We looked at the different minority groups based on ethnicity, religion, sexuality and disability. We also looked briefly at some theories on majority and minority, as well as the construction of Japanese-ness. This course certainly provides depth to one's understanding of a country often thought of as homogeneous.",
    "Anthropological way of thinking"

   "comments": [
    "This class is extremely engaging with not only the professor but also with your fellow students. A lot of discussion happened, which I think added a lot to the course!",
    "The course was very strong in giving anthropological background to everyhing we learned. It also gave me other skills that could be applied in other courses. It was a good-sized seminar and I like that we were made to lead discussion because that was helpful to me as a speaker. Although allowing students to lead a class was a great idea, I feel the student leading and the rest of the class would have benefited if there was a bit more guidance on this because some presentations felt more helpful than others.",
    "Strengths: very interesting readings\/materials, helpful feedback from professor, easy to participate due to smaller class size. Weaknesses: lots of writing (4 papers and writing responses twice a week) even though its not a writing credit. I wish we had different assessments other than just papers.",
    "We were assigned one class session to lead the discussion, and it was always very interesting to see what other students had to say about the topic. The discussions in general were very engaging and constructive. The weakness I would say is the design of the assignments. It was unclear what was expected of us for the three paper assignments. We would have also benefited from a more directed or structured paper assignments.",
    "Broad themes Focusing on fewer minority groups might make it possible for students to learn each more deeply"

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! Gives you a great overview about different minority groups and by discussions led many times throughout the semester by students you gain a lot",
    "It was an amazing course that really taught us the way to frame concepts like ethnicity and race in a Japanese context.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have an interest in Japan or learning of minority dynamics in foreign countries. Professor LeBaron von Baeyer is patient and an excellent discussion facilitator. The articles she chose were also never too long and always informative and understandable. The course is welcoming to students of all levels of knowledge onJapan and even benefits from a variety of backgrounds, as the emphasis is that you learn from each other as well as from the material. The workload is manageable.",
    "Yesit was not an easy course, but if you put in the effort, you will be surprised by how much you learn not only about minorities in Japan but also about Japanese history, culture, and comparisons between the US and Japan. Highly recommended.",
    "This course is a great introduction into the Japanese society and provides an in-depth understanding of the diversity\/homogeneity of the society. If you are interested in East Asia, definitely take this course! You will come out with enough knowledge to argue against the commonly held view of Japan.",
    "From this class you can learn not only about minority groups in Japan but also about anthropological thinking styles. A great class if you are interested in Japan, minority, identity politics, helping people, and anthropology."
