    "his outline at lottery was very clear, we would be designing and documenting a small house in chicago, to a level of detail that would render the building almost buildablefrom the documentation we would produce. all met and exceeded.",
    "My expectations were to design a fully realized house. These expectations were met.The schedule was too rigid for the first few weeks. I think an additional week could have been dedicated to finding an initial parti or concept.",
    "Far exceeded my expectations, which were high going in -- best studio I have had at Yale. Please bring Tom Beeby back as a visiting professor until he decides he's finished. Even then, convince him to come back.",
    "It has exceeded my expectations. I learned how to put a house together and how to detail it. I've also learned how to create an argument around one of the most basic human needs: a house, which is missing from the architectural discourse in general, so I appreciated the opportunity.",
    "I expected to develop a small house from concept through design development. This expectation was met."
