   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student. Clear, interesting, and organized lectures. Do not need to attend lecture to get a good grade, BUT you are missing out if you don't attend lecture. Make sure to choose a good TF!",
    "Do not take it, it's a waste of time. I only changed it from Credit\/D because I needed the grade I was getting. I took time to do the readings and watch the videos because they were actually very cool - as for the weekly writing assignments, they aren't that much of a hassle and you get some weeks off. I never went to class, he puts everything online and the lecture is boring, so why bother.",
    "This is a great course that really makes you think about sports in a different way. Viewing sports from an anthropological perspective is actually quite fun, and I would definitely recommend the class. It's not a difficult writing credit either .",
    "A great course that will make even the most intense sports fan look at sports differently and more completely. Not too much reading and it is interesting.",
    "It's a great class in that it's interesting and that it counts as a WR.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in sports. It's an easy grade, section is fun because it's just a table conversation about the current ESPN headlines, and you can really get into your topics for papers.",
    "Yes. Good way to fulfill the writing requirement, especially if interested in sports.",
    "Professor Kelly is the worst.",
    "I would recommend ANTH 282 to fellow students if they are interested in sports. But be aware of the weekly writing load which is at minimum a page and usually based on the readngs. Also beware of sections TA's that do not want to TA, and thus make section a less than pleasurable experience.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it-- it is interesting and you will love the lectures.",
    "Super exciting and you will learn so much about not only common sports but non-mainstream sports as well. I completely recommend this class, the writings were interesting and I enjoyed completing each one and seeing what my T.A. had to say.",
    "The course was OK. Could have been a lot better, but the workload is not bad at all for a writing credit.",
    "It is a great writing credit if you like sports.",
    "I would recommend it only for Credit\/D, in which case it is the easiest class ever.",
    "Yes, as a course to supplement other coursework. Not as the center piece of your courses for the semester.",
    "Definitely recommend. Great writing class on an interesting subject. Professor is excellent. Make sure you get a good section though.",
    "Yes. Take it if it is offered again.",
    "Don't take it just for the WR credit. Don't be lazy! About 90% of the class will be jocks who just play solitaire in their laptops during lecture, and it will get annoying.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Since it is a writing requirement, it does demand a fair amount of writing, including a weekly assignment (usually 1-2 pages long) and 3 course essays.",
    "Easy and boring",
    "It's a good class. The lectures aren't bad, but you don' even have to go since they are completely unrelated to your grade. You can just go to section and get an A.",
    "It's a writing credit where you get to write about whatever sport you want, so that's obviously pretty cool. However, note that you do have to write for section (which is mandatory) every week. There are three papers that aren't that long but the grading is not super easy, although the high population of athletes lowers the curve a bit.",
    "Good WR course. Interesting material.",
    "Sport, Society, and Culture was a very neat class, especially if you have a passion for athletics. I would recommend it because it covers interesting material and is very laid back for a writing credit.",
    "Take it if you need a WR and are interested in the topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially as an easy writing credit.",
    "take it.",
    "A great way to get a WR credit if you care at all about sports.",
    "The workload is manageable, but this course is not as good as it sounds. Some of the readings were interesting, and the papers were enjoyable to write because they were on a sports world of your choice.",
    "If you're interested in sports and are opinionated in your writing, this is a great class. Some of the lectures are kind of dull, but the section was the most interesting I've had at Yale, and you really get a chance to explore and express your views. You definitely do have to write, but the workload is very manageable.",
    "I would suggest this class to someone who wants to learn to look at sports in a new way.",
    "Somewhat boring lectures, but interesting information, lots of writing.",
    "Pretty easy class where weekly assignments are not very time consuming. Take it for an easy WR credit",
    "reading and section discussions are interestinglectures are a bit dry but it's a good writing credit",
    "Yes, it is a great writing class.",
    "yes highly recommend",
    "This class sucks. It's just three months worth of absolute BS where you learn literally nothing about sports or society or culture. Don't take it. Some people think it's a gut...it's really easy and you can get away with little work, but if you're looking to take a gut it's probably worth finding something even easier. Certainly don't take it if you have any interest in learning. It's a waste of a credit.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to get a writing credit.",
    "Yes",
    "An interesting class that doesn't require too much work. I ended up doing readings because they were fun to read rather than needing to read them for class (you don't). There is a short writing assignment each week for section, which is easy, and section requires little more than a working knowledge of sports. A good class for that pesky WR."
