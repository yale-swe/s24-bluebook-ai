   "comments": [
    "This was an excellent course, all around.Professor Paltiel clearly has a gift for teaching--his explanations are straight-forward and interesting, and I genuinely looked forward to each class. The material is very compelling, and clearly has many applications for research--both in execution, and in understanding.",
    "Very interesting course. Assigned cases were very helpful for learning the material. At times it went a bit slow.",
    "This course provided me with a strong foundational knowledge of cost effective analysis and decision making. I liked the classes in which we were presented with a concept and then had to go do a homework assignment rather than the reverse order, which also occurred. I thought a discussion section with the TA's may have been helpful to more explicitly go through the concepts and review homework.",
    "Really learned a lot from statistical\/probabilistic\/outcome aspect of disease prognosis.",
    "Very interesting introduction to cost effectiveness analysis, especially the second half of the class. Was sometimes frustrating that the class went too slowly to accommodate all students.",
    "Self-taught, but it was very helpful going over the homework after we had a chance to attempt it. Slides were well done; however, sometimes the extra examples of studies became extraneous.",
    "I loved the course! It was a great introduction to the methods used in cost-effective analysis and decision making and the cases allowed students to try out the methods which was really nice! I loved format with a combination of cases and lectures.The time of the course - in the evening - was a bit rough.",
    "Strengths - amazing professor, really interesting content, format was great (complete cases before class and then discuss them in class)Weaknesses - pace was a little slow",
    "It is a great course. It is challenging but very fun.",
    "Awesome course, great professor, fun and easy material, not super time intensive.",
    "Useful and interesting",
    "The course was a pleasant surprise. Loved it!",
    "great course. learned a new way of thinking.",
    "This has probably been my favorite class at YSPH, both in terms of content and style of the class. I thought the case studies had a good level of difficulty where I learned some on my own but still well supported by the material from class. Midterm and final exams were also appropriately challenging",
    "Very practical and useful. Teaches something that can be applied to a lot of different areas",
    "Very good class. I learned very much about the method used in cost-effectiveness analysis. Definitely one of the most useful class I've taken. Slides could be better organized. The cases are very good practice.",
    "I like how we had to use excel for most of the problems at the end of the semester. I feel much more comfortable with excel now.",
    "Great topics and interesting instructor, but little application of concepts.",
    "Good and interesting course.",
    "Good class, and learn a lot for C.E.A.But the homework is not that helpful and explanation for HW is less in the second half semester.",
    "A fun class but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have to take it. It was enjoyable because the professor was really funny and the cases were fun to do, but I didn't walk away feeling like I knew much more about cost-effectiveness or decision analysis. The TAs could have had a better presence.",
    "This is a perfect introductory course in the decision analysis and cost-effectiveness evaluation.",
    "COST EFFECTIVENESS ROCKS. I learned a lot from the exercises. I would have learned more if the examples we went over in class were different from the ones we did on the homework.",
    "Great at introducing concepts, but it's very much independent learning to do the homework. the lecture slides could benefit from more structure since they're hard to understand outside of the lecture (i.e. going through the slides after class)",
    "Strength- ProfessorWeakness- Topics need revision and so would be good if he reviews problems or topics",
    "This course was fantastic. A greater emphasis on excel in the beginning would definitely be useful!",
    "Power point slides during some lectures had mistakes and were not corrected prior to lecture.Mathematical errors during some lectures made that material confusing.I suggest going through the slides and problems prior to the lecture to avoid this in the future.",
    "Course provided good overview of how to do cost-effectiveness analyses, and the principles\/assumptions which drive them. I would have liked more time for the topics toward the end of the course (Markov models and monte carlo). The practice midterm was helpful - would have liked a practice final too! :)",
    "Very informative, practical and interesting.",
    "introduced some basic but useful methods to evaluate options and make decisions, but pace of the lecture is a little too slow",
    "I love this course. It teaches me very important quantitative skills and the instructor is also top-notch.",
    "I think this was a good course. I left with a good understanding of Cost Effectiveness Analysis.The first part of the course was better than the second for several reasons. For one, I enjoyed going through the homework and even struggling with it, because I knew that we would be going over it at length in class. This, along with the fact that the homework's are graded on completion, really enhanced my learning as I wasn't afraid to make mistakes and could learn from them immediately in class. This changed during the second part of the semester, where we didn't even go over some of the homework's and instead went over things that wouldn't be tested on. I wish we would have continued to go over the homework as a group.The midterm was much better than the final. I felt the midterm was a fair test of our knowledge up to that point, but the final was really ridiculous. I found myself feeling like I hadn't learned anything based on what the final was testing, when I know that is not true. That final was not a fair test of our knowledge and just a cheap trick by the professor to bring the grade average of the class down. I did not appreciate this.Finally, I wish the homework would have been worth more of our final grade. I understand that it was only graded on completion, but myself and everyone else I know in the class really put a lot of effort into doing those homework's and I think they should be worth a larger portion of our grade because of this.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester. The topics covered were interesting and relevant and it gave me a new way to think about issues in public health and the way that we make decisions about health-related issues. I appreciated the relevant examples we worked through during class and the way that the issues were made pertinent to modern health policy and decision making. I was sometimes frustrated by having to do a homework case on an issue that we hadn't yet covered in class, but overall I thought that was a good method of teaching this subject matter.",
    "1. the final exam was much harder than expected. A small part had to do that the notes for the last half of the course where very difficult to follow. There should have been better notes, not just in class demonstrations without notes on classesv2.",
    "This course was very good. It provides an introduction to a very important area in the study of public health. The lectures were very interesting and the problems were challenging and really relevant to learning the material. I think that this course should be a required course!The reading for the course was relevant, but it became a bit disjointed and it was a little hard to keep track of where we were each week. Also, I think that we needed to do have more practice solving more problems.",
    "The course was helpful. Going to class was crucial, as the explanations to problems that were given online were very bare bones. The solution posted online made sense only within days of seeing the professor solve the problem. If you look at the posted solution weeks after the fact, it did not make sense.",
    "Course would be so much better if there was a textbook that went with the course. Also, problem sets should be more rooted in the real world and health sector. Take home midterm and final are goid things, because one definitely needs time to complete these assessments and the time allotted is reasonable.",
    "Appears to be a course that would have real-world applications. Felt a little lost during the first half of the course, but things started to make more sense after the midterm.",
    "This was a great course: entertaining instruction, clear instructional focus on providing useful, drilled down information and no fluff. Examples were useful, exams (moreso the midterm than the final) allowed for useful application of class materials and problem sets.Final exam was DIFFICULT beyond what the midterm suggested. Problem 1 alone took over 6 hours! Overall, consider simplifying language of problems and providing more examples with assumptions. For instance, Problem 2 laid out a lot of assumptions, but their utility was not altogether clear (e.g., why did it matter that an individual child could not participate in more than 1 program when no child population numbers were provided?), making it seem as though there was some \"trick\" being played.",
    "It was an eye opening experience to me. Extremely useful concept and gradual approach the leads to complex methodology.",
    "Great professor, extremely interesting topic, second half of the semester kind of lags but any time David Paltiel is speaking you will stay engaged.",
    "Useful material."

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Professor Paltiel dose an excellent job keeping us engaged for a topic that can easily become tedious. Most of us feel excited to come to class and work hard to figure out the cases. He is really great at teaching. By letting us try the homework on our own then talking about it in class makes a big difference. We are able to think deeper and come with questions, and the fact that he does not have TAs help with the problems before we talk in class really enforces that thinking before class aspect. And it also means more meaningful time with the TAs covering material that he may not have elaborated on during lecture. Excellent job, and I wish more of my courses are like this!",
