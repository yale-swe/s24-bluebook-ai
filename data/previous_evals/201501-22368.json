   "comments": [
    "Very fast paced course where you will learn a lot. Studying a little bit every day is crucial to follow this course as well as dedication with the homework.",
    "Very informative and challenging",
    "You get into a lot of the tough grammar in italian 2 but you get to learn a lot of interesting stuff too. I would recommend the class.",
    "Take it only if it's taught by a native, I cannot stress this enough. Take it from Siobhan only if you have scheduling conflicts or if the sections taught by the natives are full. There's a lot of work. There was a composition (averaging 300 words) due every Monday which you then had to revise and submit by Friday. This was especially difficult since we would get them back a day or two before they were due. Chapter tests were given every two weeks and you had to turn in the workbook chapter the day of the test. The workbook doesn't really help. Even if you budget your time with the workbook, it still takes forever; it's stupid to spend all that time worrying about completing it when she doesn't even grade it - you grade it yourself before handing it in and she just wants to see that you've done it. The textbook is awful. In the vocab sections it doesn't give all the translations of the words, particularly if the word is next to a picture (a lot of the time it's not obvious what it's referring to). It's all over the place and it's difficult to refer to it when studying. Also, the examples in the grammar sections don't help to understand the constructions, aka there is no plain translation for each construction (ex. Voglio = I want \/ avevo volute = I had wanted). Even in the second semester of Italian I still found it difficult. Because Spanish and Italian are very similar, if you have a Spanish background or took Spanish you will have both no problem learning and speaking Italian. If you have a background in French or Latin, or both, you will have a difficult time learning the language; I took French and Latin before Yale and I found this particularly true in the first semester. Also, go to Italian tables and don't leave them till last minute.",
    "I would recommend the class if you're really interested in learning Italian or you have to fulfill the language requirement. Italian is really fun as a language and you can learn it relatively quickly."
