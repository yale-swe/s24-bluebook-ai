   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was fun, and never overwhelming, plus I always felt supported.",
    "It was a wonderful experience. I strongly recommend it, although I think you will get the most out of it if you have the time to really think about your work for a long time before handing things in. Creativity and craft isn't really something that you can produce the night before a big assignment is due, so keep that in mind!",
    "This is a great way to improve your writing, compile a portfolio to use in further creative writing applications, and Deming's feedback is super helpful. Looked forward to class each week.",
    "I would recommend the course to those with an interest in writing creatively. If writing doesn't interest you, I wouldn't really recommend it.",
    "This class is a great exposure to the three genres of creative writing (poetry, fiction, and drama). Because it is three genres, you never really get too much of any one, which might be a downside. Also, be prepared to write a lot of each type of writing-- don't take this class if you're afraid of poetry or another genre, because you will have to write it. But it is super fun, and Deming is great, so highly recommended, especially if you've never taken a class in the workshop setting.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! If you are even a little bit interested in creative writing, take this. If you want to be a creative writer, take it. It gives you direction, and you learn a lot about the craft of writing. It is a wonderful gateway into the world of creative writing that Yale has to offer. It might be difficult for those who have difficulty accepting critique for something that, until Yale, might have been pursued as a hobby rather than a course. All the critique is worth it, and it gives you a respectable body of work you can use to apply to the other classes.",
    "Take this class. It's fun, it will push you out of you comfort zone, and the workload is totally manageable. And, if you can, take it with Deming.",
    "Take this class. It's a block for fiction, poetry, and drama. I wish there was more time to spend on each genre, but this was a good way to explore creative writing as a whole. Deming is great: his feedback is incredibly helpful.",
    "This class is really very good. If you're looking to get an introduction to all three genres, or even if you're just looking to take a class on writing, take this class. This obviously depends on how much effort you put in as an individual, but I put in a lot of work to this class, and my writing improved significantly in all three genres. Deming is wonderful he will point out things about assigned readings, workshopped pieces, and your own writing as well that are so keen and so insightful. I don't know if I really benefitted too much from other people in the class since this class was mostly freshmen, but Deming was so wonderful that didn't matter. If you put in a lot of work to this class, you will come out of it as a better writer and with a portfolio that you're proud of. Just take this class. It's wonderful.",
