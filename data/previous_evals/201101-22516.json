    "I would take this class if it is taught again and you are at all interested in French culture, literature, or history. It offers a great survey of French lit taught in a different way than the usual survey classes because of its theme, and I think this makes it a lot easier to see the connection between the history and the literature. I would not, however, take this class as your \"easy\" class for the semester. Though the term time work to hand in is only two 3-page papers, if you are going to get anything out of it at all you have to read the books, and the reading takes a while (usually 300 pages per week of occasionally difficult French prose).",
    "TAKE IT!! Professor Samuels is the best!",
    "It's an interesting class, worth it if you don't know much about French lit and are going to do the reading. It's an easy class to slack off in, though, especially since there's a lot of reading, so don't take it if you don't think you'll get around to reading.",
    "Money and the Novel is a freshman seminar about how the rise of capitalism in France is reflected in 19th century French literature. Our class had an interesting mix of people: some of us interested in French, some of us interested in econ, some of us interested in English\/literature, some of us just intrigued by the course title, and that mix made for pretty lively class discussions. Most of the books we read (all in translation) were classics by Balzac, Maupassant, Zola \u0097 with the exception of the lesser-known \"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter\" which is actually the basis for the musical \"Rent.\" Generally the reading was enjoyable and not overwhelming, and while you had to keep on top of it to contribute to class discussions, it never felt like a burden. Professor Samuels had taught this class before (at Penn, I think) and so it was well-organized and planned out. He is so, so knowledgeable about French literature of this period and it's really cool to hear his theories on the books; he's also just laid back and a funny guy (we spent our very last seminar meeting comparing the realist 19th-century novel to modern reality TV). The class is a WR\/HU credit though we didn't write that much, just 2 short papers and a final 10-page research essay. I perhaps would have appreciated more feedback on my writing \u0097 if you're looking for a thorough criticism of your prose, you're probably better off taking something in the English department. Also, I came into this class thinking it'd heavily integrate French history, and it really doesn't. It is solidly a literature course, though we do discuss the literature in its historical context. One downside is that the theme of \"money and the novel\" can get a bit repetitive 2\/3 of the way through the semester. But overall yes, I would recommend the course if you're interested in reading the books on the syllabus.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course -- although the topic of this class may not be as immediately appealing as some of the other freshman seminars, much of the literature that you read in this course is canonical, and Professor Samuels is a terrific professor. He's always enthusiastic about each class discussion, and is an expert in the field. He even wrote the forward to the copy of \"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter\" that we read. Although you end up reading a lot of books in one term, the reading assignments are incredibly manageable and the papers are evenly spread out.",
    "Please take this class! I'm so glad that I did. The reading can sometimes be a challenge to keep up with, but the knowledge you will gain is definitely worth it.",
    "Definitely take it. Such a fun class.",
    "Interesting course. Don't take it over something you really want, but it's not a waste of a course, and it's a good writing credit if you don't want to take english.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class for anyone who enjoys reading and analyzing major themes running through various 19th century french novels.",
    "This is a interesting freshman seminar. The reading rate is about a book every week-and-a-half to two weeks, but the books are fun and fairly easy reads overall, nothing too dense or academic. Professor Samuels is a great professor. He's incredibly knowledgeable about French history and French literature, which makes discussions in the class really fun. The books are also really fun - sort of the Gossip Girl of 19th century France (we've made this comparison multiple times in class if that gives any idea of what discussions are like!). Workload is pretty manageable, two short essays (3 pages) and a final 10 page essay. A really fun class - definitely take it if you've got in.",
    "Yes! Especially to those who are interested in the topic but have never had any chance to read any 19th century french literature before. This course is a very good intro course. However, since we read 8 books by various authors over a pretty short span of time, its hard to dig deep into any author or book. So if you are looking for more close analysis, this might not be what you are looking for.",
    "This is a fairly interesting seminar class on 19th-century French novels. It incorporates literature, history and economics, and will provoke you to have a lot of deep thinking about some very engaging topics such as money, love and social relationships. If you love these topics you will definitely enjoy the class, but be prepared for intense class discussion which almost falls into fierce competition, simply driven by the fact that class participation takes up the most of the grade. Overall, a great class to take as a freshman seminar.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. However, I would tell them that it does require a lot of work because of the books that you must read. The writing requirement for the class is not very difficult though only 2 papers and a final paper; it was very managable.",
    "terrif introduction to texts you might never read otherwise, and really, really should.",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor Samuels is my favorite professor at Yale so far. He knows everything about post-revolutionary French history and literature, and will explain how it relates to economics through capitalism. You read a novel per 3 class meetings (about a novel every 1.5 weeks). You have one oral presentation, 2 short papers, and one long final paper. The reading was a bit heavy, but the work was overall very manageable. Take it."
