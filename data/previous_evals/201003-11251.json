   "comments": [
    "This is a basic neuroscience class providing systemic knowledge for beginners.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student, but only if they were truly interested in the topic and were willing to give the course a lot of effort.",
    "Sure, good course for learning fundamentals of neurobiology.",
    "With it's lab yes",
    "A good foundation in the molecular and cellular part of neuroscience, but insufficient for systems level neuroscience.",
    "maybe no",
    "A fairly thorough class in neurobiology, but very challenging, especially if you are the sort who has any issues with tests or being graded solely on 3 tests. If it is material you want to or need to learn, it will certainly force you to learn it as much as you can, but you will be more on your own for feedback than you might want and it is fast-paced. Definitely read the recommended book; it is much more engaging and better at description -- if you are behind on reading and feel you have to deal with the monster of many pages of KSJ before you should look at the merely recommended book, you are probably wrong. Reading the recommended book is very good for comprehension and getting a narrative of what you're learning about (if you can hear it in your head in Professor Kaczmerack's British accent, so much the better). Once you've read the recommended book and looked at the handouts, skim through KSJ for parts you may have missed, want clarification on, or want to see more detailled figures for. KSJ is too huge a tome to really read all of, and is much better as a reference for more information."

   "comments": [
    "helpful to understand papers in the field",
    "This course did deepen my knowledge of the field of neurobiology extensively, and this will be very helpful during my research.",
    "I feel like I have a good understanding of some of the fundamental concepts of neurobiology, and I can now apply this knowledge to understand specific circuits, etc. as required by my research (human machine interaction, robotics).",
    "Very much",
    "Helps me get a reasonable overall understanding of cellular and molecular neurobiology.",
    "average",
    "It certainly gives a good and fairly thorough grounding in the cellular and molecular basis of neuroscience, which is a valuable resource for getting an understanding of basic levels on which one can build. For my research, it provides more of an underlying framework or foundation to keep in mind rather than being as directly applicable."
