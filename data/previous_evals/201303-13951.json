   "comments": [
    "National Security Law was a great seminar. The material was extremely interesting, and so were the discussions. The weekly workload was not too bad, even though some weeks had definitely a lot of readings (compared to others with only 40 or 50 pages to read). Writing my case study paper was a great experience and a great way of applying what we learnt in class to a concrete case. Writing the final (a issue spotter) was surprisingly fun too! Overall, I would definitely recommend this class if Prof. Rangappa offers it again!",
    "This has been one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you have any interest in national security law, this is the class to take! Professor Rangappa is AMAZING - she really cares about all the students in the seminar. She also brought in some really cool guest speakers like Harold Koh and John Witt from YLS. I always looked forward to going to this seminar.In terms of assignments, there's a weekly reading response, a paper, and a final. That sounds like not a lot, but the final is probably the most challenging final I've had at Yale. Don't let that scare you away though - you'll get through it and once you do, you'll feel pretty legit.I would HIGHLY recommend this if you're interested in the topic.",
    "This is an excellent course to take for someone interested in the subject matter, even for students with no prior experience. We cover a lot of ground and end up getting into some very technical areas, but these are all skills that you develop over the course of the semester. Professor Rangappa is an excellent teacher, although you really have to seek her out if you want to meet with her. I suppose it's typical of law school professors who expect their students to be almost entirely independent, but she will allow the entire semester to pass without really getting to know you--even in a seminar--if you let it happen.",
    "This is a new course on a topic very relevant to today's world. And it is everything you want and expect out of a Yale seminar course - interesting, great professor, out-of-class opportunities(talks with Harold Koh, John Witt and Alex Rosmiller), and of course, so much material that it is not humanly possible to cover all of it. You could think of the latter point as a weakness, but it just goes to show how much national security law has exploded since 9\/11. Most of our class was in 3rd or 4th grade in 2001. And this semester we had the chance to analyze and talk about much of what happened in the aftermath, all the way up to the present day. Pretty epic.",
    "Yes, take it if you have any interest in national security, law or policy.",
    "An undergraduate law course about topics in American National Security Law and jurisprudence. International Law is not addressed. I would highly recommend the class to any student interested in counterterrorism issues - it will challenge whatever convictions you have coming into class, and you will find the experience rewarding.",
    "This is undoubtedly the best class I have ever taken in my time at Yale. The subject matter is fascinating, the class has an incredible amount of depth, and Prof. Rangappa is remarkable synthesizing very, very complicated and (at times) confusing case law and statutory law to give you a clear understanding of how interpretations of the Constitution and Statutes have evolved over time to deal with critical national security issues of the day.I think a remarkable facet of the course is how despite seeming so distinct from each other, the course's 4 themes - Presidential\/Congressional War Powers, Intelligence and Covert Action, The 4th Amendment and Detention\/Military Trial Powers - are woven together for a wonderfully enjoyable final examination. Professor Rangappa also organizes wonderful dinners with guests outside of class (Harold Koh, John Witt, Alex Rosmiller)and some great movie screenings as well. Her Office Hours are incredibly accessible, and she helps you a lot with your midterm paper if you so desire.I had a great experience, and would recommend this course to anyone !",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!",
    "Take it!"
