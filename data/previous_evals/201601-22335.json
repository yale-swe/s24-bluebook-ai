   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is definitely a useful course, especially for inorganic students. The first part of the course seems to get a little heavy in the theory, but the second part is incredibly useful in learning how to solve structures.",
    "If you want to learn crystallography, there is nothing better. If you don't think this skill will help you in the future, then don't take this course. It is very specific to that skill, and I don't think it is a class that confers any kind of general knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The class was enjoyable and taught me a lot about the theory and use of crystallography.",
    "I think this crystallography course is an excellent addition to most chemists repertoires. Some may find it more applicable than others (I suspect I will never take a crystal structure in my graduate career), but the theory behind the work will be valuable nonetheless. I would recommend this course for most inorganic students, particularly those with a synthetic focus.",
    "CHEM 553 covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of small molecule crystallography. I would absolutely recommend the class to another student! It's very useful to learn this material if you're going to be solving crystal structures for your research.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you don't have experience solving crystal structures.",
    "A practical class to learn crystallography. Would strongly recommend.",
    "The first half describes the theory behind crystallography (about beams, unit cells, etc) and the second half is practical implementation with real data. Very useful to see how everything works in practice, and how some of the instrumentation can be used to get real results.",
    "The course starts out with the first half being more of a theoretical intro into the blackbox that is xrd. There was some information that was invaluable, but at the end of this half of the course I did not feel like I had as good of a grasp on the theory as I should have. I'm just not sure there's enough time in one semester to adequately teach the theory and structure solving. The second half of the course was solving structures. I believe learned what I needed to learn to solve structures, but it was a lot of work outside the class and in brandon's office to do so. The one thing that I recall being poorly done was the integration of certain constraints and restraints into the solving of structures. From what I recall we were given a lecture on all of the restraints\/constraints and commands in one class before even really using olex much. As a result, the lecture felt very abstract and I didn't really understand how to use them. I think it would be highly beneficial to give a pictoral example in the lecture of when a constraint might need to be use and the result of the constraint in pictoral form."

   "comments": [
    "This will be incredibly helpful going forward. I will be obtaining quite a few crystal structures while here and this course will be invaluable toward that end.",
    "Before I took this class, I knew next to nothing about crystallography. Now, I believe I have the tools (an important one having built a working relationship with Brandon) to tackle any crystallography problem I encounter. I believe this will be invaluable to my research.",
    "Small molecule crystallography is relevant to many of the inorganic students who took the class, as most of us will do some sort of crystallography during their studies. While it has not directly related to my research yet, I still think it is a very valuable class that deepens our knowledge of an important chemical technique\/method.",
    "I didn't know very much about crystallography before taking the course, and now I feel confident in my ability to solve a crystal structure. I also have a much better understanding of the theoretical aspects of x-ray crystallography.",
    "Learned how to solve structures",
    "This course helped me understand where crystal structures come from, which enables me to look further at computational models.",
    "I learned to solve structures, which was the courses ultimate aim. Still fuzzy on the theory."
