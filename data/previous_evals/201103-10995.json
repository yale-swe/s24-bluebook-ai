    "I would only recommend it as an introductory vision of latin american literature.",

    "It allowed me to define rigorously the \"Modernismo\". Reading the journalistic chronicles helped me realize that the \"modernista\" aesthetic was not exclusive of the poetry and novel.",
    "Since this is my main area of interest, my work on Lugones was extremely interesting and exciting for me. It really opened up a whole new level of appreciation for his work and allowed me to work with his experimental theater, which I hope to continue to focus on and broaden my work in in the future."
