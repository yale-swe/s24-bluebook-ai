   "comments": [
    "German 130 was a very solid course. It was a good balance between vocab and grammar, and a lot of it is a review and deeper learning of some of the grammar we only touched upon in L1 and L2. I also really liked Alex Gardner, he's a great professor, and the German department as a whole is very down to earth and accessible. We had only one oral exam this semester, and the final is a skit, same as L1 and L2. The tests sometimes felt difficult, but in retrospect, they were generally very reasonable",
    "No final exam, which is great. Syllabus is very grammar intensive and lacks direction. Various sections seem random, which makes it difficult to build on previous sections.",
    "L3 German is basically a grammar review\/expansion, with a significant amount of vocabulary coming along as well. The course itself was very well organized at the broader level, but the constant stream of memorization and repetition, drawing on many different parts of German grammar, is something to be prepared for.",
    "Great. Fun language. Lots of time.",
    "If you have taken L1 and L2 at Yale, 130 is more of the same. You will watch some interesting movies and read some interesting selections. Overall, it is a good continuation of German 120 and will broaden your appreciation of German History and Culture.",
    "It was a great class. The main focus is grammar. If Alex was still teaching here, I would say definitely take it with him!",
    "I would -- it's much harder than L1 and L2 German, but it's a fun course and you'll learn a lot.",
    "German 130 is best summarized as a review of German 110 and German 120. I would recommend it, obviously, if you are fulfilling your language requirement, but even if you are just taking German for the sake of learning German, this class is a great review."
