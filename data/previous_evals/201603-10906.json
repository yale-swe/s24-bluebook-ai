   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about how oil, gas and coal forms, both in terms of the chemistry, the physics and the plate tectonics, however as a non science major it was completely accessible to me. I also learned a lot about oil, gas and coal recovery methods, the impact of those methods, the impact of fossil fuel use and the future of energy.",
    "I learned a LOT about fossil fuels -- history, chemistry, application, but I there wasn't a ton of time dedicated to discussing energy transitions (so maybe not exactly adherent to the name of the course title). Lots of applications to markets, policy, and some discussion of modern day dialogues surrounding fossil fuels as well.",
    "I was able to expand my knowledge about fossil fuel formation, location, and the effects on the environment they have. This information was very useful as I have been able to apply so many aspects of this course into my other political science classes and current events (such as the Paris Climate Change Summit).",
    "This class discusses many interesting facts and concepts about the history and production of the fossil fuels.",
    "I learned some about petroleum geology and about fossil fuel transitions, and understand the reality of fossil fuels, their environmental impacts, and possible energy futures, much better. Because of the problem sets, I also was reminded how to do calculations and conversions. I thought the problem sets taught the material well. However, I found the lectures quite dry (or it was just that I was unable to focus at 9am and didn't realize that about myself).",
    "Oil. Super useful and even more interesting.",
    "Very informative introduction to earth sciences and fossil fuel use in the world today",
    "This course served as an excellent overview of the formation of fossil fuel systems and their exploitation. It also addressed pressing societal issues, such as the shifting composition of fuel consumption and the effects of climate change. This class provided the necessary tools to understand not only the basics of combustion reactions but also the greater effects of fossil fuel consumption on the world at large.",
    "solid introduction to fossil fuels systems and earth science and thinking about the modern energy transition",
    "I learned about fossil fuels, energy transitions, extraction methods, and the relevant earth science topics. The learning objectives were clear, worthwhile, and realistic. There was a heavier quantitative focus than what I expected, but it's good to flex those muscles too. I am interested in the political and international dimensions of energy policy and climate change so this course provided a rigorous overview of relevant scientific topics.",
    "The awareness of our country and world's climate and energy crises as well as the science behind fossil fuels and the urgency needed for transitions to alternative energy sources that could help resolve these crises.",
    "Great science credit",
    "- Clarified understanding of fossil fuel geology - Clarified understanding of climate change -Clarified understanding of measuring emissions and CO2 isotopes -Introduced to a new suite of climate change and geology resources, including books and articles",
    "Very helpful in understanding the current issues of climate change and fossil fuel reserves",
    "Fundamentals of the oil and gas industry. If you are looking for more on renewable energy then try the Forestry School. The syllabus indicates a segment on renewable transitions, but its a small portion. Biggest take-away is understanding\/learning the fossil fuel development cycle.",
    "Great teacher and course material.",
    "Fossil Fuels gives you a great introduction on how the fuels that we use in everyday life actually form over time and how they are produced.",
    "I learned about more than fossil fuels, but basic geology concepts like plate tectonics, mountain formations, earthquakes, and climate change. The exercises where we calculated our carbon footprint was interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about fossil fuel formation, recovery and use, and what impacts they have on the environment.",
    "This class helped me much better understand energy consumption in general. It's really important to know where our energy comes from and why we should care about it.",
    "I learned a great deal about the geology that causes the formation of different fossil fuel deposits as well as the engineering required to access various fossil fuel reserves. I also gained great insight into the impact of various fossil fuels on global warming and the basic science behind our modern understanding of global warming."

   "comments": [
    "Great course with interesting lectures, but I felt like some of the problem sets were busy work and didn't help too much with learning.",
    "Strengths: ORISTAGLIO. An incredibly understanding, passionate, engaging professor. Clearly loves teaching, and does much more than just read off the slides. If you're uncertain about the class, TAKE IT FOR ORISTAGLIO.",
    "I learned a LOT about fossil fuels and how they're formed. I think the most interesting part for me was learning about how oil and coal is formed, and about how fracking works. I was kind of disappointed not to learn more about the different renewable energy sources in more detail, but I guess then we wouldn't have covered as much about fossil fuels.",
    "Strengths of this course included lecture topics and engagement with topics on a broader scale of Fossil Fuels and thorough explanations of complicated topics. Also, the extra sessions during the week for help and questions were very beneficial. Weaknesses though included not doing many quantitative practice problems in class which made problem sets and tests more difficult.",
    "I believe implementing a second midterm would be beneficial to keep students engaged in the class.",
    "The structure of the course was appropriate for its aims.",
    "Assignments did a good job covering the material covered in class, and the tests were based off the problem sets.",
    "I thought this course was very well organized and insightful. However, working through practice problems both before and following problem set assignments would have been helpful.",
    "Mike is a really great professor. I enjoyed his lectures a lot, though it would've been nice for the class to start later than 9.",
    "This is a very well-structured course and should be an example to other courses in related fields. Strengths: The weekly review sessions, exam review slides, and professor accessibility are all huge assets. The problem sets apply information learned in class to students' particular circumstances, which is enjoyable and engaging. Also, the powerpoints are incredible. Weakness: Some exam problems seemed like too far of a leap from the content in class and on problem sets (especially for those of us that are quantitatively challenged) even though it was nice to avoid an exam that was just regurgitation of facts and figures. I also think this course would have been more difficult for students that did not have peers to form study groups with. Given the course's size, teaching assistants might find Piazza a valuable tool for students to form study groups or ask general questions (would probably ease Prof. O from getting lots of email questions or the TAs from getting redundant questions).",
    "Very good structure of learning\/evaluation as well as professor accessibility\/care\/connection with students Grade structure however potentially too spread out - an average grade on a problem set has much more impact than in a regularly graded course where performance on midterm\/exam is emphasized more",
    "manageable workload and interesting stuff",
    "-Less focus on geology and more on climate change would be helpful",
    "Lecture was very dry, but informative.",
    "Great course content. No improvement",
    "Lectures were great and interesting. Sometimes it seemed like the psets did not directly apply to the lectures.",
    "The lectures were a bit dry. When studying for the exam, I realized the material was very interesting but the class was not very engaging and hindered my ability to see the material in a fun and interesting light.",
    "This is a great course. It is not too much work to deter people who are interested in the subject matter but it teaches you a lot from the very base level of the subject. The professor is an amazing teacher and makes you excited about the class, despite it being so early in the morning.",
    "I think the main strength is the strong engineering background of professor Oristaglio. It allows him to offer great insight into the actual practice (rather than just the theory) behind exploring for and extracting fossil fuel deposits. I think another great strength was near the end of the course when the professor took time at the end of each lecture for a more practical exploration of the engineering behind the oil & gas industry."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think this was a very good class with interesting lectures, but the problem sets could sometimes feel like busy-work.",
    "I absolutely recommend it. I needed it as an energy studies credit, but it is also incredibly important and interesting information. If you have any interest in fossil fuels, energy markets, energy policy, and even some applied physics\/chemistry, I absolutely recommend it. Problem sets are very fair and build off of course material, midterm isn't bad either. If you go to the lectures, you WILL learn. The weekly review sessions are great too!",
    "Fossil Fuels was a great class and relatively good choice for a science credit for non-STEM majors. Being a political science major, I was able to apply the knowledge I learned to many of my classes and international issues currently in the world. With psets being every other week and worth most of your grade, it was set up in a great way. But be aware that the final will be very hard in comparison to the rest of the class.",
    "This was a very interesting class and a good class for a student in need of a science credit.",
    "Make sure you can actually get out of bed and to Kline Geology Laboratory at 9am. I thought it would be great and make me more of a morning person, but the time and location was very painful. However, this is still a great way to get a science credit! No regrets. Especially take it if you are a morning person. I also think that if you care about climate change, environmental activism, etc, you will find this course engaging and full of important material that you *need* to understand. As I said, I understand energy a lot better. Professor Oristaglio is really knowledgeable and interesting. He cares a lot about the material and has a lot of experience, so he is very interesting to talk to. Also, he is so so so helpful at office hours and study sessions with the problem sets or any other questions you have on the material. Don't hesitate to go to these study sessions for each problem set, they're so helpful! Also, Professor Oristaglio is really great about making review slides for the exams and holding helpful review session.",
    "If you need a SC credit and are interested in fossil fuel geology, this is a good option. However, the problem sets and exams, while not fantastically difficult, require a good bit of work and effort. The most frustrating element of the class for me was the extremely random grading. While some graders would take off only like 0.2 points for a straight up wrong answer, others would not give any partial credit at all. The final exam was also unexpectedly hard, since it required memorization of statistics which we had never needed to do before and did not know we would need to do, which was obviously frustrating.",
    "TAKE IT! It is super interesting good fun, and not too much work.",
    "Good science class. Covers a lot of fundamental knowledge for those interested in learning about the comprehensive effects of fossil fuel usage",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to non-STEM majors who are looking to get something out of their science credit. Lectures can be a bit dry, but the material is well organized and concisely presented. The class touches upon many of the energy issues facing the world today, which is quite valuable in enhancing both economic and political perspectives.",
    "The class teaches you a lot more than you realize until you start studying for the final and midterm. I got a lot out of the class and found Oristaglio's lectures to be pretty interesting a lot of the time. The class is really easy, but the final is really hard. Lots of obscure information to know that makes me feel like I didn't really get to reflect my understanding of the course on the exam but overall I think that when you factor in the problem sets and midterm the grading is pretty fair.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course - especially if I knew that the student would make the hike up Science Hill in the morning. I would be honest that the workload was a lot for me due to the problem sets, but that I am very excited about how much I learned and how critical the topics of the course are. Also, and perhaps most importantly, the instruction is fair and sincere - Professor Oristaglio rocks!",
    "Great course regardless of science credit - Oristaglio is a legend",
    "yes",
    "Yes, a good intro course to the topic of fossil fuels. Dr. Oristaglio does a good job of covering a variety of aspects of fossil fuels and the current environmental issues. As an energy consumer in today's world, I am . glad I have more information about the industry that plays such a large part in everybody's lives, for better or for worse.",
    "Yes -- I believe this course should be an FES Foundations course.",
    "No I would not. Don't take this if you're looking for an easy science credit. It's not easy.",
    "Yes- it is crucial information that must be learned",
    "If one is interested in the petroleum\/energy space, I highly recommend this course. Prof. Oristaglio has 30 plus years of oil and gas industry experience. He provided a lot of insight that went beyond the basic fundamentals of the course.",
    "Without a doubt.",
    "Great science credit even if you are not a science major. Tests are not too bad and psets can be lengthy.",
    "I would recommend. Interesting class with low workload and reasonable grading.",
    "The problem sets are irrelevant to the course. The midterm is easy, but the final is ridiculously hard.",
    "Take this class. Professor Oristaglio is a great teacher and makes class interesting while giving you a practical knowledge about fossil fuels. There is only a problem set every other week or so, one midterm and a final. Don't be deterred by the 9am start time in KGL--it's definitely worth it, particularly as a science credit.",
    "Yes, energy is important for our everyday lives, so a solid understanding of where energy comes from is something we all should try to obtain.",
    "This course is essential for anyone looking for a career in the energy industry."
