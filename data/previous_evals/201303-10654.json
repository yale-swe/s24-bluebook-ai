   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class! Great class to enjoy and learn. Your will be pushed to also use your ear to make conclusions and develop an opinion.",
    "I would recommend Music 130 for those with a prior interest in music. The lectures were interesting, but sometimes difficult to stay engaged in. However, the course provides a great foundation for those who hope to better appreciate music.",
    "Music 130 was pretty good course overall. The workload is light (only an hour or two of homework per class period) but you still learn a lot. The class was very small too, and this created a nice seminar environment even though it's technically a lecture course. Prof Ahrendt is very knowledgeable and a good lecturer. Definitely a good class to take if you need a humanities credit and are interested in music, religion, and history",
    "This is a great class. Prior knowledge of music is not required for this class, and I learned quite a lot about a subject that I would otherwise never learn. You should take something like this before your graduation.",
    "I would recommend the class with caution."
