   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about the murkiness of the Three Teachings in the period under discussion. Given the structure of the seminar, I also believe my grasp of Classical Chinese developed.",
    "The resolve to plow through religious\/philosophical text in classical Chinese. I am greatly humbled by the tasks involved in understanding different schools of thoughts in medieval China. Instructors were very helpful in curating class discussion although the heat was on when it got to my turn to provide my translation of the texts. Nervewrecking experience. but I learned a lot.",
    "I have learned many knowledge on medieval Chinese religions from prof. Bender and prof. Greene. i read many primary Chinese text and translated them.",
    "It was fascinating to see the way thinkers approached the three traditions during this period, in their mutual borrowing, synthesizing and defining. I feel I have a much better grasp of the resources available for studying texts from this period and an appreciation for the difficulty of teasing apart the various strands of thought that were evolving at that time.",
    "I gained: 1) my first extended encounter with Chinese Buddhism. From what I gathered from my more Buddhism-aware classmates, the materials we looked at don't seem to have been the kind of material one would likely see in a typical \"Intro to Buddhism\". That, of course, was not the point and this is not necessarily a bad thing even for those of us with little experience in Buddhism. 2) a much more authentic interaction with medieval Chinese religion \/ Confucianism \/ Xuanxue than ever before. Reading the classic commentaries (by Wang Bi \/ Guo Xiang \/ etc.) was my first encounter with Confucianism beyond Neo-Confucianism.",
    "I was able to read Classical Chinese faster than before.",
    "gain an understanding of Confucian, Buddhist and Daoist classics and commentaries; reading literary Chinese pre-Tang and Tang.",
    "I learned how to read Chinese ancient texts, and the relationship between Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism. I enjoyed discussions in class and the two professors were very nice and gave me very useful advice. I learned that Chinese Buddhism had deeply infiltrated into Chinese culture in that Buddhism borrowed a lot of terms from Daoism and Confucianism. I think I understand Buddhism and Daoism a little better."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "For a first-time course, I think it went well. The readings were consistently engaging, the connection between readings was well marked, and Drs. Greene and Bender offered a great deal in their discussion of the material. Toward the end of the term, they offered translations alongside the Chinese texts. This was a double-edged sword, in some respects, as it allowed for easier discussion of the ideas in the texts (as opposed to simply discussions about how to parse specific sentences), though it also seems to have led to less reading of the actual Chinese originals.",
    "Weaknesses: Easier texts with translations at the beginning of the course and then proceed to harder ones without translation. Class size is a bit too big for my learning preference. Strengths: the students are very involved and contributed to very high-level class discussions. Instructors are very knowledgeable on the subjects covered in class. Could use a better classroom; it was stuffy in there.",
    "This was a great course!",
    "Really great course!!",
    "The style and structure of the course were excellent. The feeling that the students were exploring the material together with the professors contributed to making the course highly engaging. In terms of the selected readings, most were highly appropriate, but a few of the readings felt harder to appreciate without a certain pre-existing foundation in either the Yi Jing or typical Buddhist sutras.",
    "It would have been nice to have a gloss of some key (non-Sanskrit) religious terms, but I suppose it's hard to know in advance what people are going to have trouble with.",
    "the class readings are very interesting, but I feel that the difficulty level does not match with my ability. This course might be more helpful for those who have some knowledge of classical Chinese or Buddhist texts beforehand.",
    "strengths: two professors specialized in Confucian or Buddhist studies respectively. weakness: the class is too big and sometimes you cannot engage in advanced-level topics.",
    "This course selected very good and challenging texts that inspired me and broadened my understanding of Chinese culture. I think the discussions were very useful and helpful for me and spurred me to think Buddhism and Daoism in a new way, especially the group study and talking between students after class. I hope the discussions could be designed in a clearer structure. I hope we could have more cross-disciplinary courses like this. It is really helpful for me."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Anyone interested in the intellectual milieu of China in this (admittedly large) period would benefit from this seminar.",
    "Yes, but I would warn others of the heavy reading in classical Chinese. This is no joke. High school level classical Chinese may not be sufficient.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who works on premodern China, especially medieval China. It is because the material we covered would be very helpful to understand China's thoughts at that time.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would highly recommend the course to anyone studying any of the Three Teachings. Seeing the way they evolved during that formative period will prove extremely useful to an overall understanding of the traditions.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It was absolutely fascinating and very well taught.",
    "Depends on the student's knowledge of classical Chinese.",
    "Yes. If you want to know the interplay between the three teachings in China.",
    "Yes, if this student understands classical Chinese language and a little knowledge about Chinese Buddhism, I will explain it to her. I think it is good practice to learn Buddhism and Chinese culture, especially the discussions are very useful and helpful."
