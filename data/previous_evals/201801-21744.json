    "Strength would certainly be accessibility and reasonableness. The readings are manageable and the course expectations clear. A weakness would be a lack of direction to the seminar discussions at the beginning of the semester. I think towards the middle of the term, discussions became more intentional and full, but it took a while for the class to take off as such."

However, if you are someone who gets frustrated with lack of firm direction and lesson plan, this may not be the class for you."
