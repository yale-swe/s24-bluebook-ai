    "I learned the motivation for and requirements of database management systems. I learned about typical mainstream solutions and then about more interesting solutions that solve problems in a much different way. I learned how to analyze a distributed database system, and I built a cool extension to the professors novel and near-perfect system.",
    "This course is phenomenal. I learned how to read research papers in the domain of distributed systems and database architectures. We learned about different paradigms in the design of distributed systems. There was an implementation component (several psets early in the semester), a lecture component (Learning the basics of the field for the first half of the course), a discussion component (Reading papers on current database architectures), a research component (final project). The pieces all fit very well together.",
    "I could develop knowledge, skills, insights on various types of database architectures by taking this course.",
    "I developed a thorough understanding about the concurrency control, consistency, and basic architecture of database."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: lectures are well planned and attention-holding. Problem sets are interesting, challenging, but not arduous. The long lecture format wasnt the best; by the end I either felt bored or burnt out from paying attention for so long.",
    "Honestly, there were no weaknesses that I can think of. The course does an amazing job of engaging students and covering such a vast amount of content.",
    "This is an incredibly good course. Unfortunately, Dan is leaving, but whoever teaches this next should shamelessly copy *everything* he did.",
    "The course was highly interactive in that the class involved lots of Q&A and discussions.",
    "The strengths are that all the knowledge taught in the course could be utilized and verified by the assignments and experiments. The weaknesses is that the assignments could cover more things. For example, the number of assignments could increase one or two to cover something about query optimization or buffer management."

    "Abadi is the heart and soul of this course. A guest lecturer described him as the Beyonce of database warehouses. The course wont be the same without him. You learn so much about databases and its highly motivated and applied to the real world, yet still involves cutting edge stuff you wouldnt learn about if you just studied SQL and the commercial options. Learn about database fundamentals like concurrency control and buffer pool management and ARIES logging, then learn about amazing modern solutions like Calvin, Dynamo, and Spark. And for a final project you basically code something completely new and write a publishable paper.",
    "This course was phenomenal. It honestly such a shame that Abadi is leaving. The first half of the semester, the professor lectured on various topics related to the basics of Database architectures (Concurrency Control, Recovery, etc). There were 2 psets that required us to implement different architectures. Then there was a midterm exam on this content. The second half of the semester involved reading recent database architecture papers (examples include Google Bitable, Amazon Dynamo, C-Store and Calvin). Each week we had to read two papers and then write a critical response where we described what the weaknesses of each system were. These were challenging as you really had to think outside the box and perform a deep reading of some very technical papers. But what an experience. The second half of the semester also involved student groups presenting one paper each and a group research project. I cannot recommend this course enough. I learned so much from Abadi.",
    "Yes",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any sufficiently advanced C.S. student, but this is immaterial since Dan is leaving.",
    "Sucks Abadi is leaving, he was great. This was arguably the most useful CS elective I've taken at Yale.",
    "For those who want to study database architectures in depth, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Definitely.",
    "This course is one of the best I have taken at Yale. Starting from the basic parts of traditional database systems, the first half of this course establishes a foundation for the design of these (primarily) single machine, disk backed, enterprise systems, while the second half surveys a number of modern systems from both industry and research. Nearly all of the material comes from reading seminal database papers, and class ends up being a mix of lecture and some seminar style discussion. During class, Prof. Abadi constantly probes to ensure that students not only understand how a system works, but also to understand what motivated its design. Challenging the conclusions of the professor, the research papers, or other students is encouraged as long as arguments are well reasoned. The two assignments were challenging but not overwhelming as long as you work with a partner (or start early), so the bulk of the work ends up being the readings and the final project. The final project is a chance to pick a small but often quite legitimate research topic, and can vary a lot based on what you chose. The biggest issue with this class in its current form is the time; because Prof. Abadi wasn't on campus every day, the class met in a single ~3 hour block, which could be pretty exhausting. I'm pretty sure this class isn't being run again (at least at Yale), but I wish more systems CS classes would adopt the sudo-seminar style of research papers backed with highly interactive lectures."
