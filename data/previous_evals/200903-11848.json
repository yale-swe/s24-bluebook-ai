    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "This is an intro video course that focuses on the aesthetics of video, or the \"art video.\" If you are looking for a narrative based course, this is not for you. Although the assimgnments are open-ended, all of the pieces are meant to be made for installations in museums, and you will not be graded well if you make narrative and\/or YouTube-esque shorts. I was not really into that, but I still enjoyed the course because I have an interest in film and I learned a great deal about editing with Final Cut Pro and built a solid foundation with which to pursue film independantly at Yale in the future.Oh and you get to GREEN SCREEN! That was sweet.",
    "Overall a great class. The workload is not bad, and you have a lot of room to be very self-indulgent.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in a chance to do some self-driven, independent work in video. The class is limited only by your desire,time, and energies -- set up to move you through your own projects with as much help, support, guidance as you want, or none at all -- exactly the kind of class I was looking for. Relaxed atmosphere. Take it, and work hard for yourself, and you'll be gratified. Predominantly non-narrative projects.",
    "Yes. Very fun and chilled class. It takes a little while to get over the \"WTF am I watching\" stage and start to appreciate the videos that we watch so do not be put off by the first few screenings. And once you get it, i mean its not hard, and start to think about how and why did the artist come up with this, then it becomes really interesting and fun. There is a lot of freedom in the assignments, so if you're not good at thinking up ideas without guidance then maybe not the class for you. But you'll think of something. Traci is very relaxed and i really enjoyed seeing her work. Video art is a really new field so it's great to be exposed to."
