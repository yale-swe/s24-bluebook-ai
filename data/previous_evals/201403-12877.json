    "A must take! This was a phenomenal course. The syllabus was wonderfully organized and carefully assembled. Both professors led fascinating discussions and by the end I felt like I had a thorough understanding of the complexity of representing the holocaust. Classes were a joy, or as much of a joy as they could be given the emotionally challenging material. Take this class!!!",
    "Incredible course. Every student should be encouraged to take it. The topic is so important that it deserves respect and reverence. We became part of a community in delving into this topic together. Being a part of the chain of witness and bearing witness to the horrors of the Holocaust are so important. I feel that this course was crucial to my development as a human being.",
    "As good a course as it gets. Difficult, demanding material, but well worth delving into.",
    "This class is much more about representation of the Holocaust than the actual events of the Holocaust and its history, which, despite the name of the class, I initially was surprised by but really enjoyed. The issue of representation is one that's important for all historical events but especially the Holocaust, and I'm happy that I was able to gain exposure to this topic through such a wonderful class. It really reinforced my love of both literature and history, as the ideas presented in the class tend to be a very interesting analysis of film and literature in a strongly historical context. I would definitely recommend this class. I felt that I learned a lot while also expanding my ways of thinking in really great ways.",
    "This is really a fantastic course. If you have the opportunity to take it, you really should do it! I think that the main strength of the class is in its syllabus, which includes the most famous works of Holocaust Representation (such as Night, Shoah, and Maus) as well as lesser known works which deserve attention nonetheless. The syllabus is also valuable because it includes works of representation that are simply bad-- I feel like I have learned a lot about what good representation IS, by looking at works that typify what it ISN'T. Class discussion was always very interesting, and Professor Samuels and Professor Marcus are both extremely insightful. All in all, a great class!",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student. The course provides valuable insights towards the forms of representation given to the Holocaust experience and the importance of bearing witness.",
    "I loved this course, an insight into how the Holocaust is represented in several media forms including text and film and also how the Holocaust is perceived by the public. The more you participate in this class, the more you get out of it; this class causes you to reflect on your own opinions of representation of such a sensitive topic and how you can effectively bear witness to the Holocaust to keep the memories of survivors alive."
