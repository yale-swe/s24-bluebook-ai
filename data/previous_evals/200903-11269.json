    "It's required for the major. It would be kind of a useless class for someone outside of African Studies.",
    "It's an overview course, and you won't get much out of it unless you expect something from it. It's a seminar that meets once a week - discussions depend on the students but most times its very awkward. You can get by without ever reading or buying a book and the papers are short and open-ended (4-6pgs). It's a good 5th class.",
    "It's a good class if you want to read some books about African Studies anthropological research. But if you're not in the major, I would not recommend it.",
    "This is an okay class. The reading is interesting, but my favorite part was being in a room with so many people who had interesting experiences doing research in Africa and just talking about those experiences. That said, don't be intimidated if you haven't spent the last year doing research on AIDS in South Africa, because there are plenty of undergrads who hadn't had those experiences either. In general be prepared for some awkward silences, but overall I am glad I took the course. Also the assignments are actually pretty enjoyable and manageable.",
    "I personally took the class for 2 reasons:1) Major requirement2) Learn research methodology.The research methodology that was learned could have been done in two weeks as opposed to an entire semester. Most of the class discussions became repetitive...although there may be one or 0.5 things that someone may learn during a class.Take it....but also don't kill yourself over getting every page read. It is pretty hard to get all the reading done and papers....maybe talk to prof. about decreasing the amt. of reading. Some of the best discussions came from the shortest books\/articles.",
    "I would not recommend it as I did not feel like I learned much from the class.",
    "read a series of books and discuss their research methods."
