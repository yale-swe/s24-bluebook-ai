   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class. It is not just for art students - I had never taken an art class before at Yale, and I loved it. It is probably the most time consuming class I've taken at Yale (including Quantum Mechanics, for you skeptical science majors), so do not take it as your extra class on the side. It will dominant your semester.Take the class with Alexandra Rudensky if you want to move quickly through the technical stuff. She also gives really insightful feedback that helps you develop your personal photographicstyle. Be prepared for criticism.The best part about this class is that your brain works in a very different way than it usually does (if you are not an art major). It's a nice balance to what you are more used to.If you are someone who has stayed away from the arts because you don't think of yourself as artistic, you might end up loving this class. I see myself as heavily left brained, but even I could be an artist, as it turned out.If you take this class, you will look at the world in a new way. You will see pictures (both already taken and waiting out there in the world) differently.It's also the best way to start photography (as opposed to digital). You really understand the process well when you have to do it manually.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It is a very good introduction to the art of black and white photography in the darkroom. Sasha's class is a lot of work. You have to maintain a good schedule in order to get all the shooting done. I never found it to be too much of a burden. You will spend hours in the darkroom, especially before the critiques. I've matured enormously in my aesthetic and ability to evaluate photographs on their artisticmerit. Highly recommended!",
    "This is a great class. Definitely take it. Working in the darkroom takes hours and hours, but it is so worth it. So cool to develop your own film and print your own photos - you will feel a sense of ownership over your work and really appreciate photography. I learned a lot about photo, but also about art in general. Take Sasha's section - she is amazing. Encouraging yet strict. You will learn a ton and feel totally rewarded by the end of the semester."
