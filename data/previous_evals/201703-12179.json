    "Having taken languages in the past, Professor Von Kunes found a way to make learning the Czech language fun, but I feel I learned more in this semester than I did learning another language for four years. I feel prepared for the next level and better prepared to take other languages in the future.",
    "I got a chance to leave a language that is hard, yet very interesting",
    "I learned the basics of reading, writing, and speaking Czech.",
    "Studoval jsem mluvit cesky. Czech I introduces students to the fundamental grammar of the language, and establishes the foundations for reading, writing, and speaking a very complex language.",
    "I loved this class for the reason that I was allowed to very efficiently begin to learn a new language of Czech. I learned the basics of the language very well and I am excited to build on those next semester.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the Czech language during this course. Having had no background in the language at all, I found it hard to understand at first but due to Professor Von Kunes' I was able to quickly learn what I needed to.",
    "Learned how to read and write Czech",
    "Czech is a very difficult language to learn. I struggled this summer in Prague, but with the help of Professor von Kunes, my Czech skills improved tremendously this semester.",
    "Learned the basics of the Czech language.",
    "I really learned about the czech language and culture as well as the skills necessary to learn a new language."

    "The main strength of this class was Professor's engagement with her students. We all have good relationships and have a great time in class.",
    "It was taught very well and has expanded the languages I can speak.",
    "The class was awesome because we worked at a pace that allowed me to learn a lot while still getting a full understanding of the language grammar.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is the professor and the small class size",
    "Czech is a very challenging language to learn and requires lots of patience and practice. I would have liked for the grammar lessons to have been organized a little differently, but overall the course was great.",
    "This class is amazing to attend and be apart of as a whole.",
    "The strengths of the course were the engaging discussion and enjoyable back and forth between students and Professor Von Kunes."
