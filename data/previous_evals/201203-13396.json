    "I would highly recommend this class for the improvement of creative writing. You learn new techniques, sharpen your ability to use ones you already had, and learn to apply your skills in a more focused way. Your editing and revision improves significantly.",
    "Definitely take this class. The reading is very enjoyable, as are the class discussions and even the paper topics. I loved writing the papers for this class, and feel my writing has improved. Definitely take this with Merve Emre. She is a wonderful professor-- the analysis of readings are very insightful, and comments on papers are very thorough and helpful. The seminars are fun, and I looked forward to them each week.",
    "A fantastic fantastic class with a more than manageable workload. The essays that you have to read for class are short and enjoyable. In my section, we only had to read about 3 pieces for each class, each about 5 pages long. Homework is like sitting down and reading the New Yorker for a bit. In terms of drafts, you have plenty of time to write them. You have a week for the rough draft and then a week to revise it. Plus, you have a week at the beginning of each unit that you use to just get acquainted with that particular style of writing (i.e. Cultural Criticism, Profile of a Person, Humor, Place, Personal, etc...) In other words, each unit goes like this: First week\u00e2\u0080\u0094you just read essays. Second week\u00e2\u0080\u0094you write a draft. Third week\u00e2\u0080\u0094you revise it based on the prof's comments. Obviously each section will work differently, but that's how mine worked.",
    "I believe that overall this class gets the job done for your writing requirement.",
    "If you have any interest in improving your essay-writing abilities, take this course. The readings are thought-provoking, the assignments are very doable, and you'll leave the course knowing more about writing (and great essay-writers) than you knew going in.",
    "If you want to be a better writer, take it. But it takes a lot of time out of your schedule, especially if you're a slow reader\/writer like me. But definitely worth it.",
    "You will learn so much, no matter howgood you think you are now! The discussions are great, and the focus on reading for craft is so refreshing. Take this class, seriously!",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a great course for creative non-fiction reading and writing.",
    "ENGL 120 is a fun class. After spending so much time in high school reading prose to write analytical essays, it is a breath of fresh air to analyze prose and write creative pieces. That is to say that although the assignments are considered \"nonfiction,\" the professors are (at least in my experience) open to creative interpretation.There's a reasonable amount of work, and if you like writing, it's enjoyable. I would definitely recommend shopping several sections so as to finding both a professor and classmates you like. I think a lot of what people get out of this class depends on who they take it with and what the class dynamic is like.",
    "English 120 is a class focused on \"close reading for craft.\" For each class, the student is assigned 2-4 essays to read for style and rhetorical tools, and class time is spent discussing each piece - focusing specifically on one element (i.e. leads, free indirect discourse, lists, etc). The essays are divided into themes like personal, place, person (interview), humor, etc.and at the end of each unit the student is expected to write his or her own essay on the theme, submitting a rough draft for feedback and a final draft for grading. Each student chooses one essay to workshop with the entire class. I highly recommend this class to any student with a serious interest in writing.",
    "English 120 is a class where you get to challenge yourself in many areas of creative non-fiction writing. It was a great class for anyone who loves writing, especially for those who enjoy pushing themselves outside the box of academic essay writing.",
    "English 120 is a great class. You get to read essays by many different awesome writers and then spend class time analyzing how they crafted their essays so that you can use their techniques to write your own essays. The class is fast-paced which allows you to delve into multiple essay genres (?) - in my class we did personal essays, essays about places, essays profiling a person, cultural criticisms, and satires. At least for me, I had never extensively read essays, so this was a wonderful opportunity for me to learn how to critically discuss and write my own essays. It is also a very collaborative class and it was a ton of fun reading my classmates' essays and getting to know them better. 120 will expose you to authors and a writing style that regardless of your academic background you will have fun with and the skills you learn will help you become a better communicator.",
    "English 120 is a class where you will read well-written creative non-fiction for craft, and use what you learn to improve your writing in a number of fun and interesting topics. It is a very good introductory English class, no matter what your major. If you get the chance, take Merve Emre's section!"
