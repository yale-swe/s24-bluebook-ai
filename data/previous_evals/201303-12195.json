   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course--it not only offers a historiographical overview of the field of history of sexuality, but it is also hugely successful in training us as scholars.",
    "This class was interesting. I am not a historian so I found some of the questions to be enlightening and provocative. I was overwhelmed by the way that historians amass evidence, collecting tons of information in order to make comparisons across a terrain or along some vertical axis, strata of historical information. If you want to learn a history, then that may not be for you. If you want to learn the state of the field and some of the key questions of the discipline, then it is the appropriate class.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student if they were interested in approaching gender and sexuality studies in a purely historical context or if they were interested in expanding their experience in the field of history.I would not recommend it to a student that was interested in a more interdisciplinary approach to theories of gender and sexuality or a course focusing strongly on intersections of sexuality and race. For many of the readings, our main critique was about how the author could have incorporated race into their analysis more and the repetition of this critique became a somewhat sad reminder of the hegemony of whiteness in chronicling American history as well as a lesson in the limitations of a purely historical method."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course taught me a lot about historical method and history as a discipline. From this class, I think I have been able to more deeply appreciate and understand how history as a field of study could be used in an interdisciplinary way.I would say that it did not directly or consciously contribute to my \"dissertation\/research\" except for the very important effect of expanding my horizons in thinking about what kind of topics I might want to explore and how I might utilize the archive in future work."
