    "A great class. It's a good chance to read some of the Religious Studies classics and bond with the other religious studies majors. It seems like what really makes the class is the input of all of the members. From the beginning we set a great tone, so the rest of the semester was awesome.",
    "This is a great class!! Religious Studies majors should get excited about this course and other interested students should definitely take it as well (it might convince you to double major!).",
    "Well, if you're a religious studies major you have to take it, so it doesn't really matter what I say. But it was a really good class. Professor Waggoner had a great way of teaching where we didn't just learn the classic texts, but we really got into what religious studies is and can be and he repeatedly emphasized how religious studies can really be anything we want it to be, and we looked at things from such a wide variety of angles. Also, there were very few people in the class, so it was a really nice community and a very comfortable environment. Someone even brought snacks every week!"
