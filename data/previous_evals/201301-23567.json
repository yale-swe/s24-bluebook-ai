    "Amazing opportunity, learned an incredible amount -- thank you!",
    "The readings weren't particularly helpful or dealt with or discussed. It may be more helpful to have shorter readings that are directly applicable.",
    "Jodi also should be giving credit. She was super responsive and helpful too. Dr. Leaderer was great and quick to respond.I love the air quality monitor experiment. That was interesting - and the write up was appropriate to the work (i.e., not something overly complex).I like the outside assignments (take home midterm and paper). They are helpful to really learn the material - not just the memorize and purge method of test taking. At least for me it helps me retain the knowledge better.",
    "Thought course would have been better if there were more clinical project meetings with profs and fewer\"introduction to environmental law and environmental studies\" courses. The info in those classes was well presented but basic.",
    "I thought the course was very helpful in learning about the legal aspects of environmental policy and legislation. The ability to work with a client on a project was definitely the most rewarding part of the experience. Although our project had a slow start, in the end I believe we all learned a lot about the issue and were able to create final products that can help our client.The moot court and climate change negotiations were the two most fun experiences in the class, and also the most educational.",
    "This course is one of the best at F&ES because it gives the opportunity to work with a client, os at the same time you do research you lean how to work with different stakeholders and earn experience."

    "Working with the client and learning how to run a project.",
    "Having real-world experiences in a new area of interest to build up my expertise and communicate actual problem-solving skills to potential employers.",
    "The fact that each team was assigned a client and a specific project. I really enjoyed the interaction with our client, Islands First, and the possibility to participate in the UNFCCC intercessional meeting.",

    "Working with clinic supervisors and the moot court.",

   "comments": [
    "Mid-semester reports from classmates would be interesting",
    "The projects are interesting but possibly too intensive. The point of this class I thought was to bridge law and environmental management\/science, but it seemed like there was little science and not all teams had both a law student and an forestry student. It seems like the course would benefit from someone who is not a lawyer to assist in bridging the gap between the two worlds (schools).",
    "can't think of any",
    "While I really enjoyed the project work for the client, I think the classes could do with some improvement. I was excited about taking the classes at the beginning of the semester because they all covered interesting and important topics. But there needed to be more of a seminar-style discussion, particularly after we had done the reading - we didn't need a rehash of what the reading said in the form of a 2-hour lecture. Some of the topics e.g. cost-benefit analysis are controversial so it would have been interesting and fun to discuss them, but instead the classes were more like lectures.",
    "The classroom part of the course had nothing to do with our projects. They were interesting, but it was frustrating that all the extra work did not count towards my project time.",
    "Work with clients to make sure the preparatory legwork is as complete as possible before the semester begins.",
    "More connection between classes and projects assigned.",
    "While I enjoyed the mock trial and climate negotiation simulation, the other in class components of this course did not present much new material to me. I would have appreciated more law\/legal material rather than environmental material.",
    "Make lectures on environmental economics, environmental law, and energy more advanced and less introductory. Too basic for most, since the course was mostly FES, anyway.",
    "I think some of the course material could be improved to be more engaging and accessible to FES students without legal background. Some of the information was very basic, almost too basic, while other information was more challenging to grasp.I think a second moot court could have been a fun way for us to improve upon the feedback we received after the first moot court.",
    "This class is well-designed, well-ran and efficiently administered. No suggested improvements. That said, you will have a hard time finding a TA as excellent as Hayley!",
    "Being able to couple readings with research being done by students."

    "It helped to share the responsibility, and to bounce ideas off each other. I think it formed a better product. At the same time, having other people involved means that coordination takes a larger part of your time, and you always have to consider the possibility that they won't come through.",

    "It was difficult to coordinate schedules for internal deadlines sometimes.",
    "We were one of the larger groups which meant that we could dig much deeper into our project's issues than some other groups.The disadvantage was a slight tendency to become siloed within our group.",
    "The group work was a great way to learn about the perspectives of students from other disciplines. However, I think it was challenging at first for us to grasp our specific roles in the project and find a way to make each person's efforts cohesive and build on the efforts of the others.",
    "Students assigned to projects based on interest and background -made groups dynamic and effective.",
    "I had a particularly excellent and positive group experience. Everyone was very collaborative, hard working, thorough, and great with communication. The only challenge was coordinating busy schedules for meetings.",

    "N\/A",
    "Advantages: covering more material than I would have been able to on my own.Disadvantages: working with a friend and changing a proven formula (team membership) ended up backfiring. Our team would have benefitted from losing our previous 3rd member and leaving the team as a two-person team instead of adding a third member that did not end up meeting the expectations that the previous iterationof the group had set.",
