   "comments": [
    "No. Very boring and tedious",
    "Yes, everyone should have a background to some ancient history. you will not be a knowledgeable person unless you're familiar with the Romans.",
    "Great class, learned a lot, but it is a large workload for a good grade. In terms of an easy writing credit though, we only do two papers, so definitely yes. Prof. Schultz is wonderful too.",
    "If you have any interest in all in Roman History, I would take this class. It's a good writing credit, you'll learn a lot, and it's interesting. What I would warn against, however, is taking this class just for the writing credit. You may not do much writing, but if you aren't genuinely interested in the material, you're going to find this class very very annoying.",
    "Take it if you're currently afraid you'll flunk out.",
    "The course is a very good survey of Roman history from the founding to the end of the republic. If you are at all interested in Roman history this class is a must take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The lectures were fun and engaging, the readings relatively entertaining, and the final paper offered complete freedom to explore any facet of the Republic, which was fun. I thought that Schultz's lively lecture style really made the course for me, so it is a pity that she won't be at Yale to teach it in the future. Still, the subject matter alone is a good reason to take this class.",
    "Good class, very detailed, although it requires a lot of memorization.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for those interested in the subject. Selected readings and course books are good.",
    "As a fershman, I thought this class was slightly difficult. There were almost no assignments and lots of reading, so there was little motivation to stay on top of the material. That is primarily what made this class difficult. Additionally, the few assignments you actually have weigh heavily on your grade.",
    "If you enjoy Roman History or the classes, take the class- it is very good, and I learned a lot this semester. If you are just looking for a credit toward a History major, maybe consider a different class.",
    "pretty annoying class. a lot of time and effort is required to do well",
    "Yes",
    "Take it if you are going to major in history or classics, or if you are really into those Romans. The class is also wonderful for fulfilling WR credit. Actually, I believe everyone should take this class and know something about the base of western civilization. But if you're a science major and looking for Hu credit and are not very interested in the subject, take a easier course. The amount of readings is okay, average 100 per week.",
    "One of those gems. Definitely take it with Professor Schultz if you can.",
    "Standard intro to Roman Republican history. Good body of knowledge to control, so I recommend the course even if you don't have a particular interest in the history of the period.",
    "I would recommend it. Lots of interesting information, and I feel like I learned quite a bit. However, I thought it would have been nice to have some sort of concrete, organized visual to help me put everything into place during the lectures (maybe that's my own fault for not writing outlines clearly in my notes). Essentially, the lectures and readings went through a ton ofinformation, and I was never sure what was really essential to write down. However, the professor doesn't test on obscure subjects; she gives a list of possible essay questions for the exam. She's funny and really nice. I enjoyed the class. It would have been nice to have shorter reading assignments so that I might have actually had the incentive to finish them.",
    "If you like ancient history it's probably great. If, like me, you're more into modern history, it might seem dry."
