   "comments": [
    "It's a class in which you'll cover quite a bit, including some pretty challenging topics in calculus. I would recommend it to a student who's planning on using math in their major. It's a solid introduction to higher levels of math that's not too scary.",
    "Pretty much what you would expect it to be; reasonable workload, not to much material to cover, yet still applicable and useful.",
    "I would summarize MATH 120 as a great course if you are interested in mathematics. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would not recommend Math 120 to another student unless they really actively enjoy calculus. I would warn them that there's an extreme difference between high school calculus and Math 120: this is the point where *wanting* to learn math becomes just as important as being good at math, if not more so.",
    "Your Math 120 experience depends a lot on the instructor. Yu-Wen Hsu and Marketa Havlickova are the best. That said, you have a lot of out-of-class resources. You can go to any teacher's office hours, and the peer tutors are super helpful. I would recommend Math 120 to someone who likes math and has enjoyed single-variable calculus and is thinking of pursuing a field where multi-variable calculus is helpful\/required. The class also uses a pretty good textbook (Stewart)--I thought the textbook was clear and helpful when I was struggling with something after class.",
    "I would not recommend Math 120 to another student. In it's current state, there are so few actually helpful professors that the chances of you having to teach yourself the entire course are very high. If you are a prospective engineering major, take ENAS 151. But if you have to take the course, expect to work hard but you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "It is not as simple as people might make it sound. The material might be easy with sufficient practise, but the time constraint certainly makes everything a tad more difficult than it would be otherwise. Zhiren Wang was a good professor for this class.",
    "It's a continuation of high school math. Take it if you need it as a prerequisite for more interesting classes.",
    "I would recommend MATH120 to another student in a heartbeat, but I am a sucker for math in general and really enjoyed the math we were learning. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend it to a student casually looking to fulfill a QR requirement because I think the class would have been much more strenuous and unenjoyable if I had not been invested in the material.",
    "I would recommend it if you need it for your major. It's important information that can help you see the world differently and through mathematics, which is really cool, But I probably wouldn't have taken this course just for fun."
