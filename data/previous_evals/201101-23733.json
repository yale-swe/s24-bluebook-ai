    "Chances are, if you are reading this you have to take Spanish 140 for your language requirement. So take it! But make sure you select a professor who connects well with you; it makes all the difference.",
    "Spanish 140 is very similar to Spanish 130 but with more work and larger projects. The workload in this class is at times unfair and often unhelpful, despite being useful material being covered. I would not recommend this course to students who have already filled their language requirements.",
    "Yes, good class to take if you need it for your language requirement",
    "You do a lot of grammar.",
    "boring. sebastian is the best.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 140 for the student that wants to take Spanish to achieve fluency. The course material can be difficult at points, but it is definitely worth the effort if a student has a genuine interest in learning the Spanish language.",
    "If you've enjoyed the other levels of Spanish, yes, definitely take this course, but if you haven't, you'll just find this tedious, as it is more work than previous levels."
