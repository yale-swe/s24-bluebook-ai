    "As a non-art major, I was so happy to finally take an art class. I highly recommend taking one. In 346, we work with wood. It's a big time commitment (two two-hour meetings a week, plus time outside class to work on your projects), but it's one that is a fresh alternative to papers and exams. This class is what you make of it, though -- there is little curricular focus, and guidance is at times lacking.",
    "Poorly structured, not enough demos.",
    "The course is enjoyable and lightweight, but requires self-motivation to be successful and to take full advantage of the opportunity. There are a few smaller projects and two larger, a midterm and a final, and class time is divided into workdays, critique days, and craft lessons. NOTE: this is an art class, not a woodshop class. While you can certainly incorporate traditional forms and structures into your wood designs, making furniture, or really any practical device is not allowed",
    "Yes!"
