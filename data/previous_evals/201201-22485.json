    "Great class, not a lot of work, easy exams.",
    "This is a wonderful course! Prof. Van Vleck's lecturing style may take some getting used to, but you will come to appreciate how thorough and organized she is. The material and readings are absolutely fascinating, though many of the readings are sort of unnecessary because Prof. Van Vleck will go over them in class. All in all, an excellent class. Highly recommended!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course both to Americans like me who haven't really considered domestic occurrences in a global context, and to foreigners who want to learn more about this country. The topics are really interesting, and they cover a lot.",
    "Fantastically interesting class on American history through the lens of foreign policy. Sometimes gets a bit heavy on culture and how non-government entities shaped US power\/ policy which can be fuzzy, but definitely interesting. I would totally recommend this course for anybody interested in US history and foreign policy. This class also made me feel super patriotic, which is a plus in my book.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you want a good survey course of the US history. It is made much more interesting through a world perspective.",
    "Only with a good TA. Really.",
    "Good introductory history class. Interesting readings, and well-taught lectures.",
    "If you have any interest in American history whatsoever, you HAVE to take this course. Even if you already know your American history, this course provides a wealth of alternative views from delightfully unconventional angles, and is sure to enrich your understanding of this nation's past to a remarkable degree.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, though I would warn him\/her of the workload.",
    "Definitely. It deepened my knowledge of America, gave a good intro to how history works as a discipline\u0085 good stuff.",
    "Good history course you get what you put in",
    "This course centers on the argument of whether or not we can call the United States an empire, and, if we can, if it is\/was any different from the old empires of Europe. This course presents common lessons of American history, lessons that I had taken for granted, in a completely different light. I would recommend this course to any student who would like to test their assumptions about the inner workings of American history.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in American history. The emphasis on soft power of American culture and commercialism helped give me a better perspective on how America functions today."
