   "comments": [
    "A lot of work, dry lectures, and a final project that is due on the same day as the final and does not make much sense. Professor Purusothaman is friendly and willing to assist. Also, I can't say that I found the material particularly interesting either. DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU ARE NOT ABET.",
    "I actually enjoyed this class beacuse I am interested in the topic. I could see why someone could totally hate it though...",
    "This class made me rethink how possible it was to change my major as a 2nd semester junior. Heat transfer, as a concept, can be really interesting, just not at 9:00 AM, and MOST IMPORTANTLY: NOT with Kailas. If Kailas is teaching this class, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. I would not take another class with him for all money in the world.",
    "A lot of work, but if you're willing to do it, you will be rewarded.",
    "This class is not worth your time if it's not required for your major (hey ABET MechEs). Period. If you want to learn about it, just read the book - I learned way more by doing so than attending class. If you're required to take the class, the problem is just that Professor Purushothaman is a poor teacher. Do enough work to do pass the assignments and tests - any extra time is better spent on classes you actually enjoy.",
    "If for no other reason, I enjoyed this class because I finally learned some basic fluid mechanics. The basic topics covered in the course are extremely useful, though perhaps some of the depth is not. The lectures follow the book pretty closely, and the problem sets are not too bad. Dr. P. expects you to demonstrate a fair amount of effort (required section, 20% of grade goes to participation), but on the bright side it's almost impossible not to learn the material (unless you are flunking the participation part too). Also, Dr. P. is a really amiable Prof. who always makeshimself available. It's a good course. Don't dread it if you have to take it. If you don't have to take it, consider taking it anyway.",
    "No. While this course is a must and very useful for a MechE, it is pretty painful to slug through",
    "It's a lot of work. Period. If you're reading this review you either a) have to take the class; b) have the option of taking the class for the BS; or c) have a vague interest in the subject matter. If (b) is your category of choice, look for another course instead--isn't worth the work you'll end up putting in for the credit. If (c), then you'll have better luck taking this type of course in grad school--the course ends up being more of an introductory skimming of all of heat transfer topics, so you don't really get a whole lot of depth and understanding in any particular area. For those of you in the ABET, well, my best advice is to stick together. And for all: don't be afraid to ask for extensions if you need them.",
    "Difficult material, but intellectually rewarding. This is the course that makes or breaks you."
