   "comments": [
    "Learning about theory and applications of imperfect markets (monopolies, oligopolies, etc.) Interesting real-life case studies and simple math (easier than intermediate micro). The psets weren't super hard.",
    "Definitely take this class! Such a good experience. The professor is excellent and the material is interesting and relevant. Good mix of theoretical\/ mathematical models and illustrative case studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend Firms, Markets, and Competition. The course is more interesting than intermediate micro, and builds off of a lot of the same concepts. You will learn a lot of theory, but it is theory that is also practical. Industrial organization is a great topic to understand if you are considering a career in business or consulting.",
    "It's like advanced micro. Advanced concepts but she teaches them pretty well. Its a good class if you don't want to write papers for your senior econ class. Just psets and tests. Also pretty interesting.",
    "For a 400-level economics course, remarkably easy and still somewhat interesting. Chalioti is a sweetheart.",
    "If you are interested in how economic principles shape the workings of the business world, this class is for you. Prof. Chalioti is a clear and fun lecturer who covers a wide range of material in her class and presents it in interesting ways. I highly recommend this course.",
    "This class is a blast, my favorite class of the semester. You cannot go wrong with any class that Eva Chalioti teaches. She is one of the nicest people in the world, extremely kind and fair. As far as the class goes, the concepts are extremely extremely interesting, and I definitely walked away from the class with a better understanding of how firms make their decisions and the types of competition that exist in the market. This is the first ever \"excellent\" i've ever given a class at yale, so this should tell you something. Take this class. It's absolutely amazing. You will thank yourself greatly. I highly recommend it.",
    "I cannot recommend this class enough. One of the least stressful and most fulfilling econ classes at Yale, if not the best. You come away with a more solid understanding of intro\/intermediate economic concepts, and you see where it applies in a more realistic marketplace. The workload is 4 very simple problem sets through the semester (it took me about 2 hours per problem set), a case study (which, if you're thinking of being a consultant or considering any other business type future, you'll find very helpful and easy), and a final exam. Prof. Chalioti is a pedagogical oasis in the arid desert of good teaching in Yale Econ department.",
    "Excellent overview of the different market structures\/organizations and the advantages and disadvantages to each. Structured with a great mix of real life examples\/case studies and theoretical\/economic models and algebra. I would recommend this class to any student looking to get a better understanding of competitive markets and their structure.",
    "Yes the course is great. Not too much work and though it is classified as a senior lecture, the professor is always around to help and the class feels very personal.",
    "I really grew to enjoy the course. Professor Chalioti was really sweet and cared immensely for her students. This course seemed similar to intermediate micro at first, but it was definitely much better! I loved learning the the economics models in this class because Professor Chalioti made sure to connect the models to real world examples. I also enjoyed the group presentation. In all, the class was pretty chill, as long as you went to class and followed the lectures. The midterm and final were very fair. The psets were difficult sometimes, but they really helped solidify the material."
