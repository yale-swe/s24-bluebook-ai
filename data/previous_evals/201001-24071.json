    "Honestly, I was disappointed with this class. If you're interested in the material, definitely take it, and you'll like the professor, but don't go in expecting to be wowed. It's going to be rather slow and dry, at least at the beginning. It gets better, though, so stick it out and you'll learn a lot and like it.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Great professor, great, yet haunting, material.",
    "Good course.",
    "The class is a bit depressing, as it is on genocide, but it is super interesting. It's great to really delve into one issue so deeply. I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you are interested in African conflicts.",
    "David Simon is a terrible seminar leader. But he told us he won't be back at Yale next year, so I don't think he'll be teaching here again.",
    "I think the overall course was good. You can't really find a course that examines one historical event in detail, and this course did a very detailed survey of the Rwandan genocide. I think I would have gotten more out of the course if Professor Simon facilitated more class discussions. Although the readings tend to be very detail-oriented, some of them were very interesting and presented well-structured, refreshing arguments.",
    "It's a great class to learn about the Genocide. However, it wasn't a great class overall.",
    "You'll learn a lot, but it's not the most engaging of seminars.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Simon is really knowledgeable and set up the structure of the class perfectly.",
    "A good class if you're interested in the topic- what you put into it is what you get out of it. If you're not invested, it will not be fulfilling."
