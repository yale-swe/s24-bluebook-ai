   "comments": [
    "YES!! Take it, especially if you need a writing credit and are not a writer!",
    "Take it, get the writing credit, and move on with you life. Nothing life-changing here. 4 5 page papers, and an enjoyable section (take it with Megan Brakeley!). Don't have to do the readings for section -- maybe skim them. Papers aren't that related to lecture, but lecture does introduce some themes that may help. It seemed like the grading got harder as the semester went on, at least in my writing section.",
    "Yes, because the course is always interesting and the wide topics make it feel like a jumping-off point for further studies, like it offers and introduction to many different subcategories to pursue.",
    "workload: 4 papers - 5 pages each. no final. gutpapers have nothing to do with lectures so its not necessary to go but i would still suggest going because they're actually very interesting",
    "Recommend!!",
    "Definitely a must take if you are trying to pick up a quick WR credit. Low stress",
    "This class is what you make of it. The some of the material is extremely thought-provoking. It offers an interesting platform for thinking and discussing aspects of gender and how it's involved in daily life. Some of the lectures were more engaging and relevant than others. Overall, worth taking.",
    "If the initial classes seem interesting to you take it, otherwise it could be a long semester.",
    "Take it. Just do it, honestly. The papers are so much fun to write, and if you are sick of pure academic writing, this provides a nice break.",
    "Take this course. The readings are interesting and the discussion section hits on some really fascinating topics. Make sure you can write papers, though! Your grade is essentially just the four papers that you write over the course of the semester.",
    "Yes yes yes. Writing credit, no exams. Not being tested on the material actually makes in much more interesting, so you are more inclined to pay attention and genuinely learn some new interesting material.",
    "I would recommend this as a 5th class since it is easy to keep up with the material and it is overall enjoyable",
    "This is a good class to take if you want an easy, gut 5th class. Take it writing intensive and get a WR credit without stressing out!",
    "Women, Food, and Culture opened my eyes to the study of the intersection between women and food and how much you can learn from food about any group of people. It was totally out of my element, but I enjoyed that it was different from other classes that I have taken. The four papers allowed you so express creativity and a couple allowed for you to become personal with the topics. Overall, a good course.",
    "Great class! If you're looking for an easy-ish and fun writing credit, then it's the right class for you. Actually go to class because Maria Trumpler is a very engaging lecturer and you learn a lot. 4 5-page papers about interesting topics so pretty manageable.",
    "It depends on the person. It is an okay class and some of the topics are interesting, but I have taken classes that are a lot more interesting and relevant.",
    "Don't take it unless you are interested in the material!",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student because it is fun and interesting. Be prepared to do a lot of reading.",
    "I would suggest this class to anyone who is even slightly interested in the topics that the class is about. It's a fairly relaxed class, but if you do the readings and pay attention, you can get a lot out of it in a low-stress environment. I wish more classes at Yale were like this one.",
    "A very easy course both in terms of material and amount of work. The assignments (four relatively short papers) don't require going to the lecture or reading the assignments. I don't think I got very much out of the course, mostly because it asked very little of me. A very easy social science class and can be taken as a fifth (or even sixth) class.",
    "Good overview of food. Very basic compared to some other food courses at Yale, but the gender part of the course adds an interesting component. I honestly wish there were exams or quizzes of some sort - without any tests, this class is viewed as a gut, and it shouldn't. Food matters, and is a subject that should be taken seriously. I really do hope that there are tests incorporated into this class in the future, which would ensure people take it more seriously.",
    "Women, Food and Culture is an interesting class in which lectures don't necessarily correspond to the work for the class. The four papers are easy enough to write and involve minimal research. Be prepared to participate in section.",
    "This is a great 5th class and writing credit for science majors. The material is interesting and going to lecture is worth it, even just to listen. It is a very interesting and enjoyable stress-free class.",
    "YES. Great class, especially for freshmen.",
    "I was often frustrated by the cluelessness and occasional stupidity of my classmates. So, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re considering taking this class, make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the kind of person who would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6not friends with fat people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d during a conversation about women, disordered eating, and prejudice. Come on. That said, with four papers evenly spaced throughout the semester, this is a good course to round out a hard schedule and help keep it from being too weighted toward stress during midterms and finals. You can try your hand at many different styles of papers without any of them being weighted too heavily. But if you're going to take this course, BUY IN a little and try to expand your knowledge of food and women beyond your immediate family and culture. Also, fun fact, you can usually get this to count toward an American Studies major even though it's not cross listed. (The Yale Farm field trip is a delight. Go if you decide to take the class!)",
    "I would recommend this class. It was very informative and engaging. By the end of the course, one was easily able to answer questions involving and connecting the themes of women, food, and culture because of the great teaching and material.",
    "Women, Food, and Culture is indubitably a gut class. If you're looking for an easy writing credit to fulfill, or an easy class to balance against a harder workload, this is the class to take. Unfortunately, if you're actually interested in the topic, the general lack of enthusiasm in section and the lectures that never quite delve deep enough could frustrate you like it did for me...",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking for an interesting class about gender studies that mostly concerns writing papers and exploring various topics.",
    "It's a great 5th class. The grade is based entirely on the four papers and section attendance. If you take this class because you think it's all about food, get ready to learn about a little women's studies as well.",
    "I would say it was a class that is good for a fifth class it doesn't take a lot of work and it is some what interesting.",
    "Yes. It was not too much work and the lessons were very relevant and interesting to society and how food is apart of our world and has changed shape throughout the years.",
    "i would because its an important class to expand your horizons",
    "It is a lecture about the interdependence of women and food and how the two shape cultures over time. There are no finals or midterms, so the workload is light. I would recommend this as a great course to take for a writing requirement.",
    "I would recommend it if you're genuinely interested in women, food, and culture but not if you're truly trying to become a better writer (there are many introductory English courses for that).",
    "If you're interested in these topics and need a WR credit, you should take this class. However, if you're not even remotely interested in these topics and you have difficulty writing about things you don't care about, I wouldn't suggest this class.",
    "This is an excellent course! Accessible to a newcomer to WGSS and the study of food, it uses multiple disciplines to explore a wide variety of related issues. It's a very creative course that presents lots of interesting ideas. The assignments are really cool! It's a great fifth class.",
    "A great class if you have little experience with writing and you want to try out writing 4 different types of essays. Also great readings.",
    "This is a great writing credit for a STEM major. Not a lot of work but still felt like I took away valuable knowledge from the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The guest lectures were great, there's a cool fall break trip opportunity, and you'll learn a lot about our food system and culture in general.",
    "I would recommend this class. Not too much stress, and the essays were pretty enjoyable to write. The lectures are pretty interesting, and since there are no exams you can really just sit back and listen rather than trying to write down everything Trumpler says, which is really nice.",
    "I would recommend this class to students because there were a lot of valuable skills I took away from it. This class has helped my writing skills and also taught me that regardless of the topic, there is always some relevancy to life today. I struggled to find this relevancy earlier in the semester, but once Ifound it, it made this class a lot more meaningful.",
    "This is a great class that will expose you to a wide range of issues around women and food. However, the course has a lot to do with food apart from women, such as the history of food. The papers you write are fun. I would definitely recommend this class! Plus, Professor Trumpler makes each lecture fun and interesting.",
    "This is a good intro-level course--if you're interested in the material don't wait until you're an upperclassman to take it, because at that point you'll probably be a bit beyond it. It takes a global view and goes way way back in history which is fun. Go to the farm!",
    "Yes take this class if you're a good writer! Not a gut but if you put in effort, it's very manageable and super interesting",
    "Great course. Emphasis isn't on memorizing information but instead about learning to delve into primary sources and find something interesting and culturally relevant to say about them. In that respect, you're in charge of what you want to learn about.",
    "This class allowed me to understand how the role of women evolved over time. The numerous essay assignments helped students express their personal opinions on the different aspects of women and their culture. I recommend this to other students because I felt like a gained a lot from this course.",
    "I liked the class for a writing credit, but the topics are sort of difficult to write about because it's different than what you usually write about.",
    "WGSS 120 is a course that you should take if you are interested in beginning to think about gender and sexuality in the context of food. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I do not recommend this course.",
    "You get as much out of this class as you put into it, but if you put in the effort, it can be incredibly rewarding. If you have the opportunity to go on the Fall Break trip to Vermont, do it. The addition of the trip has brought the class to a new, more practical and applicable level.",
    "Great intro women's studies for those who want an easy introduction, and a pretty easy class for those who are more familiar with the subject. I would not recommend the class though for people currently fighting eating disorders or are in shaky stages of recovery, because one of the books assigned was very triggering (\"Appetites\") and because a student recovering from an ED was not allowed to skip section that week even though they said it would be triggering for them. Otherwise a pretty fine class with a low workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is very interesting, especially as a woman. The readings are interesting, which makes it easy to learn from. The materials in section we discussed were interesting as well, and challenged people's ways of thinking. This was a great class!"
