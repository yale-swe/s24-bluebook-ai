   "comments": [
    "I learned how to look at my writing more analytically and write for an audience, rather than simply writing for myself. Taking this class also helped me communicate and collaborate more effectively with my classmates.",
    "Writing well, American culture",
    "My writing improved significantly and I became more critical of what I was reading",
    "I feel like an immensely better writer and immensely more appreciative reader. Moreover, I think I have a better perspective on how interesting life is.",
    "An endeavor to explain the many insights and tips that this class taught me about writing would be exhausting for both you and me, so I'll sum it up by saying, in the words of Mark, I learned how to write \"good.\" You learn from Mark, you learn from the writers you read, and you learn from your classmates, who are probably all brilliant. You learn how essays work on a paragraph by paragraph level, and how they work on a sentence by sentence level. I feel like my understanding of what I, and other writers, need to do to write a stellar piece is so much richer and more nuanced now.",
    "I learned a lot about American culture and writing rules, and also how to generate novel ideas as well as how to write under pressure.",
    "AHH I learned so much from this course, not just about what makes good writing, but also about HOW to write well (the process), and what my strengths are as a writer. Perhaps most importantly, I learned about who I am: what I stand for, how my background has shaped my views, and what experiences have been the most meaningful in my life. I also learned that grades sometimes dont matter because they might not reflect the amount of effort\/time\/passion you put into a class. For this class especially, it was important that I focused on my personal edification, not on my grade. In terms of writing, I learned: * To avoid clichs * What an em dash and en dash are, and how to use them properly * How to use humorous footnotes effectively * The importance of details and using specific language in writing. * To cut 10% out of rough drafts conciseness makes for better writing * To be authentic in everything you do dont use platitudes or trumpets. * That aauthors dont pick their titleseditors\/publishers do * The importance of reading your essays out loud * That the most mundane things are still worthy of writing aboutthey might turn out to be the most interesting * That James Baldwins writing is gorgeous * That italicizing words is often unnecessary * That sometimes the rare use of second person is effective * The importance of writing about sensory details, such as how things smell."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We read a variety of authors and had very fruitful class discussions. I do not believe that this class had any particular weaknesses.",
    "We sometimes got off topic and often talked more about our opinions of the piece or the argument than about the literary skills we should take from it.",
    "Loved this class",
    "Almost everything was a strength. The readings were amazing, the professor is awesome, the classmates are stellar (I like to think this is common in English 120, since it's a self-selecting group that would take this class?) If I had to identify a weakness, it might be, generally speaking, the \"timeline\" of writing assignments. Mark would often say that students' essays would be like one draft away from being really good, so why did we never get that chance for that final draft? Maybe in cases like that, students can have the opportunity for a third draft? Or like once per semester? Not sure how this would work, but I felt like some of my writing assignments lacked closure that would have really helped me as a writer.",
    "The discussion environment is very free. In the class, we can talk about any topics about writing that we want to discover more.",
    "Unfortunately, there wasnt a single Black person in our class. This made discussing readings about race somewhat uncomfortable. I felt like there wasnt enough diversity of opinion in our classalmost everyone was white, and white women made up a huge proportion of the class. I dont know if there is a way to balance out the demographics of small classes, but maybe its worth looking into. I thought the class discussions about readings and how to write better were super rewarding. I also go a lot out of the peer-review process, in both giving and receiving feedback. Almost all of the readings were gripping, insightful, and fun to readthat was a huge plus. One downside is that I think this class is graded too harshlyif you put in great amount of effort and write passionately in line with the essay prompts, I feel like it shouldnt be impossible to get an A. I think Mark does a lot of grade deflation, which Im fine with because I dont think grades matter that much, but unfortunately grad schools and professional schools do care about GPA."

    "Brilliant class!! Definitely take English 120 with Professor Oppenheimer if you are seeking to improve your writing.",
    "YES",
    "Take this course. Take it with Mark. Start it Cred\/D\/Fail if you're concerned about your grade, but you'll come away a better writer, reader, and thinker. Also, you'll get to hang out with Mark Oppenheimer--what more is there you could want?",
    "Yes!! Emphatically so. If you enjoy writing, take it. I took it after asking an alumnus what his favorite class at Yale had been, and now I think I can say it's been my favorite class at Yale (this is coming from a senior, so you know that means business). You'll learn so much, and you'll enjoy every minute.",
    "You will definitely become a better writer throughout the course. This section is especially good for students who aspire to become journalists in the future.",
    "YES YES YES. I would absolutely recommend this course to every student at Yale. I learned so much about myselfwhat my values are; what experiences, people, and places have been the most formative in my life; and what my strengths are as a writer. After taking this course, I have a greater understanding of how my mind works and I am more confident in my beliefs. I also love myself more because this course helped me realize that I have many stories to tell and I express my beliefs clearly, persuasively, and with conviction. This doesnt mean that I got an A in the courseI got a B+but my grade is meaningless compared to the growth I experienced as a writer and as a person through this course. This class has inspired me to read and write for pleasure so much moreactivities that are often put by the wayside by busy Yale students. This course is a ton of work, especially if you take it with Mark Oppenheimer, but it is so so so rewarding. Cant recommend it enough. Almost all of the readings were provocative, memorable, and beautiful pieces. You will not regret taking this course. If you are worried about your GPA, take it Credit\/D\/Fail. Also, to get the most out of the course, dont start your essays the night before they are due. You need to let them marinate. If you have time, try to set up one-on-one meetings with Mark to get more feedback and help on your essays. Also, get book recommendations from Mark! He will give you any book in his library for freetake advantage of that."
