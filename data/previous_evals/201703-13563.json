    "Helpful project-based class if you are looking to develop a proposal",
    "This is a practice-based course, so I think it depends somewhat on who you end up working with. I had a great partner organization and learned a ton from them on the realities of implementing projects.",
    "I learned how to create and manage projects through this course.",
    "Everything taught in class was completely new to me and it was very informative. It brought me in contact with an important part of my future career goals. I learned a lot about projects and project-making in this course. I like the focus on one country and one SDG because it lets you narrow down your focus.",
    "Better knowledge about how project design and implementation is conducted. It was interesting to hear from experienced professionals.",
    "Very little. I knew about program design and the SDG's before taking this course. And I got a surface overview of both throughout the course. Maybe 1-2 speakers were insightful, but I didn't develop because of this class."

   "comments": [
    "Class should more upfront advertise itself as a project based class, be more inclusive of students from other schools other than forestry",
    "For the most part, I thought the speakers were very interesting, although for a few of the units I felt like I needed more information than the speakers provided to really understand how to do that part of the final report (ie. making a detailed budget, creating a logic model)",
    "I wished that there had been more discussion on the SDGs themselves, and what countries have done to move towards them. I felt frustrated that my project was completely hypothetical, making it difficult to conceptualize.",
    "I was expecting way less than what I learned on this course with respect to project planning, implementation and funding.",
    "I had expected to be more engaged with the Sustainable Development Goals, the indicators, the tools for monitoring and reporting. It barely scratched the surface of the SD Goals. It was way more on project development with very limited direction.",
    "Well.",
    "This class was pitched as an SDG study and there were very few lectures that went into detail on the SDG's. Our relative proximity to the UN would have made visits or experts accessible and that was not taken advantage of. This class should have been pitched as program design and practice, not SDG implementation."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course fills a gap in the curriculum for practice-based learning and is a great opportunity to work on a project if you already have an idea or an organization you would like to work with. I think if you come in without an idea it would be really challenging. It is a cool opportunity to get to set up meetings with different people around Yale. It is not a course you get a ton of feedback in so I think comments on the drafts would have been helpful.",
    "It was cool creating an SDG project, but I felt like the class lacked structure and guidance needed for the project. I struggled with developing a basic skill set required for project creation, management and implementation.",
    "The interaction with guest speakers and teachers is one of the best methods of learning such a practical subject. More focus on each aspect of a project proposal from a theoretical standpoint would be better.",
    "Some guest lecturers were relevant and others were not, particularly as it related with what we were tasked to do. There was no direction given to students in terms of what was being graded and what was expected. This course felt like an independent study.",
    "Strengths: Many speakers from varied backgrounds. Weaknesses: This can lead to the course being a little disarticulated.",
    "Any substance of the class outside of the constant, somewhat-applicable guest lectures was through the TF, not the teacher."

   "comments": [
    "It is a project based class, you wont learn about the SDGs in depth but rather focus on just one or two through your project. Great if you have a project in mind already but pointless if you dont have a solid idea, you could spend the entire semester figuring out your focus.",
    "If you have a project you want to work on, this is a good course to take! You have to be pretty self-motivated and I think a lot depends on finding a good mentor.",
    "I would tell a student that the class is the most beneficial for those that already have a project and mentor in mind.",
    "Sticking to the deadlines helps a lot when it comes towards the end of the semester and submissions pile up. It would also help a student to get to talk to the guest speakers and take help from them in any way they can. This course has been a great resource.",
    "Be clear on a project idea which you would like to develop and an area of the SD Goals you would like to work on.",
    "Take the course if you are interested a practical approach to project development and implementation.",
    "Don't take it unless you know nothing about program design or have a very specific project in mind you could do on your own but want the loose-structure of a class to accomplish."
