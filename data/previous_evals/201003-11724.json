    "The textbook was wonderful. The quizzes challenged me to read thoroughly and I'm glad that I did. I enjoyed class discussion very much. I learned a lot.",
    "Enjoyed the scope of the course but did not always feel that the assignments were directly connected to the lectures",
    "This was a small class (only 8 people) and at times, that was a little bit awkward, but most of the time, I enjoyed the smallness of the class and it encouraged me to participate more in discussions. The quizzes we had at the beginning of class were somewhat annoying, but honestly, they were a great motivator for getting the readings done! The structure of the course also was helpful in understanding the key concepts we needed to learn from the material instead of getting bogged down in all the details.",
    "I felt this course gave a good overall basis of knowledge for developing country nutrient deficiencies and then overview of general regional and global policies around food.",
    "Thecourse relies heavily on the readings assigned for each class meeting along with the quiz given during each session to reiterate the important material. The class covers the importance of so many biological nutrients I would have like to go into more of the biological pathway for each."

She is a good teacher, she cares about her students, and she puts a lot of effort into designing interesting and fun assignments. It's clear that the instructor is passionate about the topic, which makes learning from her a pleasure.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Good lecturer; liked that the class was organized to interact with professor, TA and other students in different ways throughout the semester and within each class period",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is a very knowledgeable instructor and was very interested in meeting the needs of her students in relation to their academic interests and incorporating their previous experiences into the course material and assignments. She was also very open to feedback on the course and making necessary changes as we went along.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0She wants to have everyone succeed and cares what we are all interested in. She structures the class more as a discussion and expects everyone to interact.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie teaches this class with great passion and enthusiasm for the material. She taught the class in a small section format with daily handouts as the reference point for the discussion and new information."

    "I felt Sara was very helpful and gave great input during class discussions.",
    "Sarah brought great examples from her life experience in the field of global nutrition and overall insight. She helped stress important ideas and help us question policy approaches that have been taken to solve issues of global nutrition."

    "Good intro to global nutrition issues",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, with the caveat that it will not fit everyone's interests or course style preferences. The class is highly participation-based (which is a plus for me, but may not be for other people) and is very globally focused, with very little discussion on nutrition issues within the United States.",
    "A worthwhile class for anyone who wants to get a better understanding of developing country nutrition and food issues.",
    "A great introduction to nutrition issues and the major research studies done so far. The course is constructed around textbook readings assigned for each class meeting which talk about biological pathways, research studies and policy outcomes and implications."
