    "This course failed to meet expectations. Out of class assignments did not enhance learning. Assignments attempted to be creative but missed the mark. Assignments were often too vague. This class felt like it was meant for undergrads and not for a graduate level. Pop quizzes and grading classmates felt like elementary exercises that took away from the learning experience.",
    "Overall, this course was great. I think the readings were really strong, but would have benefitted from a little more context and discussion of bias. Additionally, the final paper could have been combined with the debate to allow us to contextualize our research and use a real-world example.",

    "The topics for each class were interesting",
    "We covered a lot of ground really quickly, Prof. Dale really knows her stuff (especially fire), the readings weren't too serious, the midterm assignment forced me to re-examine and challenge my prior beliefs and assumptions about the law I wrote about (thank you for that), and the debates were an innovative way to bring in group work and external research. The course was a good balance of lecture and discussion with students who already had some expertise; in fact, this might have been the best balanced seminar\/lecture format I've had at Yale!",
    "The material and current events.",
    "I really enjoyed when we were able to have an in depth discussion of the issues and also appreciated the background knowledge provided. Lisa's professional experience in the west provides great context.",
    "Reading the original texts of various land use acts.",
    "This subject matter is very importantly and very relevant to those interested in public land and\/or the American West.",
    "Readings and discussions about public lands management in the west. The debates were also a great way to dive into controversial public lands issues in more detail and have to defend a point of view you may not inherently agree with.",
    "Enjoyed the fact that the reading was pulled from a variety of sources. I especially liked some of the readings that gave in depth summaries and history of a particular issue, i.e. NEPA or Forest Policy etc. I feel those readings will be useful references when some of these broad topics are encountered in the future.",
    "Lisa Dale is an excellent instructor; I appreciated her insight into various Western issues."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "The format and organization of discussions needs improvement. The assignments were too vague.",
    "I think the course should be retitled \"Federal Land Management Agencies in the U.S. West.\" When I told colleagues I was taking this course, they said, \"Oh, so it's basically a course in water!\" But we barely spent any time on water, which is so central to Western environmental issues. So the class either needs to spend more time on this vital issue for the future, or change the name to be a more accurate reflection of the material. (And there's nothing wrong with this material, especially since it's what the professor knows - but let's not sell it as a survey of environmental policy in the US West. It wasn't.) We also should have spent more time on Native American issues. Prof. Dale said we would only spend one day on them because they are so wide-ranging that they deserve their own course - which I bet is true! But few of us would take that course with all that we already have going on, so integrating tribes into the course the same way that states are integrated is the only way to help de-marginalize Native Americans and help expose us as students. It might also be good to look at how other racial demographics play into the West, from Latino residents to Black history in the National Parks. While I loved the midterm assignment, the final assignment is a little too similar to it. More freedom on that please. But it might work for the undergrad level at Columbia. Did not care for the quizzes, though that will work for an undergrad level at Columbia.",
    "This course was designed for undergraduates. There needed to be an adaptation to graduate students. There was very little critical analysis, if any. Gray literature was rarely discussed. Too much time spent on process. The debates were too structured. Pop quizzes implied very little trust in the class which perpetuated a lack of motivation. Discussions could be facilitated better. Breaking into small groups and regurgitating reading was okay every once in a while. Papers should be pushed forward and debate should be final assignment. Final assignment papers were made up scenarios that were not incredibly engaging. Two papers looking at process is in excess. There was clear bias in the classroom. Students would have gained more from being cold called.",
    "We needed more discussions--re-hashing the readings lecture style wasn't as helpful as getting into an in-depth discussion. I also didn't like the assigning of current events and the pop quizzes--I think there are better ways to holds students accountable for doing the work and participating.",
    "It seemed like this was a lecture class that was designed for undergraduates - with the course being a seminar, I expected to be able to explore topics of interest to me (which are well within the course's focus), and was not able to. Much of the assigned work felt like busywork that was not helpful to my learning, and I didn't have a chance to take ownership over a project that I was excited about. I think this could be a really good class for a different audience and in a different context, but it didn't fit well as a graduate-level seminar.",
    "I was incredibly frustrated with the instructor and the way the material was delivered. The whole structure of the course disincentivised learning - Lisa had regular pop quizzes which were designed to make us read for detail and repetition of the main author, and not at all for comprehension or larger synthesis of the ideas. Then the classes were entirely repetitive of the readings which felt like a waste of time. She discouraged students following interests of their own topics and was a very poor discussion facilitator.",
    "The midterm essay and final essay assignments were not useful to my understanding of the topics. Some of the lectures felt better suited to an undergraduate course rather than a master's seminar discussion-based course.",
    "I felt some of the discussion exercises were useful however I also gained a lot from Lisa's lectures. She is a wealth of knowledge on some of these topics and I had no problem being lectured to on occasion, despite the fact that Lisa seemed apologetic whenever she lectured. At times the discussions were merely a re-hash of the reading. I actually preferred listening to lecture with the discussion coming through questions and comments throughout."
