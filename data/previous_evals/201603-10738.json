    "I developed a much more substantial knowledge and appreciation for the earlier parts of the canon.",
    "I got experience analyzing and writing about dense, detailed poetry.",
    "I think I really improved at my ability to critically analyze texts, especially ones that I was not as familiar with. I have not had much experience evaluating old English poetry so I think I definitely developed some skills in this area.",

    "Writing Essays Poetry",
    "I was exposed to texts that are important and that I know will be referenced in subsequent English courses. As much of the learning I did in this class was independently reading critical articles for essays, I also learned how to be self-directed."

   "comments": [
    "The class should be harder! We only read little tid-bits of the authors. We could have read all of the Canterbury tales, the Faerie Queene, and Shakespeare's poetry. I think Donne should be removed, he's just not at the level of Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare. In addition, class discussion could be improved by allowing students to talk to one another. Instead, the class felt too much like a ping-pong game: student-professor-student-professor-student-professor. Also, we could have done more literary-theory--an intro English course should teach analytical skills!",
    "While I loved Minnis' interpretation of this course in particular, often I feel this course struggles under the weight of the question of whether the cannon is still needed and whether majors view it as valuable to them-- I'm not sure how best to solve this...",
    "The strengths of the course are the readings. There are, unfortunately, a few problems with the course; first, a huge percentage of class time is spent listening to students' plot summaries of poems, rather than analyzing the poems. The instructor should spend more time in the future trying to facilitate analysis of poems by posing questions and guiding the discussion by inserting his opinion every now and then.",
    "I thought the course was very strong but could have involved more writing assignments. I thought the ones that we had were all very useful and engaging but would have liked some more practice at writing some more shorter essays in between.",
    "The weakness of this course is it purports to teach us about poets that are foundational to our English educations. Each class, one student would provide a close reading of the poems or cantos we were supposed to read for class. Then after the presentation, Professor Minnis would essentially do his own follow up presentation. We never talked about analytical skills or why these poets were foundational. We did not engage with any meaningful critiques of the work or learn about important historical context. Its strength, I suppose, was that because each of our assignments was rehashed in class, this class was a pathetically low commitment.",
    "i think the biggest strength of the course was the selection of poems we read. i think it's weakness lied in the class environment and the lack of cohesive discussions.",
    "TEACHER IS AMAZING SUPER CONSIDERATE VERY HELPFUL IN OFFICE HOURS HE ROOTS FOR YOU A GREAT RESOURCE",
    "As a former Directed Studies student and a prospective English major, I should be the ideal student for this class: I understand the value of foundational texts, and I'm deeply interested and enthusiastic about delving deeply into works that have shaped the English language. I was so disappointed. This class failed because it didn't do any work to connect the authors we read to each other or explain their significance in terms of what innovations they made to the English language, which feels embarrassing if the English department claims that these classes are so necessary that all English majors must take them. This class failed because it did not engage with feminist perspectives on any of the authors we read; instead, we sat through class after class discussing brutal rape scenes as \"cheeky\" or \"too clever by half\" to be taken seriously. I forced myself to do the readings for my own education, but doing them was totally unnecessary as the class time was taken up by students giving twenty to thirty minute summaries of what we were all supposed to have read the night before, and then the professor going on incomprehensible tangents followed by bad questions supposedly addressed to the class that he then answered himself after a few seconds. In some, this class was not only offensive, it was also just bad."

    "You're probably taking this course because its required by the major, but it really is a very good one on its own merits. The readings are way more accessible than I had realized, never having spent significant time on any of the authors before, and some, particularly Donne for me, were incredibly moving. Minnis is a fantastic professor--knows his stuff, is incredibly kind, and makes the effort to connect with each student. His comments on the papers are invaluable as well, as he corrects line-by-line and offers some really good insights into your strengths and flaws as a writer. The one thing I would say is be aware of the people you take the class with. They can really make or break your experience, so make sure you're comfortable with spending pretty significant time with them over the semester. Workload is standard: light reading for each class, and 5 short papers, ranging from 3 to 8 pages. They're due just about every two weeks, so while it's never overwhelming, you do need to make a constant effort.",
    "This class is a reasonable second or third class, especially if you like poetry. Papers written in one day get an A-\/B+. Even with mostly good students, class discussion felt lacking. This was because the professor dominated the conversation and shut down disagreeing arguments.",
    "If they are interested in canon, absolutely. Minnis especially is absolutely adorable and super passionate, so definitely take it with him.",
    "I would not recommend the course. Class time is used inefficiently, and students often have rare opportunities to enter discussions during the lengthy presentations.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to any student considering the English major or interested in English poetry because I thought it was engaging and interesting.",
    "The most disappointing aspect of Yale so far has been that this class is a requirement for the English major. I don't know why the English department seems content to stay stuck in the stodgy, white era of a bygone Yale, but it makes an otherwise appealing major offensively outdated. It is of course essential to read these works in their historical context, but to refuse to engage with meaningful feminist critiques or even students' questions about this blatantly misogynistic material is to do a disservice to Yale's 21st century students. Yale's myopic vision of what counts as foundational literature (white, male, blatantly rape-y) makes it difficult to mine a meaningful English education for a large swath of English students. No amount of \"listening lunches\" will satisfy these disappointed students, Yale English. Just change the requirements for the major and stop pretending you don't know what the students think about this horrid class.",
    "TAKE A SIP BABES OF THIS CLASS ACTUALLY ITS THE BEST SECTION MAKES LEARNING ENJOYABLE, ACCESSIBLE AND ENRICHING",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to be an English major and is willing to put up with a lot of bullshit. I used this class to practice standing up feminist perspectives in class and thought of it as an exercise in navigating out-dated, offensive academia."
