    "Great class. Would recommend to anyone.",
    "In comparison of other types of Psychology, Cognitive Science is very much theory and computational based. At some points in the course, it felt like a computer science course. Scholl is a competent professor, although he has a bit of an unhealthy obsession with his 3 year old daughter. He is very poor at making slides, so taking notes is sometimes a hassle. He stresses that you go to every class, so much so that he doesn't offer a textbook and he uploads unfinished slides to classesv2. But overall it's a decent course, very centralized around the themes of Cognitive Science.",
    "Inro Cog sci is a ton of fun. I have no interest in going into the field, but it was my favorite class this semester. Class was consistently interesting and fun.",
    "great class, don't underestimate it. The paper's surprisingly tough, but doable. Midterm's hard, final's easier.",
    "This class is an overview of cognitive science. It covers just about anything you could study if you decided to study cognitive science as your major: visual perception, attention, infant cognition, language acquisition, love-sex-and-attraction, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and much more. It's a great overview until he starts falling behind in the syllabus, and then things start getting a little rushed, which makes it difficult to know what you need to study for the midterm and the final. I would recommend this class to someone who is majoring in cognitive science. It's easy to get lost in some of the topics he talks about, especially when he gets into linguistics and Turing machines, unless you already have some background in those fields. Overall, it's interesting, but if you don't think you want to major in cognitive science, I might recommend just taking Intro Psych and skipping this one.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think the topics covered are important for people to understand, and this class is something that most people will never study in their lives. Even though this was an introductory course, I feel as though I can speak about this subject to others and explain exactly what I have learned.",
    "I would take Intro to Psychology over this class if you have no real pull towards cognitive science as a discipline. This class was fine as an introductory course, but it's a lot more work and somewhat less enjoyable than I would have thought going into the class.",
    "Would not recommend unless you really like the material. Gets boring quickly, gets hard. He makes you think it's gonna be a gut, and then halfway through the semester, you realize you're failing.",
    "Cognitive Science 110 01 was a fantastic class that I would most definitely recommend to others. This introductory course covered a variety of really interesting and salient topics like love, sex and attraction, infant cognition, perception and decision-making. The work-load was light, the readings are interesting, the paper was interesting to write and the exams were very fair. My only complaint is that a discussion section would have been nice, but alas the behemoth class size made this impossible.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't taken an intro psych or intro neuroscience class before; it teaches you an interesting general perspective on cognitive science that you would not expect. In terms of concrete material, it is a little less fulfilling- it's definitely a more vague overarching class.",
    "Take Psych.",
    "i would definitely recommend this course to everyone. It is a fascinating topic taught in a fun and engaging ways.",
    "This is a very interesting class but the workload is formidable, mostly in the form of readings before each class. A typical day of reading could be around ~30 pages, even as much as 50 or 60 (sometimes Scholl is a little crazy to think we will be able to read all of that). The class (when I took it) was in the art gallery, which was less than ideal since it is dark and there are no desks so seating is weird and not very comfortable when you take notes by hand (like me but unlike most others). Scholl has great lecturing style also he is sometimes too cheeky or shows off his young daughter too much. Material is mostly interesting but can get technical in some places. I would be cautious about this class if you're not already interested in the brain and how it works. I would shy away from taking this as a gut class, as the tests are extremely stressful (I feel like I'll have a heart attack during each one) and the reading is quite substantial. There are some extremely amazing parts of the class though, and definitely some highlights. I took this class concurrently with Intro Psych (PSYC 110) with Dr. Chun, and I thought they complemented each other well. I'd say there's about 30% overlap, but I never felt that it was inhibiting in any way. Both classes offer different perspectives on many of the same issues and approach the brain in separate ways (Cog Sci from the more technical brain perspective, while Psych from the more social person-based aspect) - I thought they complemented each other very well, and if you have the flexibility in your schedule to do this (and don't mind a big block of classesMon\/Wed... which might leave Tues\/Thurs free). Beware the testing procedure and come early if at all possible (by early I mean like... more than 20 minutes before class starts... probably preferably 30 if you can... you'll thank yourself).",
    "Super interesting class! Not particularly work-intensive, Brian Scholl is an awesome professor, and the class is super fun. The midterm\/final was kind of a weird test, but the class overall was amazing. Definitely recommend!",
    "I would recommend this course. It is full of interesting material and a good way to peak into a bunch of different disciplines (psychology, computer science, linguistics, behavioral economics) for those who are not yet sure what most interests them. I took Cog Sci along with Intro Psych and they were back to back, which made me a bit exhausted by the middle of Cog Sci. If they aren't back to back, this a nice combo because the material overlaps a bit but from very different angles. If deciding between the two: I preferred the Cog Sci material to Psych (it makes you think in contrast to the straight memorization of Psych), but I found the Psych lectures more enjoyable (Professor Chun is very lovable). Both are worth taking, but Psych opens up more immediate opportunities, as it is a prerequisite for most psych classes.",
    "Cogsci is a good social science credit; the material is interesting and the workload is not too hard. Scholl is amazing, so you should try to take it with him if at all possible. The material is not as cohesive as in other courses, but overall once you finish you'll be surprised at all of the little facts that you learned about cognitive processing. Oh and all you science majors out there, I'm afraid to say you'll be cringing horribly when he starts talking about how MRI's work. That's how little you need to know about actual science to take this course. If you're deciding between this and intro psych, all I can say is that cogsci focuses a lot more on how the brain processes information rather than the behaviors caused by this processing; if the brain is more interesting to you than behavior, I would take this course.",
    "Kind of boring.",
    "I think the only good part about this course was the guest lectures. Otherwise, I think the course is very surface level, in that it is an introductory course to all the subfields of Cognitive Science. Further, Brian Scholl's lectures have absolutely no structure and seem like a bunch of random, unconnected information. I don't think this has prepared me to major in Cognitive science, and in fact this course almost made me switch my major entirely. I don't think it should be a prerequisite for the major, and think an introductory course in one of the subfields, like Introduction to Psychology, would prepare students better for the major.Take it only if you must, and try to laugh at his jokes as a way to get through it.",
    "Interesting class! The material is often mind-blowing (pun intended) and pretty interesting. Some of the readings can be pretty long, but you don't need to read to remember every little detail. The midterm and the final are not easy, but they are very fair. Overall good! Prof. Scholl is a funny guy.",
    "Intro to Cognitive Science was my first introductory social sciences course at Yale. It was what I expected it to be--a survey across many different disciplines that also managed to give enough depth and detail in each of the disciplines to make the class worthwhile. If a student is at all interested in the mind, I would definitely recommend the course. Obviously, it went through a lot of information and was very informative, but it also left a lot to be discovered in the future (which is expected in an intro class), so it's led me to consider many other courses that would expand upon certain areas we discussed in the course. I would recommend the class because it's a very reasonable amount of work, the lectures are worth going to, and it's opened up new doors for me in terms of what I'm considering studying here.",
    "Intro CogSci is an interesting class and will leave you with many interesting facts to tell you're friends but I doubt that it will even peak your interest in pursuing it further because the way that the filed is described it sounds like there aren't enough discoveries to learn about but there are plenty waiting to be made.",
    "The material in Intro to CogSci is very interesting, even for people who aren't necessarily considering Cognitive Science or Psychology as a major (like me). It introduces a lot of basic themes and concepts in cognitive science, and explains some of the phenomena we observe in our daily lives. I'd definitely recommend it if you're interested in learning about cognition, it's not too much work (daily readings and short responses) and it's definitely well taught.",
    "A fun survey course of a relatively new, exciting field. Some of the readings can be confusing because they are taken directly from the scientific literature, but they give you good practice. The lectures are the most exciting part of the course. In almost every lecture, you will learn something interesting about how the mind works that you will want to share with your friends.",
    "I would recommend Cog Sci 110 if you have any potential interest in studying Cognitive Science further or if you'd just like to receive a taste of a fairly diverse and interesting field.",
    "Yes - I took this class as a senior MCDB major, and now I wish I had taken it as a freshman, and I may have been a cogsci major.",
    "A fascinating course that goes briefly over a lot of really cool topics in Cog Sci. I would recommend it to anyone. If you like lectures to move quickly and to not waste time, though, this would be an aggravating course for you.",
    "If you're just wondering what kind of areas there are in Cog Sci, this class is a great and interesting way to see what's out there. It covers a ton of different topics, some are more interesting than others, but Scholl is a good lecturer and enthusiastic about all of them and shows the practical application of them all. The midterm is the trickiest thing because the questions are weird and you have to be able to apply the concepts in the moment, but I think that made the final a lot easier since you knew what was coming.",
    "A must take for a slightly different side of psychology. There isn't a textbook; it's really interesting to learn directly from readings in the field.",
    "Interesting course material, exams are not simple by any means, but once you understand how they are organized following the midterm, the final is much more bearable.",
    "A BROAD overview of everything cognitive science. I would not recommend this class because it is just frustrating to not be able to get into any of the details.",
    "CogSci 110 is a basic introduction to the field, which is comprised of neuroscience, psych, comp sci, linguistics, and childhood psych. If you are interested in all or some of these things, this is a good starting point for you, but if you want to go deeper into any one thing, you should probably do that instead.",
    "I would recommend Psych 130 to a student who thinks they are generally interested in how the human mind works but have a desire to study this question through a variety of different academic backgrounds and domains.",
    "Intro to CogSci is the science behind everything Don Draper ever says. It's a fascinating conglomeration of disciplines all investigating one question: the way the mind works. Professor Scholl covers a wide range of topics, as this is an overview course. If you have trouble remembering details, then this course might not be the best for you. Otherwise, you should definitely take it. You'll learn a lot with little pain.",
    "Cog Sci is a great class. I'd recommend it as a great alternative or in addition to Intro Psychology. It's super interesting and describes some phenomena that I had never heard of. The material is just wonderful and everything you learn is a cool fact that you would be able to speak about at a cocktail party.",
    "I would recommend Psych 130 to any psych majors that are not interested in the natural sciences of psychology and need to get that requirement out of the way. It's a science class taught through the eyes of psychology, so it's easier to understand than a real hard science class.",
    "I really didn't like this class. The material itself was somewhat interesting, but the lectures were unstructured (particularly because the material is so abstract and conceptual) and hard to follow, and the powerpoints have no real info on them. Studying for the tests was really difficult. I would recommend starting it credit\/d",
    "Amazing class. The course is very comprehensive and covers almost every topic a prospective CogSci major would want to consider for research; however, I estimate that the majority of students in the class simply took the class because it offers fascinating insights into the working of our minds. Professor Scholl is an engaging, charismatic lecturer who delivers the course materials with precision and clarity. The reading can be daunting but are necessary for really having a grasp of the course. Take the class.",
    "I was considering the cogsci major, but after taking this class, I realized that trying to study the brain with current technology is essentially like trying to study cell structures with a magnifying glass. Until someone comes up with a breakthrough imaging technique, we can't really go far in cognitive science.Would recommend as a credit D. Professor Scholl is an excellent lecturer, readings are somewhat interesting, but there are two exams and a very boring 2500-word term paper that's going to feel like pulling teeth.",
    "Many topics are touched upon in this class, which makes each lecture fresh and interesting. Some of the readings are long, but the required reading responses are short, and it's easy to get full credit. Even though it's an introductory class you can get a good idea of what cogsci is all about.",
    "Yes I would! It is a very rewarding experience!",
    "Introduction to cognitive science is a large lecture class. You'll meet twice a week, and at each meeting Brian Scholl will give you a very superficial lesson in some subtopic related to cognitive science -- perception, attention, morality, decision-making, computation, etc. You end up learning a little bit about a lot of different fields encompassed by cognitive science. There are reading responses due an hour before class every lecture day, and these are pretty straightforward and easy to complete. The readings are dense, but you're only expected to grasp the main idea of each one. There are two exams, one midterm and one \"final\" that really only covers the second half of the class material; there is also one paper due the week before Thanksgiving, which has no prompt so it's pretty much up to your teaching fellow whether you do well or fail miserably.I unfortunately took this class hoping to figure out whether or not I like cognitive science enough to major in it. This class doesn't give you that sense, because it's so far-removed from any actual critical thinking you'd be doing as a cognitive science major. That being said, I'd still recommend it because obviously if you do find you want to get a degree in cognitive scienceyou'll have to take this class. Plus, it's not a bad experience overall. Lectures are generally interesting, and it's not that difficult, so it's easy to fit into any schedule. Shop it for sure, and take it if you like Brian Scholl's style.",
    "Yes, because you will learn about things in everyday life that everyone could afford to be interested in and learn about",
    "Cogsci is such an interesting and fun course - I would highly recommend it! Since cognitive science is such a broad topic, the course introduces students to a lot of its different subdisciplines and gives a taste for what the major is like. The class also doesn't have an exam during finals period, which is really nice, and the exams themselves are fair.",
    "Cognitive Science is an introduction class that goes through the different topics of cognitive science that you can study. I would reccommend taking this class because it is very engaging and interesting. It is a little difficult and the ideas are complex but its a great class!",
    "Great class. Scholl is a funny guy. The workload is tiny and the tests aren't bad.. but not super easy either.",
    "first couple classes seemed interesting. once shopping period ended, this wasnt the case. linguistics sucks. professor is pretty annoying as well",
    "I'm not really interested in cognitive science so I didn't love the class, but I definitely found it very interesting. Scholl is great and it wasn't a very difficult class, so I'd recommend it to anyone who has any possible interest in the subject.",
    "Cognitive Science 110 is a survey course about yourself, your own mental processes. You look at many different aspects of the mind, from language to visual perception, that become obvious to you as you reflect on your own behavior, and you end up learning a lot about yourself and why you do certain things. I would recommend this course to another student because it is fascinating and appropriately challenging (and hilarious at times).",
    "Cognitive science is an overview of the main themes explored through cognitive science, including the research and some of the main hypotheses about the human brain and behavior. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student - it was one of my favorite courses here at Yale!",
    "I recommend this course if you're good at giving extremely specific answers. The lectures don't necessarily flow. There's a lot of material being thrown to you at once, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it. Either it's your thingor it isn't.",
    "It's a good introductory class to the study of cognitive science. Scholl is a good lecturer and knows how to keep the class interested, and the workload is rather light (short responses on the reading for each class, and a 7-8 page paper at the end of the semester). The class covers a lot of material, so you don't go into anything too deeply, but since it covers so much you get to hear about a lot of fascinating research. Some of the reading assignments can be difficult to decipher because they're almost all taken from current scientific publications, and have a lot of terminology we don't know. Overall I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who thinks they might be interested in psychology or cognitive science. Even if you're not interested in studying it further, it's still a really good class to take.",
    "This is a good intro course to cognitive science. It's quite similar to intro to psychology. The course is a bit scattered and although the professor tries to link the various topics with central themes, it still seems to jump from topic to topic. The lectures involve a lot demonstrations. The slides are posted after class, but they don't really make sense unless you went to class. There isn't that much work. You have to do reading responses for each class, but they're graded on a pass-fail system. There is a midterm, a final and a final paper. The tests are more application based, but you're allowed to skip a couple. There is also no textbook for the course and all the readings are assigned online. They range from primary science literature to textbook chapters to New Yorker articles. Overall a pretty good class.",
    "A fascinating class if you have even the slightest interest in how the mind works. Prof Scholl is a fantastic lecturer and the workload is far from stressful.",
    "Sure. For the cog sci or psyc major, or if youd just like a nice intro lecture course.",
    "I would summarize it as an overview of what cognitive science is about. I really recommend the class if you're interested in being a cognitive science major or if you're just interested in learning how the brain works in different areas of your life.",
    "An incredible survey course. Don't expect too much depth but do expect to learn a lot of stuff about daily life that is incredibly applicable and relevant. A must take. Everything is very recent and cutting edge and with the constant change of exact topic and B Scholl's awesome lecturing, it feels like a new TED talk, each lecture. However, the tests are a little annoying because wording really matters to score well. Not neccesarily a GUT or an easy grade like it may seem, but definitley an incredible course.",
    "Awesome course! Take it if you can! Workload isn't bad, the professor is a great lecturer, and the material is very interesting.",
    "I would totally recommend intro to Cogsci to anybody. We learned a lot of really interesting stuff about life and the human mind. It's a super broad course, and you cover a bit of everything that involves the mind...from linguistics to game theory to sex. Professor Scholl is a brilliant lecturer--I felt like I was going to a magic show during class. There's no section, and you don't really HAVE to do the readings if your other classes have too much work. The readings are really interesting and not too long though.",
    "It's a basic survey course of everything the Cognitive Science department\/major offers. If you're even slightly interested in Cognitive Science or one of its subfields, I'd definitely recommend this course.",
    "Although a lot of the material we covered was interesting, the course was very poorly run. I would not recommend taking it with Professor Scholl. Professor Scholl was often disorganized with lecture material, and would spend large periods of class showing us pictures of his daughter, but would not spend enough time explaining important information. He would also spend large amounts of class time insulting his colleagues and other researchers in the field in a very unprofessional way. The midterm and final were completely miss-managed. Because of the ridiculous system he used to hand out the tests, some people started the midterm 40 minutes earlier and ended 30 minutes later than others, so some people got 115 minutes and others got as few as 45. For a test that is curved, this is totally unacceptable and unfair. He was also unreasonable about other course policies for handing in papers and reading responses. Professor Scholl really ruined the class and the material. If you are interested in this general area or need a social science, take intro psych with Paul Bloom or Marvin Chun. It's similar material, and they are much, much better teachers. Only take this class if you need it for the cogsci major; otherwise there are way better classes at Yale.",
    "Only take it if you're interested in doing research in cognitive science. If you're looking to learn about highly practical information (e.g. techniques to influence your mind\/others' minds), this class isn't for you.",
    "a lot of tedious work, but an interesting course",
    "Yes I would recommend it! Cognitive Science is a great introduction class that will help you learn about humans in a completely new way. Unlike psychology, Cogsci focuses solely on the brain, andconstantly integrates different sciences to give you a interdisciplinary understanding. The workload is not too bad but studying for exams can be very daunting.",
    "It's an interesting survey of cogsci, but the class itself becomes tedious after a while. Take it if you're interested or need an So. It's also not very much work--just reading responses (which are pass\/fail), 2 exams, and a paper.",
    "A great introduction to the study of the mind. Might not be Scholl teaching it, but the material is awesome either way.I also took this at the same time as Intro to Psych with Marvin Chun and the overlap was not bad at all. Ask an unbiased source (i.e. another professor) in the Psych department if you're thinking of taking both to figure out how much of an overlap there will be.",
    "Intro Cog Sci is overall a good course. There are two midterms and a paper. Although the workload is very manageable, if you take this with the mind set that it will be an easy grade, you will probably not do that well on the exams. If you don't understand a concept, go to office hours otherwise you will have a hard time learning it right before the test.",
    "It is a good overview.",
    "Excellent course, definitely worth taking regardless of your background. Teaches you all things about how the mind works that you would have never imagined. The workload is also quite light -- simple reading responses, and 1 paper. And Professor Scholl is a highly witty, fluent lecturer.",
    "Interesting class but I hated the location of it, terrible seating and lighting made the experience worse. But good subject matter even though you have to go to lecture to be able to decipher his powerpoints. Not that hard and little time commitment. Tests can be tricky but definitely doable.",
    "Take it for an easy So credit. A very broad and shallow overview of several areas of cognitive science, which focuses mostly on impressing students with cool study results instead of actually talking about the studies and what they tell us about cognition. Fun gut class, there *is* work but it can be done mindlessly, or not if you so choose. Reading responses require little thought and can be done during lunch breaks before class, but having responses due every Monday and Wednesday is still a little stressful. Final paper is a little hard to BS, but it's doable. Watch out for strict lateness policies. Scholl obviously knows he has a strong cult of personality around him, and most students treat him like a celebrity (wonder how much is peer pressure?), which is kind of weird. He can be a jerk if he doesn't like what you're doing, but stay on his good side and stick around after class to listen to what other students ask if you're interested in learning a bit more about the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to a person who would want to have a general understanding of cog sci or considering it as a major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The tests are pretty tricky and definitely require studying for, but you come out of the class feeling like you've really gained a broad understanding of the field.",
    "An amazing class that gives you insight into the human mind! You learn such cool things and can go home and intrigue people by your knowledge of visual illusions and attraction. Also, Professor Scholl is the best so lectures are actually super fun and entertaining. This class is not very hard - Reading responses each week, a paper, and 2 tests.",
    "Take this class to test the waters of the CogSci major.Pro tip: Turing machines (for the midterm) and linguistics (on the final) were the most difficult topics, so go to office hours when he first goes over those topics, so then you don't have to stress to figure them out before the exam.",
    "Take it! But realize there is more work and learning involved than you think don't just write it off as an easy class because you can do really well in it because you have all of the resources!!!",
    "This is a great course if you are looking for exciting, interesting lectures and a relatively low work-load. It's great exposure to psychology, linguistics, and cognitive science. The material in lecture is fascinating too; you will keep thinking about it days to come. I think anybody can enjoy this class. In order to love it (which I didn't), you have to really like broad topics and terminology. This class will not provide you with concrete answers or skills that you can apply on a test, making studying a bit tough.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It is amazing. It is well-taught, the material is interesting, and you will have a lot of fun in each class. I learned things that I would never have learned anywhere else. I went in as a Math major and came out wanting to major in Cognitive Science. Take it, if you want to have a fantastic course.",
    "It is a good course if you want to get your feet wet with cognitive science or need to fulfill a distributional requirement.",
    "Everybody should take this course. Very interesting material, the workload is not bad at all, and a cool Professor as well.",
    "Cognitive Science is a very interesting class but it wasn't for me. Take it if you're interested in the major.",
    "DEFINTELY DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. This class could expose you to the field that you are truly passionate about, and guide you towards your future major through its vast exposure to research across disciplines. TOTALLY COOL.",
    "Overall, a good course!",
    "I would. It is a great introductory class, given by an outstanding professor with great oratory skills whose charisma and knowledge make it such an engaging course even for non-majors.",
    "This is a TERRIBLE class. Don't be fooled by the reviews; those are just freshman who have never taken a survey\/psyc course before. Professor Scholl's antics are amusing at first, but get really old really fast. In addition, the readings are brutally dense and technical. He even says that you won't understand a lot of them (you should just \"skim for the main ideas)\". In addition, the tests are quirky and bizarre. Just know that the first 4 lectures are much more engaging than the next 6. There were some interesting lectures, but I think that psyc 110 is a much better course.",
    "amazing 'intro' course. really serves well to expose students to various topics in cog sci and make those topics sexy. two exams were easy if you study with a couple other friends who know their stuff. take good notes. you can get by without doing much of any reading, BSing reading responses if your TF isn't picky, but the more you invest in reading the articles, the omre you'll learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend CogSci 110 to another student, regardless of his or her interest in the field. This intro course gives you an intriguing idea of what it means to think about how you think. The class is taught in such a way as to emphasize the quickly-changing nature of cognitive science; since our knowledge of the area is being discovered as we speak, in five or ten years, the material could be completely different. That said, CogSci gives you a solid basis for understanding the constraints and capabilities of our minds and leaves you free to pursue any specific topic within its boundaries.",
    "Its a really enlightening class.If someone is already interested in the subject field, i would recommend that they take this class because it really opens one's mind to seemingly mundane processes and teaches them to question normal occurrences.",
    "Intro to Cognitive Science is a fairly interesting course, due in large part to the fact that Brian Scholl is a great professor. However, I would not recommend the course. I had higher expectations for the actual field of cognitive science, but I left feeling like current knowledge in the field of cognitive science was rather disorganized and unfounded. Consequently, I felt like I didn't really truly learn a significant amount in the course. Unless you're positive you will really enjoy the field of cognitive science, I would not strongly recommend this course.",
    "This course is one of the best you can probably take at Yale. It covers interesting topics in psychology, linguistics, economics, neuroscience, and others. Everyone should try to take it before he or she graduates.",
    "This class gave an interesting introduction to several subjects within cognitive science. Even if you don't plan on majoring in this field, the subjects were intriguing and I would recommend this class to all students!",
    "I would recommend CogSci to another student. I wouldn't say that I would recommend it with all the passion I have, but I would say that it is a class with a lot of fascinating material that is not too much work. You have a lot of reading for work (which takesprobably 4 hours a week if you do it all) and then one or two reading responses each class (which take half an hour to an hour approx) but you can answer them without doing all of the reading most of the time so it's not too bad of a workload. A lot of the things we learned were VERY cool and I left the class with I think a deeper, cooler, and more multifaceted understanding of the way my mind works in the world, which I really appreciate. I really really enjoyed this class.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "take it. You can earn a good grade and learn a lot about yourself.",
    "Great, fun course! The time during lecture flies by quickly.",
    "It was a good, interesting class. Take this if you want to change the way you look at certain things in the world, but I do not think it will really change your life. Scholl is a good lecturer but can also be a bit conceited and frustrating to listento. Some lectures lack direction and focus, but the material is really interesting.",
    "Yes. The class is very engaging, fun, and interesting. The PowerPoint slides are a little difficult to follow and the professor has a knack for using overly flowery language. Overall, yes, it's a good class.",
    "This class is very interesting, however sometimes, it is hard to follow the general outline of the course. The guest lectures at the end of the class were the most engaging. The workload is not bad at all, with reading responses due every class period, and one final paper that requires no research. The TAs can be somewhat harsh graders, but all the work and reading is very worthwhile and interesting in itself.",
    "The content is so interesting, but I was never really doing that well, even when I thought I completely understood the material. Don't let the professor shop it to you as a gut. It is not. I'm not even referring to grades. I just like to figure out a way to understand the material before me and I never felt like I grasped that.",
    "Cognitive Science is a far more technical study of the mind than it is advertised during shopping period. Although it covers a wide range of fascinating topics, it is more details-oriented and neuroscience-related than its Psychology 101 counterpart.Additionally, Professor Scholl's choice not to use a textbook made the class far more difficult. After each class, Professor Scholl would post the presentation slides he used in class online. Unfortunately, in the process of uploading, a huge portion of the information was always lost. Without a textbook or complete slides, there was very little material to study in preparation for exams. Combined with the fact that the exams test a range of broad topics, technical information, and minute concepts (contrary to what the TFs will tell you), the whole process was far more stressful and inefficient than it needed to be.",
    "Fascinating material. Worth taking for sure. Just know that Professor Scholl is a little self-indulgent and spends more time than he should performing and being funny and therefore less time than he could teaching. But still\u00e2\u0080\u0094when he does get down to teaching, it's thoroughly engaging.",
    "We covered some very interesting material and I learned some cool facts about human cognition and the human brain but I still don't have a complete or thorough sense of what cognitive science is.",
    "This is a really incredible class. Even if you don't want to study cognitive science as your major, the material learned is applicable to daily life. It's one of those disciplines where you'll see something happen in everyday life and, after taking the course, stop for a moment to say, \"Hey, I know why my mind did that!\"",
    "While it was an interesting course, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, particularly not to students that like very structured classes.",
    "I would highly recommend it, yes. I'd say it's a great introduction to how the mind works, and allows you to get a fast of many different topics you could study at Yale. The work is slightly less than a lot of classes but it is never busy work. Everything we read is very relevant to the topic we are discussing in class. The professor is engaging, excited about what he is teaching, well-rehearsed, and really illuminates the different topics. Overall, a fantastic class.",
    "Intro course where you do a lot of big picture thinking. I would recommend the course, but you may want to begin in credit d. If you enjoy classes that are more structured\/have structured lectures with clear take away points, this class may frustrate you. I found it difficult to sit through class when I wasn't sure what to write down in my notes as significant or where the lecture was going.",
    "Cognitive Science is a good class and a good introduction to cognitive science. It covers the basic areas of cognitive science in an interesting way. The tests also mostly focus on comprehension instead of memorization, which is nice. The grading is fairly easy, since we have reading questions that are graded easily.",
    "This class is a double edged sword. Cool to learn, disastrous exams",
    "Intro to Cog Sci is a great survey course for a very unique subject taught at Yale. I would highly recommend the course to any student, on the condition that they strongly considering taking the course credit-d-fail. The class itself does not have much work (bi-weekly reading responses for the most part) but exams can be pretty difficult (not much is done on the part of the professor - if you do not actively seek out help - to prepare students for exams). Nevertheless, it's a really interesting subject and Prof Scholl is a funny and super engaging lector.",
    "I'd recommend it for anyone who liked Pysch 110 and wants to get another introductory type course in the realm of cognitive science.",
    "Intro to Cog Sci was a very informative and interesting overview of Cog Sci. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Cog Sci, or just hoping to take an interesting class that will add a new perspective to ourselves and our lives.",
    "Difficult",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who has an interest in cognitive science or psychology. In fact, I think this is an interesting course for all students in general, whether they are humanities majors or engineering majors. The material is very fascinating and relevant to us as humans.",
    "Great survey course, very easy",
    "Not necessarily. The lectures were too long that after 50 minutes it was too hard to focus on the material.",
    "There's nothing \"bad\" about this course except that Professor Scholl spends a ridiculous amount of time stroking his own ego or showing gratuitous pictures of his daughter instead of actually teaching important information. Beyond that, the course is fairly easy. The readings are short and often you can complete the reading questions without closely looking at the readings. It is a fascinating study and I find myself applying things I've learned in the class to everyday life all the time.",
    "CogSci was a really cool course that I found interesting, interactive, and fun to attend. Professor Scholl keeps the class interesting even through the less interesting topics, but in general, everything we studied was interesting. It was challenging at times because of the breadth of material, but because it is interesting studying isn't bad and there are a lot of available resources if you need help or want to go further with the subject. Definitely a great class to take whether or not you are interested in CogSci.",
    "I felt as though it was a moderately mediocre class. Worth taking if you want a survey of the various sciences that make up the singular cognitive science; certainly not a \"must-take\" course. There are some awesome revelatory moments, though, and you do learn and metacognate a lot\u00e2\u0080\u0094two great elements. I was glad to have taken it.",
    "A fantastic intro course! If you are even remotely interested in the mind and how it works, then this class worth taking as soon as possible. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in doing research on campus, in cognitive science or related fields, this class will get you to start thinking about what exactly that might mean. It has certainly opened my mind about the various opportunities that exist on campus, and even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a cog sci major, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m now thinking differently about my academic goals. Do keep in mind that this class requires that you go to lecture. For the most part, the exams are really a test of how well you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve internalized everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been said in lecture.",
    "It was interesting and a great introduction the human mind and human nature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class regardless of whether you're interested in majoring in CogSci or not. The material is really exciting- the readings are real scientific papers about what is actually going on in the world of Cognitive Science. The workload isn't bad and I ended up getting a lot out of the course.",
    "If you're vaguely interested in the subject, at least shop this class. Prof. Scholl's lecture style is amazing, and the guest lectures are great too. I looked forward to each lecture, uncovering new mysteries of the mind each time. The scientific articles and reading questions are annoying (perhaps unnecessary), but thankfully they aren't too time-consuming. You'll have to read a lot of science to pass this class, but it's not all too terrible.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course. The topics were really interesting and you learn a lot about current research that you will think about everyday.",
    "It is a great class to take Credit\/D. I'm a senior majoring in computer science and was looking for something different outside of my CS classes. Intro Cog Sci ended up being the chill but interesting class that I needed. There are reading responses due every lecture but they're quite laid back. The only other work needed was a short paper and two midterms. It's a good class for someone looking for an easy fifth or sixth credit.",
    "Take it if you are a social-science\/humanities person, and if you do not want to spend much time on the subject. But since the midterm, final, and final paper count for so much of the grade, don't mess one up or it'll be hard to raise your grade up.",
    "... Easily one of the worst classes I've taken here at Yale. The information presented in the class is shallow and unsubstantial. During the 9 weeks I was actually in the class, I came out having learned very little. I dropped the class on principle because it was borderline worthless. I'm happyI can evaluate the class to try and warn the 100's of students who will jump in thinking it will be remotely enjoyable.The grading is not systematic across the TAs and is arbitrary if you actually try to explain your answers. However, if you write the buzz words, with no explanation, you will get the question correct. Straight from the TAs themselves. No critical thinking necessary.Furthermore, if you prefer a professor who argues that it is impossible to define the word \"paint\", that no one should have to learn calculus if you aren't going to be a mathematician, and are unable to answer simple questions about English grammar that have to do with the examples he used in the class, then this may be the class for you. Brian Scholl may one of the most clueless people I have ever seen in my life. Having told us that he almost failed Cognitive Science when he took it in college, he hasn't improved much since then.",
    "CGSC 110 is an overview of the themes and domains of cognitive science, the study of the human brain. Itwas without a doubt the most entertaining class I took this semester, and I would absolutely recommend it without reservation to literally everyone. The workload is quite reasonable: the reading questions are thought-provoking, the exams are fine, and the final paper is an opportunity to explore interesting thoughts about cogsci. Do it.",
    "I would not recommend the course to another student. It does not count for a QR. It is a semi-difficult amount of work, oftentimes confusing, and overall just frustrating class.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. I thought the material was extremely interesting, and it covered a wide variety of topics. This strength could also be viewed as a weakness, however, because we couldn't cover every lecture in the initial syllabus. Overall this was a fantastic course that I would highly recommend to other students. Attend every lecture and take good notes, because it's impossible to follow the slides without being present in the class. Brian Scholl was one of my favorite professors. He's a dynamic lecturer and is obviously very knowledgable about the field. He kept class interesting and engaged despite the large number of students, and he has a great collection of sweater vests.",
    "This class is entirely what you make of it. You can get by without doing all of the readings for sure, but if you read them all you will learn a whole lot more and the class becomes a lOT more interesting. Make sure to stay on top of the Reading Questions, even with the two free passes that you get, because that's an easy A to earn for your final grade. The class, because it is providing an overview of the entire field of Cognitive Science, does not go into too much detail for certain topics, so at times the class can feel a bit disconnected. There are only three main assessments: a midterm and a final (which only covers 2nd half of the course), and a \"thought paper\" in which you discuss the real world applications of an area of cognitive science for 7-8 pages. Make sure you run your topic by your TF - the assignment can be a little annoying. That said, Professor Scholl is a great lecturer and the material is really fascinating, and does provide a nice overview of all the different ways you can study that really cool thing called our brain.",
    "YES. Take this class. You will not regret it. It is not very hard and will keep you very entertained.",
    "most definitely would recommend it, take this if you are interested in how the mind works (not on a molecular level, but on a more broad cognitive level). one of, if not my favorite, courses at yale. some of what you learn is very applicable to life as well",
    "Yes I would.",
    "This course is a broad survey of the many areas of cognitive science. As a result, you do not go into great depth in any one area, but you really do learn what cognitive science is all about and the key ideas it explores. I thought the class was excellent, and I really enjoyed it. I absolutely loved the lectures. Brian Scholl is an awesome, engaging, and sincere professor. It was my favorite class this semester, and I would say definitely take it. A lot of the haters claim it's useless, but haters will be haters. I think the material is relevant to so many areas of everyday life, and you will find yourself thinking about the concepts you learn as they repeatedly pop up outside of the classroom.",
    "As a psych major, you probably have to take this class, and I would recommend it, because you learn about interesting perspectives on how the mind works that aren't totally psych-centered. However, this might also get annoying if you are mostly interested in the psychology part of cog sci, since we spend a lot of time on things like computer science, linguistics, etc. As a non psych major I would also recommend it because it's just interesting! It's mot easy, but you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "Intro to Cog Sci is a fairly interesting course that serves as a survey to the ideas of cognitive science. Obviously if you're already considering the cog sci major, take this course. If you don't really know what it is, but you like learning about things you've never thought about before, or you want to know more about how the mind works, this could be a good choice. Also, it's a pretty easy SO, especially if you're a science major since a lot of the class is reading scientific literature.",
    "Strongly recommend as a solid introductory course with lots of engaging material.",
    "This is an introductory cognitive science class that touches on a number of the interdisciplinary aspects of cognitive science including linguistics, modularity, computer science, perception and the cognitive science of animals. I would recommend this course because it exposes the student to a variety of topics that can be explored further in other courses at Yale. Though it's unlikely that you'll find all topics covered in Cog Sci 110 interesting, it's not uncommon to find yourself undeniably fascinated with a subject, which makes the class worth it.",
    "It overlaps with PSYCH 110 so pick one and stick with it.",
    "A whirlwind tour of the field. Take it with Scholl if you can, he is a talented lecturer and clearly wants you to be fascinated by cognitive science. You don't go into much depth on most of the topics discussed, as a result of the number of topics covered. The readings are all news articles or scientific papers, which can be really cool, but can also be confusing. Exams weren't bad at all, and definitely start the final paper early. Overall, I would recommend it.",
    "Very diverse amounts of information, learned a LOT. Very on the surface and nothing in depth since each lecture is pretty much also taught as its own course.",
    "A must-take coarse.",
    "Survey course on really interesting topics. Attending lecture and taking good notes is important, as there is no textbook and the slides posted are mere skeletons of what is discussed in lecture. Not too much work -- just a midterm, final, and paper. Plus, the final is during reading week so you'll be done with the class early. Great concepts taught in this class that are interesting to people no matter what your major.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. I took it because I need a social science credit. As a senior, I've taken a lot of humanities and a lot of science, but very little in between. Cog sci was as sciency as I could get while still staying in the social science category. He assigns research papers from Nature and stuff, so in that sense the course is legit. Of course, he doesn't seem to require anyone to have actually understood the scientific principles behind the research so that's a little annoying. But overall it was an easy class and I recommend it. It's full of freshmen, which isn't a bad thing, but just something to keep in mind. Prof. Scholl is a great lecturer and I laughed out loud every now and then in class, so I doubt anyone was ever completely bored.Also the material from this class is really useful. I feel like I run into something I learned in class all the time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student, but make sure you're prepared to attend lecture every time it's offered. Also, because the exams are a little tricky, be prepared to study (with others!) and take advantage of TF office hours and extra help sessions!",
    "Take this class, take this class, take this class! This is super interesting, you will learn a lot about yourselves that you would never think about for the rest of your lives.",
    "Cognitive Science 110 01 is primarily an in class course as the majority of the information comes from within the lectures. Dr. Scholl makes lectures very interesting and engaging. The lack of text book is great because it makes readings interesting and gets rid of the \"fluff\".",
    "I would recommend Cog Sci 110 to another student, but I would warn them that the lecture style is very much in a TED Talk style. This can be engaging, but can also make it difficult to decipher which information is important and will be covered on the exam.",
    "Intro to Cog Sci is a fun and interesting course, definitely worth taking if you're looking for a large lecture with a dynamic professor. It's also a good class to take credit\/d\/fail if you just want a class that will teach you a lot but will not make it difficult for you to get a passing grade. Prof. Scholl is very funny and always makes an attempt to liven up even the somewhat boring lectures.",
    "Intro CogSci was fascinating. If you are curious about human nature and behavior, you would definitely love this class. Professor Scholl is an incredible lecturer and will keep you engaged and curious throughout the semester. The workload is very manageable. All of your reading will be articles and papers about cognitive science studies, some of which may be difficult to get through but all of which is significantly more interesting than reading a dry textbook.",
    "Cognitive Science 110 is a great survey course of the concepts that are relevant to the study of the brain. In the first third of the semester, Professor Scholl talks about many of the themes regarding the brain and then, in the rest of the semester, uses different tools and domains of cognitive science to see how these themes are implemented in the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s processes. The readings for this course do not come out of a textbook but are rather a collection of articles, book selections, and lab reports that Professor Scholl selects. Some of these are very difficult to understand, but just know that you should be familiar with the themes and results of these papers and not necessarily the methods of getting the results. Each class, you have to do brief reading responses that demonstrate your understanding of the text which take about 15 minutes to do. Besides these small assignments, there are 2 exams and a final paper. The class is very interesting, and I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in psychology or cognitive science, or anyone who wants a more profound understanding of how our minds work.",
    "Don't take it simply because Brian Scholl is a fantastic, engaging, and charismatic lecturer. Be thoughtful about the course material and determine if you actually like it, and also be wary of the confusing multiple choice questions. I wanted it to be more straightforward, and it was really frustrating to face \"Circle ALL that apply questions on the exam. Also, keep in mind that there are 2 exams, which means each exam covers a lot of course material.",
    "The fact that there is no textbook was appealing at first, but this caused the whole class to be pretty unstructured. Many lectures were very fascinating, but overall, I ended stressing a lot before the tests and paper because there was very little one could do to prepare for them. The work load is pretty small and the curve is decent, but it still is a challenge due to the unpredictability of the course.",
    "Really interesting, not too difficult course with a very manageable workload. Definitely would recommend.",
    "This is a good class overall. You learn really cool stuff but at the same time a lot of people felt like they hadn't learned anything. The tests are completely fair, not too much work.",
    "You should absolutely take this class--it's not much work and can be a lot of fun. Even if you have no interest in pursuing cogsci further, this material is so interesting to think about. I learned a number of things that changed the way I see myself and others.",
    "Great class where you learn a large variety of parts in cognitive science. It's good to read the reading given as they're pretty interesting, but they can get long.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but with a word of caution that it is not as easy as Prof Scholl thinks it is. Because the reading questions are pass-fail, it might be a good class to take Cr\/D\/Fail, but some might find it to be too much work to not do it for a grade.",
    "CogSci 101 is an intro cognitive science class that covers a vast amount of important topics in cog sci. However as it is an intro class you don't really delve that deep into any one area. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in cog sci\/ psych related stuff. It is very interesting and will definitely spark your interests in this area. However, I heard that this class and psych can be interchangeable to some extent so you may not want to take this class if you have already taken psych.",
    "If you have any interest in how the mind works, take this course!",
    "TAKE IT. you'll regret it if you don't!",
    "This class seems so promising at the beginning of the semester and only goes downhill from there. The workload is not too bad, but the tests can be confusing. They are only out of ~35 points, which are scaled up to 100, which causes simple 2-3 sentence short answers to be worth more than the \"1 point\" you can receive for them. And if you get them wrong (because there's definitely no partial credit), it really affects your score.His lectures are interesting, but there's so much information that it's hard to figure out what is actually important.",
    "To put it frankly, no I would not recommend this course. Cognitive Science is most definitely a fascinating field, and I would recommend taking a class on the subject matter, but not this one. It takes the concept of \"survey course\" to an extreme in that you get such a small glimpse into different topics that you come away from the class feeling as though you have learned very little at all. Those concepts that were most fascinating seemed to receive the least amount of attention and big picture concepts seem to take precedent over some of the nuances that make Cognitive Science so interesting. While a course like this is necessary, I feel that the class needs to be restructured and reorganized to better introduce students to Cogsci in a way that captures just how great this material is. Scholl is a good teacher, but his lecturing doesn't make up for the deficiencies inherent in the course. My advice, waitit out and take a different cogsci course with a more focused approach and it will be a lot more rewarding .",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "DEFINITELY RECOMMEND! You learn really cool things that you would never notice or learn otherwise.",
    "Yes, take this.",
    "I definitely recommend this class; it's interesting, not too much work, and the exams are pretty easy as long as you take decent notes and study them.",
    "Intro CogSci is a great course. I would certainly recommend taking it. While some survey classes are boring because they only scratch the surface of a large number of topics, this class manages to cover many topics, but still engage with the material. I loved the readings, even though they often turned out to be unnecessary to understanding the class. Scholl is a great lecturer and keeps you engaged the entire time.",
    "It is a very interesting class, but you should not expect to have learned any one thing in detail after completing the course.",
    "Good intro class, but it remains an intro class with few TAs and no section. I would recommend it as a good light workload class to possibly indicate more about a field.",
    "It's a great class to get a sense of the width and breadth of the field, but each area is only shallowly explored. The material is extremely interesting, and Professor Scholl is great.",
    "Introduction to Cognitive Science is an excellent lecture: it's well-structured, dynamic, engaging, and full of incredible studies\/experimental results. You will leave class each day with your mind blown and fixated on at least one of the things you learned, and who can ask for more than that!? No need to CR\/D this course: it's a generous curve and only has two (manageable and non-cumulative) exams, plus a paper and weekly reading responses. The reading responses mean that you have to do the reading, but there's not much of it, and it's all straight from the scientific literature (and all very carefully selected to be interesting!). Professor Scholl is a great lecturer who cares deeply about the material and his students. This course overlaps SOME (think ~7%, or about 5 minutes per lecture) with Paul Bloom's Intro Psych lecture, but not enough that you shouldn't take both! In fact, if you enjoyed IntroPsych, I can think of no better course to take than Intro to Cognitive Science: lots of similar themes here, but new studies and results that will leave you stunned. I highly recommend this course!",
    "I would without a doubt recommend this class for a fellow student. If the course description sounds at all interesting, then you will love this class. Professor Scholl is an incredible lecturer, and the material he covers is both fascinating and incredibly relevant. The way you think about the world will change slightly as you will now know why a lot of weird things that our brain does happen. The two midterms are not killers, I would describe them as tough but fair. The final paper is a lot of work and very difficult, but meet with either Professor Scholl or your TF wellin advance (at least a week) before it is due to come up with a good topic and it won't be that hard. Overall I am extremely glad I took this class and recommend it to anybody who is interested in taking it.",
    "Absolutely awful. Do NOT take this course. Tests are reiterations of high school exams, where memorization and buzzwords are everything you need. Sure, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practically no homework, but at the end of the day, I learned just about nothing. Perhaps the only lectures that weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just stories coming up with explanations of things already known were the guest lectures, and these were somewhat interesting. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a class to be wary of, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this one.",
    "The class dives into the lower portions of the umbrella subject of cognitive science.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course. You learn so much cool stuff about your brain you didn't know before. The exams aren't like Intro Psych's pure memorization exams, but test your knowledge of the theory and understanding of the concepts. Professor Scholl is just a wonderful professor, so passionate about cognitive science and all around just a great, interesting guy to talk to. You should definitely take it because you learn so much about your mind, and interesting, cool concepts you can wow your friends with.",
    "Dr. Scholl has a great sense of humor. Take the class purely for his lectures. It will be your favorite class of the semester and you will not want to ever skill lecture.",
    "Professor Scholl is a great lecturer. This class is a comprehensive overview and you will leave knowing whether or not you want to major in, or take future classes in, cognitive science. One thing is that the lectures sometimes get more funny than they are informative, but it's always an interesting class toattend.",
    "Great introductory course for the major. Professor teaches the class quite well but lacks a bit on organization. Lectures are always fun, but exams are not easy. The paper is, at least this year, very open ended so it was enjoyable to write. It's not difficult to get a good grade in this class.",
    "Great class, very interesting if you find psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy engaging. I would recommend it to anyone, even if it as credit\/D\/fail. I would definitely recommend."
