    "You can get by with not too much work and do well, but if you want to understand everything, I'm sure it would be a challenging, fun course, because the material is really really interesting.",
    "BENG 411 is an extremely interesting, low-workload course that is perfect to take if you're interested at all in medical devices, their function, and their applications. Professor Fan is clearly an expert in the field and is extremely excited about the material, always discussing ongoing projects and the like. The first midterm is pretty tricky (make sure to memorize equations), but overall a really great overview course. You should take it.",
    "BENG 411 is a low stress course that counts for bme major. Stuffs are also quite interesting if you are interested in MEMS. Lectures can be dry, but the professor is extremely nice."
