    "Fantastic course. Take this course. You will not regret it. Prof Kapustin is brilliant, helpful, insightful, passionate, and warm. If you get the opportunity, take it, especially if you like social and political theory. It's a great overview of some of the most important political theorists. This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Boris Kapustin is THE most incredible teacher I've had at Yale. Every class was filled with the perfect balance between his brilliant and insightful monologues, and the equally stimulating class discussions. The course takes a broad look at many of the most important philosophers of all time, and Kapustin does a remarkable job not just making you understand their theories, but also how they relate to each other and relate to broader movements in philosophy. I would say it is helpful to have some basis in philosophy before taking it, but I didn't and still immensely enjoyed the class and got so much out of it. If you haven't taken this class or at least another class with Kapustin before you graduate you are seriously missing out.",
    "This course is the cornerstone seminar of the major, and rightfully so; it deals with some of the great thinkers across the three disciplines and is a must-take for anyone interested in the major. It will strengthen anyone's understanding of theoretical philosophy, political science, or economics. There isn't too much reading and Professor Kapustin helps isolate the key themes\/points from each author.",
    "Most people reading this course will be EPE majors, to which my advice would not only be to take the course (as everyone should) but to take it EARLY. What you read in this course will inform your future studies. For everyone though: BK is great, and you'll be smarter for taking this course.",
    "Take it.",
    "Well, if you're an EPE major you have to take it, so take it with Kapustin. If you're not, decide whether or not you're interested in political philosophy first, because this class doesn't go ver far into modern implications of theories.",
    "Yes, definitely, even if you're not an EP&E major. I was told to take Classics with Kapustin, and that was a great decision. He's a very supportive, encouraging professor, and, while the course is challenging, it's fairly low-pressure. Much of the seminar is Kapustin delivering mini-lectures, which was really helpful, and watching him speak was like listening to a performer. Definitely go to his office hours to discuss papers--he's very helpful and encouraging. Grading is fair, it's not hard to do well if you put in the work.",
    "This is a must. Even if you are not an EP&E major, the course is definitely worth taking. The amount of work is not much besides the weekly readings. Professor Kapustin is an excellent lecturer.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to a student interested in political philosophy with a strong emphasis on philosophy."
