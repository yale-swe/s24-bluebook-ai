    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone looking for an interesting (though not gutty) non-western history course!",
    "This is one of the most interesting and important classes that I have taken at Yale thus far. In part because the slave trade is one of the ugliest blemishes on human history, and I think that everyone needs to learn about it properly. But also in part because this course will help you put trade and global interaction from 1450 to 1850 into perspective. I had never realised quite what a global world it was during this era, and I think I now have a much better understanding of how the world systems came into being. The class is a lot of work, and the information can be quite finicky, but it is worth the slog.",
    "good",
    "I would recommend it. Great class especially for the history distribution requirements. It is genuinely interesting."
