    "Andy's the man -- approachable, friendly, helpful, and willing to make time to talk to you not just about your essays but also about life in general. Favourite teacher at Yale hands down. ENGL 120's not a bad class either but if you're gonna take it, take it with Andy. I don't think he's teaching it next semester so my advice to you? Screw 120 and take whatever he's teaching. Trust me. You can thank me later.",
    "This class will definitely improve your writing, but it's not an overwhelming amount of work. You write drafts and revisions in 2-3 cycles; there are 5 essays in all. There is no emphasis on research and citation, which I liked. You'll read a lot of fascinating essays too!",
    "A great class for thinking about structure, writing a few essays and reading a lot of New Yorker articles.",
    "100 times yes. Everyone knows English 120 is a great class, so essentially it's taking the class with a good professor, and Andy is that. He knows exactly how to lead a class discussion in a non-intimidating way that still pushes the class to the important points of the essay. With your essays, he doesn't tear them apart word for word (so if that's the type of professor you are looking for Andy might not be for you), but he gives spot on analysis that finds the problems with your piece and boils it down to a couple of sentences. In addition, he is incredibly accessible. I met with him every one or two weeks, sometimes during his office hours, sometimes not.",
    "Do it if you like writing. Do it if you don't like writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 to any student. It is a great way to get a writing credit and learn how to write effective personal essays. Essentially, the course has five units, each themed with a different style of essay. You read a number of essays in the style and discuss the writing techniques for each in class, and then you write an essay in that style yourself.",
    "English 120 is a course on writing non-fiction pieces. There are 5 units, each of them having a different focus, like \"place\" and \"personal experience\". For 1 or 2 weeks, you read pieces (usually very good ones) on that theme and each unit ends with you turning in your own piece on that theme. The different topics really get you thinking in different ways and since there is no real prompt besides the general concept you can be really creative with it. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, saying that is a lot of work, but also so much fun and rewarding.",
    "The semester is split into 5 sections and in each section a different genre of writing is explored via the reading of pieces that pertain to that genre as well as writing a piece based on the genre. I would recommend it because it stretches and enhances the student's writing capabilities."
