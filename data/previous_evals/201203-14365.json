    "I don't know what Michael Korie takes before class, but I want some. I feel like my lyric writing developed considerably during this class, and I would recommend it.",
    "THST 414 is an introductory course to musical theater lyric writing, intended for aspiring lyricists of all skill levels, culminating in a semester-end concert of newly written work. I would definitely recommend the class to another student, as it is the only course of its kind at Yale, and at the very least it offers a new writing form for aspiring poets, novelists, journalists, etc.",
    "Absolutely take this class, theater studies major or not",
    "Lyric Writing is a fun and practical class-- you learn about and write songs of different forms; if I remember correctly, the first writing assignment is given in the first class. So you're creating new songs from the very beginning, and then at the end of the semester is a collaborative project with the composition and performance classes, culminating in a concert, which is very exciting (and a little bit hectic). Overall, I think this class was great as an introduction to lyric writing and I would take it again, as there were many opportunities for more advanced writers, too. Professor Korie's feedback is always constructive, and he's very easygoing and supportive of students' ideas. There is a lot of presentation of songs in class, so be prepared for that, but in general it is a lot of fun, and also really exciting to spend two hours a week learning from a working lyricist like Professor Korie."
