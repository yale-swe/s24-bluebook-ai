    "Definitely would recommend GMAN 110 for anyone looking to take a language. Annika is a great teacher and made coming to class every morning actually bearable. We were constantly involved in fun activities such as blog posts, group projects, videos, and stories. The language also is not difficult to pick up besides some of the ridiculous German grammar rules which you will get used to (not actually, der die and das is still a pain in the butt). But even with no prior German experience, GMAN 110 is totally doable for an A. The workload is not anything greater than average. If you take the class, viel Glck!",
    "This was a good class. I have no complaints. You get out what you put in. If you are thinking about taking this class: The class requires a lot of work (because it is genuinely teaching you the language and you can't learn a new language unless you use it). I would say that five hours a week outside of class is the minimum you can do and still get by. The german department has a lot of really great opportunities outside of class to do german things. There are german films shown twice a week, speaking get-togethers game hour etc which you can go to for extra credit!",
    "I would recommend German 110 to anyone who is looking for a phenomenal language experience at Yale. The professor is wonderful, and the curriculum is always interesting and challenging. You learn a wide variety of vocabulary and grammar that can be used practically in day-to-day conversations. Because my classmates and I were all beginning speakers, we formed fast friendships as we strove to learn German together. The round-table classroom setup really adds to the camaraderie.",
    "German 110 is what you would expect from an L1 language class, except that the German department is way cooler than any of the other departments.",
    "German L1 is a fun, interactive class where you learn a lot of new grammar in a short span of time. I would recommend this class to anyone who's interested in learning a new language without too much stress.",
    "It is a fairly standard introductory language class that is well paced and has a solid curriculum. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in the German language or German culture as it provides a pretty comprehensive overview of both.",
    "If you are interested in learning German, definitely take it! I took it Credit\/D\/Fail, so I cannot reliably vouch for what it would have been like in terms of workload to take it with maximum effort (as in, I didn't complete many of the homework assignments). The one thing I wish they would change significantly about the course is requiring more speaking practice.",
    "German 110 is a basic introduction to German, including German vocabulary, grammatical structures, and culture. At first it's a little intimidating to take a class that is taught exclusively in German, but I found it much easier to develop my knowledge of German by being immersed in the language for the entirety of each class. You will learn a lot of new vocabulary and a basic understanding of German grammar."
