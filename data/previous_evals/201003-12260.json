    "I highly recommend rhetoric and political order to any student interested in a humanities course. I had never much thought or studied rhetoric or political order and found the seminar exciting and engaging nearly every time. The readings were quite fun, though a bit difficult at times, but always worth doing. This class definitely improved my ability to analyze texts and added a new dimension to the manner in which I do so. If you're considering this class, definitely shop it at least!",
    "Yes I would recommend the course - as long as you have a solid foundation in Greek philosophy and are interested by a discussion of rhetoric.",
    "Highly recommended. The reading is amazing, and you will learn to read and understand books that you might think you already know in totally new ways. Also, Prof. Thompson is just a great teacher, whatever the subject.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in doing any of this reading or just want a fun (but challenging) seminar. Definitely shop it at least.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it for someone interested in exploring the rhetoric of the some works. However, I would not recommend it for someone who is interested in looking at some of the foundations of Western rhetoric with a critical eye...Prof. Thompson is not interested in hearing why you dislike Lincoln or Burke.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to someone else, as long as he\/she is willing to spend a fair amount of time studying the reading before each class. Without doing this, it is hard to follow the discussion (like any seminar).",
    "Rhetoric and Political Order was a great class. I wish we had focused on political order in our discussions a little more often though. Professor Thompson really knows her stuff and is a great discussion leader. The class attracts some great minds and the readings for the most part are exciting. It is a great opportunity to study rhetoric, which is, in my opinion, an important part of analyzing texts which often goes unnoticed. Professor Thompson breaks down the reading loads so that it is not too overwhelming and the essay assignments are fun and fair.",
    "Take it, if it looks like you're getting a good collection of students.",
    "Amazing seminar with a brilliant teacher."
