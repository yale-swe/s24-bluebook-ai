    "interesting stuff, but a substantial amount of work. should honestly be a 400-level seminar, for the amount of work that's involved. nordhaus is kind of boring, even though he is one of the foremost researchers in this field. take only if you're very interested in the subject matter, and definitely don't make this a 5th class.",
    "An incredibly average economics course. If you liked how Nordhaus taught Intermediate Macro then maybe you will like this course. Personally, I often felt confused on what was expected of me, and found lectures pretty dull.",
    "Provides a taste of a variety of topics in environmental economics, one of which you'll explore in greater depth in a 15 page paper. Prof. Nordhaus finds elegant, simple ways to explain difficult concepts and is accessible, through exam review sessions and office hours.",
    "The class shows you how to evaluate the economic impacts of current resource use on future climate change through model building. I would recommend it, especially since Nordhaus is THE man for this field of study.",
    "A good primer on the economics behind energy and climate change. The lectures are solid, but the class works on a very high level so the details are often hand-waved away. The problem sets involve Excel modelling which can be a little time-consuming and difficult to get right, especially because some of the wording in the problem sets is not entirely clear. The final paper can be a little rough at the end of the semester, especially if you don't get a good idea on what to write on until late in the game. The exams are fair and not too difficult, especially because the professor provides a lot of study material.",
    "Econ 331 is a great class and one in which you will learn a lot about climate change economics and possible futures. Professor Nordhaus an amazing guy who is both immensely intelligent and also approachable (as long as you come prepared to have an intelligent discussion with him). He is clearly passionate about his field, and has a talent for breaking down complex discussions into simple problems in order to highlight what is important. As an econ major, I think you should have the intermediate micro\/macro background he recommends - otherwise, I think the class would be unpleasantly challenging. The course consists of lectures 2-3 times a week (you should attend the optional lectures if you want to stay on top of the class), ~7 problem sets, a midterm exam, a final exam, and a final 15 page paper on a climate change topic of your choice. The problem sets vary in difficulty but are manageable if you devote enough time to them and learn how to use Excel solver well. Nordhaus' lectures are engaging and fun, and the workload is fairly light until finals period, when we had the last pset, the final paper (30% of the grade), and the final exam (also 30%) all due within 12 days of each other. This brought a very stressful close to an otherwise amazing class. If the weighting or timing of these final assignments changes for the better, then I have absolutely no reservations recommending Econ 331 as one of my favorite classes at Yale."
