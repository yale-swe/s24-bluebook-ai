   "comments": [
    "Greatly enhanced my knowledge of probability and mathematical statistics",
    "The theory behind econometric techniques and more advanced probability theory",
    "It is a graduate level course. I helps you gain a complete foundation of metrics. It was an extremely useful course for learning the fundamentals of probability and the common statistical tools (confidence intervals, hypothesis testing). It gives a much clearer understanding of estimation methods (ML, GMM) and, it connected several concepts that were sort of divided in my head.",

   "comments": [
    "Lot of material covered; but class is not engaging and a twoway conversation at all.",
    "I felt that the lectures did not add much value to my learning.",
    "This course is very thorough. The lecture notes provided to the class are clear and detailed. One weakness is that it seems to try to cover a little too much in too short a time. In particular, it would be helpful to move through convergence in distribution and point estimation at a slightly slower pace given how important they are, but I wouldn't want to move any faster on the other topics.",
    "Prof. Andrews clearly has very high expectations for the rigour of our answers, justifying all of our steps in our work, etc. But we got no substantial feedback on our problem sets and we had no worked examples or homework solutions. This was frustrating as I felt I had to learn a better standard of work without getting feedback or seeing examples of what that standard looked like.",
    "The greatest strength is Prof. Andrews! He is such a thoughtful educator and does a great job leading the class. The notes were well-prepared, which makes the content clear. The explanation are also concrete and good-to-understand if you read them a few times. Although the course workload is high, it helps you to better digest the contents. The notes are the treasures.",
    "Poor alignment of learning and course structure.",
    "The course is very compact but sometimes disconnected; the measure theoretic framework developed early on in the course is not retained throughout",
    "The handouts were absolutely excellent. I didn't think the lectures were very useful, however, as it's not particularly engaging to just watch proofs being done on the board. In general (and this is coming from someone that believes to have performed well in the course), I think the course focuses far too much on memorizing often unintuitive and frankly dull proofs, while transferring little economic intuition. I often simply found myself being very bored while revising, as I was not learning any new content (as the level of econometrics is the same as most undergraduate courses, and arguably below most master level ones) but instead spending all my time memorizing algebra that I would forget the day after the exam anyways. That being said, I did really appreciate the time spent talking about the history of the subject during the lectures.",
    "Problem sets could be rather tedious at times",
    "Lecture notes were good, but I found the lectures themselves were often hard to follow. There also was not much feedback on problem sets.",
    "No weakness at all. Prof. Andrews is an excellent professor in teaching. Very clear and self-contained notes",
    "Great overview over the theoretical basic concepts of econometrics"

    "Yes to those who want to get a complete idea about the foundations of metrics. It is a graduate level course and fast-paced to those who are not familiar with the concepts. But you will learn a lot once you go through it.",
    "Yes, but dont take the assignments at face value. Learn the material first.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any student pursuing a PhD in economics, because it is required for the PhD in economics.",
    "Absolutely, perfect for students who want to have a solid fundation in econometrics",
    "Yes, if you need to learn basics of econometrics on a high level"
