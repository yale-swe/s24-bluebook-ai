   "comments": [
    "Take this course!!! It's so interesting and you can't find a problem with learning about gypsies.",
    "Worth taking -- the material is absolutely fascinating and Stone Sweet is chill and interesting. Start your final paper sooner than I did.",
    "This class is extremely interesting. Professor Stone Sweet is an expert in comparative law and will provide you with a fascinating semester filled with Indians, cowboys, pirates, and gypsies. You will look at how each group governs itself on the margins of society and how each group resolves internal disputes. If you care anything about comparative law, take this class! Though the term paper is kind of a bear - roughly 20 pages - if you like Poli Sci seminars, you've probably done this before and if you haven't (like me), you can definitely manage it! Professor Stone Sweet is really helpful in the paper writing process, too!",
    "It's unclear what you actually learn in this class, but Stone Sweet is hilarious and you definitely come away with a better understanding of dispute resolution.",
    "Alec Stone Sweet has a pretty incredible range of careers and hobbies, and this course covers most of them. Aside from Alec being awesome I'd recommend the course because it covers ground most political science courses don't cover--it'll make you think about questions like what norms are, what they do, how they work independent of formal legal systems, etc. If you're going to be put off by covering 3-5 totally disparate cases (Gypsies, hobos, pirates, cattle ranchers...), don't take the course. The reading load is pretty light, but I had a hard time coming up with a relevant final paper topic.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you are able.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if Professor Stone Sweet is offering it again in the future.",
    "Really interesting and different kind of Yale\/Political Science class. Be expected to work because your fellow classmates will. Stone-Sweet is super awesome and interesting.",
    "The course in interesting, though it may seem unstructured at some points in time. Professor Stone Sweet has a fascinating background and does a decent job of leading seminar. He does, however, appear to have his favorites (i.e. his past students) when it comes to discussion.",
    "Take this class! Never again will you have the opportunity to study pirates, hobos, gypsies, cowboys, etc. It was well worth taking. Alec is a great professor who likes to go on to really long tangents about the constitution and American legal system and I would have taken the course just to listen to him talk for two hours.If you don't have some sort of grounding in economics, political theory, or law, it might be a bit tough to keep up with. And the professor definitely favors some students. But the course is fascinating overall. I learned more in this class than I did in my entire historical\/political education up until this point. You cover economics, game theory, comparative politics, law, anthropology, and more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any and everyone."
