    "For this class, come with a really open mind. You will be challenged - even if you have done ethnomusicological reading before. Be prepared to ask questions from a new vantage point - that will be the most productive way to approach this course. What something like hybridity really is, is much harder than it seems on the surface. Give the concept of hybridity the depth of critical thinking that it deserves.",
    "Hybridity was a really interesting class. It explored questions that are pretty relevant to musical performance of any kind - what kinds of influences go into musical genres and performance practices, and what do they mean? How do their meanings differ for their performers and their audiences, intended and unintended? What makes a performance \"authentic\" vs. \"hybrid\" and why do our ears hear music deconstructively sometimes and not other times? The discussion was at a high level yet also relaxed. Great class.",
    "Musical and Cultural Hybridity is a survey of the concept of hybridity in relation to genres of popular music from different parts of the world and in connection with social and political issues including identity and colonization. I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in studying music outside of the canon of Western art music, because it covers several topics that are essential for understanding non-Western music in relation to European and American music and scholarship, as well as introducing a variety of non-Western musical repertories."

   "comments": [
    "Although tangentially related to what I might do my dissertation on, the framing of questions in this course was invaluable in the long run.",
    "I am an undergraduate majoring in music and international studies. I am particularly interested in their intersection in ethnomusicology, so for me, the course was very interesting and explored many issues that will be critical for my consideration, particularly as the world becomes a more globalized, and therefore, explicitly hybrid, place.",
    "The content of this course is not essential to my discipline, in the sense that it would be possible to study musicology successfully without addressing the topics that the course covers. However, the study of non-Western music in relation to culture and society is very important to my own goals as a scholar and my beliefs about how the discipline would ideally be oriented, and the course might well contribute significantly to my dissertation or other research and teaching.",
