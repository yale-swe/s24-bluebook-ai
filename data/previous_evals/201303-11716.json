   "comments": [
    "Lectures are dry, but if you just read the textbook you can understand most of the material really well.",
    "Would recommend this course but with another professor. You'll probably learn more and enjoy it.",
    "yes, but only if you need it for a major requirement",
    "One key concept is introduced in each lecture, essentially, so they are important to attend. The material is not too hard and the workload is moderate. Some lectures were boring but others more interesting and important. What you would expect from an intro macro lecture.",
    "If you want to take it just for fun; don't!",
    "Econ 116 is a great class; the problem sets are reasonable, and the material is all presented well in the lectures and textbooks.",
    "BORING",
    "If you are not an economics major I would not take this class. Lectures are rough to sit through and pay attention and the work isn't very interesting.",
    "Try to take the class without Prof. Fair. I found it tough to focus during lectures and as a result, found myself not going. Definitely more interesting than micro, but try and find someone else to take it with.",
    "would recommend taking the seminar, but that's just me. would probably be better taught.",
    "The more theoretical approach that Ray Fair took really gave me a good working knowledge of the macroeconomy. Now I can see things in the news and understand what that means in terms of the different markets. Great class.",
    "It's as interesting as an intro econ lecture could be, but that's a decidedly low bar.",
    "It didn't really do much for me. I just had to read the textbook. The material though was very up to date so it was somewhat relevant. But it is an intro class, so not that detailed.",
    "Necessary and useful but not great.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not the most gripping class you will ever take, but it's really important stuff and Fair does a good job with it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a basic understanding of the macro economy. The content was actually quite interesting and you leave the class with a good intuition of how the economy works at large, but the class was heavily conceptual with very few (if any) computations.",
    "a good step for an econ major",
    "This class is really boring, but that's to be expected from Intro Macro. Ray Fair isn't great -- he's especially boring and doesn't do a good job of explaining pretty much anything. If you can, take this class with a different professor.",
    "A great course in that the subject material comes together extremely well. However, beware that Prof. Fair is a pretty boring lecturer. He is an extremely distinguished academic and I am in awe of that. However, his lectures were quite frankly pretty boring. That being said I recommend the class overall in that I liked the subject material for giving a great overview to macroeconomics.",
    "Good Class. Recommend to non-Econ majors over Intro Micro. Lecture is pointless but the book is good",
    "This is the worst course I have ever taken. Ray Fair is absolutely dreadful, and you will not get nearly enough out of this that warrants taking it. Really bad.",
    "Macroeconomics is a good basic course. It provides you with a good foundation of the broader concepts in economics. I would recommend this course to a fellow student. The problem sets are easy, the midterm and final are challenging but manageable. Overall, the course has a very manageable amount of work, as it only requires one weekly problem set that usually only takes a few hours.",
    "Economics at a larger scale, looking mostly at the interactions between government, the fed, firms, households, and other countries.",
    "Teaching could be improved with more detailed slides. A lot of people did not show up to lecture because they were not getting much out of it. People just choose to read the book and learn on their own.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Definitely take macro at some point in your Yale career--it's fundamentally useful in life and also a requirement if you're an econ major--but do not, absolutely do not, take it with Ray Fair. Lectures are mind-numbingly boring, the powerpoint slides are confusing and disjointed, the midterm and final are ridiculously difficult. Fair does not decide the curve until the end of the semester (ie after you've taken the final), so grades are a complete shot in the dark. There's nothing good about this course, and I strongly recommend that you do not take it.",
    "I wouldnt recommend it. If you are looking to learn more about the economy, reading the front page of a financial website will teach you just as well if not better.",
    "very easy, very basic, good enough intro to keynesian macro, shallow discussion of alternative viewpointswithout independent intellectual engagement, you will be bored out of your mind",
    "This class was fine- lecture can be boring at times, but the subject matter is interesting and presented in a mostly understandable way. Ray Fair clearly knew the subject matter well, but didn't always explain it in a straightforward way. Lecture could be dry and repetitive, but was usually very relevant to the tests and made reading mostly unnecessary. Take it if you have to or are interested in a non-micro side to economics.",
    "Good survey course. The textbook is really good but not necessary. This course is definitely recommended.",
    "A thorough introduction to the US and global economy - Prof. Fair does a good job of making sure you learn the models behind the facts you learn, so macro becomes an exercise of inference as opposed to one of memorization.",
    "Take it for your major and if you want to start understanding what the newspapers are talking about everyday in the Business section. Take it if you want to know more about macroeconomics. Take if you can live going through extremely unstimulating lectures and reading the textbook to confirm what you heard in lectures, simply because you're not sure what the professor really said because his sentences got strung together 50% of the time. That said, I would say half of the lectures were informative and tolerable.",
    "Econ 116 is a basic outline of the AS\/AD model for the functioning of the macroeconomy, as well as how it interacts with the global economy. The first half of the semester is building up the model for the domestic case, and the second half focuses on integrating that model into the global economy, with some other models and theories mixed in. I would highly recommend this course to another student no matter what their major is because the foundations for understanding the US and similar economies is explained and it makes you an informed consumer of information and news. Given how much media attention is given to the economy these days, its more important than ever to have a basic understanding of the issues being discussed and this course covers the basics.",
    "I would recommend this class. If you plan on taking it, go to lectures. A lot of what ends up on the exams and on the problem sets comes from the lectures.",
    "Intro Macro is definitely a course worth taking. It's not going the be the most amazing class you've ever been in, but it will give you a basic understanding of how the macroeconomy works\u00e2\u0080\u0094a pretty important concept in today's day and age. Ray is not a bad lecturer. He can be a little dry at times, but he tries his best. He always makes an attempt to tie the material of the day to current events, which helps keep things interesting. If you're on the fence, I'd say take it.",
    "It's very useful for understanding what's going on in the news, economically and politically. Ray Fair is actually not bad at all; he clearly cares about the class and made some changes this year geared towards improving clarity and getting students more excited about macroeconomics.",
    "Take it if you're in the major, or need it for another major, but don't take it for fun. Economics are pretty important to know, but this class isn't going to be the most exciting way to learn it. It's sort of the class that's okay if you do well in it, but it can be frusterating if you're struggling.",
    "I would recommend Econ 116 to any student who wants to learn how economics and the government are related. This class really increased my understanding of fiscal and monetary policies. Fair is extremely dry in lecture. I stopped going to class after the second week because I kept falling asleep. However, the textbook is super helpful and before the midterm I was able to learn all the material after reading the required chapters.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are planning to major in Econ since you need it",
    "Very good.",
    "I would recommend this course if you must take Econ 116 as a prerequisite. If you don't have to, then I wouldn't take this course.",
    "The course was definitely an easy but interesting introduction to how our economy works and how it may be regulated. Workload was lower than in some classes that are considered guts.Fair's lecture style is pretty boring and it is hard to listen to what he says for more than half an hour, but it isn't really necessary to go to lectures anyway. Pset are easy and the solutions can all be found online since Fair usually uses the same questions each year. To get through midterms and finals it is totally sufficient to read the textbook.",
    "Definitely taught me terms that I feel like every student should graduate knowing. I learned a lot about fiscal and monetary policy, but the class wasn't as exciting as it could be.",
    "Good class for those interested in Econ. Don't go to lecture, but read everything in the textbook and go to section. Easy enough.",
    "1. In case you're wondering, it's worth waiting another semester to take intro macro. 2. This class is horrible.",
    "would not reccomend. find someone to take it with other than Fair",
    "Would NOT recommend this class with Ray Fair. Perhaps with a different professor.",
    "Really not a bad course. Eminently manageable course load, relevant topics, useful detours into finance. Not sure I'd recommend it to someone for whom it isn't a requirement, but if you're interested in business cycles and recessions, give it a shot in shopping period. I liked Professor Fair butI can see why a lot of people found the lectures a bit dull...",
    "If a student has an interest in the course then they should by all mean take it but if there is no true interest I think it would be better to choose a different course."
