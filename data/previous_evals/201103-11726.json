   "comments": [
    "A class for those who have some background in cultural, race studies and want to grasp the movement through artistic, literary movements.",
    "nice class with readings that you won't get to do anywhere else, ESPECIALLY in the English dept. Take it!",
    "A course that looks at how various minorities deal with cultural conflicts\/boundaries\/the search for identity in America. I would recommend the course - you cover an extremely broad range of subjects, learn more about American history, and get to engage in some really interesting, eye-opening conversations.",
    "If you want to be sorely disappointed and waste 200,000 dollars, don't take a class with GerShun. Otherwise, you should devise any plan necessary to take his class.",
    "This is the perfect example of what an interdisciplinary course should be. It ties together history, literature, cinema, and art through the critical lens of culture and gender. A great English seminar for someone who wants to do more than just English. Plus, Professor Avilez is amazing. As an Amstud major, this was a great class to take my senior year. Highly recommended.",
    "For those looking to take it as a junior English seminar, it's definitely not a traditional English class, but that's a really good thing. You get to read stuff that's not poetry by old dead white men! And you get to talk about it in a way that's relevant to your life - to talk about the things that you liked, and that you found interesting, not just the stuff that the professors find to be technically or stylistically brilliant. That stuff is all well and good, but it's a nice break. You might miss close textual analysis - it did annoy me that sometimes people would go a whole class discussing a book without ever pointing to a relevant passage - but it's worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The discussions were stimulating and I liked the texts.",
    "Take it! This was a great interdisciplinary course that would appeal to both English majors and those in the social sciences with a reading list full of works you might not otherwise read. Additionally, GerShun leads discussion well and is extremely approachable.",
    "This class was a good experience, though it is a lot more work than you might bargain for. There was essentially one novel\/play and\/or primary text each week, making for an insane amount of work for just this one class. However, this is one class that brings together conversations about pop culture and mid 20th century activism in a way you don't get in any other class. Professor Avilez is wonderful and a pleasure to have once a week. Not one of the best classes I've taken in terms of subject matter, but I enjoyed having Professor Avilez more than most.",
    "American Literary Nationalisms was an awesome seminar with an even more awesome professor. In this class, we took a very academically stimulating look at some incredibly engaging and diverse texts, ranging from Martin Luther King Jr.'s Letter from a Birmingham Jail to David Henry Hwang's M. Butterfly. Professor Avilez juxtaposed sometimes similar and sometimes seemingly very different works under a new, overarching theme each week, and those themes meant new and exciting intellectual challenges each week. Looking at the works through so many different lenses is a skill that I brought to bear on other classes during the same semester because it was so useful. The professor himself is incredible - he was able to alternately elevate our discussions with new academic\/theoretical terms and bring in super recent and super applicable pop culture references. The seminar was very popular, so be sure to make the first meeting. And even if you don't get in, check out the reading list for some fantastic fiction and non.",
    "This is a great class.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student at Yale who is interested in how minorities have been represented and have worked to represent themselves in the United States. Professor Avilez always keeps class interesting and the work ranges from analyzing popular music videos, to watching broadway shows and of course reading some interesting novels in between. Professor Avilez is committed and understanding and always a joy to learn from."
