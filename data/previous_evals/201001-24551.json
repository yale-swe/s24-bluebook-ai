    "Again, the course was sort of a hodgepodge of feelings and film and whatever else, but I found it a relief from the typical Yale course. If you loved the films you'd love talking about them. If you need to be entertained, look elsewhere.",
    "This is a great class if you have any interest in experimental cinema, because it exposes you to a lot of material that you wouldn't necessarily come across otherwise (some are only on 16mm film). Professor Francis is very knowledgeable and also chill--there are weekly screenings and reading responses but we only had to do two 5-page papers. I learned so much and it was a fun experience, I highly recommend it!",
    "Great opportunity to look at films that you would otherwise never have access too. I would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "It's probably good to get an overview of experimental film and filmmakers in order to have a more well-rounded knowledge of film in general. But be warned, many of these films are pretty painful to sit through.",
    "This is a good 5th class but I wouldnt suggest it as something too serious"
