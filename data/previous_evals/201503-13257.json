    "There is no box for evaluating TAs. My section was frustrating; most of the conversation in section happened between loud white males, and the TA was not responsive to my feedback in this regard.",
    "It was a really useful class and it was fun. Not a ton of work at ALL but space to think",
    "Like the discussion",
    "Could have been really fascinating if we'd talked about new issues but we just rehashed all the classic \"ethical\" issues like prostitution",
    "fine. didn't really learn much. discussions were interesting",
    "The timing of this course is terrible Ethics is very important and the discussion topics were quite interesting but it should be held at a different time and should be focused on the discussion groups not the large group in Winslow",
    "The course was fine but I would have preferred that we spend more time with Dr. Khoshnood or guest lecturers, like Dr. Baranski. The student-led groups were not as substantive.",
    "good class. short and to the point. facilitated good discussion and got me thinking more about the important ethical issues I may face in the field of public health. very informative.",
    "I would love if the course had additional lecture from an expert in the field, such as the professor, instead of extensive discussion time with people's random opinions that are not research based at all.",
    "Seminar was fine. It was only the month of November and the topics covered were interesting.",
    "I would love to see a greater focus on the importance of ethics and leadership in this course. With no grade or even a P\/F status, the institution seems to be indicating that ethics is not a relevant topic to include in our curriculum. Furthermore, as public health practitioners, we should be at the forefront of transformative change and leaders within our community, grounded in ethics and social justice. I hope that our institution will emphasize ethics and leadership as important characteristics in the holistic education of public health students.",
    "",
    "strength: the small groups weakness: on friday afternoons",
    "Strengths: the course gives students a platform to voice their opinions, whether it be the assigned topics or classroom discussion. It really brings awareness to issues in public health. Weaknesses: too short of a seminar. Also, very big breakout groups made some people more shy.",
    "provide tough issue to arise thinking. inspiring.",
    "I thought that this course was excellent. I appreciated the small size of the breakout groups",
    "I don't believe that this course was worth my time. It was an incredibly shallow overview of ethics with minimal depth. The discussions seemed empty and the guidance was very surface level. Doing the ethics and humans research training was beneficial as it saved me time later on.",
    "not valuable. TAs not prepared or knowledgeable on their assigned discussions. could easily have been completed in online format.",
    "I feel that taking the two online training courses is sufficient enough for this class. I did not learn anything new that I didn't already know about bioethics by attending the seminars.",
    "This seminar is hard to evaluate because they apparently change it every year. But you have to take it unless you can waive out and no one that could waive out of any course would elect not to. The topics of each seminar were incredibly interesting and the professor very engaging, but in our breakout sections where we spent the most time, basically three people did all the talking and the rest sat silently. Plus, I felt like nothing was achieved since we just spent the entire time arguing - I know there aren't any \"correct\" answers for ethical questions, but I could have (and have) gotten the same results from debating friends in a bar.",
    "interesting course\/covers some interesting topics we were only notified about this course well into the semester and many of us had already made plans on Fridays. YSPH should remember to remind their dual degree students about this class Lots of students would leave after the small group discussions which defeats the point and undermines the value of the course",
    "Strengths: -Covered very important topics. Course did the best job of connecting theoretical concepts to current events and real issues practitioners are facing. Weaknesses: -Friday afternoon and only 4 classes. Make this longer (or integrate ethics into the core curriculum more). Also, don't have it on Friday afternoon when everyone is antsy for the week to end.",
    "I thought that this course was quite well done. I didn't know what to expect from an ethics seminar, but I found the topics discussed to be relevant, interesting, and engaging. I liked that the TA's were our fellow classmates and that they had a hand in choosing what we discussed and structuring the session. I found them to be relatable and realistic. We had reasonable amount of out of class readings, and I think I gained a broader understanding of the ethical underpinnings of the decisions we make in public health.",
    "I really enjoyed the ethics seminar. Kaveh and the group of TF's he assembled really did a nice job selecting public health topics that prompted some great conversations.",
    "It was okay, not particularly great nor terrible. Weakness: 4 sessions is a lot, maybe cut it down to 2 meeting times. Did not get reading material in a timely manner.",
    "I loved it! The best part was our conversation about ethics within YSPH. It was crucial at the time, and I felt very heard. i would love to see that continued throughout the years.",
    "This course was a waste of time. Had it been an optional course over pizza it would have been a worthwhile set of informal discussions. As mandated Friday pain it is a road block.",
    "I exempted this course.",
    "Nice discussion session with different opinions",
    "The course was case based which made it very interesting. I think we could have gone a little deeper in ethics faced in public health and we could have had a little more instruction instead of only discussion.",
    "The course was a wonderful introduction to ethics in public health. I enjoyed the topic and discussions tremendously. The course could be improved by extending the course to the full semester and not having it on friday afternoons.",
    "discussions that go no where and do nothing, so sick of them",
    "i wish this was longer. or a formal class. ethics is great",
    "I liked when we had open conversations with the whole class",
    "Although motivation was difficult to find at times for a noncredit ungraded course on Friday afternoons, we covered some thought provoking topics. I found some of the case studies interesting, others not so much. Our discussions kind of got away from cases at times. It was confusing having an introduction, a case, and specific follow-up questions. I would probably simplify the case directions. Even though every class the procedural directions like where to go differed, it seemed like the communications where clear.",
    "The course was a great introduction to ethics and public health. The use of case studies was very helpful in generating discussions and thinking about ethical issues. There are no weaknesses of the course. I would like to see a more in-depth ethics course in future semesters.",
    "Weaknesses: - Please bring back the biweekly, weekday night 'Ethics Over Pizza' structure. Carving out an hour in the middle of Friday is a bit inconvenient since many of us schedule work on Fridays. - The topics and their handling were too bland. The sharing of genetic information acquired through research was the only topic that my discussion section was split on. We agreed on all the other topics and the remarks made were very 'preaching to the choir' style. Let's get some more controversial topics and student TAs who are willing to play devil's advocate for next time! - The discussion sections became too big. I felt that there were international students who had a different opinion who didn't feel it was safe to share. The student TAs did a poor job at prompting discussion and assuring students that it was a safe space to share.",
    "Went in thinking that it was going to be painful, but actually really enjoyed the discussion sections. Turned out to be a wonderful course.",
    "we never had any conclusions to the cases so it was really pointless. why teach ethics when every time we have an ethical dilemma we cant find a solution?",
    "Course was okay",
    "The articles selected for the course were very interesting; however the lectures (apart from the guest lecture on treatments of mentally ill people, which was fantastic) added very little and there was very little guidance during the group discussions.",
    "I liked the topics we chose to speak about and the small group format. I think it would be a more effective course as a \"lunch group\" type of deal where we met in small groups for four weeks over a lunch hour, spoke openly about the topics and had engaging dialog. More people would have had appreciation with a slightly less structured format.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the class and found it informative. I really liked the small group discussions and appreciated the opinions of my classmates who participated.",
    "Interesting readings, interesting discussions. Only problem was that it was on Friday afternoons.",
    "It was useful in understanding the issue of ethics in public health",
    "Truly appreciate the thought that Kaveh put into the course - I definitely agree that it is an essential part of public health that cannot be ignored. As such, I think there is a lot more room to make the course a much more important and integral part of our education. First off, I think that it shouldn't just be a four part course, I think it could be a full semester long course so students can get much more holistic exposure to various issues in public health ethics. Furthermore, while I think it was very helpful to break up into groups, I think that merely having a conversation with little engagement with the things discussed after the convos, does a bit of an injustice to how important the things being discussed were. Maybe there should be some sort of fun, engaging assignment after the convos so we are forced to engage further?",
    "Really seemed like the department min-ran this one to maintain accreditation. Please consider making department-specific sub-topics. Although well-disguised as interdisciplinary ethics learning, we would benefit from being divided in our appropriate MPH concentrations and to be given talks or led by those who have experience in those fields.",
    "Introsting topic, but too little time to explore the topic of interests.",
    "It is a good course for what it is: a quick course needed for accreditation. It didn't really add anything; just forced students to explore their own thoughts about ethics.",
    "Overall, the class generated some excellent discussions about ethics in public health- the conversations were really interesting, and it's clear that a lot of thought and effort went into each case. I think that most of the group was a little salty because of it being on a Friday afternoon for zero credit. Since clearly conversations are the way to get the most out of this, I'd love to see a course redesign where it's during the evening, people are required to attend 4 of 6 sessions (to provide for flexibility), and beer and food are provided to loosen people up and get them in less of dour moods.",
    "This is a great short course that provides a space to talk about issues that are relevant to all courses but rarely get picked up.",
    "very useful",
    "I was exempt from the course - N\/A",
    "Great course with relevant topics and sharing of insight.",
    "This was a good course. The discussions were interesting and well structured. It was slightly weird to have someone who I had been in multiple classes with leading the discussion sections as a TA, but I suppose that's unavoidable. It would be great to have more discussions on ethics throughout the semester that are optional to attend. It seemed like sometimes the discussion had really just taken off and we were already out of time.",
    "The small group discussion fostered excellent conversations that were then brought back to the large group. Some of the topic were uncomfortable to discuss, which is why I think the small groups were essential to have open, safe discussions. logistically, I was not ideal it was on a Friday afternoon, but there is only so much that can be done around that.",
    "Excellent discussions",
    "Reasonable course. My biggest complaint was not knowing enough about the issues at hand to really discuss them in depth, even with the articles given in advance. As with any ethical issue, there are so many factors and details to consider that it was difficult to really get a solid idea of how challenging some of these issues are. Another obstacle was that my group was combined with another group - a group that large made it really difficult to have an actual discussion about the topics. Mostly it felt like listening to a lot of opinions that were already formed and somewhat related to each other.",
    "Helpful course. May be better if it was moved to early on in semester versus waiting until later."

    "Recommend only if number of classes were cut down.",
    "Take it!",
    "From my understanding, previous students drove the creation of this course by complaining about the lack of value from the computer based training modules (which are still mandatory, and still without value). They did us all a disservice. This should be a voluntary set of lunch discussions and it should be far more tailored to the individual tracks or interests of students. As it stands, this is an SBS-fest, which is....unpleasant.",

    "Not terrible for a required class that has zero credit or grades. To get the most out of it, participate in the discussions and stop texting\/emailing during the class.",
    "This course gives a space to engage with other students on ethical issues. It is a safe space to openly engage in discourse and become comfortable talking about difficult issues in a professional setting.",

    "Course addresses relevant topics and allows lots of sharing of ideas about ethics. I would recommend.",
    "Intro to Ethics is a requirement of the MPH but it is one of the better requirements and the discussions are very interesting. I would recommend it to another student. The class meets four times on Fridays and readings and ethical topics are discussed.",
    "The course will make you think through some difficult topics, read the suggested readings with a critical lens to form your own opinions regarding certain topics but be open to knew ideas. If someone says something in a discussion that is different from your own views, be sure to ask further questions to understand where they are coming from.",
    "A fun course, very intense but friendly discussions. Great to find different views on the same topic",
    "I qualified out of this class and was not required to take it.",
    "This was a good way to approach the ethics requirement. Since it was the first time they used this format I suspect there will be changes next year, but nothing too overwhelming. If anything, it's interesting to read about ethical dilemmas in public health and try to figure out a reasonable approach to solving the problem.",
