   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this as a course that any quantitatively-oriented person should take before leaving Yale. The workload is moderate; the material is useful and none of it is particularly theoretically challenging.",
    "Decent continuation of 241. Material includes estimation, sampling distributions, risk& efficiency, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, linear least squares, etc. This class definitely helps you gain a better understanding of WHY statistics works beyond the superficial explanations of AP Stats, but I still feel the mathematical\/theoretical side of things should have been covered in more depth. However, beware of the Rice textbook - it's overpriced and not that great content-wise.However, Barron's one of the better lecturers I've had, and I feel prepared to take higher-level statistics courses now.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to! It wasn't very well taught and towards the end my friends and I had no idea what was going on. The midterm was fairly easy though and the final exam wasn't too bad.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "I took this class because it's a prereq for Stat 361 and I had previously taken 241. If you really enjoyed 241 or one of the other prereqs then maybe you will enjoy this course more than I did. The homework is moderately time consuming, the book is not the best, and office hours were not the most helpful. Though, the midterm was fairly easy and very straightforward compared to classwork, and the final focused largely on the first half of the semester despite the fact that Professor Barron said otherwise. You are allowed a sheet of notes (of any size!!) for the exams so that takes a lot of the stress out of studying\/memorizing formulas.",
    "Awesome Class, overall. Helps to have taken linear algebra. If you want to know about the world you should take this class.",
    "STAT 242 is a continuation of probability theory. It shows how to apply the techniques learned in STAT 241. It covers maximum likelihood, confidence intervals, ANOVA, hypothesis testing, and linear regression. There are weekly problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. I would recommend the class for any student interested in statistics.",
    "Professor Barron is very friendly, and certainly knows his stuff. He is also ruthless as he assigns difficult and long problem sets that can only be feasibly done over the weekend. His lecture style is very conversational: there are portions where he says many things, but then doesn't write them down, which makes me forget what he was talking about occasionally. All in all, he is a good professor. The class itself is pretty difficult, and the homework can be really hard, but the test and final were manageable (mainly thanks to the intense prep that the homework functions as). If you enjoyed MATH 241 take it. If you took MATH 238, and feel like putting in extra work, take it too!!",
    "Andrew Barron is without a doubt the least adept teacher I have had in all of my four years of Yale. I was complaining about the class to another student (not in the class) and without telling them the name of my professor they said \"Oh god, yeah, my worst class ever was an intro stats class. I'd never before written a bad review of a teacher, but Andrew Barron was the worst.\" This happened several times over the course of the semester.He came to class unprepared, made simple concepts obtuse, ran over time, and posted no class notes to make up for his in-class garble. He refused to give us practice problems for the midterm or final, even though they were listed on the syllabus, and did not schedule a review session before the final.How this guy is the DUS is beyond me.",
    "If you want to understand the math behind statistical tools such as t-test, linear regression, ANOVA etc. and not blindly use them and analyze their results, then take this class! The lectures can be sometimes hard to follow, but the workload is relatively low (about 4 hrs work a week). The problem sets are repetitive and balance theoretical math proofs and data analysis well. The midterm is very easy, with problems similar to the problem sets. The final was a lot more challenging. We saw problems we had never seen before and actually had to be somewhat creative. The final also surprisingly covered mainly pre-midterm concepts and no data analysis. Professor Barron is a kind and caring teacher and his lectures delve into more of the mathematical foundation than is needed to do well in this class. However, it's great to get exposure to it as it increases your intuition about various concepts. Sometimes it is hard to understand concepts as the textbook is unclear, and I don't know if there's any other method other to read the textbook again and again. Also, if you haven't taken MATH 241, I would be hesitant to take this class. Prof Barron does do a quick 1.5 week review at the beginning of the semester but moment-generating functions and familiarity with various probability density functions come back on the final and throughout the semester. Overall, interesting class and really nice curve.",
    "I found the lectures to be confusing, and since a lot of the material did not come up in the textbook or on the homework, the experience was sometimes very frustrating. I would still take the class as I think the 241\/242 sequence is valuable, but I certainly didn't enjoy this particular course.",
    "No, Professor Barron is absolutely awful. He is by far the worst professor I have ever had in my life. If you have to take the course for your major, I suggest that you wait until a different professor is teaching. I mean come on, everyone knows the math department sucks but this is taking it to another level. I don't know how a professor like this has tenure. He should be fired. It's absolutely bullshit that a teacher like this is allowed to teach undergraduates. Barron might be a perfectly nice guy, but his teaching style is horrendous. I cannot find the correct words to express my fury. The textbook is horrible, and the professor makes no effort to get his students excited about the subject material. Oh, and Barron does not post any lecture notes online, so you are forced to go to class and listen to his nasally voice. Good times. Psets are every week, including the week of the midterm and reading week. Some involve programming that isn't covered in class or a prerequisite. I could shit on this class for a few more pages, but I don't want to waste any more of my time on this horrible class and this horrible professor. Avoid if possible.",
    "The material for this class was pretty standard and what you'd expect. Professor Barron is a super nice guy, but very disorganized and not great at explaining things. The final exam was rough, and the midterm was alright, but the grading scheme is unclear. Overall, not the greatest course, but manageable workload and good to take if you need more stats.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Probably the most frustrating course I've ever taken at Yale: poorly taught; simple material unnecessarily confounding; unattentive professors and TA's; left knowing very little. If you just want to learn stat you'd be far better served taking an intro stat course. I came in after 241 and no other background, and I learned very little of value. Horrible course.",
    "I would recommend this course because it allows you to actually apply the knowledge acquired in Probability Theory to real-world problems. The skills we learned in this class such as hypothesis testing and linear regression are very useful and go hand in hand with data analysis. This course is a perfect representation of what an applied mathematics course should be like and is a must take!",
    "Certainly worth taking to get more statistics knowledge. I would peruse the book before I took the class though. If you think that the second part of the book is interesting material, than this class is for you."
