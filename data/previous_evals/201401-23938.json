    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. While, structurally, the class could use some reworking, I truly think this is a class unlike any other at Yale. Theory and practice are emphasized and balanced in a beautiful way. The class provides an opportunity to create a work, a performance with an ensemble of individuals from diverse backgrounds and with varying interests. Essentially, the class becomes a creative think tank, a chance to think in a new way and collaborate. The teachers are inspiring to work with, always encouraging and always open to feedback. Take it!",
    "Take this course! The professors are amazing, and there are so few courses at Yale where you will get such an inspiring combination of theory and history and practical application. It's so satisfying to spend a semester actually creating pieces of art (theater, film, dance, etc). The professors also start to tailor the course to the class, depending on people's interests, which is so cool! The blog posts are helpful for digesting the reading and are also super manageable. Highly recommended.",
    "Performance and the Moving Image is a class unlike any other at Yale. It is a production seminar--i.e. culminates in a performance, but unlike other such classes you don't have to be a theatre student to do it. Our class was so diverse and so rich. We were actors, musicians, physicists, film students, athletes, etc. Not only does the class offer the possibility of learning a wide array of things about film\/dance\/theatre, but it is also a chance to make something. Actually make something of your own. Everyone contributes to the final project and that is so fulfilling. There were a few glitches that came from it being a first-time class that will definitely be addressed by the incredible professors next time around.",
    "Take it! Great teachers, fascinating material, fun and cool final performance. Work heavy towards the end, but will probably be even better organizationally and logistically when they offer it again.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "A class about collaboration and creating a multi-disciplinary final product. An extremely important class for anyone going into a creative field where collaboration is necessary including film\/tv, theater, dance, design, writing, etc. You will find people in this class that you will want to collaborate further with in and out of Yale. In the end, despite some inefficiencies borne of trying to create a product from 10+ creative individuals, it's a very valuable experience. I would argue a critical experience for anyone in the arts.",
    "The best, most engaging and original class offered at Yale. I learned so much, and I really enjoyed myself. The class offers, first, an in-depth history of experimental movements from the 1940s on in theatre, dance, and video\/film art, with some of the most interesting artists in all of those movements! Then, the class offers a guide to use artistic collaboration in a way that is generative, in a way that works, to use each students' talents to produce a whole new production, using dance, theatre, and the moving image. I was so, so, amazed by what we came up with in a relatively short amount of time, so amazed by how much my performing\/artistic abilities increased and expanded over the class as well. Take this class!"
