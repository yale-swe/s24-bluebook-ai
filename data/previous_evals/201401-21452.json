    "This class was really fun and incredibly informative. The reading is totally worth it, and the work is very manageable with short weekly reading responses. Professor Coates is fantastic - she really knows the dance world, and has for a long time, and shares her knowledge and networks generously with her students. I would definitely recommend if you're interested in how dance is relevant to your life - you might be surprised.",
    "History of Dance was an interesting course and I'm glad that I learned so much about important figures in 20th century dance. That said, the course was far more theoretical and source-focused than I would have liked. I wished we had spent less time discussing methods of dance history, and more time talking about actual dance.",
    "It's not so much a history class as a dance about the discipline of dance studies",
    "I would recommend you take this class if you're at all interested in dance and\/or you need a writing credit. It's great fun and not especially work intensive for a WR. Just two papers and weekly reading responses, which, if you enjoy the material (I.e. dance) will be easy.",
    "The complete history of dance, abridged. I would reccommend the course if the student had an interest in dance or anthropology.",
    "This is a good class. The movement exercises are fantastic. However, the readings are often boring. There are weekly reading responses and two papers.",
    "History of difference dance movements and different choreographers. Presentations are fine but reading responses are annoying each week!",
    "I would recommend this class. The readings and papers are interesting and manageable. However, if you're seeking a comprehensive history of dance, that's not what you'll get. This class focused largely on American dance in the 20th century and on specific choreographers. It is critical to constantly be caught up on the readings.",
    "The title of this class is a bit misleading: I wouldn't call this class \"History of Dance\" so much as \"20th Century Dance History in Conversation\" (or something along those lines). The course almost exclusively covers the 20th century and focuses mostly on Western dance. So if you are looking for an overview on Indian or Middle Eastern dancing, this is not your course. The readings are also not history-based, but mainly in the interdisciplinary field of Dance Studies. So if we were reading about Mary Wigman, we were not reading a summary of her work but a discussion of how her choreography played into the politics of Nazi Germany.That being said, I highly enjoyed this seminar and would recommend it to anyone interested in 20th century dance. We covered quite a bit of material and had a lot of fun in class, especially when visiting lecturers came and conducted movement workshops. The reading is fine, but you do have to write a blog post every week. There are two written assignments and a presentation (WR credit). The presentations were the worst part of class and were pretty unnecessary, as people would jut summarize the readings. But the rest of class was generally good!"
