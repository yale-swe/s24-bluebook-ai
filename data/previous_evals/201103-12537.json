    "its a decent course, a few homeworks, a midterm, and a final paper. not too much work. the professor is kinda funny sometimes. as far as econ classes go, not too painful",
    "Definitely recommend it for an econ elective. Interesting topic especially in today's world with the decline of jobs and volatile market. take it with Gerald Jaynes",
    "Relatively easy class, interesting, no final, must study for midterm though",
    "I would recommend this only to a student who is looking for an easy ECON course.",
    "Take this class whether you are an econ major or not. 2 assignments, midterm and final group paper (groups of up to 5 people, max 20 pages), or a debate. No section. Professor Jaynes is the man and the material is interesting. He will often tell amusing anecdotes about his time in the army and his experience with the material.",
    "Take this class. Easy econ class with interesting material if you choose to pay attention in class and do the readings. If not, you still won't do badly.",
    "great class. not too hard. take it",
    "Pretty interesting and not very time consuming at all. Def a good econ credit to get if youre taking 5 classes",
    "It's a pretty basic class with minimal work. I would take it if you need an economics credit, but want to balance out a harder semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload is light, but the information learned is really important to anyone living in the country. This class focuses on poverty in the US, not the world. The reading is basically the script of the lecture that he will deliver, so it is better as a review than to read beforehand. There is a midterm, two short assignments (1 page each) and a group paper at the end. For so little work it is a great amount of reward.",
    "I would reccommend this class to anyone who wants learn more details about poverty and poverty analysis",
    "Yes",
    "It's a real good class to take if you are looking for an econ class with not as much work",
    "2 short assignments, a midterm, and either a final paper or class debate. Do the debate if you have the opportunity and enough people are doing it. I would definitely recommend this class."
