    "Basic knowledge of physics.",
    "Mechanics",
    "I learned about kinematics, simple harmonic motion, torque, forces, springs, waves, and more basic physics concepts. I also deepened my understanding of mathematical concepts such as Taylor Series, algebraic manipulations, and differential equations.",
    "The ability to problem solve. I could not do a single problem on a pset at the beginning and towards the end of the course I could do many. I live at office hours though.",
    "I learned the correct mindset about how to methodically approach University-level physics problems.",
    "I have a good grasp of the basics of kinematics and dynamics as any introductory physics course should cover.",
    "I learned a lot about physics and its applications in the real world.",
    "I learnt how to break down information in various questions, solve a lot of problems using a lot of calculus and algebra which I've done extensively in other classes as much as this one. I also learnt how important it is, or at least could be, to work with others which I think is one of Professor Steinacker's goals. However it was almost impossible to do the psets on your own as you got deeper into the content and there were times when I didn't feel like it didn't make a difference whether you went to the lecture or not because of how fast she moves in lecture. There were times I went to lecture to know what I don't know in this class. Because it was better to at least know that you haven't fully understood some concepts rather than not know that what you don't know...if that makes any sense to you. I have to stress how important it is to learn how to actually do the psets on your own despite collaborating with other students. You gain problem solving skills that you have to use during the exams which you wouldn't otherwise learn if you were just fed the information. This also makes this class particularly harder and quite different from other classes (both STEM and non-STEM).",
    "We learned linear kinematics, circular motion, relative motion, projectile motion, forces, energy, work, collisions, center of mass, rotational kinetics, moment of inertia, torque, angular momentum, gravity, simple harmonic motion, and waves.",
    "how to visualize problems, critical thinking, problem solving",
    "basic physics knowledge, critical thinking abt physics problems, math loopholes that I didn't know abt before",
    "The class gave an overview of Newtonian mechanics. It's a good intro physics.",
    "I learned learned about kinematics, rotation, energy, forces, momentum, and orbits in this class. I developed better mathematical problem-solving skills and practiced calculus.",
    "I learned basic introductory physics topics such as linear\/rotational kinematics, energy, springs, forces, gravity, harmonic oscillation, and how to derive equations that dealt with these topics from fundamental equations.",
    "I really learned that sometimes it is impossible to absorb what is going on in class. I fully taught myself from the lecture notes after class, which took a long time and was quite discouraging. I got nothing from sitting in class. The problem sets were the bane of my existence and took an excruciating amount of my time, which is limited from other classes and clubs and work.",
    "problem solving and intro physics and Taylor series",
    "Physics 180 covered a lot of material of general physics. It is a great way to reinforce algebra and calculus concepts, and gives a more tangible explanation to why we do certain things in math and physics.",
    "I learned how to think more deeply about problems, evaluate equations more critically, and manage my time (considering the PSETs took so long)!",
    "I learned how to use calculus principles to solve a variety of mechanics problems in kinematics, gravity, inertia, waves, energy conservation, momentum, and applied forces.",
    "Proofs and explanations of many of the concepts that we are just told to believe in high school.",
    "I learned how to think on my own.",
    "I gained a foundational knowledge of physics, covering topics including kinematics, forces, energy, gravity, and more.",
    "I learned a lot of about physics, including linear and rotational kinematics, forces, work, energy, simple harmonic motions, etc.",
    "Learning theoretical calculations.",
    "I learned a lot of basic physics skills like projectile motion, rotational kinematics, and properties of harmonic motion. I think more importantly, however, I learned to work with a community of people--peers, peer tutors, TAs, and Professor Steinacker herself--to solve very complex problems. I, unlike many of my peers, came from a background with lackluster STEM education, especially in Physics. Having the built-in study halls and office hours was super beneficial because I highly doubt I would have been able to complete the psets by myself. Professor Steinacker was kind and her guidance made me feel like I truly had a support network to turn to when things got difficult. It was this interpersonal relationship insight that I will take with me far further than the physical concepts I learned in this class.",
    "I learned creative problem solving.",
    "I feel as though I can comfortably evaluate the motion of everyday objects through the laws of physics learned during this semester.",
    "I learned the basics of physics and enhanced my problem solving skills.",
    "This class has taught me to be a better critical thinker and problem solver.",
    "I developed team work skills, critical thinking and analytical skills.",
    "Through this course, I learned about the basics of physics. Some topics include kinematics, gravity, momentum, forces, energy, and simple harmonic motion. I also learned how to apply these concepts mathematically to a multitude of problems.",
    "I developed a useful understanding of problem solving in physics; I understand how to work through challenging problems on the material we learned. In the process, I was also taught methods in mathematics that I was unfamiliar with that will be useful in future years.",
    "PHYS 180 taught me about fundamental physics concepts such as rotational kinematics, planetary orbit, newton's laws, projectile motion, and calculation of topics like energy conservation.",
    "I developed my skills in quantitative analysis and got insights not only on how to do physics, but how to work out problems in general as well as how to better use resources professors make for us.",
    "Learned how to problem solve and work through really challenging problems",
    "Developed calculus skills. My high school was very lacking in physics education, so this was my first exposure to physics beyond a pre-algebra understanding of the formulas.",
    "Basic physics concepts",
    "This class was amazing. We learned all the basic concepts and framework for physics and used calculus to prove them.",
    "Learned how to do physics",
    "I learned how to take a new approach solving problems once my original plan wouldnt work.",
    "I learned a lot of physics.",
    "I learned calculus-based introductory physics. This includes kinematics, forces, gravity, orbitals, and springs.",
    "I now have a strong foundation in physics.",
    "This course takes you through the basic concepts of mechanics. It is a good intro physics course for those with little to no background in physics. The course is designed to improve the student's problem solving abilities while creating a foundation of basic mechanical physics.",
    "A thorough understanding of mechanical physics",
    "Basic physics",
    "A fundamental understanding of classical physics, some of its history, and a host of knowledge and techniques for problem solving within physics and in general.",
    "I learned mechanics.",
    "I learned a fair amount of new mathematical and critical thinking skills, and some insight into how physicists differ from mathematicians.",
    "Having never taken physics before this class, I learned a great deal about forces, energy, kinematics, orbits, momentum, centers of mass, and how all of these things interact with one another. This class was super helpful in teaching the students how to think with a scientific mindset.",
    "How to work through difficult problem sets, ask for help, and break-down complicated physics problems. Between going to office hours and study hall to work on the problem sets, I also learned how to manage my time.",
    "We learned the basics of linear and rotational physics with calculous.",
    "Kinematics, conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, orbits, gravity, center of mass, moment of inertia, rotational dynamics, circular motion, friction",
    "Able to develop problem solving skills and generally approaching challenges with the mindset of a physicist.",
    "An introductory level knowledge of mechanics. Introductory being no greater than a high school level. A really strong grasp in trig identities and algebraic simplifications.",
    "Problem solving, specifically as geared towards physics; broader algebra and calculus skills.",
    "Through this course, I developed a broad knowledge of mechanical physics and the many skills associated. This course covered kinematics, forces, rotational kinematics, gravity, and many other related topics.",
    "Professor Steinacker really focuses on being able to see the beauty of working through the math yourself to understand concepts and to see where formulas come from. This course covers kinematics, rotational and linear, forces, torque, oscillations, and waves. The main thing I took away from this class was being able to work through hard problems and feel accomplished with myself by the end of it. You learn that it is impossible to work alone! We live in a collaborative world! More of Yale should be like this."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very well organized, very clear structure.",
    "Strengths: - THE PROFESSOR - Good pace - Taught well - Fair testing - Applicable for STEM majors - lots of access to help Weaknesses: - Maybe explain conceptually what is going on first before diving into derivations - VERY long problem sets",
    "It is a lot of work, but I think it definitely pays off in the end. Steinacker is a great instructor.",
    "If you're not sure about PHYS 170 or 180 --- as someone with a strong math background but 0 prior knowledge in physics, the course was accessible and straightforward without having to attend office hours or study hall, and contextualized the physical meanings of things like surface integrals. Steinacker's review sessions are helpful, and her exams are fair and test on fundamental knowledge without trying to pull a fast one on you. If you need it, the course has a TON of support from the professor herself as well as from TAs and peer tutors, which most people relied heavily on in order to complete the weekly problem sets. Office hours and study hall are not mandatory (unlike for PHYS 170), but most people go religiously. Steinacker adjusts the pace of the course and the homework deadlines based on the needs of students.",
    "I think the course progressed in a very logical manner; each lecture built off of the one before and I felt like the order in which we learned the material helped with comprehension.",
    "This class requires an insanely high level of time commitment. I have never been this engaged with a class before. You have to put the time and effort into actually get a decent grade.This class also encourages engaging with other students and its really hard to do this class on your own. Steinacker is also a great professor genuinely interested in the success of her students holding office hours so many times during the week. However, this class seemed unnecessarily hard. I took Physics in high school and some content was familiar but the way she taught it made it seem much harder than it actually was and this made me really wonder about students who had no prior experience to Physics. This shouldn't discourage you though. As Donkey from Shrek said, \"Ha-ha-ha! Never fear! Where there's a will, there's a way..\" If you take this class and at some point are struggling with a pset please remember to GO TO STUDY HALL\/OFFICE HOURS! Don't waste your time struggling with a question trying to prove a point or something like that because your intelligence is not directly proportional to that.",
    "Plenty of resources are available for this class (office hours, posted notes, test reviews, PSET solutions, etc). It could be improved through more demonstrations towards the second half of the course and more thorough procedures of approaching problems.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Steinacker's lecturing (passionate, humorous, well organized) + her obvious care for learning (office hours every day, amazing lecture notes posted to Canvas) + her care for health and students' lives outside of Physics Weaknesses: Psets? I hesitate because I feel they were necessary to grasp the topics. They were much harder than the exams, but I think this is what made them so helpful to do. Most weeks they were easy to get done with 1-2 visits to office hours\/study hall per week, but some were a lot more brutal. Every PSET was very thoughtfully designed though, and were really great applications of the topics we learned in class. You can tell Prof. Steinacker cares about our time and includes problems she thinks are valuable for us to do.",
    "It was a lot of work, but it wasn't busy work.",
    "Professor Steinacker is a great lecturer. Her class was the one class I was never bored in. She also really cares about her students, and the fact that she is available so much along with the TAs and peer tutors means you will have the resources to succeed. This is by far the most well designed into class I have taken at Yale.",
    "This course has some of the greatest support available to students. Although many students take this course primarily out of necessity, rather than by choice, I think we all appreciated the amount of resources available to help learn and practice the material, including many helpful peer tutors and TF's, office hours and study halls for problem set help, and a kind, passionate, and very helpful professor to lead the class. The course is very organized and grading is fair.",
    "The strength of this course is a) Professor Steinacker and b) the fact that homework and participation are 45% (!!) of the grade. The exams are fair but difficult, but with frequent office hour and study hall attendance you can easily do well (>90%) on all of the homeworks, and then there are test corrections which you can do to bring up your grade on each of the midterms. The weakness is how difficult the psets are; while you can do very well on them, if you aren't naturally good at physics the pset will take you up to 10 hours some weeks, which can be hard if you have other classes to worry about.",
    "Problem sets should not take so long to complete. We have other classes. The tests were scary. I appreciated the test correction opportunity. Barely received enough partial credit for little mistakes even when I knew the physics behind it.",
    "long psets each week, but this was good because then it ended up being much easier to stay on top of the material for the tests. Tests were fair and corrections helped a lot. The professor is super nice, but only has office hours during the day when I was in class (but she still had a lot of office hours considering).",
    "This course is extremely well taught, there are many resources for extra help, and the homework very much reinforces the important concepts covered in class. Although it is a challenging course, Professor Steinacker offers ample opportunity to improve, such as exam corrections. This class is set up so that if you work hard, you will succeed.",
    "Lecture was sometimes a little boring (because it was 1:15 and typically involved a lot of derivations), but Professor Steinacker's enthusiasm made up for it all. Professor Steinacker is truly devoted to her students (as evidenced by the tremendous amount of office hours she offers each week and her willingness to engage with any student). The course could not necessarily be improved. All the necessary resources to succeed are provided.",
    "Weaknesses: All of the weaknesses of a large lecture apply, unfortunately, but Professor Steinacker really tries to improve this in any way she can. Strengths: There are so many resources out there for this course! There is a weekly review session, study halls, peer tutor and professor office hours, and extremely helpful exam review sessions. If you need help on problem sets, which is often the case, it is really accessible.",
    "Strength: lots of office hours and study hall.",
    "The strength of the course is the instructional value of the homework. While the homework assignments are long and often challenging to solve without receiving guidance in a TA session\/office hours, the homework is the principal means of learning how to solve complex physics problems. Working through these problems made the exams seem fair, but the trade off was that problems sets required extensive hours to complete (several hours per week to work through and few hours per week from office hours\/peer tutoring.",
    "I thought this class was very well designed and facilitated success for everyone.",
    "Lectures can drag on, and PSETs take a long time.",
    "There are lots of office hours and good notes, but the course is so heavy with theoretical problems.",
    "Professor Steinacker was THE strength of this class. Without her this class would have actually killed me. The weaknesses were not so much flaws as much as this class is HARD. I had to dedicate 10-14 hours a week to office hours and study halls to finish the homework. Even then I didn't grasp the concepts and felt like I was always 10 steps behind... The class isn't very understanding of students with little physics background or lacking math skills. While Professor Steinacker would mention doing some review for those who didn't have the necessary background, this \"review\" was often lacking and just left students like me feeling even more unprepared for the following concepts. I really should have reviewed basic trigonometry myself, but instead I kept struggling with it the whole time; this could have easily been avoided with a true review of basic calculus needed for this class.",
    "I thought the lectures were engaging and the lecture notes were very helpful. The problem sets were challenging but helpful.",
    "The course is quite fast-paced, so as someone who did not take AP Physics in HS, I felt that there was a lot of catching up to do. It was difficult to stay on top of the material, especially when midterms came around.",
    "the class was well structured and included a lot of practical experiments which made understanding concepts easier. The course load is somewhat high.",
    "One strength of the course is the dedication of Professor Steinacker shows by holding office hours and checking up on kids who seem to be struggling in the class. Another strength is the organization of the class. One weakness of the course is the lack of help available during office hours and study hall. For such a large class, there is not enough peer mentors and TAs available for help during these times. This course could be improved by just hiring more peer mentors and TAs for the class.",
    "This course's main strength is how compelling and interesting the instructor was. Each lecture was engaging and interesting, with images and demonstrations helping to teach the information we were learning. Additionally, the frequent office hours were immensely helpful as a resource for absorbing the information we learned. I did not find there to be any significant weakness.",
    "Strengths: Prof Steinacker really makes this class. She is awesome and the help for this course is always provided. In other words, the resources are there for such a difficult class. Weaknesses: There were sometimes grading errors and felt the subjectivity of the grading on exams. Not clear from the TAs what I missed and why it resulted in that many point deductions.",
    "This course was great. Its well organized, fair, and the professor provides some of the best resources Ive seen thus far at Yale.",
    "PSETS take many hours but there are many recourses and places to receive help. Prof Steinacker is amazing!!",
    "The difficulties of the psets are not necessarily weaknesses, but they definitely caused a lot of stress. Fortunately, the professor was kind enough to extend many of the pset deadlines.",
    "Amazing office hours, wonderful professor, lecture notes posted online",
    "I like that the time take was taken to derive formulas in class, giving insight into why they exist. However, I do wish that more time was allocated to show the application of those formulas. Often times, even though I understood where the formula has its origin, I would have a difficult time using it during a problem.",
    "The instructor, Dr. Steinacker is the strength. She is an amazing professor. On the first day in the lecture she said she would try to learn everyones name and she really cares about her students. The grading is very fair and the formatting makes everyone able to succeed even though the homework is very long and tedious and the tests can sometimes seem extremely difficult.",
    "Taught extremely well",
    "Homework is excessively long",
    "The workload is very high but great resources",
    "One strength of this course were the notes that Professor Steinacker posted online to help students understand the course material more fully. She also posted some example problems on there that were not done in class, allowing students to have more practice for exams. A weakness of this course was the lack of consistency of the difficulty of exams compared to homework. I appreciated that the exams were less difficult than the homework (because the homework was insanely difficult) however I never could tell which parts of the homework I should be able to do on my own and which were exam-difficulty. It made studying for exams extremely difficult. Perhaps give examples of problems which are approximately the same level of difficulty as the exam will be.",
    "The course gives students a strong foundation in physics. At times, the p-sets can be extremely long but they do facilitate learning.",
    "The teacher and her support system are amazing in this course and if the student takes the time, one can vastly improve their critical thinking skills. The problem with this, is that it is a time intensive course and there are many ways to cut corners in this class. I think the main weakness is the ability to breeze through this class without engaging in the material. Also, I think the class would benefit from more in class student participation (in class problems).",
    "The HW takes very very long but does help you understand material",
    "Very good professor and explains topics well but sometimes could be better about relating different lectures\/giving a broad overview so we understand where topics fall.",
    "Strengths include cogent, logical lectures that progress in a linear and understandable manner, as well as in-depth facilitation of group work by the professor and course structure as a whole.",
    "Professor Steinacker is amazing. Her lectures are very clear and her notes are extremely detailed, and I felt like I truly understood physics. Her office hours are insanely helpful. This class is a lot of work, but in my opinion, it's manageable and worth it.",
    "The strengths of this course were its organization, the number of study hall or office hour opportunities for students, and Professor Steinacker. The weaknesses were that some of the study halls did not have very many\/any TAs to help or they were not actively engaged with the students.",
    "Strengths - Steinacker is just a gem. She has such as passion for physics, and through office hours she really helps you to understand it. Weakness - Physics is hard. Not necessarily a weakness of the course, just physics in general is hard.",
    "There is always plenty of help available for homework and questions, but the course is very time consuming.",
    "Strengths - office hours every day! I honestly think there should be student\/ULA-run office hours on the weekends though, that would be really helpful. Weaknesses - lecture is hard to follow, always look at the lecture notes. The homework is both a strength and a weakness of this course: it prepare you very well for the tests but often takes tons of extracurricular time and does not follow the lectures.",
    "Very good foundational course for further physics or STEM courses. Unfortunately, the course suffers most of the drawbacks of a large lecture environment.",
    "Strengths: Approachable lecturer. Weaknesses: homework was tedious and poorly designed. they took drastically too long for a class that 99% of students took for a prerequisite and not a major class. They were designed to require attendance at office hours which is unfair to students with a job and overall a poorly designed element of this class. If you have to give half points back and curve your exams, they're too hard.",
    "This course was very well taught and had lots of opportunity for outside engagement of the classroom. One weakness was the difficulty level of the problem sets, while the course only requires a math knowledge of integration, the later problem sets would take much longer without use of multi variable calculus. This forced students to go to office hours and learn the method directly or struggle with the tough work around using single variable calculus.",
    "I think this course is designed very well to help the student. There are a plethora of resources, Prof. Steinacker is a saint, and the peer tutors are all super helpful and encouraging. The only problem is that it is a requirement for many different majors, and honestly I think the expectation for hours to be put into this class are unreasonable for many students. Steinacker understands the diversity of her students and does her best to work with everyone (and does a really great job with this), but I think it is unfair to put people that have taken AP physics in a class with people who have very little to no physics background. Yale needs to be better at differentiating the skill level of students in intro STEM courses, because it can be extremely frustrating for a student new to the material to be surrounded by students of the major that have already seen many of the concepts before."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course over PHY 170 -- it was better organized and you don't have to take annoying weekly quizzes.",
    "Steinacker is a really great professor, and physics began to make a lot more sense to me after this class; would recommend",
    "I would recommend this is you feel you need some basic physics knowledge or if it is required. The professor is phenomenal, but the workload is very heavy. It was a useful class, but it is a lot of work",
    "Yes, if you like physics and are looking for a challenge. If not, this is not a good course for you. Also, would definitely recommend having a strong physics background before taking this class, even though it is an intro course. It really is not an intro course.",
    "Do not take this class to fulfill a distributional requirement, unless you love physics. You will spend hours every week on PSETs and test corrections. The commitment is very high, so deciding to take this class should not be taken lightly.",
    "Yes. Professor Steinacker is fantastic. Although it is quite a challenging course, it is rewarding as well.",
    "You are probably taking physics because you have to for your major or for premed --- TAKE THIS COURSE over PHYS 170 because you probably want to build up a good classical foundation (and biological applications will be easy to implement once you have a good grasp of the basics anyway). The professor is amazing and the class is fair.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Steinacker is incredibly bright and kind, genuinely wanting all of her students to succeed.",
    "If you're not required to take this class and are just taking it for science credit, kindly do yourself a favor and take a step back and re-evaluate your goals for taking Physics 180. Some people took the class for the 'high school love for Physics' and ended up dropping the class after the first midterm (and went back to their Econ classes) because no one wants this class to hurt their GPA for no bigger reason. Also, during the class if you ever feel like dropping it, trust your gut because I actually wished I dropped this class earlier. Towards the second half of the semester, I sadly used lecture time to just contemplate about my major because I didn't have the intrinsic motivation to do the class anymore. Not because the material was hard but because at the beginning, I didn't really think about my reasons for taking this class (beyond fulfilling a requirement) and I never really thought about what I wanted to actually get out of the class. I'm also learning to look at the bigger picture of things and now I'm at a point where I wish I'm kinda okay I did this class because I now know what I definitely don't want to do at Yale. You live and you learn I guess.",
    "Most students are taking this for a requirement, but this class stands out among intro STEM courses at Yale. It is so well organized and WELL TAUGHT!!",
    "Yes. Take this over 170 for sure--it's a lot of work, but it's really worthwhile learning, it's better taught, and it's better curved. Prof. Steinecker wants us to do well and she wants us to learn, and it shows!",
    "Yes! Even if you don't love physics, Professor Steinacker makes it interesting. The class is set up for you to succees and chances are, your friends are taking it too.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has to\/ really wants to take a physics course at Yale. Although it may be more difficult than other intro physics courses, the level of support and fairness of the class makes the overall experience much better.",
    "I'm premed and I took this course over 170 because I had heard such great things about Professor Steinacker. Ultimately, I think that was a good choice, although I don't think that this necessarily ended up being better for me than 170. The reasons to take this course are that Steinacker is a great lecturer and is very invested in her students, the fact that homework is heavily weighted and you can correct your exams for a slightly higher score. However, I think that as someone without a natural intuition for physics, I was kind of at a disadvantage compared to all of the engineering students who took this class, and I ended up doing pretty close to the class average (I think) despite all my hard work, whereas that may not have happened in 170 where everybody is a premed taking the class to get the requirement done.",
    "Take Phys200 if you want to learn physics.",
    "If you need an intro physics course, I would definitely recommend this one over 170! Theres more math involved but very well organized for you to get lots of help.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking for a challenging twist to an introductory physics course. Professor Steinacker is the best!",
    "I would totally recommend this course. I had not taken physics in a long time and was quite apprehensive in taking physics 180. By the end of the course, I felt so accomplished and knowledgeable of basic material. I worked through some really hard problems! Professor Steinacker is a wonderful teacher and she makes the experience enjoyable.",
    "This course is necessary for a lot of majors, so most people taking it probably don't have a choice. However, it is well taught and there are so many resources to help you succeed -- you just really need to put in the work. Problem sets are very lengthy, but very good for both grades and understanding of concepts. In short, I would recommend this course to those who are a) passionate about physics\/need to be for their major and b) willing to dedicate a lot of work to this.",
    "Only if it's required for their major because this course has a lot of work.",
    "I would highly recommend Physics 180 for students who are interested in the subject. The course will help you become a master at reducing complex problems into basic ones that you can solve. Professor Steinacker is a deeply caring and passionate instructor. I appreciated that she was reasonable in granting extensions for problems sets because she recognized that we sometimes needed more than a week to truly solve all the problems. The course grading is fair and the exams are doable if you've worked through the problems sets.",
    "I took this class as a science credit because I am a music major, and I missed doing math. I cannot say that I recommend this class for students like me because I was not able to practice as much as a would have liked. I spent a lot of time in office hours and working on the PSET each week. However, I really did enjoy the class a lot and I would recommend it to people who need the physics credit or have time to take a challenging science credit! Professor Steinacker is the best, and I do not regret taking this class at all!",
    "It is a good introductory Physics course.",
    "Not unless this was a prerequisite. Fantastic course, but difficult.",
    "Ahhh no. Professor Steinacker is amazing but unless you have to take this class, I wouldn't. Its way too much work and unnecessarily difficult. I have said to my friends and peers that if I had taken this class my first year I probably would have dropped pre-med... So I guess if you're pre-med and want to see if you can handle it, this might be the class for you. Otherwise save yourself from the struggle, because it's real.",
    "Yes. Even though I took it as a prerequisite, I enjoyed the professor and course.",
    "If you are interested in physics\/STEM then yes. It was a hard course that required work but if you put in the work then you do well.",
    "Only if necessary.",
    "As a student majoring in MCDB, I had the decision between 170 and 180. I ultimately chose 180 for the plentiful resources and the excellent teaching styles of Professor Steinacker. As I have never taken physics before this, I probably would've been confused in either class, but I was afraid I would not understand the concepts of physics applied to a biological context.. 180 did start to go a lot faster than what I was expecting, but the peer mentors and Steinacker were more than happy to help outside of designated hours to help reinforce the concepts. The homework assignments are brutal as most of my time during the week was spent in office hours and study hall. The tests are pretty straight-forward if you understand the concepts of the homework. If you're willing to put in the work each week, work hard, ask questions when you are confused, and persevere through the difficult material, take 180.",
    "Yes! I found the lectures very interesting and engaging, and I think anyone who has or wants an appreciation for physics would enjoy this course.",
    "This is a required course. But well taught and prof Steinacker really cares about the students.",
    "Yes, physics will affect your lives more than you know it. With the increasing importance of space and applications of physics especially for all aspects of society.",
    "Yes, the professor is amazing and really cares about her students. Even if you dont feel youre good at physics, the course ends up being worth it.",
    "Be prepared to devote many hours to this class. It is not easy!!",
    "I would cautiously recommend this. As someone who has not taken any form of AP physics, this was a very challenging course.",
    "Yes!! I felt that I actually learnt a strong mechanics foundation, and I was nervous that that wouldnt be possible given my lack of background.",
    "Yes, if they are looking for a great introduction to physics. Take 200 or above if you have taken physics in high school.",
    "Absolutely! Im not sure if anyone would be able to use the knowledge if they dont need it for a major or for pre-med but I loved the info we learned. Im not sure if Dr. Steinacker is teaching again but if she is then absolutely take this. She was by far the best professor ive ever had. She cares so much about everyone and is so passionate about physics. Shes extraordinary.",
    "Yes - a very good intro class",
    "It takes a lot of time to get through",
    "Yes, Professor Steinacker is amazing and the material is interesting.",
    "Yes. Learned a lot",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student just for fun. If they need to take an introductory physics course I would recommend this one.",
    "I would recommend this course over PHYS 170. Students who are trying to fulfill a distributional credit should take another course since the coursework is heavy and time consuming.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student over physics 170. I think Adriane is amazing and the student develops an intuitive understanding of fundamental mechanics.",
    "Yes",
    "If you have to take it",
    "Absolutely, this course was an amazing introduction to physics (a subject I had not explored previously) and offered a strong foundation needed for other science classes\/career paths.",
    "Yes! Professor Steinacker is truly so wonderful. The psets are definitely a lot of work, but they're always super satisfying to finish and she's so helpful if you're stuck. This class has made me appreciate physics so much more.",
    "Yes, but only if the student was really interested in pursuing a major or field that involves physics. The class is a lot of work to not end up pursuing physics.",
    "Definitely! Chemistry and biology is for softies, take physics and be a champ.",
    "I would recommend the course becuase the proffesor is very good.",
    "This course is likely a requirement, I'm not sure that I would recommend it over the other introductory physics courses available. I've heard great things about Physics 200. This is good for those who want classical intro. physics (like AP level).",
    "As a foundational course for most STEM fields of study, this course does a good job of bringing everyone, with their varying levels of Physics knowledge, to a similar level of understanding. I would recommend this course as an effective prerequisite science course.",
    "Not at all. Wait and take 200. I felt my learning was jeopardized by having tedious assignments and focusing on algebra vs physical systems.",
    "I would recommend the course only if you are required to take it for a major or pre-med requirement. It is a very work-heavy course.",
    "Unless you are in love with physics or have understood the thinkings of a physicist, I do not encourage you to try, but if you do find joy in solving problems, go on ahead. It is a fun class with a lot of learning, as long as you don't take homework as a burden.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material is very well taught and with help of other students, the workload is very manageable.",
    "This class will suck up your entire semester. It requires 10+ hours a week. But if you're choosing between this and 170, definitely choose this one. Steinacker is a really good professor and she takes the time to get to know each and every one of her students! She makes the class worth it."
