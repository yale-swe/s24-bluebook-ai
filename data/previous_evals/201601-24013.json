    "borderlands & border-crossers was an amazing class about the mexican-u.s. border & borderlands. it had a nice balance of genres (monographs, articles, novels, poetry, & film), & the option to do a creative project for your final project. there were weekly reading responses & a primary source-based midterm paper. professor brantley is a terrific facilitator & values all contributions. this class has illuminated for me the various borders in my own life, & how identifying them & how they operate can help me cross & transcend them.",
    "Great class with lots of reading. Professor Brantley knows how to lead discussion. Midterm and final project perfectly manageable.",
    "This class is a class about expanding our ideas of what the border is. This course makes you realize that physical borders are just one aspect into the lives and histories that make up the borderlands. This course both provides necessary history into the borderlands which is often left out in US history while still being critically relevant to our lives today.",
    "A much needed class that Yale has to offer. If you wish to understand US Mexican relations, please take this course. Take this course to become educated about how the US has formed within the international context of the borderlands, a topic that is often ignored but that means so much for modern politics.",
    "Would recommend the course if you have an interest in the topic, especially from the US-Mexico aspect of the borderlands. This may depend on the members of the seminar, but discussions are usually fascinating and insightful and never boring. You will be constantly engaged and the workload is reasonable."
