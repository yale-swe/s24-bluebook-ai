My student teacher was very accomplished and had great insights in technique, but its hard to replicate the instruction that an experienced faculty member can give.",
    "I wish there was less emphasis on repertoire and more on technique. I learned so much about technique and it sometimes felt like having to prepare so many songs for jury got in the way of learning."
