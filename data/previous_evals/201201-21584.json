    "The class has its perks and pitfalls. Perks include low workload (3 essays w\/edited rough draftsand a take-home final), not having to attend lecture all the time to be able to do the assignments, and some interesting reads. The main pitfall Jackson's boring lecture style. You choose which is more important to you: interesting class or easy WR.",
    "What a surprise! Who knew modern Brazilian literature was so beautiful? This is a fantastic survey of the best works, from the modern novel to the modern play to the modern poem. Professor Jackson's lectures are engaging and help to unpack the material, though there is little room for questions or discussion in class. Discussion section is the space in which to question and discuss the literature in a more round-table style. The feedback between drafts and final versions of essays helps to deepen one\u0092s independent readings.",
    "Definitely take this course to be able to read great literature and possibly get better at writing essays. Don't take this essay for it's lectures.",
    "A good class if you're interested in getting an introduction to some of the main works in Brazilian literature. I did not think the workload was overly difficult and Prof. Jackson is a chill, cool guy.",
    "It's a great class! You'll read a lot of great works of literature you won't read in any other class at Yale. Definitely worth taking. Plus pretty lenient grading\/overall course policies.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as you will learn a lot about Brazilian culture, poetry and literature!",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. It was great."
