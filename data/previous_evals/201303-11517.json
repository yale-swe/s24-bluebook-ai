    "It's definitely not a hard class if you're premed and used to taking hard science courses. Can't speak for everyone else, obviously. I lost interest very quickly in the material and didn't enjoy it much at all, but Arnsten is a very good lecturer, so as long as you care, then it'll be good. For me, though, it was so easy that I could get by with minimal effort since everything is given to you during the review sessions. Aw yeah.",
    "Interesting course but sort of weird style",
    "I would recommend the class to anybody who wants to get an understanding of how human brain works!",
    "it's a good class. not too easy, not too hard. if you're an english major and don't want to take a legit bitch work with all other english majors like issues approach, whatever. this is actually interesting and you don't have to go to lecture if you get notes from other people because it's mostly memorizatio. three tests (50 mins), a term paper (can be a play), a final. don't go to guest lectures, they don't make sense and you don't need to know them really anyway.",
    "This class is definitely not easy. You will have to study for every test and work hard on your paper, but the material is very interesting. I recommend this class to sciency people or anyone interested in the brain. I suggest taking this with friends.",
    "It's not a bad science credit after all. I do enjoy certain parts of the course, especially the few lectures discussing memory and language.",
    "Do take this course.",
    "This is a wonderful course that taught me a lot and prepared me to take future neuroscience classes. The lectures were interesting and accessible, and Professor Arnsten's analogies to art and music were incredibly interesting. I think the only thing that would improve this course is getting rid of a lot of the guest lectures because those were very hard to follow, and though those were brilliant professors, they could not simplify the information they were giving us so that we could understand it (especially the ones about the sensory systems).I highly recommend it! One of the best courses at Yale, and a genuinely interesting, important and doable science credit for non-science majors.Just be warned- there are three exams, plus a final paper and final exam back to back. But the exams are really doable and we often get the essay question beforehand. Also that means each exam is worth a lot less than in other introductory lecture courses.",
    "Take it! Sometimes humanities majors hate it, but if you're interested in psych or cog sci or the sciences at all, this is a great course and you can really see how it ties into your other classes. The subject material can be a lot sometimes but it's all just straight memorization and all of the review sessions the TAs held were helpful and really guided your studying for the test.",
    "Take it! It is definitely not a gut, but it is a great science credit for a non-major and it's a lot of fun. If you can get into the class (there is a cap at 120 students), take it.",
    "AMAZING CLASS, by far one of the best I have taken at Yale. I wish I had known about this class earlier in my Yale career \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it would probably have encouraged me to study cognitive science\/the brain more while at Yale. 100% take it if you can",
    "Easy class, pure memorization. Overrated class.",
    "Interesting content but confusingly taught. The professor assumes you know a lot of the stuff that's \"basic\" to her. Too much material is covered in a single semester with at least 300 new terms thrown at you without proper explanation. I did fine in tests by rote memorization, walked away with a very vague understanding of everything and a lot of questions left unanswered.",
    "It's a class about the brain. You learn sensory processing, memory processing, emotional function, emotional control mechanisms, unconscious habit processing, and information about some well known neurological disorders that's useful\/interesting knowledge to have. If you have any interest at all in how the brain works (it's really cool!) then take this class. If you need a science credit, take this class (specifically with Arnsten). It's not a gut, but it's not super hard. The best part about this class, aside from the material, is the review sessions. They tell you exactly what you need to know for the exams, and they tell you only what you need to know, ie they cut out all the random crap you might have studied had you not gone to the review sessions. The guest lecturers often were either too advanced or two fast\/specific, so often the material that we needed to know from those lectures they summarized in the review sessions (again, those are super useful). She also tells you the essay question for each of the midterms ahead of time, and it's usually something that she explains very carefully in class. The tests are a bunch of each fill in the blanks with a word bank and an essay that she tells you the questions for before hand. Take this class.",
    "This course was good overall. The course material is fascinating, but the lectures were hit or miss. Many of the guest lecturers were world-renowned researchers on the topic of the day, but being an expert doesn't necessarily translate into being able to deliver an accessible, easily comprehensible basic summary of your field of study. Professor Arnsten could probably do a better job of clarifying to the guest lecturers the level of knowledge and scientific background of the students in the class.Professor Arnsten's lectures were good, by and large, although a numberof the lectures could have been better organized, and the material could have been organized in a more logical way to conduce to the formation of interconnections between the different lectures. The first half of the class was less interesting than the second half. My discussion section spent too much time analyzing research papers and not enough time consolidating the material covered in lecture.I was a humanities\/social sciences person looking for a class that fulfilled the science requirement and intersected with the humanities and social sciences. This class is decidedly not a \"gut\"; if you do not have a biology background, you will need to invest a considerable amount of time studying. That being said, the information was extremely interesting, and the class gave a good picture of a rapidly developing field that has and will undoubtedly continue to shape the world in which we live. If you're looking for an extremely easy science class, look elsewhere; if you're looking for an interesting and useful class, you've found it.",
    "I really enjoyed Intro to Brain. The lectures were really fast paced, but she always posted the slides so it wasn't really necessary to go to class. No homework, but 3 midterms a paper and a final that you definitely need to study a fair amount for. Once you study it, the tests are pretty straight forward.",
    "I would recommend it to people who want a rudimentary understanding of how the brain works.",
    "I would recommend this for those with an interest in the human brain, particularly cog sci or psych majors",
    "Brain and Thought is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It was pretty low stress, but I learned so much about the human mind and body that I know I will remember for a long time to come. Professor Arnsten is a great lecturer, and I had a great TA, Emily Finn. This is easily one of the best science credits at Yale - take it!",
    "Definitely a must-take. Take it for your science credit and you'll leave with a great understanding of the human brain. The work is manageable, just go to review sessions and memorize everything. This isn't the typical read, memorize, and repeat class though. You have to understand systems. That being said, it was so worth it. Amy is making me reconsider my major.",
    "Human Brain is great if you want to learn how your brain processes things on a normal basis. You learn about the 5 senses which is very interesting, however you don't learn too much about mental illness.",
    "Excellent! Definitely take it if you have any interest in neuroscience, and ESPECIALLY if you have any family history\/friends who have suffered from mental disorders of brain damage. It'a a great course for non-science majors - not a gut, but not too much work either. Tests were fairly easy.",
    "I really wouldn't. I was looking for a science class for a non-science major that was interesting and challenging. It was definitely challenging in that I sometimes had no idea of what was going but didn't end up being nearly as interested as I thought it would. The first half is pretty exclusively brain mapping and background which is necessary but then the actual application ofthese knowledge doesn't come until much later and happens in very small amounts. The class just awkwardly bridges the gap between straight up science and occasionally disjointed random stuff.",
    "It is interesting and I would recommend it.",
    "Take this course! Even if you're a physics major, or a film studies major! Regardless of what you're interested in, you'll walk away with a wealth of knowledge about the human brain and really appreciate how lucky you are to have a healthy one!",
    "It was a great class that did not require too much work, except until around the end -- you take the third exam right before thanksgiving break, and then when you come back you have about a week and a half for the final paper and final exam. However, the rest of the semester is not stressful at all. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in getting an in-depth look into how the brain works. Do not expect to be engaged in broad or speculative discussion on 'thought.' This is closer to a biology class than any psychology or cognitive science class I have ever taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it gives you a foundational understanding of the neuroscience of human thought that underlies basic brain processes, beginning with simple things like how action potentials are generated in the brain, to more complex issues like the neurological causes of mental disorders like Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and schizophrenia; how memory is created and stored; how movement is generated and impaired in conditions like Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and the pathways involved in our auditory, olfactory, somatosensory, and visual processing systems. The lectures can definitely be confusing, and so in order to understand thematerial, you will need to consistently clarify concepts with your TF in section and attend the review sessions held before each of the three midterms and the final. The textbook required for the course is overly complicated and not worth reading. So while you will emerge having learned quite a bit, you may likely need to put in additional effort to clarify minutiae and iron out details that are often covered quickly in lecture. Also, Professor Arnsten brings in quite a few guest lecturers; while it nice was nice to hear from experts in the field, I found most guest lecturers overly confusing and much preferred Professor Arnsten\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lectures.",
    "If you are a non-science major and you need to just GET a science credit, this is a fine way to do it. The material is interesting. The class is a trudge, though, and not very well run.",
    "I definitely learned a lot from this class. The lecture slides and review sessions before midterms were especially helpful. The assigned reading wasn't entirely necessary. This class has a very light workload except for the time preparing for the 3 midterms and final. There is also on 10 page paper but the paper is fairly simple and creative. I enjoyed writing my paper. I would recommend this class to someone who needs a science distributional requirement. It helps to have taken biology in the past but it is not necessary. If you put in the time studying before tests and really take advantage of the information given in the review section, than you will do really well.",
    "Definitely definitely recommend. This is a great science credit for non-science students that don't want to take a total gut. It also has a lot of very science-intensive information and sections specifically for pre-meds that delve deeper into the scientific topics. It's really not much work - mandatory section, 3 exams, a final paper, and a final exam. The material is captivating and Amy is amazing. Take it! Pro-tip: don't buy the textbook. You don't actually need it for anything - she posts her lecture slides and they're more than sufficient.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the topic. If not, there are other science credits and classes to take. It's definitely interesting, but if you don't want to learn about the brain, you won't get as much out of it. The class isn't a lot of work, time wise, but there are definitely more challenging topics.",
    "Take the course! One of my favorite classes at Yale-- not hard, enjoyable material and professor, and you learn a ton! I would especially recommend it to someone who's interested for an intro to neuroscience course. This class gives a great overview. Trust me, you won't regret it! I can't give enough compliments about it.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who sincerely wants to get useful and relevant information out of her science credit instead of wasting it on a gut.",
    "Take it! It really isn't a lot of work. You really don't have to read the textbook.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE, ESPECIALLY WITH PROFESSOR ARNSTEN. You will come out of it knowing how your brain works on the most fundamental level!",
    "If you think you'd really be interested in the topic, its worth taking. However, definitely don't mistake this class for an easy A, as its quite a bit of information to take in.",
    "Almost a perfect science credit for non-science majors, so long as you're not looking for a gut. There's a decent amount of work, but it's completely doable even if you don't have a science background. It might help if you've taken a psych class before, though. It doesn't require much of anything quantitative, so if math scares you, you'll still be fine in this class. It's a good balance between looking really closely at neuroscience down to a molecular level and talking about the big implications of what you're learning about for things like addiction, mental illness, the effects of sleep deprivation, etc. I absolutely recommend this class!",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend cogcsi 201 to another student. Taking this class has given me a greater appreciation of the way the body works, and I really did enjoy almost every lecture.The workload isn't too bad--everyone says there's a lot of memorization, but you end up memorizing most things as you go along so that there isn't so much right when the test is approaching. There are three tests, one final, and one term paper, but it really is very manageable because there aren't any weekly assignments. The three tests were all reasonable--not too difficult at all--but the final was a bit trickier.My only complaint would be that guest lectures are quite often hit-or-miss. The bad news: you're still responsible for learning what they thought. Good news: TAs will tell you exactly what you should know (usually very little) from the guest lectures during review sessions.",
    "A challenging way to get a science credit. Take it from this senior - there are easier ways to get your credit if that's all you're looking for. If you truly want to learn about the brain, then by all means go ahead - this is a wonderful course that teaches you a LOT about brain function through many lenses. I enjoyed what I learned but it was challenging - 3 tests, a paper, and a final. Arnsten is a great professor, makes good jokes and keeps you entertained. Take it if you really want to learn about the brain.",
    "I do recommend it because it's interesting, but I don't really get the \"this is amazing!!\" feeling others seem to have. It was rather boring at parts when it became just tons of memorization of different circuits and complicated names for things. A LOT of material was covered in each lecture, and the book was generally unhelpful as it was a book for people in med school. The end of lectures when we talked about certain diseases or patients was the most interesting part.",
    "Take the course! If you are not a science person, you will definitely come away from this course with more than you ever will \"need\" to know about the brain. That said, the material is really fascinating and gave me a huge appreciation for just how complex the organ is. My thinking is if you're going to be carrying your brain around for the rest of your life, you might as well know something about the way that it works. If you're good at memorizing, you'll do fine on the tests (almost no reading is required). Professor Arnsten is a great lecturer and really integrates ideas from a lot of different fields to give you a coherent picture of the brain and thought.",
    "Definitely take it! Really great science credit for humanities majors. It's very interesting, and you don't have to have any previous science coursework to understand it, though it's by no means a gut (you definitely have to study before every exam, but it's not hard, just a lot of memorization). Professor Arnstein is an amazing lecturer: organized, knowledgeable, funny, and caring. There's a decent amount of work: 3 exams, final, and term paper, but the exams were all very fair, and there's a creative option for the paper. The final, however, was EXTREMELY detailed and much harder than the exams in my opinion. I definitely recommend getting together a study group for all the exams-it's really helpful for understanding and learning all of the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you have an interest in the brain and its functions. Be mindful that it is a lot of work to keep up with all the lessons, but it is worth it when you gain such a vast knowledge on the brain and its system. In the course, we explored everything from basic neuronal connections to the mechanisms of memory, the five senses, stress, emotions, and more, to disorders and illness in the brain. This is a great class, and Amy Arnsten is such an amazing professor; you'll love attending every lecture!",
    "I ended my spring semester never wanting to take another science class at Yale after chemistry ate my soul. But this course has reopened my mind and my heart to the sciences, providing an interesting and engaging avenue for me to explore the neural basis behind all the broad, abstract concepts I had been learning about in my psych and cogsci courses. Dr. Arnsten is deeply passionate about the subject matter and about teaching it to students in the clearest, most memorable way possible (got to strengthen that long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of course). I love the way she talks about neuroscience, like it is art and the brain is nature's greatest masterpiece. And after taking this course, I fully believe in that.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in the human brain! As a premed student, this was an extremely valuable course and I am so happy I took it. The workload is manageable and all the readings are supplementary to the lecture material. The tests are straightforward if you study hard, and Dr.Arnsten genuinely wants all of her students to do well!",
    "I would definitely take this course. It is a great course for learning about all fields related to the brain from not just a traditional science lecture course. You'll learn how all kinds of different fields intersect in neurology. You'll have to do a lot of studying, but it's really worth it to come away with an understanding of the human brain and even learn about the miracles of the human mind you never thought possible! This is such a great course!",
    "Learned a lot in this class, and enjoyed the diverse amounts of information that was taught. It was a very detailed intro course but interesting so well worth it.",
    "A manageable, unintimidating intro to neuroscience. Professor Arnsten is great -- the guest lecturers not so much. The three tests distributed throughout the semester end up being a lower percentage of your grade than you would expect; each is worth only 10%. Make sure you go to the reviewsessions! The lectures corresponding to each test contain a lot of material, but only some of that material is actually on the test and the TA's tell you exactly what you need to know at the review sessions. Overall, I would recommend it, especially if you need a science credit or you're a psych major like I am and need it for major requirements.",
    "I recommend Intro to the Human Brain to absolutely everyone I talk to. The lectures by Professor Arnsten are always intriguing and thought-provoking. Section was usually a much-needed revision of or addition to the material. There were enough assignments (three tests, a final paper, and a final exam) to make grades not too much of a concern, but the workload was never overwhelming.",
    "Highly recommend. The material is great, and so is the teaching.",
    "This class was a lot of work but I don't regret taking it for one second. You just learn SO MUCH! Prof Arnsten is brilliant and you should get to know her if you take this class. Ask her questions after lecture because she always has smart things to say. To do well: go to lectures (I didn't really take notes because I found it more useful to just listen) and DEFINITELY go to review sessions (the stuff covered there is usually all you really need to know for the tests).",
    "Great course to take if you are interested in learning about neuroscience at a basic level. However it is still quite a bit of reading and memorizing and there is a final term paper in addition to a final exam. Guest lecturers were sometimes a hit or a miss but Professor Arnsten was pretty good. Overall, would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this class if you feel like you have a decent grasp on basic biology. I do not and had a pretty rough time in this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Human Brain was an extremely interesting course that gives students insights into the neurological circuits of sensory and motor systems, and neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and bipolar disorder.",
    "It is a fun class. I would recommend it",
    "Good non-science major science credit. Not a gut - you still have to study hard for the 3 exams (and there is a paper and final as well) - but otherwise there isn't really work so it definitely isn't time consuming. Class is sometimes really interesting, but sometimes gets a little boring when we go over the really nitty-gritty stuff. Overall a good course and I'm happy I took it.",
    "Amy Arnsten is a wonderful person and professor. This is not a gut class, so don't take it if you're looking for a really easy science credit. But it is fantastic. Professor Arnsten is both passionate and very knowledgeable on the subject, and is an excellent lecturer. She's engaging and funny, making the lectures really enjoyable, even if a couple lectures are a bit drier. In particular, the last third of the course is fascinating. You'll learn about things that you will actually remember and use after you finish the course. Just a heads up, there's a cumulative final *and* a final paper, as well as three tests. BUT I would definitely recommend the course, and apart from tests and finals, the workload is really manageable.",
    "CogSci 201 is a terrific course - I HIGHLY recommend it. Engaging, accessible, and informative. It'll change the way you think about the mind. AND a science credit. Take it if you can.",
    "A great course for anyone interested in neuroscience. If you're at all interested in or curious about how the brain functions, you definitely need to take this course. ProfessorArnsten makes the course, first of all. She is amazing and makes the course material understandable to even those who have never taken a science course at Yale. I'll admit the material is inherently difficult sometimes, but definitely give it a shot, at least Credit\/D\/Fail to start. The course consists of 3 midterms, a final, and a final paper. Prior to each midterm and the final, the TFs hold a review session which literally tells you everything you need to know. The tests are fill-in-the-blank with a word bank and an essay section. The term paper is also very manageable. So overall, super interesting material, great professor, easy assessments. If you can take the course (Prof Arnsten caps it), do so.",
    "Absolutely. You need to pay attention every lecture, go to section, and read the papers, but if you're willing to expend the effort trying to understand, you will be so enchanted by this class. The concepts are amazing and fascinating and Professor Arnsten is a masterful lecturer. No complaints.",
    "Take this class!! Its amazing. I never want to miss a word. My favorite class. Was a delight to attend",
    "It is an overview of neuroscience not going into much depth about one main thing. My favorite class at Yale so far! I never got bored during lectures and it wasnt too hard of a class if you put in some work. I would recommend taking it even if you are not a science person.",
    "Yes. You should take it. It doesn't take that much work. Don't be discouraged when Dr. Arnsten said by the end of the semester, the material would get as hard as first year of medical school.",
    "This is not a gut class - there is a lot of memorization involved, and some reading of actual scientific papers, which is very difficult. But overall this is a fantastic course, accessible to anyone, and the topics covered are thought-provoking and relevant to many areas of life, including economics and literature. I definitely recommend it.",
    "This course was amazing! I learned a tremendous amount concerning the nervous system, how the senses work, and the basic circuitry of higher cortical processes like memory. The lectures were excellent; I thoroughly enjoyed the readings from A Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. The course has given me a greater appreciation for the human body and the little things in life (like being able to move our arms properly or use or eyes to read this) that we often take for granted.",
    "You should take this class. It is a good science credit, and you will learn a ton about the brain. The tests are very fair as long as you go to lecture and study the day before. This class was totally worth it.",
    "This is a great class for a science credit. I am not a particularly sciencey person, but I really enjoyed this course. Honestly, some people think this class is easy, but I did not find that to be the case. That being said, the information is really cool and interesting, and I found the course as a whole to be very rewarding.",
    "Really good science credit. The material itself is a little complicated but the tests and final are very fair and are considerably easier than the actual material. It is just some basic memorization of terms and essay prompts and then the tests are fill in the blank. If you liked science courses like bio, this is the class for you (I personally hated bio but figured I would rather have to do memorization than be talked down to and do basic algebra in planets and stars)",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! The material is fascinating and even exciting- of all the classes I took that semester, I probably told my friends most about Brain. The workload is manageable.",
    "This course gives youa nice overview to specifics of the human brain. I would recommend it for a manageable science class. Study for the tests and address questions you have with lecture early on so it doesn't build up for the final exam. The final covers material from the entire year. The paper was fun to write and helped me remember diseases for the final. If things start blurring together, try and take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Professor Arnsten is very passionate about the material and Wendy was a great TF.",
    "I would! Although, it's not for everyone, and you have to put in a lot of work to get the grades you want. Although each of the three non-cumulative exams are only worth 10%, you have to know a lot of material (even the details you thought you wouldn't have to know) in order to score well. The testing format is about 25-30, sometimes even 35-ish fill-in-the-blank questions, and then one essay at the end. The fill-in-the-blanks are normally worth 3 points, and the essays can range from 30-40 points. It's a great class and you learn so much about the brain, and if you're into that kind of stuff, this will be a nice science credit! Just be aware that near the end of the semester, you have the 3rd exam, you have about 4 more lectures that cover completely new concepts, a final paper, and a final exam over everything. Just try to be mindful of your own strengths and weaknesses, and really try to space things out.",
    "Though this class is CERTAINLY NOT A GUT, if you work hard you will most likely reap the rewards. Try to get Emily as a TF if she's still teaching!",
    "Absolutely take this. As a non-science major, this class was an appropriate level of difficulty and I learned so much.",
    "Take this class!! It debunks all myths about science not being approachable or for creative-minded people. It is incredibly interesting and insightful (you will come away knowing how to explain what is going on in your brain when you are stressed, awake, tired, remembering things, forgetting things, and when you are under the influence of different routine medications like Benadryl and not-so-routine ones like cocaine). Two lectures per week by Dr. Arnsten (one of the most captivating lecturers you'll have), 1 section meeting per week with fantastic TAs, 3 midterms, 1 final, and 1 final paper (where your creativity gets a chance to combine with what you've learned, and one of my favorite parts of the course).",
    "Yes!! Definitely a great, interesting science credit and super useful if you're studying psychology or cognitive science. Lectures are usually interesting (unless a guest lecturer is speaking-- in which case they make absolutely no sense), and section is useful and fun. Reading isn't required, and as long as you go to the review session before the tests they aren't too bad. The final was a little harder than I expected, though. Overall-- a good, fun science credit that helps you understand your brain a whole lot better.",
    "I highly recommend this course! Professor Arnsten is a terrific lecturer and the content is fascinating especially if you have any prior interest in how the brain works or in mental illness. The course is completely manageable as a non-psych\/cog-sci major. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like spending time memorizing then this course may not be for you because you do have to put in some memorization time to study for the tests. If you are willing to spend some time memorizing then this is a terrific QR if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for one!",
    "Summary: difficult, consistent workload with many assignments, totally worth it.As a philosophy major who rarely has to memorize a hundred concepts or systems for a test, it took me a while to adjust to the rigorous requirements of this course, but I thought it was fabulous. While some of the lectures or ways that ideas are framed (e.g. CNS as a corporation) are a little hokey, Amy Arnsten really makes the brain come alive, and the course makes you appreciate how awe-inspiring your body is. I wish I'd taken this course earlier, as I might've pursued more neuroscience if I had.While you don't need to read any of the textbook, you MUST take good lecture notes and study hard for tests. [Check out Quizlet for pastyears' flashcards of terms, and create section GoogleDocs to review if you're okay with some people being total free-riders.]This is not a gut, and I'm glad it wasn't. If you have no desire to learn intricacies of the nervous system, this isn't for you, but if you think it would be cool to understand why you never forget how to ride a bike or learn why some brain-damaged people can catch a ball coming at them that they never report seeing, then you won't regret taking this class. I'm very grateful for the foundational understanding of neuroscience this course gave me.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I learned a lot of things I would not have learned otherwise, and I find science much more interesting now. I feel that I have a basic understanding of the brain after beginning with no knowledge of it whatsoever.",
    "This course is not a gut, but if you want a science credit where you actually feel like you're learning useful things, this is a great course to take.",
    "Dr. Arnsten emphasizes that this is not a gut, which is more or less accurate. It's not painful, but it does require some work (though the final paper is really easy; just 10 pages of creative writing). As a non-science major looking for a SC credit, I really enjoyed this class. Unlike most science guts, the material is interesting and something you can take with you after the class is over. If you need a science credit and want a bit of a challenge, I definitely recommend this.",
    "Yeah, take it - Science credit or not.",
    "If you need a science and don't mind a lot of memorization, then take this class. You will end up learning something, even if you don't fully understand. Also there isn't that much work (just studying for three tests, the final, and a final paper).",
    "I would recommend the class, but be aware that it is a science credit with a lot of work.",
    "Professor Arnsten teaches to non-science majors without teaching down to them. This class is well organized and interesting and assessments are fair and straightforward. Attend lectures; don't bother with the textbook.",
    "Fantastic class, manageable work, very interesting. Middle road in terms of difficulty.",
    "It's a nice, not terribly hard introduction to neuroscience, just as it says.",
    "The material of the class can be pretty interesting at times, but Professor Arnsten moves through everything pretty quickly. The guest lectures can also be both very quick and incomprehensible at times. Most of the material is straight memorization though, so it's not all that difficult to figure things out and memorize them for the 3 midterms. The final can be tricky though, as the essay questions were much more in-depth than previous tests. Interesting material for the most part, but not always presented in the best way, and can get pretty dull at times too.",
    "Best class I've taken here",
    "This is a good course! You get as much out of it as you put into it, so it's very fair. I would warn against this course if you aren't good at memorizing things. It's not a gut, but really easy if you put work into it. There are 3 tests, a final and a final essay so be warned about the work load.",
    "This is a good class - definitely not a gut, but not terribly challenging either. Arnsten is an incredible lecturer.Most of the work is studying for the test (readings are not required, and there are no assignments besides the 10 page 'creative' final paper). Though I appreciated not having to learn the chemical equations that explained the processes we learned about, I think the materialwas sometimes too watered down. Tests were almost entirely based on rote memory, and I have a feeling I'll forget most of what I learned in six months. If you are looking for a medium-level science credit, I'd recommend taking a more interactive class.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing neuroscience and learning how the brain works! It's an interesting class with a great teacher and a manageable workload.",
    "Psychology 120 01 is a quality science course at Yale. You will learn. That really is the sentence that must be used. You will learn. That is the greatness of this course. There is so much to learn and so little time. More importantly, the information is useful and interesting. One does not need to be a pre-med student to enjoy this course."
