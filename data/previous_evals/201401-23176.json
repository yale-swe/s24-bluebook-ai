   "comments": [
    "Some talks were great and opened my eyes to methodologies or subject areas I was previously unaware of. Others contributed practically nothing and felt like a waste of time -- although those may have been talks that contributed substantially to other students' research interests.I honestly think that overall, attending social talks probably hurts my dissertation research because it is a considerable amount of time away from more productive pursuits, and the benefits of attending are so remote and\/or improbable. But I appreciate the value of being forced to hear new ideas and being exposed to voices from outside of Yale. But this question is about how much my research improves from the experience, and I think the honest answer is little, once you factor in the opportunity cost of all the Monday mornings we could have been getting work done.The main value to SL, as I see it, is to see all my colleagues (when they show up, of course!) and to practice attending talks, asking good questions, hearing something you know nothing about but engaging with it nonetheless, etc. I would add, though, that if the goal of social lunch is to acculturate us into academia, we should be prompted to ask more questions or engage with speakers in a way that our discipline approves us. I think too many students use the time as a chance to catch up on email!"
