    "I would tell them that it's a discussion class, and a good way to have questions answered about issues that are peripheral to science.I feel that not all speakers are equal, nor are content. Some speakers would prefer to talk for 45 minutes, while others are receptive to questions andattempt to engage students. Likewise, some material (e.g., grant process or patents) was very memorable and useful. Other material (e.g., lab dynamics) was fluffy, self-evident, and largely common sense."
