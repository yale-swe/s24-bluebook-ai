    "Take it if you took level 1..",
    "Take it if you want to learn French, but really, starting a language from L1 is a bit of a drag.",
    "Professeur Ngame is really good. He explains everything really clearly and is very understanding if you have a problem.",
    "You get out of it what you put into it. If one works really hard, one can get a lot out of it. Its a great course, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to really learn French well.",
    "An excellent class. Definitely great preparations for higher level French. I really learnt a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wants to learn French and is willing to put in the time and work that is needed for this class. If you do everything you are supposed to do for this class then you will definitely do well.",
    "Definitely take it",
    "Take french, the french are awesome, it is useful to be able to communicate with them in order to buy the best cheese.",
    "Very much recommend taking the course with Professor Ngame. One of the best French teachers.",
    "Take it if you want to learn french, this will be a lot of work but it will be worth it.",
    "French 120 was a lot of fun, and a very rewarding experience in learning a language, since you can see how far you've progressed in a very short amount of time and take pride in that.",
    "FREN 120 is amazing, but seriously a lot of time. It makes monday night (test night) absolutely miserable, but by the end I couldwork through sources for my history class. Very worthwhile. Get Ngame, he is awesome.",
    "The French program here is great, and that really shows in French 110\/120. If you can, take it with Prof. Ngame; he's the best language teacher I've ever had. All the other sections were jealous.",
    "This is a good class if you want to work hard and actually learn French. There's a regular stream of homework, which is manageable if you don't fall behind. Definitely take it \u0097 you'll learn a ton."
