    "Developed technical skills in rudimentary Python and R coding. Expanded my understanding of how social media hoovers up personal information and how the dark web works.",
    "I learned a lot about the different tools available for big data analysis, as well as their applicability.",
    "- A better understanding of what big data encompasses. - The different uses and applications of big data. - The risks big poses and the challenges it creates, and an idea of how these challenges can be overcome.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Variety of voices in the class, variety of data tools explored Weakness: Conversations often drifted",
    "Strength: rich in discussion, good homework (applicable in real life) Weakness: homework may be frustrating for those who are not tech savy",
    "The content of the class is fascinating, the discussion in seminar was always interesting, and the guest lectures were enjoyable. Student presentation - though by and large great learning tools - could potentially be cut down a little in favor of more group discussion and\/or guest lectures. Additionally, while often this was a feature rather than a bug, the assignments for the class were occasionally overly-vague.",
    "Strengths Prof. King is incredibly insightful and cares a ton about his students. Weaknesses Sometimes didn't feel like there wasn't full accountability to complete assignments - assignments felt sporadic. Would've been nicer to have assignments on the books we read - I read all the books but often didn't feel comfortable voicing my views in a class full of smart technologists, but had a lot I wanted to say. As a big data novice, having more time in class devoted to technical skills would've been great.",
    "I couldn't find any weaknesses for this class, so I will just speak on the strengths. I think the seminar form of this class really gets the discussion going, especially around heated topics. The class is deliberately chosen from a diverse group of people, and they all have something interesting to contribute from their point of view. The students also form a camaraderie unseen in any class I have taken during my three years here. It is definitely the best way to spend your Thursday nights on campus.",
    "Strengths: free-flowing nature of syllabus and class allowed students to self-select what they wanted to focus on. Professor identified student interests and helped them develop cool concepts to pursue those interests. The \"throw 'em in the deep end\" approach worked really well for properly \/ intrinsically-motivated students. Weaknesses: the free-flowing nature was sometimes...too free. Some students need to learn to listen to and engage with others in the class, and other students need to be told that their BSing is transparent.",
    "I thought the course had the perfect balance of covering the basics of each topic while including enough topics to give me a strong understanding of the general landscape.",
    "Strengths: - Extremely motivated and ambitious fellow students. - Fascinating topic that is becoming increasingly relevant in today's day and age. - Presentations were given by extremely interesting guest speakers. Weaknesses: - Too much time during class was spent debating. Personally, I would have preferred a slightly more structured class. - The readings were not always discussed. This was a shame because some readings included entire books so after putting in the effort and reading them I would have enjoyed a thorough analysis of the material.",
    "It does meet later than other Yale courses. But overall, it is an amazing course.",
    "Strength: - the number of students taking this course was not so big, thus in-class discussions are always lively - various types of guest lectures enrich my understanding and expose me to different kind of applications of big data - the reading materials are not so \"heavy\" but capable of explaining wide range of technical details in big data - students' projects are all inspiring",
    "Amazing professor and interesting material.",
    "Phenomenal course for many reasons. Very gripping start, at the end it turned a bit uncoordinated",
    "The strengths of this course was teaching students how to effectively evaluate big data and discuss the ethical issues that it raises In our modern day society. Its weakness lies in its lack of setting students for success in having the technical competency to run experiments via exercises or readings.",
    "Strengths: Instructor, guest speakers, readings, homework Weaknesses and possible improvement: The classroom might be better equipped for a lecture involving use of laptops.",
    "The strengths are the coursework materials; the instructors unique experience that provides him with an original perspective to issues; the wide range of experiences from classmates; the final projects; and the relevance of the topic. The weaknesses might be that some issues that were explored in course materials never were discussed and addressed in class. The room was too big, and that impacted negatively the discussions. I also think there were too many guests and problems to communicate with those that were not in the classroom made it hard to be engaged."

   "comments": [
    "YES. Very smart set of students in the course, that I intend to maintain relationships with after graduation.",
    "Yes! I have recommended the class to my friends.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It's a helpful foundational course on big data and its various dimensions but if you are looking to get technical skills as well, without modifications this course won't get you there. But Prof. King is a great mentor and someone you absolutely want to have in your corner. He's generous with his time and you can tell he really wants to be there. I also wish the assignments were a bit more practitioner heavy - I'd have loved to write memos about technology policy and how governments or companies should respond to big data.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It has been the best course I have taken here at Yale. The intellectual challenge part of this course is mostly the programming aspect, and you will learn how much you want to put into the class. The workload is low, and the class only meets once a week.",
    "Yes--but only if that student is intrinsically motivated to pick up some technical skills that will help them answer questions or explore phenomena that are interesting to them. If they're looking for a course to teach them what Big Data is, this course will be less satisfying.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. It's not necessary to have any programming background.",
    "For students who are curious about the societal implications of big data I would recommend the course. However, I would make them aware that the course relies heavily on class participation and discussion, student presentations, and occasional guest speakers, as opposed to structured lecture style class.",
    "Yes, definitely. Very interesting course with amazing discussion every week. Innovative materials.",
    "Yes. I will especially recommend this course to students coming from or planning to enter public sector. Aside from showing how powerful big data is, this course also sharpened my analytical thinking and forced me to assess the broader unintended consequences of big data developments.",
    "Yes. Purely to take a course with Professor king.",
    "Unfortunately, this course delivers below the expectations one has when reading the syllabus and considering that Dr. Casey King is the Professor. Weekly assignments are spontaneously given, not really checked upon and without a clear purpose. Overall, in my opinion, the course lacks objectives and paths to achieve them. Might be a good course to audit.",
    "Yes, its a great course to be exposed to the topic but also to your bright and mostly experienced fellow students in interesting debates and presentations",
    "Yes, for gaining the perspective of the impact and trade-offs of utilizing technology in our society. This is especially important for those who want to work in the tech industry or innovate through tech.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to person who did not have previous experience with big data or to a student with big data experience who did not think about it from the public policies perspective.",
    "I would. I think its a great opportunity for those with a tech background to discover the policy and ethical implications of their work, as well as for those with a policy background to understand the capabilities of big data and technologies linked to it.",
    "If someone were to ask me what course I'd most recommend to another student at Yale, it would be this course. The subject matter (to paraphrase: what is society to make of the massive data explosion of the digital era) is more relevant than ever and Professor King perfectly picked presentation and discussion topics, readings and guest lecturers that made you face the nuances of this conundrum head-on."
