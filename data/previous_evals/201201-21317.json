    "Yes! Can be boring, but it is what you make it. Easy to do well.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Shakespearian literature in any way, even if you don't read music. This class thoroughly explores Shakespeare, both through music and through themes, and I'd bet that the level of individual attention we all got means that our exploration of the texts is more through that a large lecture in another department could provide to us. It's also an amazingly stress-free course given its depth.",
    "Shakespeare and Music is great if you love Shakespeare; it is an opportunity to delve deeply into a specific aspect of the texts in a way that wider-range high school Shakespeare classes can't do. The class is also great if you love music history; using Shakespeare's text as a constant, the class tracks the trajectory of popular theater music from the 16th to the 20th century. If you love both, thenshame on you if you don't take this class.",
    "A solid fifth class. It's best if you don't know that much about Shakespeare or music, since if you do you'll feel a little bored, but the material is interesting. Professor Malafronte is a lot of fun and an engaging teacher, and the field trips are great.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. For us, there was a lot of work if you did it all, and though you didn't have to do it all, it was really great to learn. It was fascinating to learn about music in Elizabethan times and then see how Shakespeare has been adapted in so many other forms. In that way, I felt that I got to see the variety of history and genre within music, which is inspiring for taking future music courses. Also, it was a great chance to go to the Sound Archives, Music Library, and the Met in NYC.",
    "If you're interested in the intersection of Shakespeare and music, then this course is for you. It was pretty much what it was advertised as and I learned quite a few interesting things. In the first half things felt a bit disorganized, but that improved as the course went on. This was the first time the course was taught, so undoubtedly that will improve in future offerings. Professor Malafronte is great, and is really enthusiastic about Shakespeare and music. There were lots of cool field trips--to the Metropolitan Opera and the Yale Sound Archives, for example--and the course has a fairly light workload, so it's a fun course to balance out your schedule that will still teach you some important things.",
    "Shakespeare and Music is an excellent course to take if you enjoy Shakespeare's works, or if you have an interest in musical history. The workload is very easy (perfect for a fifth class) but also very entertaining and enjoyable."
