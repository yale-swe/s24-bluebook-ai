   "comments": [
    "Really good class for getting a feel for experimental techniques while also going more in depth into molecular biology.",
    "The class can be summarized as a detailed study of the all major aspects of gene regulation starting from chromatin ending at protein degradation. Class has a major focus on the methods used to investigate these topics.",
    "This course covers important concepts of eukaryotic translation and transcription and protein degradation. The topics are very crucial to molecular biology, and this course will give introductions of experimental designs. The discussion sections, exams, and proposal also force you to think of ways to design experiments using concepts from lecture.",
    "This course is a great overview course of eukaryotic biology and the techniques most commonly encountered in research of eukaryotes. I would recommend this course to someone, particularly as the required cell bio course for BBSB track",
    "I would say that it is an in-depth survey of the processes involved in eukaryotic biology, such as DNA replication and repair, RNA transcription, degradation and translation, and protein degradation. The class also includes historical findings and recent papers relevant to the topics covered for discussions. I would definitely recommend this course for another student as I thought I learned a significant amount.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course. Although very difficult and technically detailed, it provides a great conceptual framework that will be invaluable to anyone working in the Biological Sciences.",
    "A good overview of the pathways and methodology surrounding RNA and DNA. If that's what you're going to study, it's a good class to take.",
    "I think this is a great course, and it teaches more stuff that I have ever learned about eukaryotes. I highly recommend the course if the workload is manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who needs a solid background in cellular and molecular biology. The class also teaches you a lot of techniques that can be used in your own research and you learn to criticalyl assess other people's experiments",
    "Was expecting a strong survey in molecular biology - which we received, but in much more detail than required. Understanding molecular biology in eukaryotes does not dictate an atomic-level understanding and memorization of each specific factor involved in so many different pathways."

   "comments": [
    "This course served to further education from my past degree and will not attribute to my discipline or research.",
    "It forced me to think critically about experimental design, and the concepts presented are important for basic understanding of molecular biology. Learning about techniques like EMSA, Chip-Seq, etc. will definitely help with my research understanding.",
    "I found many of the course lectures inspiring in thinking about follow-up experiments\/questions and even applications to my own research. I definitely know much more about eukaryotic biology than I did previously, and much of the knowledge gained here will assist me in my future research",
    "While much of the content does not align directly with what I will be doing in lab I thought that the class was very useful to take to broaden my knowledge of eukaryotic biology so I could be better educated for many of the department lecturers that we host.",
    "This course will play a very large role in preparing me for departmental requirements and my research. Not only did this course serve as a in-depth investigation of eukaryotic biology, but also as a look into modern research of professors here at Yale.",
    "I now know a lot more about import\/export pathways than ever before.",
    "It teaches me about biology more than I ever had."
