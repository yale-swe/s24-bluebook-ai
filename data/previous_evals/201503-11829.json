   "comments": [
    "ENGL 114 01 is one of the easier English classes, with a lesser workload and very receptive professor. Though it was not the class I thought it would be (I expected a greater focus on literature), I did find that my reading of articles and scholarly journals did improve.",
    "Yes I would recommend it",
    "English 114 is touted as the \"must take freshman writing class,\" but I think the section that you're in REALLY matters. My section gave me writing practice, but didn't really teach me any new writing skills. I don't think we mentioned the word thesis once in class the entire semester. Professor Walsh is really kind and tries to foster a community atmosphere in the class, and I enjoyed the readings, but I didn't feel like I learned very much.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to any student who wishes to improve his or her writing skills. This course has helped me for writing assignments in other courses.",
    "I would summarize ENGLE 114 01 for a fellow student as an excellent introductory writing course that gives you more insight into the function of the humanities in society. Yes, I would recommend this class to another student because I think that I was lucky to have taken such an interesting class with such engaging material."
