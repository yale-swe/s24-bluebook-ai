    "Krystyna is the best Prof at Yale, very understanding and easy to get a good grade from. Great class moves at a fairly good pace. Polish was the best decision ive made at Yale so far. If you have a chance to take anything from her do it!",
    "It is not a terribly difficult class in terms of work but the language is a difficult one so you will have to put in the work to learn it. I would recommend it as an easier way to fulfill the language requirement in a language which is rather common in some parts of the northeast.",
    "The course is not very difficult, fun, and provides a good forum in which to practice one's language skills (it's a pretty intimate setting). Prof. Illakowicz is also more than willing to meet with students outside of class in order to cover supplemental material.",
    "You continue through the textbook, with nightly writing assignments. Take it!!",
    "Polish is awesome. You will not regret taking this class.",
    "I would recommend this only if you're willing to work long hours."
