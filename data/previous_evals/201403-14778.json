    "An odd course by virtue of the fact that the material it covers is, well, odd. But AMAZING AND A MUST TAKE",
    "A solid overview of the Spanish Inquisition, it is a great opportunity to look at one of the more feared and interesting institutions of the 16th and 17th centuries. Professor Schwartz is (as usual) absolutely fantastic and someone that is both extremely knowledgable and extremely approachable. Take this if you want a seminar that isn't crazy work heavy, has good consistent readings, and if you want to get into historical\/religious discussions or debates.",
    "This is a great course. I would recommend being assertive, perhaps even aggressive for those with more laid-back personalities, in posing one's opinions and ideas during seminar discussion."
