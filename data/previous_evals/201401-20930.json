    "Better than 165L. The final is hard, and you'll be rushed for time, but you probably have to take this class. Get Prash as a TA!!",
    "It's typical of what you'd think an intro physics lab is. We did a lot of circuitry\/electric things, and lots of LoggerPro. If you have to take it, it's really not a bad course; if you don't have to take it, then only do it if you're interested in frequencies and amplitudes, speakers, beats, capacitors, resistors, etcetc.",
    "This class is a good introductory physics laboratory course that covers a variety of material related to BOTH 171 and 181. It does not matter which class you are in because the labs apply to both. I would only recommend this course if you have to take it. It is interesting and the lab are well thought-out. They are generally not too long either.",
    "Basic physics lab on electricity and magnetism. Some labs are longer than others, but overall it was a good semester, better than the fall.",
    "Similar to 165.",
    "A fine lab course to go along with the E&M section of the introductory physics curriculum. I took this course alongside phys 181, and unlike the previous semester, the topics didn't match up between the two classes too often. There was a bit of time in the course where we focused on things such as signal analysis that were never covered in lecture, but concepts like that were easy to grasp and well-taught. The course overall didn't run very long-- we got out early every week, and the work required for post-labs was two to three hours a week at most. TAs and professors were very helpful, but still hands-off enough to give us an understanding of the experiments. The course utilizes a much more practical approach to E&M than the lectures do, which definitely helps in understanding the more practical topics such as circuits and optics. Overall, it's not an oh wow course, but if you have to take it, there's no reason to be dreading it.",
    "It's a good class.",
    "Useful course to apply second-semester physics concepts.",
    "Good course, take it.",
    "I would recommend this! It's not an overwhelmingly large amount of work or time commitment!",
    "It's not a great class and only take if if you have to. I would not recommend this class.",
    "I only reccomend this course if you have to.",
    "You're probably taking this class as a requirement but it's still good as far as labs go. Not too much work and fairly engaging assignments. Make sure you pick a good lab partner!",
    "I think most people only take PHYS 166L because it is a requirement. I wouldn't recommend PHYS 166L as a fun class, but I did learn from it. The practical exam at the end is really stressful. I would say to rotate doing different tasks with your partner throughout the semester to get a good feel of all the equipment you use.",
    "Okay course, kinda fun to play with the cool physics equipment you use in lab. Also, the material sometimes is a nice complement to the PHYS181 curriculum.",
    "Much better than 165, TA's and professors are friendlier and better to work with. Material is more conceptual and theoretical, but so much more interesting as well.",
    "Like all required labs at Yale, you probably have to take it. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. However, it is a fairly relaxed lab. It ends in about two hours, and the instructors\/TA's are very helpful.",
    "This lab goes along very well with the second semester of PHYS 171, which made the labs much easier to follow. The experiments are very different than the Phys 165 course, but I found this one easier since it was more of the material covered by Phys 171. Not much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student with a physics\/engineering major, and would definitely recommend my TA, Joe Panzik.",
    "You probably have to take it, in which case it's not very painful. It seems so sometimes, but the instructors are very helpful and they try very very hard to make it somewhat exciting. You should appreciate it. Try to get a good TA, and sometimes the labs teach you more about physics than your physics class. I have definitely come out of lab knowing more and appreciating physics more than in class. If you keep an open mind about it, and not begrudge it, it's manageable.",
    "I only took this because I had to, of course, but I thought it had a lot of potential and was reasonably happy about taking it at the beginning of the semester. Having taken 165L last semester, I thought I knew what to expect. I was definitely excited to get to work with Professors Ramos and Cahn again - both of whom are very kind and knowledgable. But, tragically, I lost the TA draw, and this sealed my fate. My TA, Raymond, did not have any idea what was going on in any of the labs. His pre-lab lectures were consistently unhelpful, and he could never really answer my questions about the experiments. But, given that I didn't have any idea what was going on either, and that he's only a first-year grad student, his confusion wasn't really something I could fault him for. I ended up deferring to Professors Ramos and Cahn for help during the lab sessions, which worked out very well. What was upsetting was that it seemed like Raymond attempted to make up for not being able to teach with draconian grading. It was both ridiculous - he took off points for harmless things like pages being out of order - and unfair - I got many bad lab grades for not including random mysterious graphs that were never mentioned in the lab manual or by him in class. His grading policy also mysteriously changed from week to week. Having to deal with Raymond's grading was an incredibly stressful and painful experience. And it made me dread lab class. So, then, here's my big sweeping idea for improving this class: ABANDON THE TA SYSTEM. Have the professors do all the teaching (pre-lab, during lab, etc.) because they, unlike some first year graduate students, actually know what's going on. Make grading uniform, and don't delegate it to TAs who feel pressured to take off points to compensate for their own incompetence. Yes, this would be a radical change, but it would also LITERALLY FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS EVERYONE HAS WITH THIS CLASS. So I think it's worth considering.",
    "I would recommend as a requirement, or if you have a deep-seated desire to take physics lab. Overall, I found it very informative regarding fundamentals and am glad I took it, if only to help me understand concepts on the MCAT.",
    "Awfully tedious.",
    "It's really only a lab you take if you have to. It's not terrible, and some labs are interesting at points. The lab reports are annoying but certainly doable. Nothing you can really do to prepare for the practical exam but at least this one was better than first semester.",
    "Yes, it's a good intro physics lab. You learn how to work with basic E&M equipment, and have a good time doing so.",
    "It's lab. Not too bad.",
    "I don't actually like physics, but this lab was pretty good. I took it along with PHYS 171, and I definitely felt like I grasped the concepts better for having seen them in lab. There's only a one-page lab summary each week, and you don't have to spend more than 10 minutes prepping for lab each week. Pretty much no one will take this lab if it's not a requirement, so the only questions left are about when to take it. I would recommend taking the lab at the same time as the lecture because they really do reflect each other (like I said, the lab definitely helped me in lecture), but it would okay to do later as well. Also you could totally handle this lab without having taken 165 before - there are a few things you would need to pick up, but if you're schedule works best that way I wouldn't worry about it.",
    "If you're considering this class, you likely have to take it. However, it's not too bad, and the workload isn't heavy, so you'll be fine.",
    "A counterpart to PHYS 181, but its quality far surpasses that of PHYS 181's! Of course, choose your TA wisely (avoid Ravi like the plague), but other than that, it's a wonderful course in small part because the topics covered are interesting, but in large part due to Sid. He's one of the best professors I've met at Yale, and that's after only sporadically talking with him.",
    "You're going to have to take it so take it.",
    "Good lab if you have to take it. Not much work since only 1 page lab reports and relatively easy labs.",
    "one of the best labs i've taken. very straightforward instructions and the experiments were easy enough to allow for good data collection while still being challenging and interesting! the instructors were super helpful too!",
    "You probably have to take this class. It isn't bad. A standard continuation of PHYS 165L.",
    "don't take it if you can avoid it. but if you do, make sure to get Danielle because she's got your back and super fun",
    "PHYS 166L is more interesting but challenging than PHYS 165L. It mainly involves working on circuits and wave analysis. If you need to take it, it's a good physics lab to take.",
    "Basic physics lab similar to 165. You probably are taking it because you need to. I felt like the lab aligned very nicely with Physics 171. Actively playing with circuits and completing the activities helped me understand the concepts.",
    "This is one of those classes that most people only take because they have to. It's not bad, but pretty tedious. It's very similar to Phys 165L. Reports are short and the final practical exam was reasonable. Overall, your experience will depend a lot on your TA. For what it's worth, I did not think this lab helped me as much with the lecture material for 181 as 165L had helped for 180; this lab seemed to follow 171 more closely.",
    "I would recommend it if you have to take it. Otherwise it's way too work intensive\/too much class time for 0.5 credits unless you're super interested in signal analysis. It's actually not a bad course at all besides the time drain\/handwritten lab notebooks.",
    "Good course, very similar to the first semester of physics lab. If you spend a time making sure that your lab reports are thorough, its not hard to get high grades.",
    "Take it if you have to. I was in the 205 lab previously and this one was better organized.",
    "If you are taking it, you are probably taking it because you have to. But really, it's not bad at all. You learn a lot, and things in lecture will seem so much easier once you get similar things done in lab. Just know what's going on in each of the labs and you'll be fine!",
    "Only premeds are really in the course. It's less work than most other pre-med labs but the grading seems pretty arbitrary most of the time for reports. Lab can be a real struggle at times, although the lab reports are only one hour long. Beware the practical is just as difficult as 165L.",
    "If you have to take it for pre-med requirements, you're pretty much just reading this to know what you're in for since you'll have to take this anyway. The lab itself seemed better than last semester (or maybe I'm finally getting used to physics), but some of the labs were difficult to follow and the TA was not always helpful. (Definitely hope that you get a helpful, knowledgeable TA because that makes all the difference I think). Practical didn't seem as bad as last semester's but it was still pretty challenging. Basically, just grit your teeth, take the lab, have some candy that Prof. Cahn gives out, and you'll get through it.",
    "I found it to be better than PHYS 165, but that's probably because I got used to it.",
    "Only take this as a lab credit.",
    "It's very similar to 165, maybe slightly better. Instructors do a good job of making it as painless as possible, but don't take it unless you have to.",
    "This class did not stay in canon with the lecture as much as before. However, labs were interesting and challenging, making the experience enjoyable.",
    "This is a fine class. The labs are pretty engaging, and the reports are very straightforward. My only recommendation is to take the class in conjunction with second semester physics. I didn't, and it was definitely harder to understand the concepts because the lab doesn't fully explain them.",
    "yes! (you probably have to take it but Yale does it well!)",
    "PHYS 166L is a very good segue for what was covered in PHYS 165L and a great complement to the PHYS 171 lecture. I believe if the lecture and lab classes continue to coordinate with one another, the students will develop a greater understanding and appreciation for the material covered in both classes. It is one thing to discuss the concept, it is anther to actually experiment with and observe it.",
    "This is a Physics lab course that covers about the same material as PHYS 181. It really helps you understand circuits, magnetic flux, and other physics concepts better. I would not recommend it if you aren't premed, but if you are looking for a rather chill lab, this lab is definitely more chill compared to orgo lab.",
    "I would say this is an overall good lab course. If you're taking this it's probably required, but as far as lab classes go it's not that bad.",
    "You probably have to take this class, but it's not bad. Lab reports are manageable.",
    "Probably easier than the 200s. Write ups were easy and only 1 page, the lab itself was always very frustrating .",
    "Well you're likely taking this because it's required and you're scared of 206. If you've taken 205, a lot of the material (with circuits and scopes and signals especially) will be repeated. Probably less so with 165 but I can't speak to that. The class is pretty relaxed overall - 'lab reports' are a page and aside from marginal soul-sucking for 4 hrs once a week, it's not bad.",
    "PHYS 166L is a basic intro physics lab. The experiments are good, and on the whole I felt the labs were shorter, and there were fewer lab quizzes, than the first semester course.",
    "Really great learning experience that pairs well with Physics 181. Won't overload you with work, but will challenge you once every week. Has pre-med oriented ideas, but keeps the focus on physics.",
    "I would take this after Phys 165.",
    "Not as bad as 165L. Probably will only take it because you have to anyways so not a painful one.",
    "Good lab. Better than other premed land, but they were picky about points",
    "Take it. You probably have to anyway",
    "Eh. I don't really like physics but just took this for pre-med. It was about what I expected. The teaching staff are amazing--especially Sid--but the grading is really hard! If you like electricity and magnetism or optics then some of the experiments will be really interesting.",
    "The course is a very standard physics lab and is good for students who need it for their major or who want to see hands on how basic physical concepts work.",
    "You have to take it for your major or for pre-med. I wish I could say the more effort you put into it, the more you get out of it, but it honestly depends on your TA.",
    "I would only this class if it is a requirement for your major\/career track. The class is below average and the experiments are not very interesting; however, the grading was fair and the experiments were generally brief.",
    "Get a good partner, make sure you answer all the questions in the lab notes in your notebook so you don't lose points unnecessarily. Review the major themes\/concepts for the final",
    "PHYS 166L is a very chill lab compared to the other ones I've taken. It shouldn't be dreaded pre-med requirement and I think the instructors of this course do a good job of making it as painless as possible.",
    "A well organized and executed lab course that I recommend to anyone who needs to\/wants to gain hands on experience in physics concepts.",
    "Phys 165-166 are really the best, chillest labs at Yale. Take them.",
    "PHYS 166L is a great introductory lab with experiments that apply concepts from electrical circuits, magnetism, and optics. It is best taken while taking PHYS 171 or 181 such that the fundamental concepts learned in class can be applied to the experiments performed in lab. I'm glad I took the course while simultaneously taking PHYS 171. I am also very thankful to the professors of the course, who were phenomenal and genuinely had a passion for teaching and helping students learn how to apply physics. The practical was challenging as practicals go, but certainly manageable.",
    "Easy lab. If you actually write good notes during the experiments your weekly homework for the class will be really short. The one-page summary writeups are not difficult and usually take 0.5-1 hour to complete. A lot depends on the TA, but grading is not harsh. Experiments, while not tedious, are not exhilarating. Certainly less stressful than 206L. If you were in 205L first semester and are thinking about taking 166L instead of 206L, do it. You'll thank yourself when you see our friends writing super-long lab reports every week. If you don't care about having to write all those lab reports then by all means, take 206L for the supposedly more interesting experiments.",
    "I would not recommend taking PHYS 166L unless you must take it for your major. But I think you already know that.",
    "This class is usually a pre-req. but this is certainly not a stressful lab class. There is always guidance at all times and the concepts correlate well with Physics 171 and I'm sure 181 as well!",
    "It is a good introductory lab that I would recommend",
    "Better than Phys165L.",
    "Only take this if you have to. It's a lot of time and work for half a credit, so there's no reason to take it unless it's a requirement. It's pretty stressful",
    "Yes for premed stuff it was one of the easier labs ever done.",
    "In terms of hours, PHYS 166L has a greater workload than PHYS 165L. This is probably because circuits and electromagnetism is more challenging than mechanics. With that said, the standards for grading are also very opaque.",
    "PHYS 166 is a great lab course. The concepts are at times difficult, but the instructors really make them understandable and engaging. Walking up Science Hill can be a drag, and 3-hour labs are long, but the enthusiasm and energy of the instructors make this course worthwhile.",
    "PHYS 166L was a little less tedious than 165L. They improved the lab handouts so that you knew what they were looking for. I think the labs helped me solidify the concepts we were learning in class. There were less weekly quizzes near the end, but there were still weekly (1 page) lab reports. The final wasn't as bad as in 165L. If you're taking the course, it's probably because you have to. Good luck!",
    "You're probably taking this because it's required. Don't worry too much about it. It's three hours on an afternoon which will be tiring but not a disaster like some other labs. The workload is pretty chill, just a lab report following the lab like in PHYS 165L. the lab practical wasn't bad either.",
    "If you're choosing between this and PHYS 206L: this one covers a lot of the same stuff as PHYS 205L, but if you're like me it will be a really helpful review and you'll feel better about the material after taking this class, plus you don't have to write lab reports. It was definitely the better choice for me, but if you really REALLY dig physics I hear 206L is good stuff.",
    "i would recommend it over other physics lab. the grading on the lab reports may be a bit harsh at times, since i dont recall there being any 'sample' lab report posted online that we could look to for reference. or if there was, it was not helpful",
    "Loved physics lab!!! Take this lab it's great!",
    "Lab addendums don't take much time (1 hour outside work a week for the class in total), but the lab itself is tedious since half the time you have no idea what you're doing.",
    "This lab is NOT tedious or too time consuming, it's very reasonable and the lab reports don't take long either. I recommend it!",
    "They really work hard to make physics lab as painless as possible. Labs get out within 3 hours, and the one page lab report is wonderful. Because you have to write out everything in your lab notebook and the one page summary requires you to only highlight the important parts, you really come away understanding the stuff. Lab helped me better understand the material we were covering in 171 too, which is how labs are supposed to work but don't always do that. And everyone in this lab really cares about making it efficient and painless, enjoyable even.",
    "You have to take this for your major\u2026 I don't know why else you'd be taking it\u2026 It's pretty darn easy, easier than the first semester of physics lab.",
    "Only if you are required to"
