   "comments": [
    "So much fun! Professor Sodi is a delight. This class is a great way to continue your Italian education--you will both work on your language skills and learn a lot about modern Italian culture.",
    "I would recommend this fabulous course!",
    "A great introduction to Italian opera and film and a great opportunity to speak Italian three times a week. Very fun due to Prof.essa Sodi's use of movies and youtube videos, but there is a weekly movie screening that you have to watch on your own time. Very relaxed course--very much worth your time.",
    "Italian 157 is a solid course that gives a good sampling of Italian films and operas. We covered about one opera or film every week and also wrote a short essay about once a week. I preferred the films to the operas, but it was nice to get some of both. Also, the final project was pretty fun; we made a video incorporating characters from the operas and films from the course, and prof.ssa Sodi loved it. Prof.ssa Sodi is a wonderful professor, by the way.",
    "definitely.",
    "We watched an opera or a film every week outside of class and wrote either a short assignment (250 words) or a long assignment (500) about every other week. In class, we discussed the films as a group and did short presentations.",
    "You learn a vocabulary for talking about the arts in Italian, which considering the fact that it's Italian, is pretty useful. Take it."
