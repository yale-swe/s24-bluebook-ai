    "If you need it for the language requirement, take it and suck it up. If not, avoid this class. TONS of work, and just not fun in any way.",

    "Spanish 130 is a great class. It is not easy, but you really do learn a lot. There is more homework than in L1 or L2, but you really come out with a stronger base of knowledge.",
    "Great class for improving foundations of Spanish, definitely necessary for students that want to strengthen their backgrounds in writing, syntax, grammar and speaking",
    "Spanish 130 is a great course whether you have to take it or not. Its also a great review for anyone who things they have q good grasp on the language but is nervous about taking the next step.",
    "This course is good if you want grammar and household vocabulary but is not good if you want to talk about history, economics or politics in Spanish or if you want to conduct field work in a Spanish speaking country."
