   "comments": [
    "You need to take this class. You will grow as a scientist and you will grow as a human being.",
    "This is a great course, Professor Wolenski cares so much about his students take it!",
    "Good course to learn the basics in biology research. Great students and TAs. I found that the professor digressed too often, thus explaining the need for a 10 hour per week block for the class. Lab could have been shortened by a few hours a week if we remained on task. Beyond that I enjoyed the class and the community it built. You need to email Dr. Wolenski ASAP if you're interested (like spring of your freshman year as there is a long wait list).",
    "MCDB 344L is hands down the best biology lab you can take at Yale. I emailed Professor Wolenski in January of my sophomore year and I was on the waitlist until the end of the fall semester, so if you want to take the lab, make sure to email early. While it is a hefty time commitment in class (8-10 hours a week), there is virtually no outside-of-the-lab component, save for an easy quiz and a 5-minute chalk talk on a methods paper. I really felt like I learned a lot, and it was truly a connected family of students, so I'd HIGHLY recommend this lab to complete your lab requirement!",
    "This lab class is one of those \"once in an academic career\" kind of classes. If you get in, take it. It is by far one of the most useful and applicable MCDB classes available.",
    "Being lab that meets probably on average for 8 or 9 hours a week, and sometimes up to 10, you really have to know going in that this is the level of effort you will be putting in to the course. In my opinion, it's worth it. I learned a lot. It was not a cut-throat environment even though you are dealing with some spectacular peers. It was an enjoyable experience overall and I would recommend anyone with an interest in MCDB who can get in, to take it!",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it. The class is MW 1:30-6:30 (with variable end time; usually get out an hour early), so it is a time commitment. However, it is completely worth it in my opinion. This an amazing class that is not bogged down by busy work; every component is designed to get you to learn while having fun. Despite majoring in BME, I was able to follow along and learn a lot (I had some experience in bio labs before). More importantly, the infectious enthusiasm of Professor Wolenski and the TAs made it a pleasure to attend each class, even the days I was tired and cranky. I encourage you to email Professor Wolenski far in advance of when you would like to take it (1.5-2 years), since there is a lot of (well-deserved) demand for the course.",
    "A wonderful course--will help you become a better scientist and communicator. Dr. Wolenski and the TAs are fantastic! Take it if you have the opportunity!!",
    "MCDB 344\/345 is a \"dope\" lab class, and easily the best Bio lab class that I took at Yale. Also, it allows you to get the entire credit requirement in one semester. If you are lucky enough to get in off the 18 month wait list, absolutely take it. Wolenski is amazing and the experiments are actually interesting and often the trajectory of the class follows a single experiment that may not have ever been done previously, which is awesome because its real science and real experimentation. Also NO LAB REPORTS, just a quiz and a chalk talk!",
    "One of the best classes I've taken simply because the instructors are so involved with the students, and where the skills taught will actually apply for a future career in science. If you can take it, I highly recommend that you do.",
    "A great class, but may not be worth the time sink. Really consider whether or not you want to be in lab 1pm to 5\/6pm twice a week!"
