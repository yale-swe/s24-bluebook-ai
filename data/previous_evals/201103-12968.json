    "If you're an architecture major, you know why you're here. If you're not an architecture major but are planning on becoming one, good call. Your junior year might suck less. If you are not now and have no intention of becoming an architecture major in the future... well OK I guess.",
    "Yeah I'd recommend it. If you get over the fact that your breadth of knowledge will be very narrow and are ok with a very relaxed course structure, you'll enjoy it alot.",
    "Take the class, even if you are not an architecture major. It is much more than simply looking at buildings - but also civilizations and their history. Lectures are fun to listen to, and class work is minimal with just two essays (or one final exam, one final essay). Reading responses are weekly - bit time consuming but interesting.",
    "NOT a comprehensive overview of architecture, but it's nonetheless a lot of interesting material, and it allows you to write about themes that you're interested in. Take it.",
    "I would recommend it because it's a pretty simple class and could be interesting even if you're not an architecture major.",
    "This is a good course. The work load is light. I recommend it to anyone with any interest in the evolution of western architecture.",
    "could've been worse.",
    "This course is a broad survey of the architecture during this time period. The professor is very knowledgeable in the history of each building and its clients and architects. The work load is very manageable, and the readings are typically interestingand engaging. However, I would only recommend this course if you are interested in the history of the built environment or an architecture major.",
    "Enjoyable lectures with a talented professor. The class is small, the readings are interesting, and the workload is chill. Take it!"
