    "A very good literature course. I'd recommend it to first time literature students looking to discover whether they want to continue studying literature or who want a challenge. The course had a great set of texts. By discussing the texts in seminar, we could each learn from and build off of others' insight. Though I thought the genre-focused course might be narrow, I found a lot of richness in thinking about tragedy across the semester's many plays. A minor point: The Greek tragedies got tiring toward the end-- maybe replacing a few with more modern tragedies would be valuable. My only serious criticism is that one or two students talked just to be recognized and earn class participation points. This felt unproductive-- though Professor Yeazell did often bring the dicussion back to focus. Professor Yeazell was an excellent discussion facilitator. She knew when to let the conversation follow students' thoughts, and when to guide these toward important points we hadn't considered. She made herself very available to talk about essays beforehand and provided extensive comments on final drafts. She always came to class extremely prepared and made the seminar feel very welcoming to all, including those for whom this was their first literature class",
    "An excellent and well-taught course surveying some of the finest and foundational texts in the genre of tragedy and western literature. Put it the time and careful effort to closely read these works and you will come away with a richer understanding of all western literature -- many of the things that you will read, whether on your own or in other classes, are influenced directly by (even alluding to) the things you will read here.",
    "If you want to read a ton of plays you feel like you should read, then take this class. You will learn a lot about tragedy and drama and get to read some fantastic plays, but you won't get an extremely in-depth picture of any era of drama due to the breadth of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 129.",
    "A fascinating class: you'll leave with a broad grasp of an impressive number of great texts. The plays are well chosen, and the professor did a great job prompting and guiding discussion, as well as giving thorough feedback on essays. There was a considerable amount of reading, and several long and fairly intense essays, but the texts and essay prompts were well chosen, so doing the work was rarely too difficult.",
    "I would highly recommend it for a student interested in literature. It's a reading-heavy class, so they'd have to be eager to study literature or else grow very, very tired of the work.",
    "English 129 gives a great view, broad view of tragedy, and is a good way to develop skills in analyzing text. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "All of the readings for this class are great, and if you're interested in a 2700 year survey of Western tragedy this is the course to take. That said, you read a play per class, and time constraints make it so discussions remain necessarily shallow. You could just read the material on your own and probably get as much out of it, but if you want a surface level intro to a lot of interesting, important texts feel free to enroll."
