    "MENG 403 is an introduction to nanotechnology and nanomaterials. It is a survey course that will introduce a bunch of different topics without going into great detail on any particular one. A lot of time is spent on microscopy techniques and how they are important for characterizing the materials. It is a relaxed class and not too much work. Bi-weekly problem sets, a presentation, and a term paper.",
    "Class consists of a large portion of graduate students, who may a larger background in the topic but this should not affect your grade.The problem sets are quite easy, and there is only one other presentation and a term paper. Although the problem sets are not terribly complicated, they account for 50% of your grade so small mistakes really count.No exams, which is nice for an elective class and you can really focus on the topics which interest you.Nice tour of the YINQE center at the end, ties the course well together.Most of your learning will come from the presentation and term paper (~10 pg, nanotechnology topic of your choice).Nice elective.",
    "For undergrads the material can be hard to follow at times since there is no textbook. It's not a hard class per se but it could be improved with more of an organized curriculum. No exams, short problem sets, final presentation and paper.",
    "I found some of the material super interesting... and then there was microscopy and characterization. Which is pretty much everything except the begin and end of the class. You can get pretty far into the math tricks behind the characterization tools without really understanding what you're learning. The lecture on lithium ion batteries was fantastic, though. And you learn a lot from preparing your presentation and writing your paper, and you get to choose your topic. Overall a solid course, especially considering you don't have to put much time into it outside of the presentation and paper.",
    "Take it if you want an interesting elective for your major.",
    "It's interesting material, but what you get out of it what you put in. It is possible to go through this class without learning a thing, but it is also possible to get a lot out of this class. The homework is very easy, but it lulls you into a false sense of security for the end of the term paper. I would recommend it as an interesting engineering credit."
