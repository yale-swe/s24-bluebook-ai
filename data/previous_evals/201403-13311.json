    "Take it! This was a fun writing credit, not too much work, and the teacher and TAs were cool. Besides, you get to learn about the Middle Ages, which is always fun.",
    "Pretty solid pre-industrial history course that filled in a lot of gaps in my history knowledge. There is relatively little reading and the workload is quite light until the end. There's a 15-20 page final paper AND a final exam (which was incredibly easy, but still).",
    "This class is just what its title suggests: a survey of The Middle Ages, years 300-1500. It's a fascinating period, and the professor, Anders Winroth, is fantastic and hilarious. His lectures are a bit rambling, but you get used to it. Take good notes and you will be fine for the final exam. I recommend the class as a writing credit without too much work (a 500 word reading response every two weeks and one final paper).",
    "Not a ton of work, the essays aren't bad, but definitely depends on the TA as far as how hard this class can be.",
    "Yes. It's a great overview class and will improve your writing. Make sure that you keep up with the ongoing narrative of the history of the Middle Ages throughout the semester however. This will make studying for the final much more manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good introductory course for this time period.",
    "This class is a good overview of the Middle Ages as a whole. Obviously with only a semester to cover a thousand years of history you can't get in to too much detail on everything, but as someone who didn't know much about this period before the class I definitely learned a lot."
