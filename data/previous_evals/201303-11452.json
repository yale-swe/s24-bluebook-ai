   "comments": [
    "yes if want to learn how to program \/ required for the major",
    "Most of the learning in the class was done through the problem sets and figuring out how to make programs work rather than in-class lectures that just introduced new ideas and concepts to us. Some of the problem sets were rather nondescript, but they were effective.",
    "Don't take it if McDermott is teaching it. Otherwise I'm sure it's a great class.",
    "Yes but expect to put in work reading on your own instead of listening in lecture.",
    "Not good for beginners. This is not a good foray into programming. Go to the Yale Bookstore and browse the computer science section instead. I don't recommend this course.",
    "I think it completely depends on the professor. Take it in a semester when you know that the professor has taught it several times recently before that and when you have heard good things about him\/her.You should also be aware that \"Introduction to Programming\" practically means learning how to code in Java (that's the only thing you learn in the class), so if you're familiar with it or want more than that don't take it.",
    "If you want to get the basics of programming I would take it but try and get a different instructor.",
    "CS 112 is great class. The material is very interesting, and the problem sets are fun to work on. You learn to break a problem down and think in a new way. McDermott isn't a great lecturer, but the material of the class is so interesting that it doesn't matter.A great way to learn about CS.",
    "For those who want a furtive glimpse at what coding would be like, since you won't walk away knowing how to actually code.",
    "An introductory computer science course is a useful class for just about any person to take, considering the importance of computers for most careers, so I would highly recommend CPSC 112. I would want to warn a person looking to take this class, though, that the problem sets are long, but if you actually want to get anything out of this class, you need to do them thoroughly. Also, if you take this course with Professor McDermott, you'll need to plan to read the book.",
    "Yes but with a different teacher.",
    "No, it was probably almost as useful just to read the textbook",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you have never touched computer science before as this course is designed for beginners. Although the problem sets are challenging and time consuming, you really learn a lot from the course and finish the course with the basic knowledge for programing, whether it be for personal use or for taking more cpsc courses later.",
    "CPSC 112 is a wonderful class, almost a must-have in today's computer dependent age. However, whatever you do, MAKE SURE that you aren't taking it with McDermott. It's worth the wait, trust me.",
    "Drew McDermott has good intentions and is a nice person, but he is a terrible lecturer. He often starts and stops halfway through a sentence and does not explain things clearly. If you are able to take this class with a different professor, do so.",
    "Not the best intro to computer science. It's okay though.",
    "Will teach you some programming basics; Important to know this is more about programming in the sense of doing things with data, not web development or that kind of thing which i think some people assume it will be.",
    "This course is... bearable. However, I would not take it with McDermott if I had another option. As far as an introduction to programming, he does a decent job of teaching you the basics and maybe even more than the basics. The problem is that Professor McDermott words all of his problem sets and exams terribly. Half the time you can hardly understand what he wants. Once everythingis clarified, it's usually pretty straightforward, but you will need him to clarify almost everything he writes.",
    "I would not recommend this course with this professor. It was completely disorganized and very dry.",
    "If you don't know anything about programming, then this class will help to rectify that. If you have experience programming, you probably should look elsewhere. It's an intro class, and that's what it does. It introduces you to programming.",
    "You learn basic java tools. I recommend it to anyone who wants a small base in compute science.",
    "If you're seriously considering comp sci as a major, definitely take it. Otherwise, you're probably better off learning languages from Codecademy because what you learn in this class is not as practical. If you really feel like taking the course, go with credit\/D.",
    "A good course if programming interests you, but be warned, do not take with Professor McDermott. Lectures were poorly prepared and clearly thrown together shortly before the start of each class. The majority of students did not attend lecture as there was simply no point.",
    "Useful and interesting, solid course",
    "Yes, take this class because understanding programming and being able to write simple programs is an essential skill in the 21st century. But do NOT take this class with McDermott because he is awful.For the computer science department, this is what you can do to improve the experience of learning Java at Yale:- Split the class into two. Introduction to Programming (or Java) offered during fall semester and Intermediate Programming (or Java) offered in the spring semester. In the first course, spend more time with programs that require graphics, user console input, and boolean flags (in addition to loops, arrays, and all the basics). In the second course, teach all the object oriented programming that currently happens after the mid-term. Teach classes, records, ArrayLists, and interfaces. This will make the material so much more manageable to digest, allow students to explore each component in more depth, and really truly learn java. I also think that, with the right professor, these could be insanely popular classes particularly among those that don't have a programming background.- Change the formatting of the problem sets. Provide clear instructions (first of all). And rather than starting with McDermott's code foundation, have us write the programs from scratch. Even though the end result may be less sophisticated, this will help us truly understand the process of architecting and writing a program, make our own mistakes, and build something that we understand inside and out. Also, we should only build one program a week, as a single problem set which will help us focus our concentration and effort. And the grading should allow more room for creative solutions.- Change the format of the exams. They are rather one-dimensional because most of the problems involve critiquing or assessing pre-written code. This is what a more thorough and fair exam would look like: (i) a basic vocabulary quiz with a word bank, (ii) Reading lines of code and writing out the expected output, (iii) Looking at pre-written code that has errors (explain the number of errors, like at least 15, and the cut-off number for identifying the errors in order to receive full credit, like 10) and have the students identify the errors, (iv) write simple programs from scratch. Explain what a simple method or class should accomplish and write it out. This will force us to memorize the syntax). (v) Have a pre-written program and then ask the student to fill in the blanks (like a missing method or method header or loop \/ array...).- Have anybody except Drew McDermott teach the class.",
    "CPSC 112 is a great intro to programming -- especially if you want to learn Java. Some of Professor McDermott's lectures were somewhat dry, but they were certainly useful. This was a very practical class -- I now feel very competent in Java, something I knew nothing about going in. The problem sets were sometimes quite challenging (especially towards the end), but they were enjoyable and quite helpful in supplementing what was taught in class. This class has sparked my interest in computer science and I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in learning some basic programming skills.",
    "I would recommend the course as a good introduction to programming.",
    "CS112 is a good introduction to the subject of programming. Strengths: starts you literally from zero knowledge of the subject to rather advanced topics, helpful set of TAs, lots of late time given for problem sets. Weaknesses: learning curve SKYROCKETS after second problem set, bad lectures, extremely theoretical approach to the subject matter. The professor however is not excellent; lectures were unstructured, and fumbling with technological problems accounted for at least one full class time over the course of the semester. His writing style in exhaustively complicated, to the point where what was actually needed in a problem set was obfuscated. The problem sets- one due each Friday at midnight - take up a good amount of time, unless you're already familiar with how to code, which seemed to be the case for many of the students in the class. Great for being introduced to the concepts behind programming, but which the professor had made this class more interesting.",
    "Introduction to Java programming. It teaches you basic Java.Yes, I would recommend it."
