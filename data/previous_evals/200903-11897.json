   "comments": [
    "Fantastic class, fantastic professor. We learned so much this semester and had fun while doing it. Ayala is actually amazing. She's one of the few professors here whose sole purpose is helping her students learn. She goes out on a limb for each and every student, making personal appointments with us when we're struggling and even helping us during quizzes! All she cares about is that we learn--and we did! This class will improve your Hebrew so much--especially your writing--and you will make great friends in it. I couldn't recommend it highly enough.",
    "I would recommend Hebrew L3 to another student. We did a lot of grammar work and I feel my comprehension and writing have really improved. Ayala is a wonderful teacher and the workload is not too difficult. A great class if you want to continue working on your Hebrew!",
    "This course is very good and you will learn a lot of Hebrew. The pace of the course is fast, but Ayala is very receptive to questions and is always willing to review confusing subjects. While there is a lot of busy work, there were parts of the class that were very interesting. Near the end of the term, we did a unit on the history if the kibbutz in Israel, which I thought was fascinating.",
    "L3 Hebrew is a great class. It is small and you really get to know everyone in the class and learn Hebrew very well. I'm much more confident in my ability to have conversations in Hebrew than I was last year. You learn the future tense in this class and more prepositions and your use of the language improves a lot. I would recommend this class to anyone. It is interesting and the grading is not that tough.",
    "If you want to learn hebrew, this is the course for you. There is a really engaging and engaged environment. You work on the grammar and vocabulary. It is a wonderful class.",
    "An excellent continuation of first year Hebrew. A lot more reading and writing, so be prepared to work harder than in L1\/L2, but totally worth it. Take it with Ayala--she is the best professor you will get at Yale.",
    "You learn hebrew... but at a higher level. Music, performances, and movies are integrated into the language learning- and it makes for a really interesting, fun, class. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "For anyone in doubt about continuing after level 2, I would highly recommend this class. Though there can be a lot of work, it is very rewarding and really solidifies everything learned in the first year and gives you a substantial base to continue."
