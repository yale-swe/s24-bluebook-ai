   "comments": [
    "Take this class, even if you didn't like Econometrics I.I didn't enjoy the process of going to this class (it's dry), but I'm really glad I took it. I understand economic papers SO MUCH BETTER than I ever could have otherwise.You walk away with a real education and an applicable skill towards conducting and reading research in any social science discipline.",
    "The toughest class that I've taken at Yale, but incredibly rewarding, as well. I spent the entire first few months completely confused as to what was going on. Once you get adjusted to the class and the fundamentals, the material becomes a lot easier to understand. The textbook is great and will help you a lot before tests. I actually feel comfortable reading and evaluating economics articles now. There are six problem sets, a midterm, a final project, and a final exam. Would definitely recommend it to people who truly enjoy econometrics and want to learn the material. To everyone else: stay far, far away.",
    "Econ132 is a rigorous course, but, because of the subject covered in this course, it would actually not be so great without the rigor. The course material is very interesting for the most part, and it will give you a much better understanding of how we can work with data on everyday issues. The prof and ta are super caring! I am not an econ major and thus had doubts during shopping period, but I'm really glad that I took it!",
    "yup, learn useful stuff",
    "Econometrics 132 was an interesting course, but I think it's biggest weakness is that the professor uses power point and rarely ever uses the chalkboard. Power points are fine, but especially when we are going through proofs, it would have been a lot more beneficial if Altonji went through them by hand.Also would reconsider if you don't have a strong stats background.",
    "A really wonderful course if you want to do the work that will help with research of all types.",
    "Definitely take this course. It may sound scary or boring and you might hear people tell you not to, but this is actually a lot better than I thought it would be. I am really glad that I took it this semester. The materials are interesting and really helpful in understanding econ papers. At times they get challenging, but the professor, the TA, and the textbook can help a lot. Plus, professor Altonji is very reasonable when it comes to exams. He's clear in what materials we're responsible for and we did skip stuffs that are just too complicated. The problem sets are long but still reasonable in terms of difficulty and they are very instructive. So again, do take econ 132 with prof. Altonji.",
    "The econ department really needs to rethink its econometrics sequence. ECON 131, which you'll likely take before this, is completely useless. You could learn the material for that class in about 3 days tops. This course is more intensive, but involves way too much hand waving. What does it mean for an estimator to be efficient? Beats me, but you'll be bandying that term about for much of the course.Learning the basics of STATA is a large part of the course. Every problem set will involve using the program and the exercises are largely plug-and-chug. However the tests are all much more theory based and you barely get any practice on these problems.If I were to start over, I would take STAT 241-242 and then take the math-econ econometrics course ECON 136. These courses may be more difficult, but you would probably also understand what you're doing instead of going \"ooooh! Best linear unbiased estimator\u0085that sounds good\u0085\"",
    "Professor Altonji is a nice person if you go to his office hours. However, he may not be the most organized professor and best lecturer - especially when you compare him with Fabian Long who also teaches this class.Note 1: Problem sets were hard and extremely time-consuming - there are only 6 of them though.Note 2: Please do go to his classes because his PPT slides is far from comprehensible and have many mistakes, i.e., reading PPT is not going to help you and not going to class means not being able to do your assignments I mentioned in Note 1.Note 3: You need to read academic papers for exams. He will test your knowledge of a particular academic paper - things like what model did the author use, what data did the author use, etc.Note 4: There's 1 midterm, 1 final, 6 assignments AND a individual project, which is 10 to 13 pages without graphs\/charts.Note 5: People in this class are self-selected because this is not a required econ course - a lot of seniors who feels necessary to take this for their future research positions, a lot of people take this Credit\/D\/Fail - so, be prepared and please allocate a reasonable amount of time for this class every week, otherwise you will not understand what he is saying in class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you need to take econometrics.",
    "Think long and hard before taking this course. If you are not seriously considering going on to some sort of graduate work in economics and aren't prepared to commit a large amount of time and effort to this course, you probably shouldn't take it. At least for me, the material was incredibly challenging, the problem sets are long and difficult, and the tests and project are very tough. But if you are interested in moving on to higher level economics, and you're willing to put in the time and effort, I think this course could be very rewarding. I left this course with a much better understanding of how economists analyze data and overcome the many problems associated with different types of data sets. Professor Altonji is incredibly nice and intent on helping you understand the material. Go to his office hours and work with him - he'salways willing to spend time with you. So really it's your call. Don't just take it on a whim. But if you think this is what you're really interested in doing, then go for it. You'll get a lot out of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is an Economics major - I personally found it really interesting, and while it was really challenging, I think the material you learn in it is really valuable.",
    "While it is not the proof intensive course, algebra is essential. This class will teach you the grounding for future econometric research. The I would recommmend the class to anyone considering research. Otherwise, it is not highly essential learning."
