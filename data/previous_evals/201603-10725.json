   "comments": [
    "I learned the art of the essay in this class, which is a skill I'm so thrilled I got my first semester at Yale. I went from a \"pretty good\" writer to a writer who much better understands control, story, point, audience, etc. The readings for the class are exquisite, and the level of detailed, high-quality, thoughtful feedback I got was incredible.",
    "This class made a huge difference in my writing ability and style; really helped me to develop a voice of my own and to write confidently about myself.",
    "- How to read non-fiction closely by analyzing writer's techniques, and how to apply those strategies in my own writing",
    "I learned how to better write creative nonfiction essays, from providing scene-setting details to establishing a consistent and appropriate tone to using humor to make my arguments. This process was far more difficult than I imagined but ultimately I learned a lot in how to write nonfiction essays that a greater audience can understand and enjoy.",
    "During the past semester of English 120, I developed better writing skills and expanded my awareness of the essay in modernity. Class discussions also bettered my ability to communicate thoughts and opinions on other works. While the focus of the course was essay writing, I feel that the communication skills that I developed will continue to benefit my writing in other venues.",
    "I was able to learn a great deal about non-fiction creative writing, from paragraph structuring to different kinds of narrative surprise. In the course we covered all topics of non-fiction creative writing: personal essays, essays on places, essays on people, cultural analysis essays, and humor essays. The chosen readings were not only helpful in analyzing and developing these skills, but also fun to read. The five assigned essays, corresponding with each unit, were what cemented these skills in.",
    "I learned not only how to write about myself, but also how to apply the techniques that would make that writing the most effective. I feel that I now write in a more persuasive way that appeals to a larger audience."

   "comments": [
    "Some particular strengths are Pam's attention to individual students in terms of how carefully she reads our writing, and the reading list - it's broad but engaging, and centers around some phenomenal non-fiction essays.",
    "The course is wonderful in that it features a workshop, where students review other students' work(s) and provide them with meaningful comments on what works and what doesn't work. The round table set-up is also great for facilitating student discussion.",
    "The course gives you opportunity to write in many different non-fictions styles as well as exposes you to great works by a huge variety of authors. You don't do many writing exercises in class which I think I would've liked to have more of.",
    "More workshopping would have been great because getting feedback from peers was always really helpful.",
    "To me, the course is well developed with its five units centered on different forms of the modern essay and five assignments based off of those incarnations of the essay. The flow of the class from studying professional writers' works in a certain genre to crafting your own is beneficial and allows you to employ professional skills in your own creations.",
    "The readings, essays, and Professor Newton are the greatest strengths of this course. As said before, the chosen readings illustrated different strategies in non-fiction creative writing, which we were then able to employ in the five assigned essays. Professor Newton was a wonderful professor, always facilitating discussion on the readings, adding in different terms as they came up, and making sure everyone spoke."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely - if you want to become a better non-fiction writer beyond just academic writing, this class is for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I took it as a freshman (without taking ENGL 114 or ENGL 115) and I do not regret my decision at all - ENGL 120 not only greatly developed my nonfiction writing, but it also made me a better reader in terms of picking out specific writing techniques and understanding the points of essays.",
    "Absolutely recommend to any student. Writing well is a skill everyone needs and I would say of all the intro English courses this one offers the best instruction on actual writing technique for effectiveness.",
    "If you have any doubts, take this class! Even if you're never written a single thing before or especially if you've never written a single thing before this class is for you. You'll learn how to read a piece of nonfiction and apply writing techniques in your own writing. You'll learn that you \/can\/ write and that writing is a lot of fun. Also, workshopping each others' pieces is a valuable and growing experience. Pam is a great professor who really cares about her students. She did mid-semester evals to get anonymous feedback on how to improve the class, then followed through to address any concerns.",
    "Yes, I think it was a great way to practice my writing and explore different skill sets.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 120 to any Yale student. The skills of reading and writing nonfiction are unique (I certainly hadn't fully experienced this kind of writing before), important, and extremely interesting. The readings are very engaging and the essays are fun to write since you can pick a topic that you're truly invested in and make it come alive for a general audience.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in taking a less literature-focused writing course. I was drawn to English 120 originally because of the course readings, and the syllabus did not disappoint. I think any student looking to develop more flexible but still practical writing skills should consider taking this course.",
    "This course really teaches you how to write and how to communicate effectively. The skills you learn will help you not only if you plan to write creative non-fiction, but also if you plan on writing any papers for future classes. The readings and skills will stick with you--take this class!",
    "Yes, because I feel that I am a much better writing after having taken it."
