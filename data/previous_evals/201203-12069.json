   "comments": [
    "The class is great. The readings aren't long or dense but they give you a lot to think about. Professor Gabriel takes wonderful and fascinating tangents in the middle of class, so if you're a fan of learning random but awesome things, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Good class, fairly easy, not much more.",
    "A class in which you study medieval Irish and Welsh literature - would not recommend because of the teacher's poor ability to lead a seminar.",
    "I would recommend Celtic Lit to people with a specific interest in medieval things, folklore or Celtic things. It is a very niche class. Professor Gabriel is incredibly niceand very knowledgable. Very very little work involved - two short papers and short readings. The stories are fun and different from standard English class readings.",
    "Medieval Celtic Literature is a survey of mostly Irish and Welsh literature from the Middle Ages. Class discussion ranges from the historical context to the literary merits of these deceptively simple works, and the class provides an interesting range of information about the people who created this literature as well as analyses of the texts themselves.",
    "Fun, fascinating and often bizarre texts -- but until Prof. Gabriel gets a firmer handle on discussion (and lets himself assign reading that will contextualize these sometimes maddening stories), I wouldn't recommend this classroom experience to another student.",
    "This class covers material you might never study any other time, unless Medieval Celtic Literature is what you are studying. It is some pretty interesting stuff. David Gabriel is a bit unorganized but excited about the material and very accessible. There are two fairly short papers on topics of your choice, and the weekly reading isn't too extensive either. I would recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in the material; otherwise, it may be a bit tedious.",
    "If you are interested in the material and don't require prodding to be involved in section, yes.",
    "I didn't learn quite as much about medieval Celtic literature as I would have liked, but it's an interesting course! Depends heavily on who is in the class, both personality- and size-wise.",
    "You read and discuss translated Irish and Welsh literature, as well as write two papers (or one long paper, if you're taking it as an English senior seminar). It's pretty laid back. The interesting thing is, we know so little about the cultures this literature belonged to that almost any interpretation is valid.",
    "Literature 463 is a course that will teach you most of what there is to know on the the major branches of celtic literature. It is a very interesting course that I would recommend to students interested in Medieval Studies for it presents and interesting point of comparison with continental medieval literature.",
    "This class is a survey of medieval Irish and Welsh literature, touching briefly on literatures from the other Celtic countries. Texts are mostly prose, including the T\u00c3\u0081IN B\u00c3\u0093 C\u00c3\u009aAILNGE, the MABINOGION, SWEENEY ASTRAY, and others. Professor Gabriel is the best seminar professor I've had at Yale \u00e2\u0080\u0094 class is always just excellent.",
    "You should take any class with Professor Gabriel; he is an engaging instructor that teaches material you may never encounter otherwise."
