    "A lot more work than L3.",
    "This class overviews major Spanish grammar issues and explores some writing. You will read a few stories, mostly do a lot of comprehension questions and grammar stuff on the website, and watch a movie and read a very oversimplified book. I would not really recommend this class to another student, because as someone who loves Spanish and the study of the Spanish language and courses, I was always very un-excited about this class, it made me resent and dislike Spanish, and I did not feel like I learned that much new information.",
    "You will work a lot on speaking fluidly and you will finish out your exposure to basic vocabulary and the rest of the grammatical forms. Expect consistent work every night and makes sure you pay attention to all of the parts of the syllabus. All is totally manageable and if you engage in it your Spanish will improve.",
    "as good as a high level spanish class can get, which is not great.",
    "Going into L4 I had heard that it was the hardest level of Spanish; however, I found that as long as you did the work and asked questions when you weren't quite sure of the concepts, it was quite doable. I recommend Profesora Leon, she is an outstanding teacher and does not grade unnecessarily arbitrarily.",
    "I would if someone needed a language credit, but if they were on the fence between continuing with spanish or starting another language, I would probably recommend the latter."
