    "ART 331 gives you a lot of leeway to do your own exploration, with some guidance. If individual exploration is what you would like to do, take it. If you want to build up your basic painting skills, with rigorous academic exercises, take another class like Basic Painting or Intro Painting.",
    "Great, fun class! Not too stressful either",
    "Yes, you can develop your skills a lot in this course",
    "This class changes with whatever professor teaches, but I would definitely recommend Anoka. It's pretty self explanatory, and her workload is super manageable. I took this class along with four others and it was fine.",
    "I would recommend the course if you have taken all the prerequisites; I really enjoyed the somewhat independent aspect of the second half of the semester, but if you haven't taken painting before, that may be a little intimidating or maybe not enough structure for someone with not as much experience."
