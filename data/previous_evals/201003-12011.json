    "Definitely take it! I only hope that future sections are as small as ours, since I think having a 9 person class made it very easy for Professor SP to give us targeted and complete individual feedback.",
    "I have never liked an English class, I loved this one. You're reading constantly but everything is connected and very interesting.",
    "It is a neat way to look at ethical topics in medicine while reading good literature. For an English major the discussion was a bit low level because the class was small and made up mostly of pre-meds, but the readings were interesting and the workload was not too bad.",
    "This is a great course if you like thinking about some heavy, dark issues in medical ethics. It is also a good course if you like literary analysis, or if you are thinking about writing about healthcare and medicine with an ethical bent."
