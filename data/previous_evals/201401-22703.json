   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it was a great way to learn about some of the current technologies in biomedicine and what some of the limitations are for these technologies. Additionally, the exams and lectures forced students to think critically about experimental design, which is incredibly useful for anyone that wants to pursue research.",
    "Interesting class, take it if you want a nice overview of cell-material interactions without getting bogged down in unnecessary course load.",
    "If I did, I would let them know that it would be helpful to have some knowledge of molecular\/cellular biology",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to my fellow students. It is a reasonable amount of work (no homework...just 2 exams and a final paper). The workload is just enough so that we learn the material well without feeling bogged down). The instructor is very interesting. You will improve critical thinking skills and learn how to set up a good experiment. Very relevant topics."

   "comments": [
    "I learnt a lot from the class. Even though not directly related to my research focus, I now have a good understanding of the biomedical field.",
    "Helped to build critical thinking skills that are critical for experimental design.",
    "Learned a lot regarding display of figures in manuscripts and accurate representation of data",
    "It introduced me to some new concepts , especially on what to consider when designing biomaterials.",
    "This course helped me to develop critical thinking skills. I took 2 grad level biomaterials courses in my undergrad, but neither of them were as engaging or useful as this one. I can certainly take something from this course even if I do not use the material directly (although it is possible that I will). We also had to write a book chapter for our final project, which was a useful exercise."
