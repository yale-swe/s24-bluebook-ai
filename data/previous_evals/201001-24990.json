    "Required class for MechE.",
    "Take this class if you're a MechE major even if you're not ABET. It's a lot of work on the lab reports, but you really actually learn fluid mechanics and have a great time doing it.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably required for your major. Good course, good instructor, lots of work but still fun.",
    "Writing lab reports every week can get a bit tiresome, but the experiments themselves are interesting, sometimes even fun. This class is definitely a full credit. Professor Ouellette is very reasonable with extensions though, and his friendliness makes the class worthwhile. As far as advanced lab courses go, this one is both less stressful and more engaging than most, even if there is a good amount of work involved.",
    "One of the best lab courses I've taken at Yale, with great labs that are actually interesting. Professor Ouellette does a great job making complicated subjects manageable, and the labs easily showcase complicated fluids theory."
