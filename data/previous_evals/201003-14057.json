   "comments": [
    "Far much more work than initially advertised. The material was really interesting, but Schepartz seems to be under the impression everyone in her class is taking just one course during the semester, that course being Chemical Biology",
    "CHEM 421 is a good introduction to some interesting topics. The groupdiscussions and final presentation were very helpful in learning how to understand, analyze, and talk about primary scientific literature. Prof. Schepartz is very friendly and good at explaining things, if not particularly exciting. I would definitely recommend it to someone who doesn't mind getting up really early.",
    "This is an awesome class. If you don't like reading scientific papers, this may not be your type of class, but even if you don't you should give it a try. You will definitely learn to read scientific papers in a more detailed and analytical way. The class is work heavy for the first half of the semester, and afterwards you just have a paper and presentation to prepare for, which worked well in terms of my schedule. Professor Schepartz is also very enthusiastic about teaching this course, which is nice. Oftentimes she posts homework the day before which requires you to stay up late to finish it, but it's worth it.",
    "Really interesting course! I recommend it if not just for the cool papers that you read. The final presentation\/project proposal really make you think outside of the box. Just make sure you can handle the heavy workload for the first half of the semester. After that, there really is no work.",
    "I think this is best suited for a student who is experienced in biological and\/or biochemical research and who is familiar with basic biochemistry.",
    "An interesting survey of the growing field of chemical biology. Professor Schepartz lectures for the first half of the course, with discussions of primary literature scattered in as well. For the second half, you just listen to presentations by other students, as everyone talks about their final project (summarize some papers from a topic in chemical biology and present an original research proposal for next steps in that area).",
    "Chem 421 is a fantastic course. You learn very sophisticated science from a very talented and dedicated professor. The course might prove a bit challenging if you don't have a proper background in organic chemistry and biology, but it is worth taking anyway. I highly recommend it.",
    "This semester, the class was too big for its format and needs to be reworked. I hope that it is. My one comment would be that to a chemistry major with a weaker biology background (no biochem), the biology often felt overwhelming and got in the way of understanding the material. Biochem seems to be a sort of unwritten prereq.",
    "I would absolutely take it again, Chemical Biology is such an amazing field, the subject matter makes this class one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "Chemical Biology is a great way to learn about the many exciting and new applications of chemistry to the study of biological systems. An average week is one lecture followed by one discussion section where you discuss papers you were assigned to read. At the end, you conduct a literature review of a topic of your choice, and come up with an original research proposal. The class is hugely rewarding. Definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you plan on going to graduate school and wish to learn how to give a good presentation. However, in terms of the amount of material covered by the professor in this course, it's rather insufficient--only 6 or 7 lectures in total, and all completed within the first 1.5 months."
