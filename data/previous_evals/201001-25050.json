    "It's disorganized and difficult to know what the professor's expectations are. But Professor Weiss is really a pleasure.",
    "I would recommend it if you like to learn things independently. Aside from a few introductory lectures, most of the learning in this course is done on your own. The professor is great, though.",
    "Archaelogies of Empire invited me to think about history and historical analysis in a way few courses or professors generally do. I'm not sure how much I believe in this way of thinking, but I'm very glad to have been exposed to it. Also, Prof. Weiss can be frustratingly vague to work with, but access to his accumulated knowledge of surprising parts and moments of the world is well worth a certain amount of uncertainty about what the course is actually about.",
    "Good course, but be expected to be exposed to a series of topics that might not be well connected. If you enjoy classes that stimulate you and urge to learn more about diverse topics in a non-stressful way, this is a great course. If you are looking for a structured course with well designed and assigned readings, assignments etc, then you might want to avoid it."
