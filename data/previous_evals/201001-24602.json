    "I'd recommend it to a student with a solid background in geochemistry. I was much more confident on the geophysics side of things, but utterly lost through a lot of the chemistry, despite having a basic knowledge of inorganic chem. Otherwise, the course is a fairly enjoyable, comprehensive look at Earth's climate system through time.",
    "Paleoclimates is a great seminar for environmental studies or g&g majors (juniors and seniors) who wish to prepare themselves for graduate school or work in research. It not only explores the literature on climate over the past 65 million years, it also requires you to work on presentation and discussion skills.",
    "This is an amazing course. You will learn a lot about Paleoclimate, and you will have a lot of fun discussing the material in class."
