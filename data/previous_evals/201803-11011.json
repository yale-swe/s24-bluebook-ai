   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I feel that I gained a very deep understanding of air quality control issues and insight on an interdisciplinary approach to solving these issues. I gained a mix of qualitative and quantitative assessment skills to solving such issues.",
    "Understanding the difference between primary and secondary pollutants, learned about pollutant species that I did not know about before. Learned a little bit about factors affecting climate change. Discussed mitigation techniques",
    "Learned about the fate of compounds in the atmosphere whether through transport or chemistry. Learned how to evaluate systems to quantify the air quality of a particular place",
    "We learned about the different types of pollutants found in the atmosphere, how they are formed, and what their sources are. Beyond the facts and knowledge we developed, we also learned how to approach air pollution problems: what factors we need to consider, how to collect information about a pollutant, how to work towards a solution.",
    "General principles of air quality control solutions based on topography, meterology, emissions, atmospheric mixing, etc. Some mathematical applications",
    "Pretty expansive knowledge of the current state of air pollution and strategies for mitigating it",
    "In this class, I developed a basic understanding of common air pollutants and their life cycles in the atmosphere. I now understand basic atmospheric chemistry, how weather influences pollution levels, and sources\/sinks of various atmospheric pollutants. I also have experience in working with air quality data from the final project."

   "comments": [
    "This class gives an overview of the important factors in Air pollution. It is very well taught and the lectures and material for review are well-organized. I think I would have liked to read more articles ( published papers) about air pollution than the Seinfield book because at the end we learned the material in class",
    "Professor Gentner approaches the material in a unique and engaging fashion. The collaborative activities facilitated lots of discussion even if they were a bit tedious over time.",
    "The organization of the class was a little off at times; sometimes we would spend an entire class period covering one case study that didn't relate much to our homework, and we would leave feeling confused. I wish we had done some more quantitative problem solving in class, as that would have helped more with our assignments. Overall though, the content of the course was really good, and I felt like I learned a lot about air pollution and how to approach air pollution problems.",
    "Course was a bit heavy on in class exercises that sometimes didnt apply to homework. Homework sometimes required long lines of questioning with TA didnt always lead to answers. Overall, the course was also very assignment heavy, but Prof. Gentner took some of the pressure off at the end with course adjustments. Professor gave no feedback on independent project so made it feel a bit unappreciated despite the amount of work that went into it.",
    "Drew is an awesome person and super knowledgeable, and he makes the course pretty interesting. The in class activities are usually helpful for deepening understanding. On preclass lectures, it may be useful to have a brief in class re-cap of what we are expected to have learned from the preclass lecture, just because sometimes the content is tricky to completely get on ones own.",
    "On the whole, the course was a very good one. I liked how Professor Gentner tried to make the class interactive to keep students paying attention. That being said, I think the course could have been much better if it had gone into more detail. There were several class discussions which could have been skipped without losing much content. Furthermore, a lot of the more mathematical concepts we learned (e.g. equations of diffusion and gravitational settling) were not derived an we were given little context about why they may be true (e.g. what assumptions go into them, what principles where they derived from??). Learning them without this context makes the knowledge much less useful to me - from classes I have taken far in the past, I no longer remember exact equations, but only the intuition behind things. College engineering students can handle a slightly more rigorous treatment."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course, as it was one of my favorites at Yale. Professor Gentner great and committed to student learning, the material is presented in a very engaging and interesting way, and the project helps you gain better understanding of applications of the material. Be prepared to put in a a decent amount of work for bi-weekly psets, the project, and 3 non-cumulative exams. The course is tailored to students of all academic backgrounds, as long as you have basic understanding of chemistry and math (although understanding concepts of engineering helps too). The class is designed to be intensive, but not stressful and when it was veering on being stressful, Prof. Gentner changed the syllabus to better fit student needs.",
    "Yes, if you want to understand the transport of pollutants in the atmosphere and other factors that contribute to atmospheric chemistry",
    "Definitely a great course for anyone who is at all interested in air quality",
    "A good course if you want to learn all the basics about air pollution. Drew is a really nice guy who is very willing to spend time answering questions and speaking with his students. There might be some grad students taking the class who seem like they know a lot more than you, but there's no reason to be intimidated!",
    "If you have an empty class and a lot of free time its an interesting exercise in quasi consulting on air quality issues. Wouldnt take it on as a fifth class given the workload but with four it was fine.",
    "Yes! Well taught, good amount of content learned.",
    "This is a good class if you want to get a basic overview of air quality problems. The class is fairly qualitative with little serious math. If you want a more rigorous, mathematical treatment of air quality, take Prof. Gentner's spring graduate class on air quality instead."
