On the other hand, I was frequently frustrated with the size and disorganization of the class--20 people seemed like too many. And I didn't get my article where I wanted it to be by the end of the semester, which was frustrating.",

   "comments": [
    "This class is a great way to stay motivated and on track with my research. However, the size of the class made it difficult to discuss my research to the extent that I was hoping.",
    "The class this semester was much larger than it typically is - this didn't bother me, as Dr Ashton and Danica were very helpful and accessible and added extra sessions for student presentations. For my own learning style and not having previously worked up a thorough proposal for my project, as I did not take Research Methods, I would have appreciated beginning the writing process with an annotated bibliography, rather than diving straight into writing the introduction. For students who had already done this in other courses, I understand this would be redundant, but for me it would have been very helpful. I neglected to do a thoroughly bibliography before attempting to write, and it was a real mess. The iterative presentations of our research is a huge help - it's great to get real practice presenting for a group, and very helpful to get to watch other students grow as well.",
    "Mark knows an awful lot about the peer review process and can be a real solid resource. However, his time is stretched very thin by numerous commitments and he's not around campus very much in the fall--making it difficult to get 1-on-1 time with him outside of the class time. Meanwhile, the class this fall was overenrolled--with 20 students at varying stages in the process--and so each of us got very little time to talk through the details of our research; we could only really do overviews each time, which was dissatisfying. Similarly, the comments we got on papers were successively less detailed and vague. I would recommend limiting enrollment to 10-15 students. I would also recommend having students group (or grouping students) into groups of 4 apiece that are doing similar types of analysis (e.g., the plot ecologists together, the social scientists together), and have each group send their papers to each other--so that we would do more peer editing, and take some of the revision onus off of Mark and Danica so they could pay more attention to the higher-level issues. We could even do swift reads during a 30-minute start to class, where we each bring in 1-2 paper copies of our article, and others go over them with colored pencils and mark up issues in 10-15-minute rounds. Finally, I think the emphasis on presentations was a bit of a distraction, really; my research is nowhere near ready to present, because it's not yet written out in a full first draft--and I think presentations should rightly belong in the spring semester of the course, with full first drafts due by the end of the fall instead....",
    "It's a great course. The only improvement I can see is if the class were smaller or divided into sections."

    "Excellent for anyone conducting their own research related to ecology. Especially good for practicing presentations of scientific research.",
