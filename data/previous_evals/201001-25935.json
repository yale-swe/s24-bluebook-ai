    "solid course. great professor. intimate setting. brilliant classmates.",
    "There were only seven people in the class year, which surprised me. The subject matter is fascinating, inspiring and perennially relevant to current events, and Professor Schell is a great teacher. He's warm and personable; an engaging discussion leader who is deeply knowledgeable about nonviolent political movements but never overbearing; and, perhaps most importantly of all for class of this nature, he is clearly passionate about the subject matter. He learned everyone's name and treated us all like peers. His feedback on my final paper was really detailed, perceptive and constructive. It was really a pleasure to take a class with him. The other people in the class were really smart and thoughtful, too. I would certainly recommend this class to anyone who's interested in nonviolent political movements - but make sure you'll have time to put some work into the final paper, because it's substantial (20 or so pages) and also a great opportunity to learn more about an episode or movement that interests you.",
    "Take this class. It will introduce you to leaders that were not part of the elite, yet brought about dramatic changes in their countries and societies. You'll learn about Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Mandela and many more. Really worth it.",
    "Do it if you want to know why non violence works or for that matter, even why violence works."
