    "It's the senior essay and you have to take it.",
    "It's required for the major, but this doesn't mean it has to suck. My experience was great, andI love the final paper I submitted. You might want to consider going abroad the summer before senior year to do some independent history research -- Yale has tons of fellowships just waiting for you. Get in touch with upperclassmen to figure out who's a good advisor -- Bruno Strasser is amazing if you can find a topic he'll mentor you on. Make sure you have someone who'll set strict deadlines for you (because you're definitely not going to stick to the ones you set for yourself), this will make the writing process easier and you won't be scrambling to finish the day before it's all due.",
    "Writing your senior essay is fun only because you get to handle primary documents and work with them. Other than that, it is overwhelming, exhausting, stressful, and takes a TON of time. It will suck. Of course. I would not, if you are a history of science and medicine major, elect a History advisor (someone from just the history department) because the disconnect between departments was a real issue for me, in the case that I was not given the resources that my friends were from the HSHM department. Not. good.",
    "You write a bunch of words. Then you edit them. Then you make sure your citations aren't wrong. Then you pay TYCO a fuck ton of money to print it. Then you turn it in and get a sticker."
