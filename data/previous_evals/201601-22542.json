    "The seminar moved from Boethius's time up to the early modern period, with weekly discussions of the readings assigned. Students give class presentations on a topic pertinent to their interests.",
    "ENGL 549 offers an interdisciplinary study of Boethius's writings and their reception in England up to the era of the Reformation. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "A useful and detailed study of the reception history of Boethius throughout history. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in the history of philosophy, like myself, or focused on medieval or Renaissance classical reception."

    "I learned very much about this very important text, which was one of the most copied texts of the Middle Ages. This will definitely influence my future research, and I am currently working on a research project that began in this class.",
    "I felt as if the way that the course brought together historical and theoretical materials in the early weeks was very interesting. Even though to some extent Foucault and others dropped out of the discussion after the first few course readings, it was interesting to think about the stakes of the conversation in these terms. I think that the first readings asked us to be conscious of method and ask questions about our own approach that were very productive.",
    "The course challenged me to develop my thinking on how arguments are formed and reformed throughout the history of a text. This new thinking will lead me to consider the historical dimensions of my texts of study in a different way.",
    "I am not a medievalist, but I've learned a great deal about it in this class."
