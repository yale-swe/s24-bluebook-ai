    "A better understanding of Confucianism and Chinese history from the Song to the Qing, particularly in a non-Eurocentric way",
    "Close reading, research, evaluating primary sources, and just dispellinf misconceptions on a body of thought and a historical period that just isn't very well-understood.",
    "I learned so much in this course, that describing it would extend beyond the word limits of this evaluation. To put it simply, this was a course about the Confucian intellectual tradition and historical developments that influenced it, starting from the Analects and Mencius and Xunzi, and extending all the way to the Late Qing. It was a mix of primary and secondary sources, and covered every field from politics, philosophy, religion, culture, international relations, history, among others. Specifically, the course goes into detail on the Song Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty, and the Qing.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of the major themes in the Confucian tradition."

   "comments": [
    "More reading than expected; some of it was great and some of it was not as interesting",
    "I loved the format of the class and how Professor Chin balanced her lecturing with ample time for insightful discussion. The sources given were also some of the most engaging literature on Chinese philosophical and political thought, which I enjoyed tremendously.",
    "This class was very small (only had 9 students and one professor), so it was very easy to dive in-depth into the subject. The quality of discussion was very high, and I liked how the professor would bring up questions for discussion that really helped draw out the nuances of the texts. We learned more than what was just in the readings, due to the professor's vast knowledge of the field. This course really didn't have any weaknesses to it."

   "comments": [
    "Given that Professor Chin is not teaching after this semester, I'm not entirely sure how useful any feedback will be. I enjoyed the seminar format, which pushed us to think creatively. The papers also helped solidify our understanding of Confucianism as manifested in different eras. Overall a very enjoyable experience.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student if offered in future years. The professor who began this course retired, but I'm sure whoever teaches it in the future will also do a fantastic job. This was my first introduction to the Chinese intellectual tradition, and has been the most formative class upon my thinking this year. It has changed the way I think about politics, philosophy, and culture, and is perfect for anyone interested in the humanities. Top notch course.",
    "Yes. I will recommend this course to any students who have a serious interest in intellectual history in general."
