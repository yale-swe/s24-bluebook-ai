    "This class is very demanding in terms of outside course work but has definitely been one of the more interesting classes I've ever taken at Yale. You will learn a lot but you will also spend a lot of your free time working on the group project outside of class. I recommend that you take the course only if you are willing\/able to devote a lot of time to it. The midterms are reasonable, 3 in all, and each test only over the material covered since the previous midterm.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "Very good class to take. Good mix of cell biology and physiology. Interesting material. A good amount of paper reading.Tests are a little too nit-picky on details very specific to certain papers and are not concept based\/relevant to tissue engineering but more to whether you read a certain paper closely enough or not.The lecture portion of the course does not take too much time\/work at all. Just go to lecture and review the notes, looking at the papers if something is unclear.However, the project portion involves a good amount of independent paper reading if you are to design a project that will actually work.I think it is still not too much though considering the class is 1.5 credits.It would have been nice to have alittle more structure\/ guidance on which direction to take. However,the project is a great learning experience in designing a project.Advice: don't be too ambitious on selecting cutting edge things to use in your project. Do what is proven and it will still be gratifying and will have good results. Don't try to build a bioreactor with moving parts from scratch.",
    "This has the potential to be one of the best courses offered by Yale. A fantastic opportunity to get to know and learn from one of the best tissue engineers in the country. Dr. Niklason is a terrific lecturer, and the material is both novel and fascinating, even for an experienced BME major. I would highly recommend it.That said, be warned that this course takes an extraordinary amount of time, patience, and commitment. The lab section of the course, where you grow a tissue from scratch, is frustrating, difficult, time consuming, and ultimately rewarding. Things will not go as planned, and you need to be prepared for a ton of last minute work during reading week and finals period. Take it if you're interested in the material, take it if you want to learn from Dr. Niklason, take it if you want an awesome BME elective, but don't take it just cause that's what people are doing. It takes dedication. And you will really let your team down if you're not invested in the work.",
    "Tough course, tough midterms, but you learn so much."
