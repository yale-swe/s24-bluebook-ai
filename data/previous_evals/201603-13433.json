   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the Pacific Islands in this course a topic that I am ashamed to admit that I knew next to nothing about, and would probably otherwise never have studied. Important themes were how histories of settler colonialism and current patterns of neo-imperialism continue to affect the Pacific. We absolutely need more classes like this at Yale!",
    "I knew nothing about the Pacific before taking this course. It's an incredible shame. I learned how to discuss complex cultural issues. I've acquired a more open mind but also a more critical mind sight. I understand the importance of asking the difficult questions.",
    "I learned so much in this class! I think it has been a severe gap in Yale's course offerings and should be filled after Professor Teves' departure. This course covered a huge array of topics related to Pacific Islanders and encouraged us to think critically about different stereotypes we might have unknowingly bought into. I was extremely grateful to learn about Pacific Islander history and the way that they have been conceived of in media and through American cultural sources.",
    "Survey of issues in the Pacific Islands. Short time to deal with a broad range of peoples, so less history-based and more about contemporary threads that affect many groups across the Pacific. Lots said they were looking to fill a gap in their education.",
    "Heightened awareness of settler-colonialism in the Pacific Islands by the United States and other colonial powers. Suppression of Pacific-Islander\/Kanaka Maoli specific problems such as homelessness, poor health, land use changes and abuse are masked by confounding API category and general lack of PI perspective in canon. Introduced to unique issues such as TMT, Standing Rock, Moana's appropriation, masculinity\/femininity, and the sovereignty movement, as well as influential Pacific Islander writers such as Trask, Silva, Tuhiwahi Smith, and Perez.",
    "I learned a bit about Pacific Islander history both in the context of American history and each islands' individual history. Additionally, the course encompassed topics of gender and sexuality within Pacific Islander culture and how history played a role in creating those structures. The style of the class varied each week. One week we would debate, the other we would analyze pictures. The variation helped to hone in my analytical skills through different methods. Overall, the course has largely shaped how I view the Pacific Islands and I have become more critical of the policies created to expand militarization in the pacific.",
    "This class provided a fantastic introduction to the study of Pacific Islanders with a specific focus on the processes and impacts of imperialism. The Pacific is largely unknown to most people so this course is an important opportunity for students to broaden their understanding of the negative legacy that America's role has had in the region.",
    "I learned the history of imperialism in the Pacific and I learned the ways in which the United States continues to disadvantage and destruct the livelihoods of Pacific Islanders.",
    "This course did a fantastic job in giving an overview of the history of the Pacific Islands, as well as modern issues they face and movements and current events on the islands. I had never thought extensively about the Pacific and its deep significance to world history, but this course was fantastic in getting me to think critically about the Pacific and how it has been painted and ignored."

   "comments": [
    "This course is amazing the syllabus is very well-chosen, and engages especially with feminist and queer theory. Professor Teves' purposeful decision to assign only texts written by Native scholars was incredibly fruitful. I do wish that we spent more time on other parts of the Pacific than Polynesia!",
    "Since this course is a seminar, I would have preferred more discussion as opposed to lecture. That being said, the lectures were all necessary because there was a huge gap in the classes understanding of historical context, which is more of a problem with the institution. The syllabus was incredibly thought out and did well to synthesize a subject that warrants years of background knowledge. There was a lot of multimedia and different activities that kept students engaged. Very dynamic course.",
    "I think this course was taught pretty perfectly in every way. The seminar style was great for discussions among our classmate, but Professor Teves always scaffolded the classes with a short lecture, as most of us didn't come into the class with a lot of context. I enjoyed all of the readings immensely, and I think that the addition of films makes the class more interesting, as well as adding visuals and personal stories.",
    "Seminar-size was really conducive to productive conversation. Lots of new information because of the very unique topic.",
    "Strengths- knowledgeable professor, engaging discussions, excellent reading material, current event assignment and midterm helped formulate one's own opinions about PI issues Weaknesses: I wish the discussion comments hadn't been locked until one published their own. Open access allows for maximum engagement with others' opinions and might help prepare better for class discussion",
    "Strengths: Variation of the nature course discussion discussion leader component Weaknesses: Feedback on assignments could have been clearer and more constructive",
    "The course was largely Polynesia and Hawaii focused and while it was great to study one region in depth, it would also have been valuable to explore further the issues and history of other regions of the Pacific.",
    "This course was well organized and well run. The readings were interesting and illuminating. The final project was a great opportunity to do independent work and pursue an area of study that the class had not touched on.",
    "This course was great in that it used a lot of different media as sources for instruction and knowledge. I really enjoyed using written scholarly sources like articles and books as well as films and video projects and websites and short stories to learn more about the subject and engage with it. It was great that not only were the sources varied, but the class structure was as well. Some weeks we would have a discussion while others we would have a debate or a presentation. The varied structure of the course allowed the students to really engage with the subject, and I never found myself distracted or not paying attention in seminar, and it really made the time in class fly by. As for weaknesses, I can't really say there were any. I really enjoyed the structure, the work, the amount of work, and the professor."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class! You will not regret it. All non-Natives have a responsibility to learn more about the Pacific Islands, since the U.S. has benefited greatly from the annexation, colonisation, and exploitation of the Pacific. This class is an enjoyable way to answer to that responsibility.",
    "Absolutely! If this course is taught again, take it. There is an entire history that is too often overlooked. Professor Teves is incredibly patient and is genuinely dedicated to ensuring that students get as much out of the course as possible. It is designed to fit your learning style, allowing you to take ownership over your own academic interests and work.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to another student! Almost everyone took the class because Pacific Islander studies is a gap in our education and I would say that most students at Yale probably share this. This class will make you think about representations of Pacific Islanders completely differently and I learned a lot about history as well! Professor Teves is also an amazing instructor.",
    "10\/10 would recommend. A postdoc for the RITM center taught it this year, but if the course comes back I'd definitely recommend since it's a topic that isn't talked about a lot.",
    "100% yes take it!",
    "If you want to fill a general knowledge gap for most Americans, the colonial histories of Pacific Island territories and nations, definitely take the course. The course focuses on targets of American colonialism, especially Hawai'i, but the Marshall Islands, Aotearoa, Samoa, Fiji, etc. are all also discussed. Professor Teves is excellent at facilitating discussion based on current events and teaching history. There are two main brief writing assignments that allow one to synthesize material and solidify their own opinions.",
    "Take this course! Professor Teves is a leading scholar in her field. In this class you will learn about the histories of the Pacific Islands and how current structures and systems within their culture and community were shaped. Great class with meaningful discussion. All assignments are manageable and the final project can take any form.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course - the Pacific represents a major gap in most curriculum and it is both fascinating and important to learn about the region's cultures and the negative legacy of Western imperialism.",
    "This is a topic that many more people should know about -- that everyone should know about -- and so I think that many more people should take this course! I absolutely recommend it!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to another student. I loved that this course engaged a subject that many American students don't usually think about, even though the Pacific is an integral part of our national history as well. I really loved the lens and the approach we took to the course material. I think that it's really important that more people learn about this, and that teaching a course about this at least once a semester would exponentially improve Yale's offerings and intellectual diversity."
