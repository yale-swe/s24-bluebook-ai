   "comments": [
    "This course moves fast. If you have taken Econ already or want to major in econ, then this is a good class for you. However if you are just interested in the principals take the lecture. This is really not a \"basic\" course.",
    "DEFINATELY TRY TO GET INTO TOLGA's SEMINAR over the lecture. As somebody who took both up until the midterm I can definitely tell you that being in the seminar is a hugggeee luxury. You learn a lot more and in what I think is a more logical order.Tolga is probably one of the best freshmen teacher's I've had so far. Also, he's freaking hilarious. This course is a great survey for the intro to microecon. It covers all the topics ably and the material is very comprehensive.Take this seminar if you plan on being an econ major or even if you just want to have a very useful understanding of basic economics.",
    "Economics 110 is a class that goes over the basics of microeconomics. I would recommend it to students because it is important information to have in order to be a smart consumer or to run a successful business.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Econ is incredibly fun, and the workload isn't too much at all.",
    "Tolga is an amazing professor that keeps the class interesting and helps you when you need it. Definitely take this class and with him if possible.",
    "110 is a more intense class than the Econ lecture is. If you're interested in majoring in Econ or related fields, I'd absolutely recommend the seminar (this course). If you're not that serious about Econ, you might not like this as much. The grade is a little tougher and the workload is a little higher. But definitely worth it if you want to do something in Econ, and Tolga is fantastic.",
    "The course is a great foundation for economics. It is though, but Tolga Koker is an amazing teacher and you will have a lot of fun in his classes.But take it with Koker!! Whenever I did problem sets with my friends from Simons' section, they always mentioned that they were much less prepared for them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students. Speaking as a student who took economics in high school, I never fully appreciated the interconnectedness of consumer choice, a firm's production and factor markets. Econ 110 starts with the very basics of economics (basically what you would have covered in high school) and it goes on to give you a strong foundation in microeconomic analysis. This course also challenged the assumptions that underlie economic theory, which helped me to look at the subject critically.",
    "Economics 110 01 is a course on microeconomics that goes beyond just an introduction to the topic. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, because it taught me how applicable economics is in life. It's a challenging course, but you learn a lot which makes it more than worth the effort that goes into it. Professor Koker was the most engaging instructor I had this term and he made the topic very interesting.",
    "I would recommend it if you're an Econ major, but if you're not, you're better off in the lecture.",
    "Very good class, take it if you get in. Workload isn't too much and Tolga is a very interesting teacher if you like teachers who interrupts the class with jokes. However, his accent might take some time to get used to~",
    "It's a long class period (1.5 ish hours) but it's interesting and oftentimes very funny. Take it",
    "Economics 110 is a fascinating intro class.It covers a wide range of subject matter and examines it thoroughly enough to get a good understanding of micro-econ. It is well organized, well taught, and a very strong base for anybody interested in economics. There is no previous knowledge of the subject necessary. Strongly recommended."
