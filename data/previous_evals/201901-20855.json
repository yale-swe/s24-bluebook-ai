    "Learned how to think critically about a variety of issues. Was a great way to help me think about the long-term and global effects of a singular action. Awesome intro to ecological thought that was not too much for a humanities major.",
    "I learned about ecosystems, the species that build various ecosystems, and how these ecosystems are connected. I also learned about how humans impact their environment, and how to limit the negative impact we have.",
    "I learnt more about the complexities of ecosystem interactions and the role that humans play in preserving the future of these ecosystem interactions for services that we depend on. The course encouraged me to adopt a new understanding of the consequences of climate change on biotic life."

   "comments": [
    "Assignments were good. Lecture was a bit boring and not really suited to the smaller class size. The papers we read all seemed pretty obvious and not really worth reading.",
    "The lectures were interesting and insightful, and the course material was not overly burdensome. However, a couple of the projects were overly difficult, as a lot of the information we were required to find was not readily available on the internet. This made the process of completing these projects to be really stressful. Also, although it was helpful that the lectures built on each other and were related, the course material we were learning about did start to feel repetitive at times.",
    "The class raised very interesting questions about our relationships with nature. The section was very useful for solidifying concepts learned in class and asking questions to supplement my understanding. I think that the course was designed for a bigger class and than a larger class size would have allowed for more fruitful discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! If you have a lot of science\/ecology\/biology background, it may be too basic for you though.",
    "Yes. Overall, aside from a couple of the projects, its not excessively challenging but it is still very interesting and I felt I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in environmental activism and who wants to learn more about how dependent we are on the Earth. It provided crucial insight into some of the flawed understandings of environmental advocacy and some of the paradoxes of uninformed activism. This class is necessary for anyone who wants to venture into the environment as a career."
