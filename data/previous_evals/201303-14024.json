   "comments": [
    "Yes! Russian literature is weird. Try it.",
    "Take it! The reading loan is very manageable and the content is extremely interesting. Having some sort of background in Russian literature and\/or history would be helpful, but not completely necessary.",
    "Excellent course, I really recommend it. The books were very enjoyable and Professor Fink does very well with balancing student participation and providing background for the novels.",
    "The Irrational in Russian Literature was a really great class. I loved the reading list, I loved exploring the different portrayals of madness, and it was really interesting to explore the ways in which the relationship between madness and rationality was used in literature as a response to shifting sociopolitical circumstances. This class is a great introduction to a number of the most important authors in the Russian tradition, and has me wanting to take more literature classes, particularly Russian literature. Professor Fink was an excellent seminar leader, particularly given how small our class was. With more people, I might have said that she stepped in to discussions too much rather than guiding them, but with only five people regularly speaking her intercessions kept the conversation from dying. She's also incredibly knowledgeable about Russian literature and culture, and provided excellent background on the material that grounded and elevated our discussions. The workload is very manageable (about 100 pages of literature reading a week, give or take, a 5 page midterm essay and a 12-15 page final paper), and the class was one of the highlights of my semester. Definitely take it if you're interested in literature, Russia, and the human mind!"
