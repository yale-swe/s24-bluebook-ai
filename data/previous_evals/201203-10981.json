   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the physiological mechanisms involved in speech, or are interested in how articulation is related to perception of speech, this will be a very interesting course for you. I would recommend it to students studying in any language-related or thought-related field, or any medical student who wished to understand issues involved in speech and speech disorders.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I learned a lot of interesting new things with language production and perception.",
    "It's a course where you will become familiar with the sounds of the world's languages and will be able to recognize and produce them. It provides a better understanding of how sounds are produced and what their role is in language production and comprehension.",
    "While the material is extremely interesting, it is also highly specific in a way that many other courses are not. As such, I would only recommend it to a subset of people interested in linguistics and\/or speech processing",
    "I would summarize this course as a good introduction to the field of phonetics. It is a course that probably has two semesters worth of information packed into one semester, but overall it will introduce you to everything and anything you might need to know to have a solid basic understanding of the field. For this reason I would recommend it to another student."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "While I do not believe what I learned in General Phonetics will directly apply to my research or my eventual dissertation, learning how to record human speech using Praat and edit sound files using Audacity will help in situations where field research is needed and in situations where it is important to produce high-quality recordings of speech for analysis.",
    "It has provided me a better understanding of how this step in language production is achieved. It is very different from my Phonology class, and I very much liked the approach and the organization of the course. Also, Prof. Krivocapic is very helpful and she is always available to go over anything you've seen in class.",
    "My takeaway from this course is that there are still many unanswered questions in phonetics, eg how vowels work. It has certainly made me much warier of making assumptions when it comes to phonology",
    "This course did provide a solid understanding of the many basics of phonetics, which has filled in a gap in my overall knowledge of linguistics. In terms of my own research, it does not directly contribute, but it is good to have this foundation for general understandings of various linguistic phenomena."
