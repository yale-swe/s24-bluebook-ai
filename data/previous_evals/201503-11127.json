    "As in my above comment, I would recommend this course as a definitive background in the history plays of Shakespeare.",
    "highly recommended. A must-take for anyone who's interested in Shakespeare and early modern literature.",
    "The class is a survey of Shakespeare's histories placed in conversation with other contemporary works in the same genre. The class considers the way that historiographical approaches were shifting in the Tudor-Stuart period, incorporating changes in scholarly historiography, popular chronicle literature, and historical drama. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in early modern drama, politics, and historiography."

   "comments": [
    "This class will inform my perspective on drama and on English historiography, which I will carry into future research in my analyses of historical change.",
    "It has given me a good sense of how Shakespeare utilized the historical sources and reinvented them for artistic and political purposes. I also learned a lot about political theories concerning kingship, sovereignty, historiography, etc., which will be helpful for my later research.",
    "I am interested in early modern drama but had never had the opportunity to study the history genre in a classroom setting. It was great to finally get a chance to do so! I feel as if the class broadened my knowledge of Shakespeare's social and cultural world and gave me the chance to familiarize myself with the critical literature surrounding early modern history writing."
