    "I didn't need this class for a requirement, I took it for fun and just to improve my Spanish, and so I enjoyed the class. Less demanding than L1 and L2 and to be honest most of the material reinforces what you've already learned in L1 and L2",
    "Spanish 3 is Spanish 3 and you'll learn everything you'd expect. All sections use the same interesting readings and films but the instructor makes all the difference in whether or not the course is enjoyable.",
    "This class is not very much fun but the last week is really cool because we watch a film in Spanish (we saw Pan's Labyrinth). It moves quickly but is basically just a review.",
    "Absolutely! It is an excellent review of the material learned in L1 and L2.",
