    "This was a fantastic book a week class on ethnographies across Asia. The writing component was not terribly helpful, but I enjoyed the opportunity to do research on a contemporary topic.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Close attention to student writing; a well-curated reading list. Erik Harms was a very dedicated and approachable instructor. Weaknesses: Discussions were free-flowing and not always focused enough for explication of concepts",
    "Strengths: You read a wide variety of ethnographies and get a grasp of many writing styles You're forced to consider the minutia of a single book when writing an academic review, which was a useful exercise in concision, analysis, and academic writing Weaknesses: Just a lot of reading each week that was almost impossible to process on any deep level There were some exercises we did (like putting up quotes online) that we never really expanded upon and became kind of like busywork",
    "I think it's a fantastic course, negative comments really. One of my favorite aspects was the writing aspects, perhaps consider making it a writing credit because I felt like I learned more about writing in this course than in my English writing seminar...which either speaks poorly of the English course or highly of this one. I think workshopping papers in class and having everyone read out their reviews is a fantastic setup. Writing is art, and I'm always astounded how writing often doesn't get \"critiques\" in classes like art and architecture. Discussing someone's writing is a very helpful exercise, and should happen more in writing classes at Yale. I think us students still need to get used to it though, as not many people spoke up during those reading response sections (we also ran out of time a lot for those).",
    "It's a fascinating course that is taught very well. It's very labour-intensive (a book a week) but all the books are really interesting and not usually books you might have read already so it's a wonderful opportunity to explore a new field you might not have any experience in. You don't really have to know anything about urban ethnography or Asian cities to take the course, it's structured for everyone. A lot of work but also a lot of payoff.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Harms did a great job putting together the materials and our TA Emily was extremely helpful and hands-on",
    "While the breadth of the ethnographies we covered was useful, I sometimes felt like because we went through so many so quickly we didn't get as much out of reading each one as we could have. Being more selective about he ethnographies or about sections of the books to read (which was smth prof harms did for the first ethnography but did not follow up on) would have been useful"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class for underclassmen looking to get a good grasp of social theory in a seminar setting. I would recommend this class for juniors and seniors if they have a special interest in urban theory and",
    "This was a decidedly \"meh\" class for me. Sometimes the books we read and the resulting discussion were great, and sometimes it was like pulling teeth. There didn't really seem to be much of a logical order for the books (aside from the \"theoretical interlude\" in the middle, that I found more confusing than anything else. On the other hand, some of the reading was really cool and you get a great sense of different styles of anthropological research and writing. Just be sure you, as a student, have time to actually read and process all of it.",
    "a fantastic course, and would highly recommend it. it's a seminar discussion format with a book a week, but it manages not to devolve into \"book club\" - like discussions like some other classes with similar formats end up doing. In part, that's because there's a large writing aspect to the course and we critique and workshop each other's work (and reading review), which breaks up the monotony of just summarizing books. there's also a focus on critiquing writing style and method, which is arguably more helpful in thinking about how to apply what you learned to other experiences in academia and life. also questions of balancing theory and description comes up, and though you definitely don't need experience with theory to do well I think having an interest in it would help as almost every book brings it up. Professor Harms is a great professor and really patient, willing to work with students to help improve their work. He also helps explain seemingly complicated things fairly concisely. if you have any interest in social science\/urban studies, you should definitely take this course. it helps you think more critically about these subjects, and especially if you live in\/have lived in\/go to Asia often. plus the skills you learn in this course, especially how to write and critique writing, are really useful in many different fields and disciplines. one of my favorite classes at yale, and in my opinion, a model for what a great college class should be",
    "Definitely! Take this course! Professor Harms is one of the best instructors at Yale and this class is a fascinating study of Asian ethnography (but really overarching issues that plague cities and city dwellers that could be applied anywhere). All the readings are super interesting, the atmosphere that Professor Harms creates in the class is very encouraging and not at all scary. Anyone can take this, from a grad student to a freshman and get a lot out of it. There's also a lot of freedom with the papers to really pick a topic that interests you so you can't go wrong. Take this course!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in comparative anthropology, sociology, or cultural history. The material was very engaging and consistently interesting.",
    "Yes, but know it's more about ethnography than Asian cities!",
    "I would it I would also mention that it is a class with a significant amount of work and where grading is fairly strict. I did enjoy the class and I did enjoy reading the texts we were assigned + the discussions we had",
    "Yes, Professor and TF were very dedicated, books we read were also very interesting."
