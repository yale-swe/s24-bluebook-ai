    "Its a great course with an amazing professor. It's not that much work, but the material can be hard at times. Prepare to feel challenged but know that your questions will be answered if u ask the professor or fellow friends.",
    "NO, take 120. This is hard and you won't learn much. I am not an engineer, I am a G&G major, so if you too are not an engineer....don't take it!",
    "Overall, a good course. The problem sets get a bit long in the middle but if you understand the work they aren't too difficult. Based on what my friends have told me I would recommend this course over Maths 120 as it isn't always as abstract.",
    "This is a fun class, its hard but definitely worth it. Much better than the Math 120 option.",
    "ENAS 151 is a great math course - TAKE IT OVER MATH 120! It's the same multivariable class but with concrete engineering examples, but you don't have to be an engineer to take it! Professor Smooke is a great lecturer and a very understanding professor. I know it's 9am, but if you have to take multivariable, this is the only way to go.",
    "Yes, take this. Taught straight out of the book, no surprises. This class is certainly predictable and manageable. The weekly problem set took 2-4 hours tops, and the two midterms were at the same difficulty level as the homework. Also, Smooke is very nice and receptive to questions during classes or afterwards.",
    "Totally, if you've never taken a multivariable class before and if you don't like mathematical derivations. This class shouldn't be too hard if you feel confident about your mathematical knowledge, i.e. more opportunity to explore some other difficult classes in Yale because this one will relatively be an easy A",
    "This class should really be called \"Multivariable Calculus without Proofs,\" not \"Multivariable Calculus for Engineers.\" There aren't any real engineering applications to speak of, and it doesn't go into tremendous depth with the concepts covered. That being said, the math is presented in an incredibly clear, understandable, and user-friendly way. Prof. Smooke is a great teacher, the homework and tests are quite reasonable, and most of the people I talked to were doing very well without putting in a ton of effort.There's honestly no reason to struggle through bad teaching in Math 120 rather than just take this class. I have a suitemate in Math 120, and his grades (as well as his understanding of the calculus) are much more tenuous than they should be, simply because nobody can understand the instructor or follow what he's doing. I'm pretty sure that ENAS 151 has been growing every year, and for good reason. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENAS 151 to someone else - especially who likes math, physics, and\/or engineering. It applies the calculus you are learning as you go, rather than just proving things and moving on.",
    "Its a solid applied math class. Everything is well explained, the homework is easy and the midterms are a breeze.",
    "This course is basically multi. calc through word problems.",
    "Unless you're trying to be a math major, ENAS is the way to go to preserve your sanity and your GPA. It teaches you a good amount, and you will be surprised at how easy the exams are.",
    "This is a difficult class, and your grade is based pretty much on 2 midterms and 1 final. The midterms had 5 questions each. I personally do not think that that's enough to determine one's grade in the class. I believe that my grade does not accurately reflect how much I understand the material. You just have to somehow know what topics out of the many that there are will be on the exams.",
    "Better than MATH 120 for learning multivariable calc. Weekly problem sets aren't too bad, although lectures at 9 am can be a drag. Tests were reasonable.",
    "I would summarize the class as a different version of Math 120 with a more interesting professor and larger problem sets. I would most definitely recommend this class to engineering students as I see few advantages to taking it through the math department and it is incredible through ENAS.",
    "Take the class if you have taken a multivariate class before or have the appropriate math background. While it is better than 120, sometimes Professor Smooke's \"out of the book\" teaching is not the most helpful towards understanding the complex concepts and applications.",
    "ENAS 151 is very similar to a high school multivariable course. The work is constant and can be somewhat frustrating, but the TA's generally are able to assist if asked. I might be hesitant taking 151 if your major does not require it. The class requires a lot of work, but is also very beneficial.",
    "I think this is a very comprehensive overview of multivariable calculus and its applications. After completing ENAS 151, I am confident in my ability to do most problems involving multivariable calculus. I could not decide between MATH 120 and ENAS 151, but I'm glad I took ENAS 151.",
    "Easy if you're a math person! I would recommend it over equivalent in math department (i.e. 115\/120) but know that it is difficult.",
    "Well taught course that teaches you the material. Lectures are clear and coherent, and in case you miss them the textbook is extremely well-written and you can basically just learn the material by reading from there. Take it if you need to learn multivariable. It's a class where you feel that you can do well given the resources and the materials you're tested on in the 2 midterms and the final.",
    "If you're choosing between ENAS 151 and MATH 120, take ENAS. It's very straightforward, typical math class. The problem sets aren't bad, and the two midterms are pretty straightforward and easy. The final was more difficult but manageable.",
    "This is a must take class over Math 120. Every time I spoke to friends in 120, they wished they were in this class. Professor Smooke is great and the exams were very straight forward. Problems sets were fairly easy and if you needed help there were enough TF office hours to go to get help.The only problem is sometimes you will need to teach yourself the concepts out of the book just because you cannot really learn math from a lecture course.But TAKE THIS OVER MATH 120 especially if you are thinking of anything engineering or science",
    "pretty standard multivariable calculus course. a lot of people never came to lectures. psets every week were manageable.",
    "It was fine. Curve isn't great but not awful. Homework fine. Midterms (2) have 5 word problems. Final has 10. All fairly straightforward. Looking back, I think I might've given Math 120 a shot even though people told me to do ENAS 151 over Math 120. I feel like I could've taken more away from a class in which there's more interaction (so that you can do and discuss math in class, rather than just watch someone else do it and discuss it).",
    "This class was very good. I feel like I learned a lot, and Professor Smooke is a great teacher. He really knows how to explain concepts so you understand them. The thing that made this course difficult was the fast pace. Make sure you start the problem sets ahead of time, and go to office hours!",
    "Very good class! Take it with Smooke!",
    "Pretty predictable multivariable calculus class. Not as many \"engineering applications\" as you may expect based on the description. Basically taught from the book.",
    "It was a fine class; there is really no reason to attend lectures. You will still learn plenty, though, making it an excellent alternative to 120. The problem sets are long though. I wouldn't take it unless you really have to.",
    "If you have taken multivariable calculus already in high school, do not take this course, as you will find the pace of the class frustratingly slow at times. If you are taking multivariable for the first time, be sure to consult outside sources or find a tutor. The textbook for this course is poorly-written, and unfortunately lectures tend to be straight out of the book.",
    "I would recommend this class for engineers. Easy A, and efficient and clean style of teaching.",
    "In general, I would definitely recommend ENAS 151, especially if its taught by smooke. It's a very solid class. Reasonable Psets and exams. There is not much help (Smooke does not have plentiful office hours, and TA office hours are not that plentiful either) but friends usually provide enough help for this class. Smooke is an amazing lecturer. However, ENAS 151 might not be right for everyone. A common complaint from students doing poorly is that \"all we do is memorize equations and don't understand how we got them or howthey work.\" As much as I hate proofs, I feel that a proof based approach (Math 120 as opposed to ENAS151) might be better because proofs force you to understand at a fundamental level. The problem with Math 120 is that you might end up with a very poor grad student teaching the course. If that happens then definitely switch to ENAS but if your grad teacher is good (rare) then it might be better to stay in math 120 (seminar format is a plus too). Overall, ENAS is very solid course that I recommend to anyone who wants to take multi.",
    "ENAS 151 is a class that engineering students should definitely take, especially if they don'tlike theoretical proofs. This course is much more application of the material than MATH 120, but really that is the only difference. Take the course if Professor Smooke is teaching it. He is a great professor; he is careful to tailor the class to address everyone so that it isn't too boring for those that have already taken Multivariable Calculus in high school and isn't too difficult for those that have never seen the material before. (Which I heard didn't happen in the MATH 120 classes) Also, the textbook that this course uses is phenomenal, so even if Prof Smooke isn't teaching it, I would recommend the course. I'm definitely very glad I took this instead of MATH 120.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend ENAS 151 for those who did not cover Multivariable Calculus in High School. Do not take this course if you already did this topic.",
    "A lot of people who took the class last year, were very satisfied with the class and thought the grading was very fair. I can't really disagree with that and I might be an outlier, but I learned very little during the large lectures in the morning as there was too much new new information presented for a long time too early. I would recommend taking 120 instead if you haven't had multivariable calc, but thisclass if you had.",
    "I would recommend this class over Math 120 specifically because it is not taught by a grad student (not that all 120s are) and it isn't as difficult.",
    "I thought that ENAS 151 was a reasonable course. It was a little bit difficult to get questions answered, and I think that Math 120 might have some benefit over it for that reason. The smaller sections that are available in Math120 have definite benefits over the 100 person class.",
    "I would MORE than recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "I have never taken any physics\/engineering-related classes before, and took this class simply because they told me it was easier than math 120.This teacher actually speaks English (unlike most 120-teachers), and uses a lot of interesting real-life examples to make it less dry.You don't need any physics knowledge to do well.",
    "ENAS 151 is a good introduction to Multivariable Calculus. Although not very difficult, it is thorough and a useful thing to know. Smooke's lectures are also very interesting for a math lecture.",
    "Take this class. Good application based multivariable class that isn't too finicky about theory.",
    "Can be a challenging math course if you haven't taken multi before. I would recommend it.",
    "A more interesting and possibly easier approach to multivariable calculus than Math 120. I would recommend it to another student for this reason.",
    "I really like that this course was taught by a professor rather than a TA. In fact, this was the primary reason why I chose it over math 120. The psets were quite long sometimes, although not too difficult. The midterms were also not too hard;the average was about an 85. I wasn't a big fan of the textbook, but the material itself is not that difficult to learn. Overall, I would recommend ENAS 151 (over math 120), especially for prospective engineering majors.",
    "It is a very good class to take. The concepts are easy to understand and this allows you to apply them to complex problems.",
    "Overall this class is not that bad. Everything is pretty easy until the last chapters with stokes, greens, and divergence theorem. The psets are not that much work, they are pretty reasonable. I would recommend this class over 120. The professor is also witty.",
    "A class that tends to have a lot of students who have already taken multi - if you haven't, be prepared to do a lot of work to catch up.",
    "Take it if your 120 teacher doesn't suit you. Or you want a little less proofs, and a little more emphasis on the applications of multi.",
    "Definitely better than Math 120. Helps a lot for prospective engineering students.",
    "If you like learning about math for real-world applications, ENAS is for you. However, if you're a more conceptual type person, then be warned that you'll have to put in a little extra work outside of class to fully understand concepts conceptually.",
    "I would recommend it for the engineering req. not too mich work but you learn quite a bit.",
    "ENAS 151 is a good course. The workload is not that different from any other course that you take at Yale. Material is sometimes dry, but Professor Smooke is a funtastic instructor. You should take this course!",
    "ENAS 151 is a good multivariable calculus course; my only suggestion would be to maybe take it second semester, as I had never taken multivariable calculus before or done anything with vectors or 3-d space really, and there seemed to be a lot of people in the class who had done some or all the material before (and maybe they won't be there second semester). I feel like the class is fair, but the homework on tangents, normals, and binormals takes an insane amount of time: do not wait until the last minute to do that section.",
    "Class is considered to be better than math 120. Out of four TA, only one of them was a real math brain, rest of them needed a lot of time to understand a question\/problem from homework, what is annoying if the session is only 1h long. Many people do not usually go to the lecture but if you haven't studied this topic before, you should come. Otherwise, it would hurt your grade. Some people take this class only to get a good grade 'cos they studied it before in high school. Take if you have to but do not expect fireworks..",
    "No. The class is really hard and I didn't like it. One should only do it if it is for their major.",
    "This is a less theoretical version of MATH 120. It is based more on applications. For a perspective science or engineering major, this is a great class to take.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to another student because it's a good class to fulfill the necessary multivariable calc requirement for engineering courses. It is very practical and often correlated to engineering type problems",
    "Yes I would, it has a very excellent teacher who understands the pace at which students can learn and truly wants them to make the most of the class. It also has interesting content. Finally, it is graded very fairly.",
    "Take it! If you've ended up in a bad math 120, or if you're an engineer, you can't really go wrong with this class.",
    "It is an inconsistent class that does not teach you multivariable calculus too well. Pretty easy if you understand the questions on the test but even if you study like crazy and then dont understand what it is asking on the test you will do badly.",
    "Make sure you're completely rested before test days. If you aren't, one lower grade (especially since one test is only 5 questions) can really pull down your final grade.",
    "Multivariable calc for anyone. Better than Math 120 from everyone I talked to. I struggled in this class at times but I think the information was there. I could have benefitted more from practice problems. Would recommend. Also, concepts and applications are very interesting. Just sometimes hard to see the big picture.",
    "If like me, you are not an engineering major, I would still highly recommend this class. It's an opportunity to really learn some new material, challenge yourself, and benefit from a really great professor.",
    "If you are an engineering major, I would definitely take this course over Math 120. The order in which the material is covered and the context of the problems is much more accessible than a regular math class. The problem sets are sometimes long but are excellent preparation for the exams, and Prof Smooke gives you a good indication of what the exams will look like throughout lecture. The problems sets are always returned quickly and give you a lot of opportunity to get extra points in your homework section. The lectures move quickly but everything is explained very clearly. If you are willing to put in the time outside of class to understand everything and prepare for lecture, than the class is great and largely beneficial.",
    "The class is very much like Math 120, but is filled with engineering students. As a class, I think it is significantly better than some sections of Math120, but I would have taken some sections of 120 over this class.",
    "I would summarize it as a large lecture on multivariable calculus, with no application. I would not recommend the course because of its ineffective methods of teaching the material.",
    "The teacher was very comprehensive. It wasn't exactly fun but it was very straight-forward and I felt like all the students had a good understanding of the material. As long as you go to class& read the textbook, the homework is fairly easy and the exams are also very straight-forward. I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Great course, take instead of Math 120!",
    "Yes, I would, especially those who are not so much interested in doing proofs and theoretical work, but are interested in improving their problem solving ability.",
    "Great class if you want to learn how to solve problems with multivariable calculus. The instructor knows how to keep the material interesting, and is great at explaining how concepts learned in class relate to real-world applications. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone seeking to improve his or her calculus skills."
