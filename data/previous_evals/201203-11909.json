   "comments": [
    "Take it if you like to write and need a science credit. Don't take it if you have a low tolerance for BS.",
    "Boring. Sort of just sit in class and present once in a while. Pick a topic you really like. No idea what my grade is going to be since it's just based on this one paper, but most people seem to take this class as a joke, so if you put in a little effort, you'll probably be okay. Could be a GREAT opportunity to research something you're passionate about. At least I'll get an SC credit.",
    "Gem of a science credit. Take it.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to non-science AND science majors. There is no reason anyone wouldn't want to take this class",
    "Only really need to do work every other week since you present to the class that frequently. Very nice to have the relaxed pace. You get to choose any topic you'd like to do research. I feel like I learned a lot over the course o the semester.",
    "Absolutely. IT is by no means an easy course, although it could be if the student isn't self-directed. The structure of the course puts a lot of faith in the student, which I like. If you're up for a non-structured course where you have to put in a more of legwork to get something substantial out of it, then this one is for you!",
    "This class is wonderful if you are self-motivated, but its format facilitates procrastination in a way that means no one does research until the last few moments. I hated myself for taking it, by the end. I could have learned so much more about my topic by taking a real class on it, but instead spent my semester twiddling my thumbs and refreshing my email, with a final super-stressful rush at the end. Admittedly, all that was entirely due to my own bad habits, but the course is not good if you are like me. If you're self-motivated and conscientious and don't care too much about actually learning things, this course is for you.",
    "It's a great way of fulfilling your science credit while simultaneously finally getting the chance to research something you're interested in. The class basically consists of choosing one topic at the beginning of the semester and then researching all the way until your final paper (15\/18 pages) is due at the end of reading week. You present on your progress every couple of weeks and have a final 10 minute presentation right before your paper is due. By the end of the semester you will have learnt a lot about your topic while also learning the basics and some fun facts about everyone else's research. I found the class super interesting and Professor Summers to be both hilarious and super approachable. He is basically the most knowledgeable human being I have met. Whether your topic is a disease or the biological roots to morality, he has something interesting to say about it all. It's fantastic.",
    "This is definitely a class for non-science majors. From week to week there is not a ton of work, just regular research for your paper. However, there is a lot of work at the end of the semester to finish the paper. The class can be stressful because 50% of your grade is your final paper, so you won't have any idea what your grade is going into the end of the semester.",
    "Definitely the best Sc class you can take. You will learn a lot about your topic from your research and get an introduction to other students' research. Not too much work for the payoff of learning about scientific technique."
