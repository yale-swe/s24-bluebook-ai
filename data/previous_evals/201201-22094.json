   "comments": [
    "fun, but confusing, as a huge amount of information was presented and it was unclear what we needed to know, or what relevance it had. sometimes it just seemed like a picture show. one upside is that there was no homework.",
    "I'd take it again.",
    "This is a science class about evolution that is cool and has no weekly homework. In terms of grading I have no idea how it's going to pan out, but the midterm they seemed to have graded fairly and the paper quite harshly. But the final is worth 50%, which kind of sucks.I think I would recommend this class. But it's not the best class I've taken.",
    "I would recommend GG 125 to any student at Yale. It has universal themes such as evolution and chemistry. I personally found all stages of the course interesting, right from the introduction to geology to evolution to the fossil record, etc.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone! The topic is amazing and the professors are wonderful. This is the first class I've taken where I genuinely enjoy learning the material and going to lecture, because the topics are enthralling.",
    "This is the worst course I have taken so far at Yale. The lectures are poorly constructed (with the VERY notable exception of Nick Longrich's contributions) and the continuity between different lectures had much to be desired. I learned overall very little from this course as expectations and presentation of what material was in fact important and what material we would be tested on were never clearly expressed. I was bored to tears almost every class by what seemed to be disinterested, jaded, and unbelievably arrogant teachers (again with the exception of Nick Longrich). I would never recommend this course to anybody ever. Seriously, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. The workload is low, but I don't think it's worth sitting through the 1.25 hour long lectures that you have to go to because there is no connection between the textbook and the course material, and the lecture slides are not self-explanatory in any way, shape or form (except for Longrich's).",
    "If you're looking for an interesting and pretty easy science credit, I would shy away from this course. It was pretty dull especially when Derek Briggs was teaching. I also found it very difficult. The midterm was very hard and the papers were curved so that you did worse that what you originally got. I'm overall not happy with my selection of this course.",
    "The first half of this course was well taught, and tremendously exciting. The second half was slightly less thrilling, though still interesting, but at times tried to accomplish too much, in fields outside of the coursesaims. I felt that too much emphasis was placed on the role of Human Beings in the History of life, and not enough on the many other, lesser-talked-about elements. I would have also been more impressed if some of the resources from the Peabody Museum were used.Professor Briggs is an outstanding lecturer, and made the first half of the course a lovely experience. He has a way of making the information stick, without giving it too much overt attention, and therefore it never feels like the class is dragging.Professor Hickey's portion of the class was a big step down from Professor Briggs. This had a little to do with the material presented, but mostly with the manner of presentation. Lectures were not at all clear, and very hard to stay interested in. At times, his tone struck me as highly pedantic, although, given the audience to which it was pitched, it was perhaps sincere.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a relatively easy science credit without being a total gut. Class in KGL is pretty far away, but most of the time I was motivated to go to lecture because the material is genuinely cool and interesting! It is nice that only three things were graded--our midterm, a midterm paper, and our final exam. And I really liked Nick Longrich's lectures and enthusiasm, though he wasn't originally intended to teach any of this course.",
    "I felt very deceived by this course, for a class that advertises itself as accessible for non-science majors it certainly didn't feel that way. The lectures felt disorganised for the most part and it was impossible to tell what was the important information out of the mass of dates and facts that were thrown at us. Despite there being a recommended textbook, we were never informed as to what would be useful for us to look over to aid our learning. I felt like the effort I have put into this course is in no way reflected in the grades I have been receiving. Despite studying incredibly hard for the midterm, I found myself unable to recognise most of the material presented or able to answer the questions about the material I did recognise. I feel like I wasted my time even righting the paper, after all of the time and research I putinto it I barely received a passing grade. This should not be advertised as suitable for non-science majors if it is not taught and examined as such.",
    "Yes! Very interesting class...glad I took it before graduating!",
    "This is a course about rocks, fossils and sometimes dinosaurs. It is sometimes dull and hard to engage with the material, but it is not that much work until you cram for the midterm, paper or final. It is pretty boring but if you're into that kind of thing or need a science credit that is minimal work throughout the semester, go for it.",
    "survey course of biology. gives you a ton of perspective.",
    "I would recommend this course only if the student has some interest in paleontology. Otherwise there is a lot of detailed material that can be very very boring to study.",
    "Absolutely do not take this class -- I thought it sounded interesting at first (who doesn't like dinosaurs, right?). The grading is really arbitrary, studying for this class is frustrating as hell, and the material is really dry. Plus, Professor Hickey is a bit of a jerk in lecture....I really detested this class...",
    "It is a good thing that the material of this class is interesting in and of itself, otherwise the ineptitude of the professors and the structure of the course would have made it absolutely unbearable. As such, it was an acceptable science credit, but I feel like most students left the class with a bad taste in their mouth. Something I took for granted in other classes that this one seemed to miss the memo on: HAVING ONE PROFESSOR! The fact that three different professors lectured on a variety of topics, often not in their field using their own terminology, sometimes their own research, and not a semblance of consistency was pretty frustrating\/appalling. They wouldn't even attend each others' lectures, so there was unplanned overlap (irritating since our supposed fieldtrip to the Peabody was cancelled at the end of the year for a lecture about how humans are destroying the world). More transparency about exams and maybe even some assigned reading (they made us buy the textbook only to completely ditch it most of the course) might also make it a better, more cohesive whole.If you're looking for a \"gut science\" I guess this might apply. On the surface, it seems appealing- while you have to go to the lectures, there's no reading, one paper, one midterm and a final. But a final worth 50% of your grade is more of a curse than a blessing, and the material is so interesting that the only feeling I had leaving it was one of disappointment that it was not treated more sensibly and that I didn't retain more of it.",
    "This is a survey course in the History of Life. There is no assigned reading, no assigned section, and a midterm, paper, and a final. However, I think the relaxed structure hurt me in the end. It can be a good science credit, however I'm not sure if I would recommend it.",
    "This course is very unorganized and certainly not easy by far. It will require A LOT of memorization and self-teaching.",
    "Whether you're an advanced geology major or just looking for a science credit, history of life is an excellent class. From Derek Briggs, a world-renowned invertebrate paleontologist, you will learn about the earliest evidence of life, how fossils are preserved, exceptional preservations like the Burgess Shale (which Briggs excavated), and up to the rise and fall of trilobites and brachiopods at the end-Permian extinction. From Leo Hickey, an expert paleobotanist and stratigrapher, you will learn about the history of plants and mammals, up to the human-dominated Anthropocene. Leo also imparts a true love for the order and beauty of nature. Finally, the soon-to-be a huge deal postdoc Nick Longrich covers the glamorous things, like the rise of tetrapods, dinosaurs, humans (and he finished with a deep look at what it means, evolutionarily, to be human). The class has a very light workload - reading from the textbook is 100% optional (the profs know they can do better, so it has no impact on the class), and then there's a midterm and a midterm research paper on a given topic, and a final (all extremely doable with a bit of studying\/work). Definitely take this class!",
    "Not as easy as projected. You have to work for an A but you can get away with missing classes every once in a while and pull a B.",
    "It's a summary and survey into the diversity of life that has existed on the planet. Sure, if you're willing to memorize a lot of facts and details for the final and midterm.",
    "History of Life was really a disaster. The course's first half was boring but at least substantive and rigorous. Leo Hickey should be ashamed of his lectures. they were hopelessly disorganized and completely unhelpful - a problem when the course also has no textbook.steer clear",
    "Great class!",
    "Interesting and relatively painless science credit for a non-science person. Derek Briggs, who teaches the first half of the course, is a bada** Irishman who manages to bring up the funniest references while talking about Paleozoic fossils and has actually done some seriously major work on the Burgess Shale (I kid you not; check out his Wikipedia page). The second half was split between Leo Hickey, who specializes in plant evolution and is unfortunately less humorous and more cranky (but still not bad) and Nick Longrich, an enthusiastic postdoc who is obsessed with dinosaurs and will hopefully get added to the roster of HoL professors next year. There is no regular reading or work and only a midterm, a semi-interesting research paper, and a final; section is optional but I only attended twice, for midterm and final reviews. Just make sure you're okay with memorizing huge amounts of information in a short period of time.",
    "Extremely interesting, but vague on what exactly would be assessed on the exams. Great overview of the History of Life, as you might have guessed, and gives you a solid understanding of how we all came to be.",
    "This is a class where absolutely no work has to be done throughout the year besides a simple paper, but TAKE WARNING. THIS IS NOT A GUT. The amount of information you'llhave to stuff into yourself for the tests, and the absolute incomprehensibility of most of that information, makes it an incredibly unpleasant process. I don't know anyone that really enjoyed this class in my year.",
    "An interesting class if you enjoy evolutionary biology and aren't put off by geology jargon. Very little work to do (only one essay and two tests), so it makes a great 5th class.",
    "History of Life is a very interesting way to fulfil your Sc credit, as it basically covers how everything ever evolved, how the world happened, and how you are how you are today, which is all kind of a big deal. The workload is also pretty minimal, though be warned that the midterm and final do require a lot of study and memorisation, and the paper is graded strangely. Professor Hickey is good, if a little rushed at times, and Professor Briggs is wonderful and a huge deal in the Geology world, so it's very cool that he's teaching lowly non-science majors this material. So, overall, take this class, but be ready to sporadically have to really study in order to get a decent grade.",
    "Don't take it. It will kill you.",
    "This course is an extremely fascinating course about the history of life. If you seem to be enthralled by the great biological and cosmic forces that act around us, I believe this course will greatly influence your thinking and general understanding about the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's very interesting and not too much work. Just a midterm, a paper, and a final. If you're interested in geology and paleontology, then definitely take this course!",
    "Study of evolution from early fossil record to rise of man. Briggs is great, makes what could be a very dry subject somewhat interesting. Be wary of the second part of the course, Hickey can be confusing and he definitely doesn't prepare you for the exam.",
    "This is a really interesting class, and to do well in it you need to:1) Take great notes and don't skip any classes2) Write your paper a week ahead and beg one of your TAs to read it ahead of time.",
    "Take it for a science credit. You do lean some valuable stuff. Just make sure to study very hard for exams - lot of memorization!",
    "Mr. Hickey, your lectures in this class are one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.",
    "I took this class for a science credit, and I'm glad that I did. The material was interesting and the lectures were pretty good.",
    "Take the class. It's a great general knowledge of the evolution of life on this planet. The professors are interesting and keep lectures interesting. I suggest taking notes during lectures, you can't skip them, and go to the sections because they really help you prepare for the exams.",
    "To say this was a bad class is an understatement akin to \"the ocean is wet.\" Without a doubt it was the worst educational experience, if one can call it that, I have suffered since the seventh grade. I, and literally (in the true sense word literally) all of my friends in the left lectures wondering, \"what were we supposed to get out of that class? What was the point?\"And don't be fooled by the first few lectures given by Derek Briggs. He is a fine lecturer, very interesting and engaging. When preparing for the midterm, it was hard to know what mattered and what didn't in his lectures, but nonetheless, he was adequate. The second teacher, however, should make you run for the hills: Leo Hickey, whose lectures were atrocious: aimless, disorganized, without clear messages. I got the strong impression that Prof. Hickey was profoundly unaware of his failings. On rare occasions were the lectures filled with information; in such cases, the information was often delivered as simply a litany of facts (e.g., the lecture on the development of primates consisted of 40-odd traits in order). Far more often would minutes pass without a single note-worthy thing said. At times, slide after slide would consist simply of a picture of an animal or a scene of animals, with Hickey merely naming the animals therein. Occasionally, we would be treated to Prof. Hickey's philosophical platitudes; most often repeated was that humans are not necessarily the peak of evolution. A fine point, no doubt, although after the third of fourth time, I think I understood it well enough. Also worth mentioning is that Prof. Hickey failed utterly to convey his expectations for the final exam.The one advantage of the class is that it had no homework. (This also prevents students from knowing what in the blazes will be on the midterm and final....)",
    "Not the easiest Sc credit, if that's what you're looking for. Has a paper, and two very difficult exams. However, has no reading and features interesting material. If you're up to walking all the way to KGL to hear about dinosaurs and fossils, this is the class for you.",
    "HIstory of Life does not have a lot of work, but go to the lectures or else you will not do well on the midterm and final. If you pay attention in class, it will be an enjoyable and truly rewarding experience. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in evolution and the fossil record, or anyone whose childhood fascination with dinosaurs still survives.",
    "This course is light on work (very much so if you credit-d it) and would make a good science course for a non-science major. The only assignment is a single essay that is fairly straight-forward to write and the tests are not difficult so long as you come to lectures and pay attention. Don't be too discouraged by the first few lectures, as the first portion (roughly the first 1\/3) is kind of boring, although it picks up quickly after that and gets very interesting. The lecture notes are posted online and so a class missed here or there isn't damning. Try your best not to miss Prof. Hickey's lectures, though, as his lecture notes consist almost entirely of pictures! I'd say go for it under most accounts. It's light in workload, fairly interesting, and the examinations are not too detail oriented (i.e. they probably won't ask you to name the scientific names of specimens covered briefly in class. Most of the specifics are from very important specimens that are emphasized in lecture).",
    "There is no question that I learned a significant amount of material in the class. The problem was that some of the material was presented poorly, and there were great differences in the teaching ability between the three different professors. Overall, the class was interesting, but it could have been more engaging than it ended up being. My biggest problem was that the T.A.'s and professors often didn't make clear what information was very relevant. So much information was presented that it was difficult to determine what we actually needed to know and what we did or didn't need to memorize. Also - don'tbuy the textbook for the course. You won't need it."
