    "Solid ecology course.",
    "As interesting as such a broad overview of a topic can hope to be. Professor Post is a great lecturer, and clearly loves teaching and the topic, and Prof Vasseur and Smith, while we had them only briefly, were also very passionate and engaging - class time was rarely boring. As an E&EB major, I would have preferred to do more modeling and less specific discussion of global change and specific ecosystems, as this seemed targeted more towards the Environmental Studies majors in the class, when it's an E&EB core! For my research interests, a lot of the information was a lot to specific to, for example, pond ecosystems to change my thinking. Only twenty minutes on host-pathogen interactions? All of the work is fairly manageable, though a lot if it is really stupid: the human demography project was particularly inane. The shocker of this class was the take home final, which was THE HARDEST TEST I HAVE EVER TAKEN. And I'm a senior E&EB major! Something absolutely needs to be done about that.",
    "This is a good overview of ecological interactions. Not for someone who is just generally interested in science; it's fairly specific. If you have interest in the area, though, I'd recommend it. Main things covered include population dynamics, competition, predator-prey interactions, ecosystem function, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem change. David Post is great; he makes the class entertaining and is energetic.",
    "I would recommend Ecology. Post's lectures in particular are lots of fun, and overall the class is good. Theoretical ecology is not exciting though.",
    "EEB 220 covers all aspects of ecology, though it is heavily focuses on the math and less so on examples. I would recommend it if you are interested, but know that the take home final and paper are both hard.",
    "The course presents very interesting information, but I am not sure I would take it with this set of professors unless you only want to learn about Grasslands and Lake ecosystems. Grading isnot particularly fair, and tests\/essay are not representative of information learned in the course. That said, the course presented some interesting questions, and would buttress any Enviro Studies student's course load.",
    "It's a good class. It also gives you the jist of the major",
    "Yes, I would. This course has really opened my eyes to a whole new way of viewing environmental issues and conservation. Great, comprehensive introduction.",
    "Day-to-day: lectures on ecological topics ranging from population dynamics to ecosystem and biospheric studies with many interludes in between. Fifty-minute section once per week with good section leaders.Bottom line: Take this course if there is some prospect that you will be an E&EB major. If you think you just want to take a course of this theme for kicks, search elsewhere (Conservation Biology?)",
    "Good intro ecology class if you don't have a strong background in ecology. If you do, it is likely redundant to other classes offered at Yale that are better (landscape ecology, for instance). Take it early in your time at Yale - you'll get more out of it.",
    "Yes. It was a great class. Be careful about the tests. They will destroy you.",
    "I would recommend this to any student interested in learning about basic ecological principles. E&EB220 is a pretty cut and dry basic science course, but I found that it provided some interesting ways to think about processes and structures, as nerdy as that sounds. The blue book says that Math112 is a prerequisite. That is not actually true \u0096 you don\u0092t need to know any calculus to take this course. The math is conceptually challenging sometimes, but there is nothing that a fair amount of effort and practice can\u0092t resolve.",
    "this was the first E&EB course i took, and it wasnt tooo hard to get by, but i definitely felt a disadvantage (there were quite a few grads in the class)i enjoyed learning the material, the textbook (Gotelli) is not too bad to read, (sometimes it's a bit mathy, if you're not a person who likes math) but other than that the graphs and things are helpful.melinda lectures at a good pace.reads almost directly off the slides though.david p is a great lecturer, but goes very fast through the material.david v covers the more mathy parts so you should try and keep up with what he's saying.the tests are kinda hard i felt, but i liked the class so take it if it interests you.",
    "It's useful for understanding the fundamental principles of ecology. The math involved wasn't difficult, but made understanding some of the models easier. The class wasn't too much work and the paper has several deadlines to check your progress so you can't get too behind with it. Sometimes the grading seemed a bit subjective in comparison to other science classes, but overall itwas an enjoyable course.",
    "This is a tough foundational course for people who want to go on to further study in ecology. I would not recommend it to non-majors unless they are prepared to do lots of work, including a long, open-ended paper that consumes most of the semester.",
    "EEB 220 is a good class, but not without faults. I liked how the class had a good mix of qualitative and quantitative material. The science isn't so soft that all you'll hear about is how pandas are endangered and how global warming is happening (you'll probably hear a good deal about it, though): you'll also hear about key experiments in the field of ecology and conceptually understand and apply some simple models to the ecology of populations and their interactions. It's a required class for EEB majors, and I think for EEB majors it could have been a little more rigorous in terms of concepts and models, but it's a great class for a non-science major who doesn't want to take a gut science class. I don't know how the class is curved, so I can't say much about grading, but I found the midterms to be relatively fair. The first one was a lot more challenging than the second. There's also a 15-page paper, which made the class more stressful than it needed to be. The only feedback you get is through a peer review. It would have been a lot more helpful if the T.A.'s gave feedback, because ultimately they're the ones grading it, and I thought the papers were graded harshly. The lecturers were all good. My favorite was Prof Post, as he had a good mix of qualitative and quantitative science in his lectures. Prof Vasseur was a bit confusing in the population growth lectures. Prof Smith mostly stuck to descriptive ecology. Overall, recommended if you want to fulfill the Sc distribution requirement or are an EEB major (you need it anyways)."
