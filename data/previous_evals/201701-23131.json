    "I developed Writing (W) skills. Most importantly, I developed research skills that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to develop otherwise.",
    "This seminar taught me to view the world around me through a more critical lens. Capitalism and its effects are contextualized in history and thus demystified. It also taught us strategies for approaching dense theoretical texts, and clarified them through class discussion.",
    "I learned a lot in the way of understanding capitalism and its embedding in society. Capitalism, as the course title implies, manages the flow of our lives in profound ways. This course helps you recognize that and understand how that came to be.",
    "Daily Life in American Capitalism was one of my favorite seminars at Yale. I love the idea of seeing how something as abstract as capitalism effects virtually every aspect of our life, and seeing how it has affected human beings throughout history. As for the assignments, I loved the range of skills that this class cultivated, from personal writing, to archival research, to secondary research. Before this class I had never been into the archives, and I truly had so much fun!",
    "learned good historical analysis"

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated the way that the course was structured, particularly in terms of the fact that the concepts are applicable to my everyday life.",
    "The reading list is phenomenal. Seriously, these are incredibly compelling and informative readings--and many of them will stick with you. The material is also just generally very interesting and the periodization, from pre-industry to industrialization to financialization\/deindustrialization is an interesting way of structuring the course.",
    "Phenomenal course with a fantastic instructor.",
    "The class was very well organized, and I especially liked how each week centered around a different theme. I also liked how our discussions were focused on the readings and better helped me understand them, but at the same time we could still stray from the readings and focus on personal experience, other things we had read, or more abstract concepts.I think one suggestion might be to incorporate some of our weekly discussions into the conversation, as each week I would read through my classmates' questions and many of them were quite interesting!",
    "I wish we discussed our canvas questions more in class. Gabe is a great facilitator of discussion but I never left the class feeling like we had reached some kind of resolute conclusion (which maybe is the point?). It would've felt more rewarding to me to have moments in the class where I felt like our discussion was building towards answering one of our own questions.",
    "The syllabus for this course was incredibly well-designed and facilitated learning and creating connections. The readings were also very appropriate and interesting, motivitating what I think was a greater amount of reading than most seminars. I don't mean that more reading was assigned, but more students did the reading than in other seminars I've taken."

    "Definitely! It's an effective way to obtain a Writing (W) course that will not only teach you how to write.",
    "This course is great. Take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone in the history major because its analysis of capitalism is essential to understanding the history of any capitalist society.",
    "This is a phenomenal course--Gabe is a great instructor (clearly very passionate and knowledgeable as well) and won't give you any shit. You should definitely take this course--it helped me discover a passion for labor history and working class history.",
    "Most definitely take this course.",
    "Would highly recommend to any students who are interested in rigorously studying the social history of American Capitalism.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings are enjoyable, the discussions are fruitful, and the field trip to the Tenement Museum was incredible. I understand capitalism through an entirely new lens, and I find myself referencing things I've learned in this class constantly!",
    "Yes",
    "yes! a heck of a lot of fun",
    "Yes."
