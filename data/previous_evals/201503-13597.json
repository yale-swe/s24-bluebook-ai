    "Take this course if you must. Not particularly exciting, but will sharpen your Spanish and isn't impossible. Definitely one of the harder courses in the sequence in terms of content, pace, and workload, but if you do all the assignments you'll be more than fine.",
    "This is a very fun class. My spanish did improve, but I'm by no means fluent. You'll have to do a bunch of busy work but it is totally manageable. Mercedes Carreras is an absolute angel. I would take the class if your top priority isn't perfecting your language skills.",
    "I would recommend span 130 to another student.",
    "i would definitely recommend this course",
    "I'd recommend it to another student. It was exactly what you would expect from a language class at Yale. Daily work, but nothing too crazy."
