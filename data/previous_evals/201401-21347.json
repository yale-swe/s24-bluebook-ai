   "comments": [
    "Good econ senior seminar. Your experience will depend on your other classmates; it felt sometimes as if class was comprised of students trying to demonstrate what they knew about the material.",
    "Yes-take this if you're looking for a cool combination of economics, public health, and psychology. Chill senior seminar with a relatively light work load.",
    "Weekly talking sessions about addictive things with reading responses.",
    "Good class, but a little underwhelming in terms of content.",
    "If you can get into this class, then take it. It's a great senior seminar. The workload isn't overwhelming and the topics of discussion are very relevant and interesting.",
    "This is a great course, taught by wonderful and knowledgeable professor. You will definitely learn a lot about public health and policymaking, and thinking analytically about current\/past policies and regulations. It's a fantastic senior Economics seminar.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! IT IS A WASTE OF A YALE CREDIT. ONLY TAKE IT IF YOU NEED TO TAKE 5 CLASSES AND DON'T WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING OR DO MUCH WORK! It is extremely poorly organized. I don't think I learned anything. It purports to teach evidence-based interventions, but then we just talk about what we think would be good ideas or not. The professor is a fantastic researcher who works on fascinating projects, but none of that translates into this course. I also feel bad writing this because she's a nice person, but I need to do this for you, future class-takers. For the most part, she is unprepared and disorganized. I thought I would take a fairly interesting, but not terribly challenging class in addition to writing a thesis, but this ended up being incredibly frustrating and I did not learn anything.",
    "There are weekly assignments so you can't coast through, the final paper is whatever topic you want and we discuss a variety of subjects so really anyone can find this course interesting. I thought it was a great senior seminar and would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "This class was a pretty fun and relaxing class for an econ senior seminar which is nice if you're a second semester senior. There's definitely a big emphasis on the public health part of it so if you're looking for a very econ-y class, this is probably not for you. The material can get a little bit repetitive, but the class was still enjoyable. The workload is pretty light. The final paper is fairly easy especially because you have to give a presentation on it to the class before the submitting the paper so when it comes time to write it during reading period, you already know exactly what to write without thinking too much about it.",
    "A solid econ seminar - yes.",
    "The class is a super chill Econ Senior Seminar."
