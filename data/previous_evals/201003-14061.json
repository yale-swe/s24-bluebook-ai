    "This is the most impactful class of all I've taken at FES. I've learned more in this class than in 3 classes combined.",
    "Best class i have ever taken, it synthesizes skills and learning...but beware, it requires most of your energy. there is no hiding that this class is demanding, but it is well worth your time and disregard for other classes.",
    "This is by far the most useful and best class at FES. If you can get into it, take it. I consider this course integral and essential to my experience at FES.",
    "This course was a highlight of my educational experiences at FES. It was a pleasure to be given applied work that will truly have an impact, to bring to bear nearly every skill I've learned at FES, and to deal with the realities of human nature and economics (among others). This was one of a few of my collaboratively work experiences at FES, and I found it to be a fun challenge. Prof Ashton is a great lecturer, a pleasure to have in the field, an excellent resource for information, and an encouraging but hard-driving leader all at once.One small comment - it would have been helpful to give students more reminders that the papers we are pulling together will eventually need to go into one document and be formatted alike, so that we would have turned our thoughts to formatting and consistency from the beginning -- how a name will be abbreviated, whether there are two spaces after a period or one, etc. Some you can't predict, but others are small changes that can save a lot of time at the end, allowing us to focus on quality rather than formatting.Oh, and one more -- Of course, as a general rule, I think it is good to leave us to take initiative, seek out the resources we need, and make our own decisions about past land use history and future management. However, our analysis would have benefited quite a bit from more guidance from experts. Perhaps I'm simply encouraging the teachers and TAs to in turn encourage students to go out in the field with experts (in botany, soils, hydrology, reading landscapes) not just early on, but up until the end (in the end even better, because it leaves us time to figure it out on our own, and then cross-reference with someone with more knowledge and experience). This far down the road, I think the quality of our project would have benefitedfrom more oversight; the learning experience, however, may not have been quite as rich.Overall, well done! Thanks!",
    "This course presents a good opportunity to apply knowledge from other courses in a practical, real-life situation. Much of the learning can be frustrating at times, because students may have plenty of theoretical knowledge, but not know how to put it into practice...Using GIS is one example in which this dynamic plays out. Students will end up learning as they go along, by trial and error. Professor Ashton provides guidance to the best of his abilities, but due to the immense scope of the project and the diversity of skills required, a lot of the learning takes place the hard way: by making mistakes and spending lots and lots and lots of time to figure things out.",
    "Jason did a great job organizing field work. I wasn't sure his comments on drafts was necessary. Maybe an improvement would be to have TAs available to help with writing questions or other issues teams face."

    "The independent work",
    "This is an applied course that teaches skills to supplement the professional's knowledge base. I highly recommend this course for practitioners.",
    "group work and learning, practical implications, one of the most fun and useful classes at fes",
    "You get to live out in the field, Mark is always ready to assist and critique your approaches- invaluable learning experience. You will be proud of your final product.",
    "The opportunity to work on a project with 'real-world' clients.",
    "I learned a lot from Professor Ashton and from my team members. The interdisciplinary nature of our particular assignment was intriguing and challenging.",
    "Working on real issues for actual clients.Mark has an excellent pedagogy, too. He knows how to present material and techniques in a structured way, first with lecture, then by guiding students in practice, letting students do the things themselves, and then by debriefing them.",
    "1. The professional experience of the element. We had real-life clients who paid a fee for our services and we learned marketable skills.2. The team work--in spite many nights of miserable lucubration--was actually a lot of fun and a great bonding opportunity. I think all of the teams become close. The work is challenging but also often a lot of fun.3. The delightful Dr. Mark Ashton."

   "comments": [
    "I didn't find all the lectures totally useful but it is a hard class to have lectures for, so maybe this isn't really a legitimate claim.",
    "should have more opportunities integrated into class time to learn from other groups - e.g. we shared our biophysical methods in east rock park and prelim. reccomendations at the end of the semester. but between these two points, we all were mostly in our own fox holes -- e.g. discuss challenges we've encountered from deed surveys and advice for others, what questions we're asking in stakeholder analysis and responses we're getting, how\/why we decided to do surveys rather than interviews, and so on.",
    "It would have been great to learn about InDesign and formatting at the beginning of the course.",
    "I'd emphasize the social analysis more. It's at least as important as the biophysical.",
    "It is my understanding that the course has been greatly improved even since last year by trying to front-load work to avoid exam and holiday time nightmares. However, I feel that even more front-loading of the actual writing of the plan would be helpful! We did A LOT of writing before, after, and during exam period."

    "1. You will do a lot of work (especially toward the end of the semester). You will be challenged. But you will get A LOT out of this course. Skills that will be useful if you are pursuing career research (PhD) or professional forestry.2. Mark Ashton is a gem.3. You will have a lot of fun doing field work with you teammates.4. You will feel a sense of accomplishment and relief when you present everything you have done to your clients.Recommended."
