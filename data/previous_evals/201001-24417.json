   "comments": [
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Lots of fun, an opportunity you will never have again. Great insight into an ancient culture-- it is very different being able to read texts not in translation.",
    "This is an amazing class and an even more amazing language, however it is NOT easy. The language is complex, despite seeming like a bunch of pictures tacked on one after the other. I would recommend the class if the student is devoted to the subject and ready to put in a lot of time to truly grasp the mutable grammar and subjective translation. The class is not easier than any other language -- if anything, it's harder! That said, the class is so interesting and very fun. If you are at all interested, you should completely take this class.",
    "Yes, Its a great class, even though its hard. You come away with an understanding of egyptian.",
    "definitely a great way to get your language requirement out of the way",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. Learning hieroglyphs is awesome. You have to be dedicated to learn the grammar and do the translating, but this class is really great because you get to work with real, authentic texts."
