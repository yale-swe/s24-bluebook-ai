   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this class! If you're even thinking about the lit major take it to get a sense of the difference between English and Literature. This course introduces you to literary theory. It is taught by several members of the lit department so is a good way to get to know the lit department. The syllabus was an interesting mix. The course really is about \"narrative,\" which may be a different approach to literature than most people had in an english class.",
    "It's not that great. But if you like the texts, it's worth a shot for a WR credit.",
    "I think it's a good entryway course for anyone interested in Literature.",
    "Lit 120 is a general literature class that explores narrative structure across a number of time periods and genres. I would recommend the class to another student, but I would caution Freshman against taking it. Although it says it is a writing course, very little is done to actually workshop your writing. I would recommend taking a more writing central course to get used to college writing before embarking on Lit 120.",
    "This class was so good -- the syllabus may seem a bit eclectic, but the professors bring it all together under the narratology umbrella and the class has a cohesion you don't initially expect. The four professors work so well as a team, and pretty much all the lectures are super interesting and well-done. Professor Gabriel was an incredible section leader and fantastic at encouraging us to share ideas and questions about the texts -- as someone who has been intimidated into not speaking much in other sections, this class was a revelation. If you're a lit major or not, this class is definitely worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend Lit 120, especially to those who find change and diverse viewpoints exciting rather than frustrating, and who don't mind a lack of structure. Take it for the syllabus alone!"
