   "comments": [
    "I would say yes, take it, if you are interested in the developing world and the complications of welfare. It's worthwhile and I found the readings interesting. My class was very international and added their perspectives on growing countries, which added another element of interest to the class.",
    "Yes, for laying the groundwork in this field, but not if you have advanced knowledge of it.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to other students. It was a lot of fun and extremely informative.",
    "A must take for those interested in economic development and poverty alleviation strategies.",
    "Definitely take it. I thought Prof Torres found a nice balance between teaching the material and facilitating discussion. Be prepared for lots of group work though.",
    "Good overview of all the different types of obstacles that take place in trying to alleviate poverty. Very policy-oriented and practical. I would definitely recommend this class; it's on my top three list for classes taken at Yale",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! It really provides you with an overall view about different kinds of programs being implemented to reduce poverty throughout the world. Amazing course if you want to learn a little about international development.",
    "This is a really interesting and enlightening class that I DEFINITELY recommend to any student interested in poverty and inequality. The readings are great and the discussion is always interesting and engaging. This class is also fun because you get to do group projects with a creative twist-- not something you get to do often in college. Great class! definitely take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to somebody who is interested in getting a wide array of political science theories while looking at poverty alleviation and economic development. It is not a very technical course about economics and poverty alleviation, but it does introduce the central concepts in economic development. At the same time, it introduces almost every influential theory in political science, including philosophical, game-theoretic, political economy, statistical and other issues in political science.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is interested in economic development and poverty alleviation. This course is definitely useful in terms of understanding the political and economic aspect of poverty alleviation."
