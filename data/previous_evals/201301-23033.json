   "comments": [
    "A great political philosophy seminar; would recommend.",
    "I would absolute recommend this class. One of the standouts of my Yale experience.",
    "Terrific!",
    "Yes, if you like discussing Gandhi and other leaders in morality as a branch of political philosophy.",
    "Yes, Yes, Yes! This is simply the best class I've taken at Yale so far. Professor Kapustin is amazing. The readings were awesome, too. Definitely take it!",
    "Absolutely - this class is a must-take. The readings are incredible, the topic of crucial importance, and the professor a true gem. I was also impressed by the students Professor Kapustin attracts; I've never been in a Yale seminar with such universal buy-in to the discussion. It was a truly exhilarating experience, intellectually and personally.",
    "Yes. If you're at all interested in the topic absolutely take it.",
    "If you can get in to the seminar, you should definitely take it! The readings are not too long each week (maybe about 50 pages?) and the discussion is though-provoking.",
    "Kapustin seminars are a wonderful experience. It's an INCREDIBLE reading list and you get at some of the deepest questions underlying philosophy, political science, history, and EP&E alike (who decides what truth is? when is violence justified? when should we stop intellectualizing and take to the streets? who wants our support? how corruptible or flexible should our ideals be? how much do individuals drive history? - and that's just a start.) Anyone who misses DS, or who thinks on the level of ideas about the political realm (YPU types?) should be sure to make this a priority - Kapustin encourages big thinking and doesn't grade harshly if you think about the readings.Just make sure you actually keep up with the reading: it's easy, given the free-wheeling and big-picture questions asked in the seminar, to let yourself float by, listening to other people say brilliant things and chipping in with a mild comment here or there without really understanding what's going on. But you'll get SO much more out of this class by actually reading in detail and bringing a lot of detail and focus to the discussion.",
    "Solid, if a bit repetitive and intro-level -- these writers aren't the most analytically solid. Obviously, Kapustin's reputation precedes him, and rightly so, though I felt he sometimes directed discussion towards topics that were pretty basic and not worth discussing at much length.",
    "Moral Choices in Politics explores the intersection of morality and politics from two perspectives: that of the political actor (historical) and that of the neutral observer (theoretical). Though a small portion of the material overlaps with that of Professor Kapustin's Critique of Political Violence course, Moral Choices in Politics ultimately feels less grounded in theory, likely because of the emphasis in the first half of the class on writings by famous historical leaders and thinkers (e.g., Guevara, Thoreau, Havel). I would recommend this course to another student, not only for its politically important and thought-provoking content, but for the chance to take a class with Kapustin, who has virtually mastered the seminar format."
