    "A must-take if you can get in",
    "This is a really enjoyable course! I went in knowing very little about the Iraq War and learned a lot, but there were clearly people who were already very knowledgable, and this contributed to group discussion. Professor Howorth is wonderful - great at leading class, and very approachable. There were lots of presentations by students, which could sometimes drag, but the discussion was interesting.",
    "Great course! Definitely take if you can get in. My cohort was really great, we had a wide variety of student backgrounds in the room, which made for many great discussions. Class presentations were interesting and engaging as well.",
    "Great material with an even greater professor! 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Take this if you can get in! Great course. Covers a lot of ground on the Iraq Crisis. Howorth is amazing, very amenable. Just two papers and seminar readings. Come to class prepared to get the best out of it!",
    "Absolutely take this class! You'll learn so much.",
    "If you can get in, definitely take this course. It's one of the best poli sci seminars I have taken at Yale. Howorth has deep knowledge of the subject and is very helpful. The assignments are pretty flexible - one presentation on a given book\/article, one 2,000 word paper based on your presentation (though it can be loosely related), and one 5,000 word final paper with a wide-open topic. Try not to schedule your presentation\/short paper too close to the end of term\/final paper, unless you want to write 7,000 words in a short time period for the same class. The reading load is great -- you can actually read everything because he doesn't overload it. You may leave in total despair over whether Iraq will ever be stable\/functional, but not much can be done about that.",
    "Definitely take this class if you get in. The readings and discussions are really interesting and it is not too much work. Prof. Howorth is fantastic -- extremely knowledgeable but also laid back and with a good sense of humor.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in one of the most relevant country's to modern American foreign policy of today. Professor Howorth is a gem of a professoryou will rarely find a more knowledgeable and cited professor in the field. With any luck, your classmates will be just as interested in the course as you and keep the conversation smart and enjoyable. Take the class. You won't regret it.",
    "You learn about the intricacies of Iraq and ultimately that the US did pretty much everything wrong."
