   "comments": [
    "This class definitely isn't actually a gut even though it may seem pretty low key during the course of the semester - the exams are hard in a way that doesn't really feel proportional to how the class is structured and the material is covered. As long as you go into it knowing you're going to get a fairly biased presentation of the material, it's okay - and, after all, you do still get to listen to great music which is pretty nice to have in a class.",
    "A fun class. I enjoyed learning more about classical music since it had been years since I last played an instrument. The material is engaging, but there is quite a bit of work if you want to take this class for a grade.",
    "Definitely. It was a great balance to the rest of my classes as a non-music person. I loved going to class. We got to listen to music for homework. You learn a ton about music and how to talk about it. Great class.",
    "Yes, absolutely recommend for anyone to take, no matter what music level, and no matter what major. A great intro to an under-studied but interesting and useful subject.",
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "Fun class, interesting material! Workload isn't too bad as long as you make sure to study for the midterm and final exam and put a decent amount of effort into the short writing assignments throughout the course. I would definitely recommend this class, but don't take it too lightly! I definitely feel that I have a better understanding of music and the history of music, which is something I'm grateful to have learned about.",
    "TAKE! (Just be aware that the final might be tough, but you'll still come out realizing you've learned so much regardless of the grade you get.)",
    "People should take this course! It is great for anyone who wants to get a general background in music history and is very applicable to everyday life.",
    "Sure. Not an easy 5th class but doable. Tougher on the paper than they should be.",
    "Take this course. Whether you like music or not, the course is extremely taught, very interesting, and not a lot of work. Professor Wright is fantastic, and he makes the lectures entertaining and engaging. A fun and relaxed humanities credit.",
    "Yes, for testing the water in Western Music and building a foundation for understanding all music, even top 40 pop and electronic dance music.",
    "This class is a good introductory course into the components of music and why we like music. I liked how casual the lectures were, but sometimes the professor moved through the slides too quickly, and they are not reposted after class to make up what you might have missed in lecture. However, overall the class was very informative, but not stressful.",
    "Yes you will learn so much it was fabulous!",
    "The course gives an overview of musical history, providing in-class listening for a few exemplary works from each major musical period. The weekly assignments take a half hour at the extreme most and consist of multiple choice questions that apply to online listening passages; all of this is done through the online software that Professor Wright himself created. Other assignments, besides studying for the two exams, include one 500-word review, a 5-page final paper, and 2-3 other writing pieces of less than 300 words. This course is great for the music-lover of any experience level, take it to have a relaxed, fun, and fascinating Hum\/Arts credit!",
    "Take it if the stuff is somewhat interesting to you. A lot of cool music history involved in the course. Definitely don't need to have a strong music background whatsoever.",
    "Listening to Music is a great course for anyone with a classical music itch they want to scratch. I'd say it's more educational and probably more interesting for someone who doesn't already have extensive experience playing an instrument or a lot of preexisting knowledge of classical music. Even if you are in that boat, though, Professor Wright is a great lecturer and you'll probably still end up enjoying the class. Textbook readings aren't really necessary, assignments are very doable--definitely a solid fifth course. Section with Professor Wright was great (not sure if that happens every year).",
    "Music 112 is a great class to take if you want to learn about the history and development of today's music. Professor Wright shows you why modern music sounds the way it does, and the class is FUN.",
    "This is a good class if you are sincerely interested in gaining a basic overview of western music through out its different historical periods. If you are not actually interested in the subject matter, the large amount of memorization required for exams may seem tedious. There is not a ton of work on a weekly basis, but for someone who truly has no music background, it will be sufficiently challenging. Professor Wright is great, and even someone with no musical history or talent will be able to get a good grade by studying enough.",
    "I would recommend this class. You learn a lot about some of the things to listen for in classical music, and how to distinguish between pieces from different periods. That said, the exams require a lot of memorization, and the final paper assignment is rather difficult."
