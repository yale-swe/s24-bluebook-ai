   "comments": [
    "The topics of the course were well-selected.",
    "I learned very little in this class and it was a waste of time. The course is set up in such a way that it is mostly peer taught. The one hour section is led by the TF and one hour of the two hour lecture is led by peers and very poorly executed. The readings are really random and scattered and heavily focused on aging. Given there is already a class on health and aging, this class should be much broader, especially since it is a core class. I'm not sure that I learned anything that was specific to SBS in this class or really, anything at all except for the work I did on my final paper.",
    "it is a very dynamic range of topics, which is also its strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I was disappointed in this course because I felt that we were treated as if we couldn't handle social science work of any kind, which is what makes up almost all of my background. I thought I would have engaging discussions about topic like racial inequality and how this causes an unequal distribution of health in the US, but all of our \"discussions\" were extremely basic. I didn't feel like I learned anything in this course.",
    "The course covers an interesting and exciting range of topics not covered in other courses, but the level of depth and learning that took place on each topic was minimal. As a primarily first-year MPH course, a core course, this class was far too student-led. Between having student TA-led sections and half of every class being student led -- THERE WAS FAR TOO MUCH STUDENT-LED TIME.",
    "- Great overview of social and behavioral determinants of health and measurement challenges that go along with studying them- Readings add to the course content- Love the discussion and class engagement, but I wonder there are ways to encourage people who are shier to participate in the class.- It was a nice, safe classroom environment to participate.",
    "This course is purely academic, there is nothing practical to be learned here. All material can be learned independently.",
    "This was a very good course. It covered a wide variety of topics. It would have been nice to have some more attention to mental health issues in their own right, rather than just as a risk factor for physical health outcomes.The discussion sessions were helpful, and I wish that they could have continued throughout the semester, rather than effectively ending halfway through.The guest speakers were excellent!",
    "Interesting",
    "Good. Not only it helps you to learn the material, but also give you chance to lead discussion and also received feedback about the final project through writing prospectus and giving presentation",
    "The topics did not really build on one another and at times the class seemed a little disjointed. Professor Rosanova is really wonderful though, as was my TA,Tracey!",
    "This was a great course. I liked the student presentations and I also really liked the guest speakers.",
    "The material was interesting, but could be presented in a more compelling way beyond simple lecture. The lecture style could be repetitive and the student presentations varied in quality.",
    "-pretty good for non-CDE students",
    "Guest speakers, activities and interesting discussions are strengths of the course.",
    "Great intro course to psychosocial epi: lots of interesting topics and teacher has good commentary. Guest speakers were also very interesting. Student-led discussions at the end of class were okay... felt a little forced although the actual TA led discussion sections were pretty good."

    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Knowledgable.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0She didn't really teach the class--it was mostly peer led. I don't think she is an experienced enough or skilled professor to be responsible for a core class. The class is very much focused on her specific interests and she is unable to manage classroom time, frequently running over and unable to engage students or keep the class interesting.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0The professor is very helpful and kind, but she underestimates the ability of the students to engage in complicated theoretical conversations, which leaves us having very basic conversations instead.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0really liked her!",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Dr. Rozanova has an interesting background in psychology and is able to draw from a range of critical theory and public health knowledge in her lectures. However, I often felt that in addition to covering valuable and useful material in her lectures, they were accompanied by a series of long-winded rabbit trails on a small theoretical point. The class was often lost. That said, I think this course has a lot of potential, and the topics selected were very interesting. I like having someone with a background in criticaltheory at the school of public health, and I think Dr. Rozanova's perspective is very valuable.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0- Very approachable and flexible\/accommodating",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Julia is great, she does a great job of exploring a variety of topics relevant to the course.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Julia was great! She selected interesting topics, with good readings, and gave good lectures. I liked the format of having student led discussions.I think that for some of the ethnographic topics (particularly the race\/racism readings) it would have been nice to have more preparations for how to read that type of literature.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Excellent.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0She is always responsive and her lectures were engaging and interesting to learn.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Dr. Rozanova is a great professor. I really enjoyed her course and she did a great job of engaging us in class discussions.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Professor Rozanova is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, but could have presented the information in a clearer and more compelling way. Lectures could get repetitive in terms of format.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0-super friendly!",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Maybe reduce readings too two or one articles per class to go more in depth into each one.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rozanova \u00a0Very caring and knowledgeable professor! She has a great way of talking about each topic and tying them to the \"real world\" as well as to other areas of epi research. Professor Rozanova has an eloquent way of talking that seemed philosophical at times."

    "A good course for students who are interested in this area of research.",
    "I've heard the fall SBS core class with Marney White was really good. I would recommend that over this. Don't go into the class with the expectation of learning any core SBS concepts.",
    "Still getting lost because there were too much topic and I cannot figure out a general theory or methodology out of it. Maybe it derives from the dynamic characteristic of psycho social factors.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The conversations were very basic and I didn't feel like I learnedanything. It won't convince anyone who doesn't already believe in the validity of non-positivistic thinking, and it will be boring to anyone who does.",
    "The perspective taken in this course is extremely important to the field of public health. Critical theory - particularly in psychosocial and behavioral epidemiology - is a useful and important lens to view this topic through. However, the course is fraught with problems: too much student-led time, too much focus on the mechanics of writing a literature review (especially if you are a second-year MPH student), too much TA-led time with not enough meaningful material to fill it (1-hr section per week), and too little focus on methods in psychosocial epidemiology.",
    "This is a great way to get the recommended SBS credit. The class is not a lot of work, but it's still engaging. The instructor is great at facilitating student learning and the assignments\/discussions really enhance the experience.",
    "This course is required, I would say that like in all social science course do not expect to learn anything that will be useful outside the walls of YSPH.",
    "This course teaches a wide assortment of topics in psychosocial epidemiology.I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I think it gives a perspective that is not commonly found in other courses. Also, it has a series of excellent guest speakers.",
    "One of my favorite classes",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to fellow students.",
    "The material is interesting but the lectures get repetitive and are not particularly compelling.",
    "Students teaching students aka leading a course is not helpful or engaging. It incentivizes students to not pay attention or completely skip class. I would recommend not formatting the course this way. If the 2 hour block is too long for the professor to teach the entire way through, she should find another way to fill students time in a more meaningful way. We are graduate students here to learn from experts in their field, not from other graduate students who merely summarize the articles...",
    "I had no background in psychosocial and behavioral science and felt like this was a quick but good introduction. It was a fun class.",
    "Good introductory course if you don't know much about SBS\/ psychosocial epidemiology. It feels more qualitative than a lot of other classes\/ subjects I've taken but I think it's important to incorporate the knowledge from this class into the rest of your studies."
