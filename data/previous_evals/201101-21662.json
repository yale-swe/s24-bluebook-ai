    "If you can get in, take it without question.",
    "If you can get in, take it in a heartbeat and then build your schedule around taking this course. Also take Critique of Political Violence. Both are outstanding - easily the two best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Kapustin is extremely dynamic and facilitates discussion and critical analysis like no other Professor I have had in my three years. I cannot stress enough how much of a must-take his two courses are.",
    "Definitely. If you've never taken a class with Professor Kapustin before, you cannot afford to miss you. You will walk away from this class thinking differently about morality in politics, and you won't be disappointed.",
    "YES. YES YES YES YES YES YES.BEST COURSE I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE SO FAR.Strengths:-Best Professor. Professor Kapustin is GREAT. You should take this class just for Professor Kapustin (if not for the material). He is really, really knowledgeable, kind, understanding and professional. Best seminar leader.Professor Kapustin is the best professor I have met at Yale.He is not only knowledgeable, but his method of delivering his knowledge to the students is incredible. He is also the best seminar leader. He is able to listen and synthesize students' discussions and direct the debate by asking questions that stimulate the students.He is also extremely kind and understanding. Go to office hours. I was at first a little intimidated, but there is no need to be. He will understand everything and help you through your questions\/issues.Best professor. I respect him very, very much. I was so lucky to have been able to take his seminar this semester.-Great seminar structure\/atmosphere. Everybody is very prepared and is willing to participate in discussion. Very intellectually stimulating.-Great readings. This class is unique because you don't necessarily get to read actual political leaders (such as Robespierre, Gandhi, Havel, Che Guevara, etc.) and their philosophies and assess them in other political philosophy classes.",
    "This was my second course with Boris, and it was yet another memorable academic experience. He is uniquely fortunate enough to be able to handpick the students he wants for his classes. Coupled with his incredible lecturing style, this makes for an awesome classroom dynamic where everyone is on their A-game all the time and the discussions are both stimulating and bereft of the nonsense you might get in other courses. I love this man to death, and if you are lucky enough to be able to take a class of his, it should be a no-brainer. He conducts his course like an epic, with every word he utters meticulously stated and truly inspired. Top 5 class at Yale.",
    "It shows the overlap between practical politics and political morality, and how people have dealt with the seemingly impossible contradictions between them. A really valuable course.",
    "Take it. Leaves you with a lot to think about and Kapusin is generally just amazing.",
    "I think even someone with zero interest in the course matter would do well to take this course. It will change the way you look at the world and generally make you a more informed person.",
    "This is not my first class with Prof. Kapustin, but sadly it will have been my last, since I am graduating. Kapustin is an excellent (and then some) professor who has been important in shaping my Yale political science \/ philosophy experience. Eminently wise, kind, prepared, and exacting, this course demands the attention of its students and rewards them with an insightful journey through the moral implications of political decisions, as well as exploring in other fashions the nexus of morality and politics. An important theoretical study for any political scientist for sure. My one wish is that some students in the class would have talked up more, since discussion could sometimes feel to be too few voices and the silent folks had great points when they did contribute. Otherwise, really a big fan. Also, that room should have the thermostat turned down, seriously.",
    "Moral Choices in Politics is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The readings are manageable and always interesting. Prof. Kapustin is an incredible professor: obviously passionate about the material he teaches, he is a captivating and often humorous lecturer, who also effectively provides ample time for seminar discussion.If you are interested in moral philosophy or political philosophy, don't miss an opportunity to take this class."
