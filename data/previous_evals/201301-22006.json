   "comments": [
    "Take it with a friend if you're taking it for the science credit. Even though it's an engineering course it's pretty decent as a science credit--you go over a lot of topics but none of them too deep. And there's not much beyond basic math involved.",
    "Yes, its pretty math-y and sciency but not overwhelmingly so. If you've taken a math class at Yale and took chemistry in high school you should be fine.",
    "Intro to environmental engineering is a great introduction to the field of environmental engineering, and really works to give you a taste of the subject, particularly if it is a potential major. If that is your goal, definitely take the class. But beware, the problem sets are surprisingly difficult and time consuming.",
    "Although this class is slated as an introductory class, do not be fooled. In class everything will make sense, but once you try to do your psets, it gets so confusing. However, working together makes them doable.",
    "I found the class useful because I am interested in environmental issues. But a lot of the class was focused on waste water treatment and not \"cool and sexy\" environmental problems like climate change. There is also a lot of chemistry so make sure you're comfortable with chemistry before taking this class. Also, Professor Peccia is very chill and the work will be a lot less than you imagine!",
    "I'd take it. You learn some valuable interesting information once you get past the boring chemistry at the beginning of the course. Beware though, there are no +\/- grades -- only A\/B\/C, and there is no curve.",
    "This is a good class and You learn really interesting things. It's chill and You only have problem sets every week and a half and the material is straight forward. The problems sets can be confusing as he does expect You to google common knowledge (to environmental engineers) information, but usually You can find it. The problem sets did take a long time at first, but I think there was a wide variety in how long it took people. He does have a format You have to follow as You answer each question: state the objective, parameters, then solve, and say its significance, but that was only weird at first. Overall, I enjoyed this class and would retake it.",
    "I really liked this class. It's a great introduction to environmental engineering and Professor Peccia is a funny guy. He keeps the classes interesting and I really liked the real world applications of the material. Definitely would recommend it!",
    "It is a good base for a class that you will need later in school.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone thinking about environmental engineering or anyone interested in civil systems.",
    "I would summarize Environmental Engineering 120 as a great class that teaches the basics of some of society's most important issues, such as air pollution, wastewater treatment, drinking water treatment, and more. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the environment in general. It is a great survey class on topics that are relevant to many different majors.",
    "I would recommend environmental engineering to anyone considering the major or interested in the environment who needs a QR credit. It's fun and just challenging enough.",
    "For a science major, this class is really easy. Lectures are pretty engaging (thanks to Professor Peccia's personal stories), problem sets are only due once every couple weeks, and the tests are very manageable. Take it for a really basic introduction to an interesting subject.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN STEM. It's fun and not too intimidating as an engineering class. Also, if you have any interest in knowing more about the environment from any mathematical standpoint, I would take this class to enhance your knowledge.",
    "A pretty straightforward course. Good overview and lots of unit conversions. Cheat sheets are allowed, so if you spend time preparing those for the tests, you will do fine."
