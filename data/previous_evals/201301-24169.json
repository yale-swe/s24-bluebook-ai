   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a little eclectic but it really made me think about religions in different ways.",
    "Maybe. I'd really look at and research the books on the syllabus. In the end I wanted to try something new but the class dynamic along with the new type of reading (for me) of the course didn't really work for me. I would really just shop it -- see if you like Neuman's style (it is very hands-on) and the other people in the class (and look at the books!) because in the end unless you just inherently LOVE all the books that is all that matters.",
    "Great, great class! Definitely take it. Prof. Neuman is literally such a badass, seminar is so fun, and the books we read were really great. I actually enjoyed all of them, which is insanely rare in a survey kind of English class. This class definitely broadened (and piqued) my knowledge of postcolonial fiction and global fiction overall. The workload isn't too bad, probably around 100~ pages per class and often less depending on the length of the novels, which is very manageable. Also, the books are just so fun to read!! One 7-page midterm paper, and one 15-page term paper plus reading are the assignments, and an occasional blog post.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENGL342. Professor Neuman teaches a unique brand of English, in which he forces students to immerse themselves in the social contexts of their readings. You learn how to write compelling research papers in Neuman's class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a skill that's often overlooked by the English department's preponderance of close reading-based analysis.The workload is somewhat heavy, with many pages of reading per class and per week, but I'd say it's worthwhile. And the books are awesome.",
    "This class has an interesting reading list. It joins outside research and an interesting combination of literature, religion, and philosophy.Professor Neuman is a fascinating man. He cares deeply about the course material and his students. He also asks a whole lot of his students. It's worth taking his class and taking on the work to be in his seminar.",
    "A lot of reading, really fun discussion.Take this class! You learn a ton, read amazing books, and get to know an incredible professor. Favorite class at Yale!",
    "The reading list is fantastic, and Professor Neuman is a scholar of the most authentic sort, though clicking with his teaching style is probably critical to enjoying the class, so make sure you like him during shopping period. Two papers and some reading responses, but this is the place to be exposed to a more academic understanding of how to read literature in a setting that is as honestly invested and excited about the material as possible. I absolutely loved this class, and it changed my understanding of literature and how to think critically about fiction.",
    "This class is amazing. Definitely take it--you'll learn a ton and, if you can keep up, it's a total blast. Stay on top of the reading list as best as you can, and enjoy these books. They're gorgeous pieces of art. Professor Neuman is awesome, but he'll push you hard. If you're prepared to work and prepared to read like there's no tomorrow, you're in for a wild ride. This class is an adventure and I loved it!!!",
    "I will definitely recommend it to both English and non-English majors, if you like to read and think about the world. The course readings are all world renowned novels, but from very, very different backgrounds. There are many, many issues to talk about, and usually the classmates that are confident to take the challenge of this course are incredibly intelligent and open-minded."
