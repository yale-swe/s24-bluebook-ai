   "comments": [
    "I was given the flexibility to pursue my own project, which was an amalgamation of all my different areas of interest here at FES. In this way, most of the knowledge that I gained was self-directed, but that was the plan from the beginning. I learned a lot more about how to use Web of Science to support my research, as well as integrate a thoughtful review of peer-reviewed literature into projects for a more general audience, which in my case was a business plan for an affordable nitrate sensor that measures runoff.",
    "This class was entirely project-based, so each student develops different skills\/knowledge depending on the project. My project involved field work, laboratory analysis, non-comprehensive literature review, and research into government regulations\/resources. I learned a TON from this project.",
    "Water quality related to land use Watershed management",
    "Developed additional experience in data management and story map creation. Was great to be able to work with an organization on deliverables that were useful to them and allowed me to hone certain skills."

   "comments": [
    "Given that it was a small class with a lot of varying interests, I got what I wanted from the course, and the sessions where we met went as they were described in the syllabus. The meetings incorporated a chance for all of us to offer feedback on our respective projects, which sharpened the final deliverables.",
    "I expected the class to have more of a lecture component. I was not disappointed that it didn't, however, since the project was very time consuming. Gabe also taught concepts as requested.",
    "Expectations met. My team designed project to ensure it encompassed topics and skills we wanted to dive into.",
    "Up front, expectations were pretty clear that this would be a largely independent effort. Gabe was there for check-ins, feedback and if we had questions, but everything from schedule to deliverables was coordinated between the student and client."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength was the freedom to pursue our own individual projects. I came in with a clear idea of what I wanted to pursue, and appreciated the flexibility that I had to get it done. I can see a world where somebody came into the class without an idea for a project, and would have felt behind or unstructured if they spent a lot of time thinking about what they wanted to do at the beginning. A more clear idea of when we were meeting with the group vs 1:1 would have been helpful.",
    "The schedule worked well and the report outs helped us stay on track and get feedback. It would have been helpful to turn in a first draft of our report earlier, but probably not possible given the timing. The expectations for final presentations and scheduling of them could have been a little clearer.",
    "Strength: flexible, can tailor the project to what you want, can request professor to teach topics you desire Weakness: classes felt ad-hoc, was never clear if we were having class or not, no formal mechanism to collectively establish class norms and schedule Both: self-driven course, which is good and bad. It's all up to you and your teammates to make it what you want.",
    "Strengths: Allows for independent work, project management experience. Lack of structured seminar class time could be considered a strength or a weakness. Strength because limited in class seminar, no readings\/assignments beyond a few presentations about the status of our work allowed us to focus on our projects. Weakness because there was not really an in class teaching component."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Come in with a project in mind, and be ready to hit the ground running. Self-direction and a sense of autonomy and control over the project is the name of the game.",
    "You have to be proactive in seeking out help and resources. I took on a project that I wasn't really qualified to do (had never done sampling, weak background in chemistry), so there was a steep learning curve with mistakes along the way. Students taking this class should carefully consider the skills, resources, and time required for their proposed projects. That said, I don't regret taking on an ambitious project because that's why I learned so much.",
    "You need to come in with a clear purpose and project. If you choose a client that is offered through the course, make sure you immediately start communicating with the client to establish project scope and deliverables.",
    "I had an overall good experience because the project I was working on was interesting and the client was great. You need to have a project in mind in coming into this course, or take the initiative to find one to make it worthwhile."
