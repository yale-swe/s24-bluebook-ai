    "Absolutely take it if you get in.",
    "Students admitted to GS should certainly consider taking the course. It's a fantastic opportunity to learn from some of Yale's best professors, as well as meet other great students (both undergrads and grad students).",
    "Fall semester consists of a month of lectures, a series of policy brief presentations by the students, and a crisis simulation. The one written assignment is the paper on the GS summer experience - there is no guidance given to students on how to do this well, so be prepared for that. I spent more time on the policy brief than I did on my senior essay, and still felt miserable about the experience and like no amount of hard work could possibly pay off. Overall, I learned something the two days I presented, I had fun at the simulation, the dinners with guests were phenomenal, and the class itself was largely un-engaging and unhelpful.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who is willing to AND HAS THE TIME TO put an unbelievable amount of work into it. It can be a frustrating experience, but it is ultimately rewarding. The first semester is a more traditional history seminar and the second feels more like an IR\/IS political science seminar. It is slightly awkward because once Marshall Briefs begin, students do not participate except those presenting. I think the larger class size is not ultimately a negative, but I do not think the size has been mastered yet. I recommend this course for students who want to be challenged but be prepared to not have your interests directly engaged if they lie outside of military history and diplomacy. It is, at the end of the day, a very unique Yale academic experience that I would not trade.",
    "Studies in Grand Strategy is a fantastic course, especially if you are interested in international relations, the largest questions of history, and political thought. The most important things to bring to the class are an open mind and a genuine commitment to read closely and participate actively. The resources offered to GS students are unparalleled - but it is definitely a class where you get out what you put in. So if you look at the syllabus and are intrigued, and then are admitted to the class, be sure to take it seriously and devote a lot of energy to it. There are a lot of students in the class and many professors - you will have to seek the professors out if you want to get to know them (the professors, I might add, are definitely the best part of the class). If you are willing to be proactive, Studies in Grand Strategy will probably be one of the defining aspects of your Yale education."

   "comments": [
    "It made me see connections between historical moments that I had not before. I really liked the breadth of the course though some periods are skipped over. The course asks you to think bigger than you have before - to think about questions of power and rule that make you uncomfortable. I loved those debates.",
    "I wantto work in U.S. foreign policy. Studies in Grand Strategy deepened my knowledge of international relations substantially. I cannot be more thankful to have been given the opportunity to take this course."
