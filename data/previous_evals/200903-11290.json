   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course is you truly would like to learn French. Otherwise, it can be a bit tedious.",
    "It is a ggod way to immerse yoursefl virtually in the French world because only French is spoken in the class, but I was able to learn a huge amount of stuff in a very short space of time. The work is hard bcause you learn so much at once, but it all comes together.",
    "If you really want something interesting and engaging you should definately take it.",
    "Fun, a lot of work, good professor (though Parfitt might not teach it anymore), occasionally hard early in the morning. You will definitely learn a surprising amount of french.",
    "Great course, although can be confusing at times. The textbook that is used has a funny plot that makes the class better.",
    "Yes I would.",
    "Excellent beginning French class. You will enjoy it a lot, but you will also have to work hard to stay on top of the material. Very practical - if you plan to use French in real life (with your job or living there), this class will help you immensely. If you are only interested in linguistics, however, you may consider a grammar-focused class instead.",
    "A lot of work, but with great rewards. Take it, it's fun!"
