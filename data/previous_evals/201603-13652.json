   "comments": [
    "thinking about common pool resource problems",
    "I learned how to understand institutions as a whole, and see how the intentions behind policies often are very out of touch with the reality those policies produce.",
    "This course provides a nuanced approach to democracy and common pool resources. Specifically, students will develop an understanding of the IAD framework, a method of understanding complex systems of any sort. This course helps to develop a sense of comfortability with complexity.",
    "I learned tools for how to go about dissecting complex systems and isolating moving pieces within them and putting those pieces back together to understand \"what is really going on\" in that system and how outcomes can be explained.",
    "Prior to taking this course I had never really taken seminars before but, this course definitely showed how seminar courses are an incredible experience. This course taught me how to be a part of a seminar- something that I find many people can be nervous about at Yale if they mainly take lectures. In terms of academic material this course was incredibly engaging and I learned a lot. The narrow scope of the material really allowed for the class to look in depth and truly understand Social ecological systems, how to go about management and the many different functions that occur in a community, industry, habitat etc.. The focus on the lobster industry gave a unique outlook at how to evaluate an SES as well as broader themes of democracy. Professor Fotos is incredibly passionate about the material which makes every two hour class a joy to participate in.",
    "The course is frontloaded with a lot of democratic theory and finishes out with an in-depth analysis of the New England lobster fishery and groundfish management case studies. Using Elinor Ostrom's IAD framework, you analyze a specific SES in-depth for the length of the whole course, and also get the lucky opportunity to observe your classsmates' research.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to interactions between the political process and environmental and scientific issues absolutely a critical course offering at Yale. The intellectual project posed by this course represents the kind of complex, interdisciplinary study needed to understand and solve many pressing challenges in the world. In particular, the course proposed a policy framework (developed by the Ostroms) for identifying places to intervene in socio-ecological systems but with an eye towards the democratic processes legitimizing this policy process. So this course went above and beyond in the goal of getting students to comprehend not just what effective resource management can be, but also the politics that make it possible. This was all applied in a large-scale project that reflected our personal interests, meaning the information did not stay in theory but was brought to bear on real issues."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Fotos has a lot of really good things going on in his head. The seminar format though means that a lot of the class quality depends more on your classmates, which is more variable. I think a 2x 75 minute format would have been more conducive to discussion (and that way we could cover less reading more in depth per section).",
    "My main suggestion to improve the course would be to reduce the amount of assigned reading. All of the reading was carefully curated and worthwhile, but I felt like students often were overwhelmed and skimmed everything rather than really digging in deep. The quality of discussion could be improved if you gave students no more than 2-3 discussion questions in advance. The weekly memos did include reading questions, but sometimes there were too many or sometimes they were not the questions that were raised in seminar. Guest speakers were outstanding.",
    "I think that more clear guidelines on the papers would be helpful. It was really unclear what Prof Fotos wanted a lot of the time, and while I thought my papers turned out well, more initial guidance would have led to a better experience. Also, he would assign unrealistic amounts of reading, especially during the weeks when papers were due.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the passion of the instructor. He puts extra care in curating a list of relevant readings for the week that he puts into context with a rambly, yet endearing memo of his own personal reflections.",
    "I think it really lends itself to bringing in outside knowledge that helped illuminate the course-specific concepts we discussed. It was easy and often helpful to draw parallels with examples from subjects within (and even outside) the discipline. I enjoyed hearing other students' contributions. I sometimes wished we made a more pointed effort of doing this periodically--that is, pausing, and saying \"now what about this specific thing we are talking about in lobster fishing can we compare to x y or z thing in the world?\".",
    "Having not taken man seminars I did not participate as much as I could have although there is ample opportunity too.",
    "Strengths: Case studies, especially towards the end of class, are fantastic. Great guest speakers. Prof Fotos. is overall a great prof and a great dude. Weaknesses: The reading load is heavy, and while I don't necessarily suggest it should be lessened, maybe the weekly list could be split up into more relative 'essential' and 'supplementary' categories? I definitely struggled to complete all the reading each week and would've benefited from knowing beforehand what was most important.",
    "This course was incredibly ambitious in reach largely because it has to be in order for students to truly understand the complexity of the factors underlying social and environmental policy issues. Professor Fotos was more than willing to support along the way, especially with weekly memos that detailed his thinking further, and expected a lot from students. The result was a high level of student engagement I pushed myself a lot to comprehend and apply this knowledge, especially in my project, which feels like very important work. In terms of weaknesses, the only one that felt pertinent was the fact that the workload could at times be extreme especially in theory heavy sections, it could be incredibly hard to grasp what was happening, meaning there was a heavy learning curve. Luckily, Prof. Fotos's memos could elucidate the intent behind a reading, but I wonder if simplifying some sections may have improved comprehension."

   "comments": [
    "The point of this course is to improve your ability to analyze governing institutions, specifically, institutions that govern how natural resources are used. If you're interested in working on resource regulation in the future, or are just interested in the subject, this class is for you. Most of the work in this class is on two papers. It's really one large paper with a part 1 due at midterm and part 2 due at the end of the semester. You'll be working on it basically all semester, so make sure you like the topic.",
    "As a stem major I was pretty impressed with how engaging some of the material was. Some of the readings are pretty dry however, and most people's research projects have almost nothing to do with the class content.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It's an engaging class that challenges your assumptions about science, the environment, and public policy.",
    "Good course with a lot of reading. Professor Fotos is a policy wonk who is really kind and dedicated to the class. Read something by Elinor Ostrom beforehand and only take the course if you find her work interesting.",
    "Should only be taken by environmental studies majors.",
    "Yes, I would. Very cool, interesting, unique class.",
    "Yes; Even though the specific topic wasn't exactly my favorite, I think that in this course we practiced thinking about complex systems in a way that is applicable to many other topics. Every class was enjoyable. I learned a lot also from my final project.",
    "YES!! Professor Fotos is amazing and one of the kindest people at Yale. Also learning about the New England fish industry and really cool and applicable all over the world.",
    "Amazing course, totally take it, Prof Fotos is an incredible prof and an incredible dude. Be warned that Elinor Ostrom's IAD framework will dominate the entire course and both your research papers, so if you're not into it you might have a tough time, but if you can get into it you'll learn a lot. Examination of fishery management is completely fascinating, and the opportunity to conduct your own in-depth research of a social-ecological problem is a treat, especially because you also get to hear from your classmates. The course overall is a lot of work, but if you're willing to devote to it, absolutely take it.",
    "This course is absolutely unique and worth taking. The thinking is highly interdisciplinary, the readings are diverse and intriguing, Professor Fotos is knowledgable and kind, and you leave with real intellectual growth. It is challenging and the course will demand commitment, but that's what makes the work on a project of your choosing so rewarding."
