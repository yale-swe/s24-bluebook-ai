    "If you liked Nemerov's survey, you'll love Zeidler's.",
    "yes definitely take this course! it's one of the best lecture classes in the art history department, in my opinion, pertaining to art that everyone should learn about. zeidler's a fantastic lecturer with strong points and perfect pacing. some people complain that the material after the midterm is boring - this is so unfounded and not true at all - it's a matter of exposure, and the stuff after the midterm is just interesting new material that americans exposed to western art for their whole lives (impressionism, post-impressionism, what have you) just haven't considered before. work is rather standard or even less-than-standard for a lecture course, since you only have a midterm and final and 7 pg paper. the best part of this lecture class is you feel you really have learned some major issues coming from the modern era -ones that extend beyond the realm of art history into cultural, intellectual, sociological\/economic history. take zeidler's early 20th century art! easily one of the best classes at yale.",
    "I absolutely loved this course, as it opened my eyes to a whole new depth to the discipline of art history. I learned so much, from a broader background to the formation of the modernist movement to influences on art such as philosophy and psychology. It was a great multidisciplinary study of the early 20th century, touching upon all the intellectual movements of the time. Rarely have I taken a class at Yale that stayed so consistently interesting throughout, and I'm so glad to have taken it. The workload is definitely manageable - the readings are interesting and not too long, and the exams are fair. Also, Zeidler is a great lecturer, he's really knowledgable and engaging, so you will never want to miss the lectures.",
    "Yes, the material covered is very good and excellently presented. But the lecture begins in 1865 and ends by 1945 for all intents and purposes. The course name is a bit of a misnomer",
    "Yes! Lots of very cool art, manageable readings, and straightforward exams. Section was helpful, too.",
    "The class is basically all about sex in art. If you are interested in that, take it, but the workload is significant. Lots of in-depth reading, and missing even one day of lecture can be detrimental.",
    "Sure. I really enjoyed going to class. The first half of the class is more fun, but the course has a light work load and Zeidler is a fun lecturer. I have never taken an art history class before and I probably will never take another one, but I really enjoyed this course and I\u0092m glad I took it. Beware of the TAs \u0096 make sure to find a good one!",
    "i would definitely recommend this course to art history majors. it covers a very important spread ofk artists and movements. the course also offers a decent amount of history and political context to back up the images in the class.",
    "A very thorough and satisfying survey of modernist art. Sebastian is an excellent lecturer -- his lectures usually leave your head swimming with really beautiful ideas about art, life, everything. The class is fast-paced, but not work-intensive (just one paper, a midterm, and a final). Really wonderful class - Sebastian's great. Take it.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. It is very informative and extemely interesting.",
    "This class is exactly what it sounds like, a survey of the art of the early 20th century. If that's the kind of class youre looking for, then by all means take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as a great foundation in the art of this period. There's not too much work, the art is interesting, and Professor Zeidler is a good lecturer.",
    "Great class! Zeidler is brilliant. He doesn't read from notes and really engages students with his own unique, eloquent, and precisely worded interpretations of early 20th century art. Most of the time he stares at the presentation screen or at his own hands... lecture is basically sharing in the meditations of a professor lost in his own fantastic world. You learn a lot just by paying attention in class and readings are often interesting. Common themes (like autonomy in art, truth in materiality, etc.) give coherence to the material. One paper and two very straight forward exams. Take it!",
    "Early 20th Century Art is an excellent lecture on Modern Art, beginning with Manet and ending with Abstract Expressionism. Two lectures and one section per week, a midterm, a final, and a 7pg paper, readings. Zeidler chooses really excellent readings, in addition to assigning reading from a fantastic textbook that I will use for any art history paper I write for the rest of my education (Art since 1900). Work load is clearly very light, but the material is so interesting that it is easy to engage with the information and readings, etc, on your own. The course is slightly less organized in its second half, but Zeidler is a very engaging lecturer. Definitely take this class if you are an Art HIstory major--very crucial info, readings, etc. are assigned.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. This period in art is very interesting and includes a lot of modern pieces that are still largely featured in museums and galleries. The course helps you get a sense of how the historical context bred particular movements as well trains you to do formal analysis of pieces themselves. I learned a LOT about art history in this course and about how to think about art. Z makes the pieces accessible and does a great job going through them in lecture. One hesitation is that he spends a LOT of time on picasso, soviet avant garde and brancusi. It is very interesting but it gets a bit repetitive. Regardless, the exposure to these pieces is great and if you want to learn about these movements (like DADA--which is awesome!), then this is a great opportunity. Also, be sure to pick a good TA that does not merely focus on the readings but gets the class to do formal analysis while in section. (I suggest Lindsay Riordan!)"
