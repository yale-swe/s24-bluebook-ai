   "comments": [
    "Learn how to discuss a wide variety of current issues, learn newspaper vocabulary and grammar structures, write some short essays, deliver 2 presentations. Daily quizzes. Fast paced but well worth it if you have the time to get the work done.",
    "A well-structured, well-taught course on current Chinese issues. I learned a lot about media-speak, and Zhou laoshi is one of the most caring and understanding professors out there.",
    "Great class if you want to improve of keep up your Chinese. The content learned in this course is similar to a \"Newspaper Reading\" course with lessons consisting of actual newspaper articles. The topics we learned were interesting: Chinese-Americans, Chinese contemporary art, LGBT issues in China, etc. The work consisted of small assignments every class, three exams, two presentations, a final, and 500-800 character essays every 2 weeks or so. Our section was small (around 6 by the end) and had a good mix of heritage and non-heritage learners. The work is steady, but definitely manageable and very rewarding. Our final consisted of four small essays. I was amazed by the end how easily I could write those using the language patterns learned throughout the class. Professor Zhou was the best Chinese teacher I've had at Yale. Attentive, caring, always willing to help. His class is designed very well. Definitely take it if you are interested in improving your practical Chinese reading and writing skills!",
    "Amazing course, one of the best Chinese electives offered here at Yale. Take it if you can! Zhou LaoShi is the man. Really caring and organized."
