    "This class provided a very helpful introduction to the historiography on modern Mexico, including the Porfiriato, the Mexican Revolution, and the postrevolutionary period. Readings included many of the key texts in this field, as well as some newer works.",
    "We became familiar with the historiography of the Mexican Revolution. It was wonderful to read the field's groundbreaking scholarship and to consider the varied approaches scholars have used over the past 30+ years to study modern Mexican history.",
    "I gained a bird's-eye view of a century's worth of writing about the Mexican Revolution. I gained confidence in speaking to my peers about my own views of a reading we'd all done. I gained a model of seminar discussion facilitation. I developed a much finer-grained sense of how issues of indigeneity, class, religious belief, and gender stimulate (and compete for prominence with one another in) moments of great social upheaval.",
    "important historiographical methods and questions; issues of how to do history in ways that are holistic and apropriate"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I appreciated the opportunity to read many of the foundational texts of Mexican history, as well as to read books with a variety of different approaches and methodologies. I believe I left the course with a clear understanding of the trajectory of Mexican historiography, particularly as it concerns the Mexican Revolution. I would have appreciated if the reading list had included more female historians, including assigning books written or edited by women earlier in the semester.",
    "I really enjoyed this class: discussion was fascinating, and the memos were a useful way to formulate talking points.",
    "A strength of the class is the (great) degree to which it is led by student discussion (even if the professor's hand is behind it all). A related weakness is relative iniquity in speaking time among the students. (I suspect that the books on the syllabus were chosen in order to smooth this out, and that differences in personality account for at least some of the iniquity.) Of course the course is organized around the Mexican Revolution, but it might benefit from a slightly wider scope -- temporally, geographically, and methodologically. I would have preferred more readings that get at the \"long waves\" of Mexican history (though I'm not sure all of my compadres in the course would feel the same way). I know some of my compadres feel that there ought to have been more readings that put Mexico's history into the broader Latin American context, and I mostly agree with them there. And what about starting the course off with some juicy Mexican literature, rather than John Tutino's dry, sociologically-deterministic explanation of rural mobilization?",
    "great discussion and thematic overviews"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in Mexican or Latin American history. It would be particularly helpful for students preparing for comprehensive examinations in these fields, as many of the assigned books are likely to appear on an exam reading list.",
    "Yes. This is an important class for every student studying Latin American History. It also introduces students to multiple theoretical interventions and approaches that are useful across subfields.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to other graduate students with as much of an interest in Mexico as I have.",
    "Yes, anyone interested in mexican history should take this class by one of its leading historians."
