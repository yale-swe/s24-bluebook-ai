   "comments": [
    "Absolutely yes.",
    "Excellent overview of the political and economic history of modern Japan. The other topics, like independent central banking, were interesting as well though what I learned depended a lot of the student presentations. A lot of reading though some of them were kind of unnecessary.",
    "Be aware that while this class centers on Japan, it is definitely not just about Japan. It's about how you can apply the lessons of the Japanese experience to today, which makes it more current-events heavy than you'd think. It is an overwhelming amount of reading in the first few weeks when you are expected to learn the basics of the Japanese debacle, but the reading lessens by a lot afterward. There is a lot of reading, but much of it is not truly required. Roach is a pretty lenient grader, and he's a nice person and responsive teacher although he does name-drop a lot. He will call on you in class and make you take stands. The class does get repetitive at times, especially near the end of the semester. Overall, solid course.",
    "YES. Amazing class. Genius people in it. I learned a lot from Roach, but also from the students in the course. PHENOMENAL.",
    "At the beginning, the readings are long and challenging, but after a while you'll get the hang of it. Take this class if you can - this was one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. If you do the readings, you'll get a lot out of this class. Do not be shy in expressing your opinions during discussion, but be prepared to be challenged by Roach.",
    "Yes. If you are an economics major, take it as a senior seminar. You won't regret it.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "Course on forensic macro using Japan's experience during the Lost Decades as a lens.I would recommend the course to anyone interesting in macroecon. Probably the best macroecon-related course at Yale. Also go to office hours. Roach is not only smart but also has funny stories\/experiences about current policymakers.",
    "Highly recommended for anyone even remotely interested in the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "Yes, take this class. Its time consuming and difficult but the amount of material you learn makes it worthwhile.",
    "ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES AT YALE. DEFINITELY TAKE IT. ROACH IS A GREAT TEACHER AND THOSE TWO HOURS EVERY WEEK WENT BY SO QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO GREAT AND BECAUSE WE LEARNED SO MUCH.",
    "Econ 474 is a great overview of Japan's experience since World War II and the fiscal and monetary policies enacted, and how those policies and their effects are relevant to Europe, the US, and China. It is a \"forensic macro\" course and discussion based. I would highly recommend this course as it is very engaging and Professor Roach is very knowledgable. It explains many of the economic and financial events of the postwar period, and covers the recent financial crisis as well."
