   "comments": [
    "Got a lot more comfortable with many math\/calculus techniques, which wasn't necessarily what I was expecting... Very theoretical class, almost seemed like there was no econ involved. I would suggest a very strong background in multivariable calculus. There was also a good amount of probability\/stats stuff involved towards the end which I had never seen before.",
    "I learned the theoretical foundations of mathematical economics at a rigorous level.",
    "This was a fairly advanced mathematical look at microeconomic concepts.",
    "I learned about consumer theory, optimization, and ways of analyzing general concepts mathematically.",
    "Gained a lot more confidence in mathematical modelling in economic situations, and felt well prepared to take more advanced math courses. Gained experience in setting up economic problems.",
    "I learned very little \"real-life\" Economics, which I supposed I should have anticipated taking a class labeled as \"theory.\" But it was still very disappointing to spend most of my time doing what felt like symbolic manipulation and attempting to understand long-winded proofs without ever stepping back and talking about any applications.",
    "Extension of intro micro in a much more rigorous fashion.",
    "The course does not make many presumptions. It is a bold launch into the theoretical basis of micro-economics. This means many technical details, carefully constructed proofs, and intricate development of mathematical methods to crack various characterization and optimization problems. This is an abstracted intellectual challenge, so considerations like applicability and simplicity are bracketed for this particular course. If you are interested in this line of study, you might find the course fascinating. (Professor Faingold is deeply committed to the inner-workings of mathematical argument and would be happy to show you every wily aspect.) If not, it will be tough and rugged preparation for advanced economics. I wish you the best of luck.",
    "This was a nice relatively proof-based course. I certainly gained a lot of economic intuition."

    "Strengths: Eduardo is a nice guy and really cares about his students. Office hours are super helpful! He makes an attempt to provide extra office hours if needed (was out of the country during reading week so he arranged a skype session as office hours, for example). Well organized, all lecture notes and class slides are posted online, which is super helpful. TA was helpful and approachable, psets were always promptly and fairly graded. Exams were fair. Weaknesses: Material can be dry, theoretical, and even very boring at times. Doesn't seem applicable to the real world. Didn't give me any insight into how economics is used or applied to help people in life. Classes are not very interactive: it was probably the students' fault but nobody asked questions, so class moved very quickly with most people probably being totally lost in lecture. Psets are often unrelated to exam material and full of overly complex mathematical computations, requiring hours to solve a system of equations for example (which isn't hard, just tedious, time consuming, and not really relevant).",
    "The mathematically rigorous introduction provides a unique perspective on economics. However, I was more interested in the economic intuition and results than the details of the mathematical proofs.",
    "This course is incredibly hard. The textbook is difficult to comprehend, but perhaps that's just the nature and difficulty of the subject.",
    "The class was very difficult; lecture was often too hard to understand the first time around, so much of my learning was done on my own. However, it was extremely helpful that Eduardo posted the lecture notes online.",
    "The beginning of the course was very mathematical and proof based. I do not think the prerequisites for the course were aptly assigned, as the course would be much conceptually easier after taking classes in analysis, optimization, etc. However, the course was very interesting and I found it very engaging.",
    "At the start of the semester, I felt incredibly lost and unaware of the resources available to help me. Stating this clearly at the start of semester would be helpful for future students (as well as having student tutors available?). Also making sure that TA office hours aren't immediately after the problem set is released.",
    "I wish we'd gone over applications to the theory we've learned. For example, looking at modern papers in economic theory or even occasionally talking about how this theory could be tested\/supported by data.",
    "Sometimes having more motivating examples would be helpful. Proofs by themselves with no application to real examples can make it difficult to develop intuition. The book was too advanced for the course.",
    "I was overall pretty happy with this course."

   "comments": [
    "Depends on what you are looking for in a class. If you have a strong background in multivariable and probability, the class isn't bad. I'm actually glad I took it. That being said, it is a very challenging and theoretical course!",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in the theoretical aspects of economics.",
    "Do not take this course unless you really love mathematical theory (if you're unsure, you probably don't) or need to for your major. Professor Faingold is kind and keen on his students succeeding, but it is impossible to understand the material, because it is so abstract. It will make you feel intellectually incompetent and lost, and bears no resemblance to intro micro.",
    "If you have a strong mathematical background, you can probably get by with just that. Keep in mind that the class will still be difficult. If you're looking for a more mathematical, supposedly graduate-prep level class, take this instead of 121. However, for all other intents and purposes, take 121.",
    "If you are very strong in math (not strong as in being able to breeze through Math 120, but strong as in have a background in proof-based mathematics and in analysis), then take the course. If not, you will find yourself struggling at the beginning to learn the concepts, and there are less resources to help you with the material. However, if you are willing to put in a lot of time and are taking easy classes aside from this one, it is an interesting course.",
    "ECON125 is tough! Faingold demands intuitive and analysis-based understanding of the concepts for mathematics and economics. For someone unfamiliar with the mathematics, it was difficult to grasp at the start but Faingold is incredibly helpful and patient to support all students to conquer the material. Huge sense of achievement at the end.",
    "If you're comfortable with pure math and want to be an Econ or Econ\/Math major, why not just take the course. You won't enjoy it, but at least you'll be able to prove your capable of keeping up with a proof-based econ course. It's also a smaller class than Intermediate, so there's that.",
    "Take it if you're willing to be confused a lot of the time. Course is tough but if you put in the effort to understand the intuitions which motivate the often complex proofs you'll be much better off. Second half is much better and more interesting than the first half, so don't drop it after the midterm unless you really, really don't like it.",
    "This course gives the impression of heaving up the hood of a car and then spending the next semester trying to understand how the running engine works. This analogy works in many ways. First, ECON 135 is an exploration of the most fundamental underpinnings of the field of micro-economics. The idea is to strip away all the exterior, all applications, even some of the central debates and focus on what makes micro-economics tick. But do not mistake basic principles for simplicity. Trying to understand exactly what assumptions and what arguments are necessary (or redundant), sufficient (or lacking) can lead to all sorts of complications. And these economists brood over efficiency with great appreciation of a watertight argument. Like peering under the hood of a car, it would be best to be prepared with the right tools. The tricky part of describing these tools is that Professor Faingold teaches most of the necessary mathematics in class, so in some sense the prerequisite knowledge would not have to be more than MATH118 (maybe MATH120 concurrently). But the few topics he introduces resemble more advanced mathematics, and more importantly the way of thinking and reasoning through the course's assigned problems resemble analysis or a proof-based math courses. This is to say familiarity with slightly more advanced mathematics or a genuine flare for proofs and quantitative reasoning would be a good idea. The course also gives a glimpse into what studying micro-economics in graduate school would mean. The course textbook is relatively common for introductory graduate economics classes. In this light, the course is not really intended for those with a passing fancy in economics (or maybe even those just engaged enough to get an undergraduate economics degree), but if you are genuinely interested in what it would mean to study micro-economics in depth, here is an open opportunity. To know what it would mean to be a mechanic, I suggest you get acquainted with a car. Finally, the harder you work on the engine, the better it will run. This course will take commitment (including concentration through some of the less interesting, more complex lectures). Realize that nothing Professor Faingold teaches is convoluted, but it is at times material difficult to grasp at first pass. I believe a sizable number of students dropped the class. One could probably get a good sense of how they will fare from the first couple of problem sets. Thankfully mid-terms and finals are not as difficult as the problem sets, but most problem sets require some ingenuity and are always much more involved than simply following an example or a practice problem. Two final notes of conciliation: First, if you finish a lecture confounded as to exactly how some line or argument worked, you are likely not alone. Second, there is (mercifully) a generous curve.",
    "It depends. It's a good course, but you should have at least a decent math background."
