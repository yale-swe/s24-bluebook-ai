   "comments": [
    "PLSC 259 is a good course that could be made better. Professor Horan offers her students so much time, which is great. Class discussion could also be good, and it was interesting to hear the perspectives of my classmates. But, it sometimes felt as if the class was not student-driven. And, essay assignments were very frustratingProfessor Horan wrote vague prompts, but obviously had a very narrow idea of what she wanted. This class definitely requires work, but it is a good chance to get a lot of one-on-one opportunity with a professor and to engage in class discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to people who are interested in the nitty-gritty of how policymakers make decisions. You work within three basic units that progress-- policy definition, implementation, and evaluation. There is a good mix of theoretical readings and case studies in this class. Professor Horan also requires everyone to pick a policy area of focus for the entire semester, which yields to a very fruitful experience because you feel like you actually become an expert on something. This course is probably one of the few that exists where you focus on the behaviors of bureaucratic institutions and service delivery in policy. The readings you'll be assigned during these weeks are quite important, and other classes on social policy will likely not have such a relevant focus on the analysis of power within bureaucracies. This class has been traditionally small. The individual accountability to do readings is higher, and the quality of discussions in seminar are great. Professor Horan is also someone really worth knowing and talking to if you are interested in urban policy, welfare policy and race.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, but be ready for a lot of reading. I would also recommend having and idea of what you might be interested in researching as that will help you focus your research quickly, although that is not necessary for the class to be a success.",
    "This is a great course for students interested in the theoretical and practical implications of public policy making. It also offers a good opportunity to examine a specific policy issue in detail. The course does require a lot of work, but that's worth it if you're interested in mentorship from Professor Horan."
