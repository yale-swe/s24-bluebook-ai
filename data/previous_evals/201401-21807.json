    "If you've taken intro GD and Type 1 and want more, take this.",
    "Lots of work, so don't take it if you're not fully into it. But take it if you are! We had 3 projects, a type specimen poster, a book and a type in motion animation.",
    "The class is about half graduate students, which is daunting but also a great learning experience. Henk assigns three projects: a type specimen poster, a book, and a type in motion video. The latter is incredibly difficult if you've never touched Adobe After Effects. Johannes de Young, who helps the class out (a ton!) during that project, will make himself available to meet pretty much as often as you need it, but you need to seek him out. Even with this help, it is a tough task to think in brand new terms. All of this said, the class is still a must-take. Henk is a gem of the Yale graphic design dept. and you ought to experience him at least once.",
    "ART 265 is a great class, definitely recommended for students looking to take a more challenging graphic design course. There were three assignments--a poster, a book, and a type-in-motion project, and we had free-reign to do really whatever we wanted inside of those general guidelines. This made the class really engaging, because everyone focused on what they were interested in, and everyone came up with very different projects in the end. Very rewarding class and you come away with 3 new pieces to add to a portfolio.",
    "Typography II is a great course. I would definitely recommend it! As opposed to Typography I, the projects are a lot less constrained and often not strictly typographic. We are encouraged to use typography in a considered way, and it is usually the most important element in the piece, but it is integrated with other design elements in a fashion that is closer to what will probably come into play in more advanced classes and in the professional world."
