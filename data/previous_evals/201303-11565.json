    "It is exactly what the title sounds like. You read the works of African American Poets of the modern era. You meet once a week for discussion and turn in two 10-12 page papers. If the subject matter interests you, take the course. You won't regret it.",
    "Very relaxed. Very little reading, very little writing. Unfortunately, the discussions do not get very in depth, so the most interesting work you will do is in your paper.",
    "Great way to read and discuss some of the best poetry written by African Americans in recent years.",
    "Yes! Professor Stepto makes the class. And you read really good stuff.",
    "If Professor Stepto is teaching the course, do not hesitate to take it. He is a living legend. The course is an opportunity to analyze and read poetry with a professor who is one of the preeminent voices in the field. He also knows (or has known) many of these poets on a personal basis. Make sure to start the final paper no later than one week after the midterm if you want to have plenty of time for meetings with the professor at the end of the semester."
