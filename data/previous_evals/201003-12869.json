    "If you want to take a design course, take it with Henk. Just be prepared to put real hours of work in.",
    "AWESOME, low-key introduction to graphic design. Expect to work with grids and lines at first, but the assignments get better throughout the semester.It's however much work you want to put into it. You can do basically nothing if you want, but you'll probably be embarrassed when you have to present it to the class. Henk is one of those teachers who inspires you to actually WANT to put in a lot of work.",
    "Take it. Be ready to do lots of work though. Also I hope you like collage.",
    "I highly recommend it to anyone interested in design. Henk is a great professor. Be prepared to spend a lot of time cutting and glueing out letters though.",
    "I would highly recommend this to a student. If you are at all interested in design, take it. At first I was a little skeptical in taking it because all the projects are done by hand, but I loved it. Doing the projects by hand gave me a new perspective on graphic design. In addition to this, I was able to do some of the projects on the computer as well. There are people from all academic backgrounds in the class, which always for a very interesting class dynamic. Loved the professor and the projects. Take it.",
    "An intro design class where you learn how to think about conveying a message through design and does not solely focus on learning how to use a computer program. A lot of time put in but not that stressful.",
    "Really great introduction to design. The projects are fun and interesting, and the critiques help you learn the language of the elements of design and art. All in all a great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking it - you learn a lot about the field of graphic design and its history, and even visit the studio of a New Haven graphic designer, which is really cool. The projects focus on different types of graphic design - from brochure to logo to poster - so you get a fuller sense of the field.",
    "As someone who isn't an art major (this is my first and maybe last art class at Yale), I loved the class! Henk is an awesome person, kind of reminds me of James Bond, and the crits are very nice--generally structured to be very constructive criticism now.Workload is very flexible based on how much you want to put in, and how labor-intensively you decide to do your projects.It's all by hand, though--very little computer use is encouraged--which I loved, but some may not.",
    "I would recommend this class for an art major or student interested in pursuing graphic communication."
