    "This is a typical day that demonstrates why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear to me how Terri Francis teaches a class at Yale:When we sat down at the second to last class of the entire semester she announced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHm, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually given much thought to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do today\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but I guess we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here! So\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter treating us to musings on whether avant-garde can survive, musings separate from any reading that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looked since the second week of class because it never came up in discussions, Francis decides to open up the powerpoint she showed us during shopping period that features random samples of paintings from the last four hundred years. She settles on Courbet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Stone Breakers\u00e2\u0080\u009d and says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, so this is people breaking stone...\u00e2\u0080\u009d more pausing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, what do you think of this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you know about it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d After six seconds of silence one student finally says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a while, since high school, but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about...\u00e2\u0080\u009d We then have a meandering discussion over twenty minutes about whether still life paintings are more real than portraits of stone breakers.Then Francis shares a five minute anecdote about iPhones.Ten minutes on whether film is different from other art forms. Francis says something like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not pretty to be a starving artist.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEventually we drained through an hour and fifty minutes, and it was time to leave.This class also features:--weekly screenings Francis doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come to and that we never talk about again--a class when we stare at scrapbooks in the Beinecke for an hour and fifty minutes--a class when we walk around sculptures on Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campusI guess what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying is--if you thought you could never do six classes, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your chance.",
    "It can be difficult to stay focused the entire period in the morning, but this is a laid-back class that really depends upon you to bring your passion for cinema into the conversation. If you don't, you may very well be bored. If you do, you will find it much more worthwhile.",
    "Take it if you're gonna watch the movies - it's a good selection, and many of them are hard to come by otherwise... If you're motivated to learn about this stuff on your own, it's worth it....",
    "Yes, if you have an interest in the avant garde",
    "It's a course on experimental film (really avant-garde stuff) with accompanying readings. Take the course if you want to watch super artsy films that would be in a gallery setting. Don't expect narrative or content\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost all the films are literally just formal elements, like paintings on screen. I would recommend it if you really care about this type of film, otherwise the discussion can be boring.",
    "Really chill class focusing on the discussion of films that are really weird, cool, and sometimes disturbing. Take if it sounds interesting to you.",
    "Avant-garde is a really cool class. I love art house\/international\/independent movies so I thought I'd like this class. It took me a while to get used to the craziness\/boringness of some of the films, but after a while everything just sort of clicks.Since a lot of this stuff was done during the mid 20th century, and since it was done purely for the sake of art, you get to see what life was really like before you were born. In some ways, I feel like I learned more about human nature and history from this class than from any others.This is a fun class. I didn't do a single reading. It might be good as a fifth class or credit d. although getting an A isn't too difficult."
