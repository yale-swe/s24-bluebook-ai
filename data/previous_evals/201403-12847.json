   "comments": [
    "It is an intensive grammar survey, writing\/reading bootcamp and vocabulary booster. I would highly recommend to anyone who has been away from French for a year or more.",
    "Learn to speak french and go over the grammar reviewed in other semesters.",
    "Yes! It'll help improve your French loads. It can be more work at times, since you do meet every day, but it's not a problem for most of the semester. Madame Koundi is wonderful, very intelligent and very kind.",
    "I would say that if you can push and get yourself into L5 try that. But even if you can't I'd still recommend L4 for the grammer review at least. The stories are a little weird\/sad, and the movies are typically weird and French, but overall it's okay.",
    "Great class, extremely tough, especially for partially native french speakers, but worth every second of work. I loved it.",
    "French 140 is a great course to be used to refine grammar that a student has learned before and learn any new grammar necessary to move on to courses dominated by longer essays and modern literature.",
    "I thought that french 140 was a great class. I really enjoyed the texts that we read."
