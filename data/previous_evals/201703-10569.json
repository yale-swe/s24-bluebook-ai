    "I felt that the course was especially useful for gaining experience with data presentation and analysis. The practical skills gained will also be helpful. I think one weakness of the course is that at certain times it felt like we had an overwhelming amount of things to do, while at other times there was little that needed to be done.",
    "It can be more organised",
    "Strengths: Topics taught span a wide range of physical chemistry topics. There is a fair bit of learning on your own and this is quite valuable. Course is adjusted to work with other courses while still having an expected level of work. Weaknesses: Too much time was spent on the electronics. Not that what was taught was not valuable, but rather that the running of this section of the course had a lot of \"wasted\" time. While it is important to work through \"new\" topics and experience the struggle, it may be better to have a small tutorial on how electronics are used and measured just as one may have an older student in the group do for a newer student. A lot of time was spent not understanding the basics of breadboards. There was also a great deal of time just trying to decipher what was wanted for the objective. If we were given a clear objective and perhaps less instruction in the manuals then we could explore resources on our own to try to find ways to solve that objective. The time would feel much less wasted then."

    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes. I found this course very instructive, though perhaps it could be paired with separate modules that could help theory students instead of them taking some of the more experimental ones."
