   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to a freshman with very strong backgroud, since the class is very discussion-based and writing is also done on a regular basis. The theme of the class was \"Italiannes\/Otherness\" and it also depends on how comfortable one would feel discussing these, instead of art, culture and cinema, for example. However, a great part of the course was also focused on good Italian literature, Italian films and artists.",
    "I really liked Karen as a professor, so if you have a chance you should take a class with her. However, I would not recommend this one. It's not that interesting and you learn about a lot but don't come out with a deep understanding of any of them individually. Definitely a focus on the dark side of Italy and all of its problems.",
    "Take the class if you want to develop fluency and you want to have interesting conversations. You can take this class and take the other Ital 151 class as well.",
    "Yes. This is a very good course if you want to learn more about the italian history and culture and do fun presentations in class. And Karen is great!",
    "This class was about the Italian identity and it helped people understand what the Italian identity is through using the language and improving our skills. It is a great class and there is a lot of practice of language skills.",
    "Italian 150 is a great way to improve upon your italian skills. The workload is manageable, and there are a number of oral assignments that tha allow you to explore a number of broad topics, so there's a lot of freedom in regard to studying what you like.",
    "Good class! Would definitely take with Karen",
    "Not really because if you're taking L5 italian its not required and you're looking to have a fun experience and learn and this was not really either, but it wasn't particularly hard so if you're looking for that then maybe",
    "I would recommend the class especially if you are already quite proficient in Italian. If you are fluent, the class will be a breeze. If not, I would recommend seeking help from Karen or a language tutor. The class is not overly difficult and it introduces you to Italian language in the context of today."
