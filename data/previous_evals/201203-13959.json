    "I would recommend this class. It is a great way to learn about current events and understand more fully what is going on in the Middle East. It is not just a surface level class, but instead has you to really engage in the material and understand the deeper problems in the Arab World. There is a midterm and final paper and weekly responses due on the reading. There is also an in-class presentation.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Islam and the Middle East. This course really opened my eyes to different ways of thinking about the Middle East and coming up with solutions.",
    "This is a great class to take a very holistic view of the Arab Spring. Topics range from religion to basic tax structures of states. Dr. Shaker will make or break this class for you, so be sure to shop if you are considering it."
