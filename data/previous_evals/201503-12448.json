    "Neurobio is a hard class. There is a lot of material, the tests are difficult, and the roster is a bunch of Ph.D students and really qualified undergrads who make the curve fairly competitive. That being said, neurobio is a phenomenal class that gives you everything you want and more out of a survey neurobiology course. Paul Forscher and Haig Keshishian are both great professors who are super knowledgeable about the material and willing to answer any questions about it by email or after class. The workload proper is not actually that much, as the class grade is only based on two midterms and a final with no intermittent assignments. Nonetheless, students ought keep up on the material fairly regularly, as the week before the exam may not be soon enough to get every concept if one is confused. The book is extremely dense (Dr. Keshishian called it a \"big blue sleeping pill\" in one of our lectures), but it is extremely comprehensive and worth reading. Optional weekly review sessions are held on Thursday night by the TFs, though I never took advantage of them. Should you be interested in learning about neuroscience with a bottom-up approach, I definitely recommend that you take the course. Still, I would recommend that it be taken along with a lighter course load to accommodate all of the studying that you should be doing. I also did take the lab, which I found to be one of the more enjoyable MCDB labs at yale. Worth taking if you do end up in the class.",
    "About half the class will be grad students but you'll learn a lot. The tests are pretty fair and if you pay attention in class you'll be fine. Be aware that both professors often go 5-10 minutes over most classes.",
    "I would recommend Neurobio if you're interested in the brain, especially it's technical workings and neural circuits. This class is concerned much more with anatomy than with functional aspects of the brain, so if you're interested in how the brain works as a whole and disorders, etc., I might consider the Human Brain instead, but neurobio does a great job of introducing how the neural system really works and wires together. midterms are fair (though grading depends on TAs) and the final was very hard (but is likely to change). grading consists of just midterms and final, and there is reading associated with each class and class notes provided by professors to help with studying",
    "A difficult, but excellent course. There are no problem sets, only two midterms and a final. With no problem sets to help you review the material every week, you need to make sure to keep up with studying before the exams sneak up on you. The material is fascinating and you'll come out of the course feeling that you've gained substantial knowledge. I also recommend taking the lab.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A 5TH COURSE WITH CREDIT But really, there's a lot of content in this course, and you'll learn a lot, so you need to give yourself lots of time to study for the final, instead of starting the night before like I did.",
    "Big, Big, Class. Covers biochemistry, development and genetics, and more traditional neurobiology topics. Hard but worth it.",
    "You are given A LOT of information, and the final exam is the hardest test I have taken at Yale. But the class is interesting if you are interested in neuroscience and covers a lot of different topics.",
    "I took this as a psychology major having only taken the introductory biology sequence, a year of general chemistry and a couple of neuroscience-related psychology courses, and I did fine, so if that description sounds anything like you, don't be scared away from this class. In fact, I'd say that if you're thinking about pursuing the neuroscience track of psychology or cognitive science, you should probably take this class. It really teaches you a lot about both how neurons work on the \"micro\" level (i.e. electrophysiology) and how larger neural networks are organized in animals. Professor Forscher's unit on membrane properties can be a bit tough to follow and may seem confusing at times, but it's nothing a little independent review can't fix, and Professor Keshishian's units on development and neural systems are for the most part clear and easy to follow. There's a considerable degree of overlap between this class and The Human Brain (PSYC 160), though this class is definitely more challenging and is overall much more focused on the smaller-scale characteristics of neural communication than on how large regions of the brain interact with each other (though you do get into some of that towards the end of the class). The only work is two midterms and a final - no problem sets, though honestly the class could probably use them, especially during the first third of the course. Overall, the class requires quite a bit of studying, I won't lie, but if you're really interested in this stuff, you won't regret taking it.",
    "MCDB320 is a thorough course covering neurobiology from the basic biophysics of how the resting and action potentials are mediated by ion channels through complex cortical pathways that define sensory input and processing. The course is extensive in both breadth and depth, covering a wide range of material with high granularity - it really incorporates knowledge of biology (and some physics) at every layer. Despite this breadth and depth, I thought Prof. Forscher and Prof. Keshishian generally covered the material in a clear and cohesive way - besides the last section on higher order cortical system integration and function, which seemed to jump randomly from topic to topic. The tests are quite difficult - the topics they test you on are not necessarily the topics they emphasize in lecture. I'd recommend stopping by the section before each exam (if not regularly) to get a sampling of the former exam questions.",
    "A very difficult but rewarding class. The course is divided between two instructors- the wrist is Forscher, so what you see during shopping period is not necessarily what the entire course will be like. However, the second half is just as interesting as the first, and thankfully less intensive. There are no weekly problem sets or practice problems, so in order to do well in this course it's necessary to study\/review everyday. Make sure you read the relevant chapters in the book for Forscher's section- they're not as important for Keshishian's. There are three exams- I found the first to be more difficult than the second, and the final the hardest of the three. Make sure you study topics not covered on the previous two exams, because they're bound to show up on the final. Great course overall in my opinion."
