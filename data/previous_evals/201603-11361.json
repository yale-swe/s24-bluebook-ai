   "comments": [
    "Learnt the language and basics of analyzing jazz harmony.",
    "More knowledge of the mechanics behind jazz theory.",
    "Working knowledge of the jazz vocabulary, especially as pertains to reharmonization (a central focus of the class).",
    "An much-expanded understanding of jazz harmony, voicing techniques, and repertoire. The ability to reharmonize jazz standards with tasteful voicings on the piano.",
    "In this course, I learned to dissect and understand harmonic progressions in jazz. The course is not too challenging and is very doable for someone with a minimal jazz background.",
    "I learned a lot in this course, from the composition of jazz tunes to the harmonic analysis of them. We picked up a good set of skills for our reharmonization toolbox.",
    "I learned the vary basics of jazz harmony. Having studied jazz piano privately for some time, this course did not cover much that I wasn't already familiar with. So, if you're a jazz musician, this course will probably not cover more than you already know. This course's best audience is students with only classical background or not much musical background. We covered 2-5-1 progressions, functional bass analysis (which is Kane's simplified version of Roman numeral analysis from classical harmony), and various types of chord voicings including rootless left hand voicings, \"So What\" chords, and upper-structure harmony. While Kane is a great teacher and offers helpful insights on the course materials, those with jazz experience under their belt might be better off skimming through Mark Levine's harmony book as opposed to taking this course.",
    "Deeper understanding of the Jazz harmony structure and how it all works.",
    "Before I took this class, I hardly had any exposure to Jazz theory. I didn't know about tritone substitutions, coltrane changes, subtonic cadences etc. By the end of this course, I feel that I've learned so much and would now be able to look at a lead sheet and reharmonize under the melody, as well as look at a jazz transcription and analyze in depth. Now, I'd want to focus on practically applying this analytical skill and work on Jazz improvisation. I've also gained a valuable appreciation for jazz and have widened my knowledge of the jazz repertoire.",
    "I gained an appreciation for jazz in general that I hadn't had before, not being a jazz musician myself. Prof Kane was keen on teaching us jazz history and style as well as harmony, and I am grateful for that aspect of the course. We also obviously covered jazz harmonies in great depth, starting from the very basic ii-V-I and moving through methods of analysis, different ways of reharmonizing jazz, and types of chord-voicings and extensions. The class left me with the skills to look at a jazz standard and understand its structure, or to look at a transcription of a solo and have an appreciation for the soloist's interpretation of the music.",
    "I learned a lot about jazz theory, including functional bass analysis of lead sheets and reharmonization techniques. It also introduces you to famous jazz standards, and Kane points out many interesting techniques that musicians use in recordings.",
    "I learned basically all the most important jazz theory concepts, got a much better sense of jazz history and its development as an art form, know a lot more jazz standards really well, and became much better at reharmonizing jazz (and music generally)",
    "As a musician who had only ever had experience with classical theory, I learned a lot, as advertised, about Jazz Harmony in this course. Prof Kane does a great job of structuring the beginning of the course as a bridge between how we're thought to think about harmony classically and how it functions in jazz. By the end of the course we were able to break away from the strictures of classical harmony, and look at how the concepts we were learning might be heard in the jazz canon.",
    "This course will teach you a lot about \"understanding\" Jazz. If you already play piano, you'll probably pick up some basics of how to play too.",
    "I learned the basics of Jazz Theory and how jazz musicians improvise and reharmonize.",
    "A unique and practical insight into the mechanics and history of jazz harmony, taught by an excellent musician and teacher."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's just fantastic.",
    "Strengths were professor's extensive knowledge of jazz history and passion for the subject. Weaknesses was the amount of repetitive learning inside and outside of the classroom. I felt like I could've learned many of the topics just as easily from a book.",
    "Caters to a broad student base - both a strength and a weakness, as everyone can be engaged at times, but more focus would allow for everyone to be more engaged all the time. However, this is perfect as an \"introductory\" course, not in that one should take it as an introduction to music, but rather in the sense that one who is familiar with musical analysis and interested in jazz (without having studied it before) will gain a lot from it.",
    "I thought this was just about everything a jazz class should be. We listened to and studied some classic standards, learned the key elements of jazz theory, and did lots of composition and theory exercises. The class moved too slowly at times, in part because there was a wide variety of musical backgrounds in the class.",
    "For non-pianists or non-jazz pianists, perhaps a keyboard lab component could have further increased the applicability of the course and provided an interactive component.",
    "I came away from the course with a very clear understanding of the theory concepts we covered and how to reharmonize a standard. What I felt I was missing was the cursory jazz history background I would need to see how jazz harmony has evolved over time. I know what 2-5-1 chord progressions, tritone subs, coltrane changes, etc, are but I don't know how, why, and when jazz harmony adopted these techniques.",
    "The strengths are the material itself, Prof Kane's teaching, and the engaging assignments. The only weakness I could imagine is that it would have been fun to do a creative final project.",
    "While I commend a class that tries to be all-inclusive (particularly when it's the only class available on jazz at Yale), I wish that Jazz Harmony covered more ground. We started with the basics, continued as a slow pace, and in the end we didn't learn that much. I feel like class time could've be spent more effectively. Kane usually started the class by going over the homework for a long time. Then, he introduced a new harmonic technique, which could often be explained in five minutes or so. He then spent the rest of class playing examples of the technique in famous recordings. I feel like we could've easily covered twice as much material as we did if so much time hadn't been spend in this way. Additionally, I wish we had more composition assignments. Almost all of our assignments were arranging standards. I would've engaged more with the course material if we had more opportunities to compose our own material.",
    "Before I took this class, I hardly had any exposure to Jazz theory. I didn't know about tritone substitutions, coltrane changes, subtonic cadences etc. By the end of this course, I feel that I've learned so much and would now be able to look at a lead sheet and reharmonize under the melody, as well as look at a jazz transcription and analyze in depth. Now, I'd want to focus on practically applying this analytical skill and work on Jazz improvisation.I've also gained a valuable appreciation for jazz and have widened my knowledge of the jazz repertoire. What makes this class so great is Brian Kane. His love for jazz is so apparent and I think it inspires us all. His knowledge of jazz recordings is also invaluable to us and I just loved sitting in class, listening to all these great recordings. The only thing I'd say is that it's difficult to get feedback from our assignments so I didn't quite know how to improve. I guess I should have met up with the TA. I also don't know if the grading is fair\/systematic. I once worked on an assignment with a friend, we basically did the same thing but we got different scores.",
    "I think we could have moved faster through the middle part of the course (eg not spent a whole lecture on tritone subs, not spent a whole lecture on unpacking), and had a day or two for tight vocal voicings. Writing for a horn\/vocal section is an integral part of jazz harmony and I would have liked to study that as well.",
    "Kane was an incredibly good lecturer. He kept things fun and engaging, and he was very organized, explaining concepts very clearly. I looked forward to going to class every day, and I would always learn something interesting.",
    "This class has a lot of strengths and not a lot of weaknesses. Strengths would be the lectures were pretty engaging, which is a feat for a 75 minute class, and the psets appropriately hammered in the material. Sometimes the psets felt a bit 'busywork'-y, but I think sometimes that is necessary to acquire the skills I did. A potential weakness is that I would have liked to listen to even more standards: I know there is value in listening to the same piece over and over and maybe most standards have no theoretical value but I think the more different pieces and artists we listen to over the course of the semester the better the course is. Probably the biggest weakness is that Kane isn't an amazing jazz piano player: for someone with a bad ear it was sometimes hard to tell which chords were mess ups and which were the ones he was trying to demonstrate. Might be better to get a TA who is really good and then have them sit at the piano the whole class, and then Kane could also yell out the chords as the TA played them or point at sheet music on the projector like he does with recordings!",
    "I think the class is really well structured - the skills you learn each week really build upon one another, and the homework from each class allows you to apply the skills you've learned in class. Prof Kane also does a really excellent job of answering questions - if there were parts you didn't understand in the homework, you can go over those in class. That said - the grading was a bit difficult to navigate. Every assignment (even the midterm - and I'm guessing the final) is out of 7, and at times it seems very arbitrary. What is the difference between a 6.5\/7 or a 6.75\/7? There was also a very clear difference between how the TA and Kane graded (the TA was harder). If this class is going to continue to grade everything out of 7, students - and the TA - should have a clearer understanding of what a \".25\" deduction really means.",
    "The course develops a pretty well-rounded toolkit of analytical terms, and they're paced out well. So, the course has a very clear \"plot,\" which makes it easy to understand what's going on, and why it's being structured the way it is. This might be inevitable in a class where students have such variable backgrounds in the subject, but it did seem sometimes like class discussion became dominated by a few very enthusiastic people. I might have enjoyed it if the structure had been varied a tiny bit more so that we heard more voices.",
    "The course was very engaging as Brian Kane is fun, knowledgable, and interesting to listen to."

   "comments": [
    "Great class. Also has the most insanely high (what you get)\/(what you put in) ratio I have ever seen here at Yale, and you learn a lot. Just absolutely fantastic.",
    "Excellent course. One of the best I've taken at Yale. I came at it with a jazz background and a strong but informal theory background (i.e., I hadn't taken any of the prereqs but I was comfortable with chords and roman numerals, etc.) and I found the material very accessible. I felt like the rest of the class was primarily music majors with more formal, classical training. All this to say, if you think you might be interested in jazz or theory or both, definitely shop it. Brian Kane is an awesome professor and extremely knowledgable on both the theory and practice of jazz. I came out of the course as a better jazz musician and a better musician overall.",
    "Yes - a strong interest in jazz and a strong musical knowledge are necessary, but a working knowledge of the jazz repertoire, while helpful, is not needed.",
    "If you are at all interested in Jazz theory, go for it! You won't learn to improvise, but you will get to learn all about jazz chords from a true seasoned expert.",
    "Take this course! If you are interested in jazz in any degree, Kane will blow your mind week after week. Amazing lectures and really cool material. You'll be able to reharmonize and play your way through a jazz standard with really nice voicings by the end of the course. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale!",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to someone who is curious about jazz and how it works, musically. Also, the class is not super challenging so it's a great way to fulfill the music major's theory requirement without a struggle.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! Take it if you have any interest in jazz. The theory pre-reqs are somewhat unnecessary; jazz theory is almost a world in and of itself.",
    "All in all, I would recommend this class to a non-jazz musician who wants a very basic introduction to jazz harmony, but not to a student with some jazz experience under their belt. It's a light-weight course and therefore a good choice for a straightforward fifth class.",
    "Its a great class if you are into jazz and the teacher is great!",
    "TAKE IT! Even if you don't have any jazz background. Before I took this class, I hardly had any exposure to Jazz theory. I didn't know about tritone substitutions, coltrane changes, subtonic cadences etc. By the end of this course, I feel that I've learned so much and would now be able to look at a lead sheet and reharmonize under the melody, as well as look at a jazz transcription and analyze in depth.

What makes this class so great is Brian Kane. His love for jazz is so apparent and I think it inspires us all. His knowledge of jazz recordings is also invaluable to us and I just loved sitting in class, listening to all these great recordings. He's also such a chill, cool guy. It's great to be in a class where people laugh. The only thing I'd say is that it's difficult to get feedback from our assignments so I didn't quite know how to improve. I guess I should have met up with the TA. I also don't know if the grading is fair\/systematic. I once worked on an assignment with a friend, we basically did the same thing but we got different scores. I also have no idea how grading will turn out. Seems like everyone did well.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course if you're interested in learning more about jazz and its harmonies. You need to be very fluent in music theory already, otherwise it will be tough for you to keep up. Eg, if you're not sure what note is a tritone away from Ab, or what the ii7 chord would be in the key of G, then maybe take a lower level music theory course first. That said, you definitely do not need any familiarity with jazz! Prof Kane will teach you everything you need to know and he's very good at making sure everyone is on the same page from the get-go. Classes are engaging, mini history lessons are fun, and his trove of Spotify playlists and Realbook PDFs make it very easy to study outside of class.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course if you are at all interested in jazz. It will not help too much with playing jazz (unless you practice on your own), but the reharmonization techniques are something you can definitely incorporate. It gives you a fundamental understanding of how jazz works.",
    "Jazz harmony is seriously awesome. I came in with mid level theory (MUSI 205) and some piano background, but not jazz, and I was still able to enjoy and get a lot out of the course (perhaps more since I likely picked up more advanced normal theory that was considered more a prereq along the way). You learn a lot about jazz history and great jazz standards from a theoretical perspective, which imo gives a much deeper appreciation and knowledge of the history. Kane is a great lecturer and a treasure trove of jazz knowledge: he welcomes that sort of engagement so you could get a lot more out of the class that way. I'd highly recommend teaching yourself jazz standards along with this class: its a rare opportunity to complement theory with practice and I loved it. Homework is a bit busywork-y but it helps you learn, and there's not anything that requires a ton of thinking. Take it!",
    "The music department offers SO few class outside of the western classical tradition, so please do yourself a service and take this course. It will expand the way you think about music and harmony, it has a very reasonable workload, and the skills you will learn (reharmonization especially) are incredibly valuable assets.",
    "Definitely take this course if you listen to any jazz. If you don't, consider taking it anyways; it gives a really interesting perspective on post-1900 harmony in all its guises. If you don't do music theory, but play music and want to learn more about jazz TAKE THIS COURSE. It's a great way to be exposed to what music theory can do for you.",
    "If you like Jazz or are interested in it al all, take the course.",
    "For any aspiring musician wishing to expand on their knowledge of harmony and the connections classical writing has with jazz, this class is instrumental in broadening those horizons."
