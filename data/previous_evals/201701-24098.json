   "comments": [
    "Not only did I learn about Chinese poetry and poetry in general, but I also greatly improved as a writer and as a thinker. This was my first humanities class at Yale that actually forced me to reflect and create original idea as opposed to regurgitating and repackaging others thoughts.",
    "This course really helped me apply the knowledge and critical thinking from other literature courses at Yale to an in-depth study of a tradition I was not particularly familiar with, which helped me broaden the ways in which I experience and apply the content I learn from the texts we read.",
    "Even as a graduating senior, this course gave me a plethora of new skills. Professor Bender did an excellent job at teaching methods of close reading poetry, and was extremely committed to providing resources and feedback to help writing papers. The job he did is truly hard to surpass.",
    "Poetry&Ethics Amidst Imperial Collapse provided me with the first venture into Chinese literature; the course taught me to, one hand, shed the frameworks of reading generally used for Western works. On the other hand, the inclusion of extensive literary and ethical theory texts, written in the West for its literature, also taught me to draw connections where relevant, without attempting to force one region, time, and culture, to conform to the other. Beyond these skills, this course provided an indepth example of a poet who hasnt got any answers to give, and for whom attempting to reduce into a manageable belief system or philosophy misses his lifes lessons entirely.",
    "I learned a great deal about Du Fu, and learned to analyze a literary style I'd never experienced before.",
    "I learned so much from taking this course. Most obviously, I learned how to properly read, interpret, and understand Chinese poetry, but I also learned so much about both the Tang dynasty historical, philosophical, and literary context, as well as reading through a bunch of more modern philosophical thought. The Lear and Yearly works really changed the way I see and think about the world, which was amazing. It was an excellent counterpoint\/course to take with DS, as it both allowed me to apply methods of analysis I'd learned from DS and see how much they applied and also taught an entirely different way of thinking",
    "I really loved the course, discussions were amazing and truly invogorating",
    "I'd never taken a course about China in any way shape or form and I certainly do not know any Mandarin. Even so, I learned a lot in the course about Du Fu. And to be honest I probably would have never learned about him otherwise so that's pretty cool.",
    "Excellent introduction to the classical Chinese tradition and the big names in comparative literature. We also read some moral philosophy, although I wouldn't say we \"learned philosophy\" - it felt more like contextualizing the literary theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course strength was also its weakness. The secondary philosophy readings were extremely demanding and difficult to understand at times, but they were what made the class interesting. It was challenging being plunged into the waters of certain philosophical ideas and not just getting one's toes wet, but the readings were all relevant and insightful once we had gone over them in class and been given the philosophical background behind the arguments.",
    "Strengths: it had an ambitious scope and realized it pretty well by combining traditions of analyses that students were more familiar with and applying it to a tradition most students were unfamiliar with. Professor Bender excelled at guiding the conversation during seminar Weaknesses: again, an ambitious scope that often ran up against all-too-real limitations like time and plausible amounts of reading",
    "The strengths were a cohesive syllabus that walked us through Du Fu's life in a very compelling way. I took a lot away about the cultural frameworks surrounding the poet. In the times where we focused a bit long on secondary readings, Professor Bender was extremely flexible and adapted the course to the learning objectives.",
    "The class, in my biased opinion, must be taught the way it was this year: it should follow Du Fus career because much of the poetry appears to reflect the lived experiences up to their time, each advancing a new retrospective understanding of life and circumstance. For this reason, perhaps more each session should be spent on the poetry itself; the secondary material is often meritorious of its own two hours, but when it begins to crowd out Du Fus time with little progress, perhaps a change in focus is in order. Otherwise, I enjoyed the format of the class, with secondary texts either informing or being refuted by the poems of the week. With such different subject matter, I believe it is useful with some form of interpretation rather than entering into the text without a framework.",
    "Despite being taught for the first time this year, this class was very successful. It's strengths lie very much in the knowledge of the professor on the topic in particular. Bender's passion and knowledge of Du Fu and Chinese culture and thought made the thematic organization of each week easily understandable (or at least as easy as one could hope for). His knowledge of western humanities as well allowed for very interesting conversations between cultures. Especially in the context of other EALL and EAST offerings, this seminar was a wonderful addition because of its in depth focus on one of China's literary heroes instead of on a general subject. The seminar format also seemed essential to teaching the course and frequent office hours helped a lot with tougher material and difficult essays. To be honest, the course does not have many weaknesses. I might have preferred to spend a little less time on western texts and literary analysis and instead focused more on Chinese criticism (which I think lacked generally but is also, understandably, harder to find). I think also it might be better to spend more time on Du Fu's poetry since we were unable to talk about many poems. This is difficult to do as the collection is massive and the secondary sources provide really interesting insights and ways to view the poetry. I'm not entirely sure how this could be done except by adding more class time or making this course a two part seminar half taught in the fall and the other half in the spring but there are clear pros and cons of this. In all, I think the course has few weaknesses that, if they were to be fixed, might pose other problems. I generally enjoyed the course very much and got a lot out of it and so would take these criticisms with a grain of salt that might or might not be solveable in the future. P",
    "I thought is was a well-designed course. The only problem was that it didn't meet enough, so there wasn't enough time to go in-depth on all the reading",
    "i personally really liked the philosophical analysis but we often focussed on the other aspects. otherwise, i 100% recommend this class.",
    "I liked when we went off of people's responses for the class discussion. Sometimes the secondary readings were sort of dense and would take up a lot of time to unpack so using what someone already unpacked to start off with sped things up.",
    "I worried it would be hard to get into this class because Chinese poetry is hard to translate to English, and Du Fu's poetry is hard to understand even with my L5 heritage Chinese background. But the class was so well structured that the readings always felt doable, the poetry always accessible. If the students don't go past the \"main idea\" of each week's reading, this might mean losing the poetry's complexity - but I was blessed each time with engaging discussions from diverse backgrounds and points of view. Lots of fun!"

   "comments": [
    "My favorite class to date. Readings were all manageable. DuFu is an interesting topic. Mainly, Professor Bender is a great teacher and a nice guy, makes even the difficult and irritating readings worthwhile.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student of literature, because it not only asks students to really engage with texts and think critically and analytically, but also adds some much-needed diversity to the literature we consume.",
    "Yes. This course is a MUST for anyone interested in poetry history china or ethics. It is one of THE defining learning experiences of my undergrad career. Anyone who gets a chance should take this opportunity.",
    "Yes! The poems, secondary readings, and online responses are most fruitful if allotted sufficient time; grant them these and each session will be very enjoyable and engaging.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course, essential for anyone interested in comparative literature, Chinese poetry, or poetry as a form in general.",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting course with a manageable workload and a good environment.",
    "In the strongest terms. The class was engaging, interesting, and forced me to think in an entirely different way. I would take it again, given the chance, and I would learn just as much, if not more",
    "YES!!! 100% this class is amazing",
    "If you're tired of studying only old dead white dudes in poetry classes, this is for you. Shoutout to lit majors trying to fulfill that pre 1800s requirement without ripping all their hair out. This was definitely the best way to take care of my requirement. 9\/10 would recommend. 1 point off because the class was two hours.",
    "I'm a sucker for big ethical questions about the purpose of literature in political turmoil - but aren't we all? Even if you've never heard about this Du Fu guy, even if you're not usually a poetry person, take this class! I highly recommend."
