    "I would only recommend it for Mech E's. It needs substantially more accessibility before BME majors will be able to get anything out of it. That said, for mechanical engineers, it is a nice overview of exactly the type of biology we would find most interesting.",
    "I would recommend the class, especially to mechanical engineering students, because it provides a perspective of the applications of the subject to the field. The lectures get a little dry and vague, but the workload is not too great.",
    "Biomedical aspect of mechanical engineering, breaking down the human body into mechanical systems"
