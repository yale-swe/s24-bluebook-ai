    "research, innovation, project management, goal setting",
    "I learned how to think like a BME researcher. This course enabled me to justify the amount of time I spent in lab doing work outside of my classes, and provided a more intense learning experience in lab. This course is also a great launching point for senior theses.",
    "This is the second time that I take independent research and I could not be happier taking it. Having relative independence over my own project has allowed me to learn many skills that are impossible to learn in the classroom such as: - Project management - Fund administration - Prototype development (3D printing and manufacturing methods) - Trial planning etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: personalized collaboration with advisors is a huge strength. they are invested in your work",
    "Having the choice to extend your senior project is incredibly useful, since it gives you time to lay a foundation and get things working before fully diving in to it the next. There is a perfect balance of guidance and freedom, with a syllabus, midterm report, and final presentation or paper to hold you accountable for your work. However, the specifics of your project are entirely self-guided, which provides a great sense of responsibility. It makes sense that you should be responsible for carrying out a final product!",
    "Strengths are that the course gives a ton of flexibility and independence for students to decide what they want to accomplish in the semester and to do what best drives their research forward. Weaknesses are that this flexibility can often seem overwhelming and unstructured to students; it's like handing them a blank sheet of paper and telling them to write\/draw something that will later be graded with no real rubric. It could be improved by having samples of past student presentations or papers and by having some form of rubric for grading.",
    "I think that the fundamental weakness of this course is that you are required to do research under a faculty member and without a team of your colleagues. In the Mechanical Engineering version of this course, the adviser is there to help but students chose their own projects and work on them quasi-independently and sometimes in teams. I think this model is much more effective in teaching engineering than this class's model which is a good preparation for biomedical engineering research, but not engineering.",
    "Most of this course is self-driven. It can be as challenging or as relaxed as you want. How much you learn really depends on how much you interact with people in the lab and the professor. I wish for BME, though, that the senior project was a collaboration with other classmates, like those of other engineering majors. Too often, I felt like I was struggling alone because my mentors were either too busy or unapproachable. One suggestion for next time is to organize a day to share the works of our classmates, either through a poster or a presentation. That way, we can at least talk about our projects in depth to some people who don't already know exactly what we're doing."

   "comments": [
    "yes, it is very valuable to complete a full year senior project. although this semester is typically not filled with much success, the groundwork completed in this semester is critical and valuable for longterm success in the project.",
    "Take this class if you think you'll need a bit more time with your senior project!",
    "Yes, I would recommend if you already have a research project in mind or if you are hoping to get a taste of more serious research. However, I should note that doing research with classes can be challenging, and sometimes a summer experience is more conducive for gaining a good research experience.",
    "Yes. I would definitely recommend it, but try to work on your own project or at least something that you are passionate about."
