   "comments": [
    "You learn Japanese!",
    "Good intro to Japanese",
    "Fast-paced and solid Japanese learning.",
    "Learned a lot of the Japanese language in a short amount of time",
    "Speak, write, communicate in Japanese while paying regards to customs and hierarchies.",
    "Furthered my language skills; especially with writing, reading comprehension, and kanji.",
    "I learned how to express myself more precisely with more complex grammar structures and learned vocabulary for practical situations.",
    "I not only expanded on my knowledge of Japanese vocabulary and grammar structures but also learned more about the Japanese culture through both unique facets of the language and the creativity of instruction.",
    "This course was very challenging for me. Besides learning new grammatical structures, vocabulary, and verb conjugations, I also learned how important perseverance is in college academics. Though time-consuming and a lot of extra effort seeking outside help, taking the necessary time to really learn content benefitted me immensely in the end.",
    "I have significantly improved my grammar knowledge and fluency in Japanese.",
    "I developed a good strategy to tackle this class that would let me get above average on each test. To start off, at the beginning of each lesson, make sure to know the vocab for the lesson. Use an app like Anki to let you get through it fast. I'll get to it later. To study for each test, I try to go to the review sessions so that I have an overview of that test's grammar. Then I review the vocab. I listen to the Quia Eavesdropping because the listening comprehension follows closely to it. Go through the Utilization hw again. Finally, do the CC's. Try to translate the English of the Utilization and CC's into Japanese. Although the sensee's say to write the translations down, I realized I didn't have that much time to do that, so I just said it outloud and hi-lighted what I got wrong on and reviewed those mistakes later on. Before the test or the morning of, I reviewed the vocab and listened to the Eavesdropping again. Now for vocab, I used an app called Anki. There's a downloadable file for JSL 1 and 2 which comes in handy. If you customize your flashcards, you can test the vocab for that lesson. This app seemed to drill the vocab for me much faster than the flashcard app provided by the sensee's.",
    "I learned a lot about Japanese language, culture, and grammar skills",
    "I learned lots of Japanese!"

   "comments": [
    "Good instructors",
    "More explanations on grammar points in class...",
    "Very effective at teaching useful parts of language; no real weaknesses",
    "Too much coursework,not very evenly distributed. Some weeks would be impossible to get through while others would be easy to manage",
    "You get what you put into the course and more. It requires commitment and dedication, as with any language. which was difficult to manage with other demanding classes, but taking advantage of office hours, review sessions, and the homework helped immensely. I would have liked to seen more times when the grammar structure was written in front of us on the board, since seeing it written, rather than only having the powerpoint or hearing it, works better with my learning style. I would also prefer to have the kanji quizzes\/tests at the beginning of class, as I was focused on not forgetting the kanji during class. I know that it was held at the end so that students would have more time, but maybe they could allow students to come to class early if they needed more time. Additionally, I would have preferred to not have as much homework the day before a kanji test.",
    "The class is very engaging and brilliant at fostering a close and supportive environment. The largest weakness of the course is likely just the difficulty of the material, which can't really be helped.",
    "I think the way the class was structured was excellent. The homework frontloaded the content and then was explained in detail in class. During class, there was also a lot of practice speaking with partners, which was really helpful for intonation and was a time where the professors could correct our grammatical structures.",
    "It was very useful to consistently receive feedback and require us to correct our homework. The Japanese clinics were also very helpful in practicing what we learned in class. The workload of the course was also adequate.",
    "It's a large workload, but very enjoyable. You want to study and do well in the class. It's excellent.",
    "No real weaknesses."
