    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Farrar is an expert in the subject and throughout the course of the semester you'll be exposed to important ideas related to issues surrounding the new media and journalism. It's a lot of work, and Prof Farrar is not an easy grader. Your grade consists of posts and comments on a class blog (you should look at the old class blog to get a sense of what it's like - highestmonkey.commons.yale.edu). It's a great class, and you'll get a lot out of it. If you're willing to put in the work, I highly recommend it.",
    "Take. This. Class.",
    "Absolutely - different way of learning and cool topic to discuss!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course basically discusses how the political landscape will change and has changed due to the advent of the new media (which includes social media, the blogosphere, etc.). I found the content to be extremely interesting and relevant, particularly since I took the course during the primary season.",
    "YES. easy class format, we have a midterm and write blog posts and talk about politics and the new media. what could be better?!",
    "PLSC277 covers really interesting subject matter that is relevant not only to the future of political discourse but also to an understanding of how the internet can be used in general. I would recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in new media, journalism, or information technology and politics."
