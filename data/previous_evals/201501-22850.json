    "This class is more of a collection of different topics in dance history than it is a cohesive survey of dance history. But it really opened my eyes about this important field. There is A LOT of reading and one short paper and one long paper.",
    "YES. It changed the way I viewed the writing of history as well as the field of dance study, and inspired me to consider the field as a possible research area I would want to go into in the future.",
    "Yes, but it is a very reading and discussion based class, so if one is not interested in such a class, do not take it.",
    "A wonderful small seminar if you're interested in dance and its history, but is by no means a breeze.",
    "I will recommend this course to other Yale student, especially some people who study art. It is a very unique art history class, people understand history not only by mind but also by body.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, though I'd make sure to note that it's definitely not an easy or light work load class (as some might expect from a dance studies class). Still, it gives a great survey of the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend it but be ready for quite some writing! It shouldn't be a daunting task though as the reading responses are just a reflection of what you understood in class."
