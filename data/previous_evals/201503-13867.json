    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I cannot recommend it more highly. American Silver uses the amazing collection of American Decorative Arts at the YUAG to teach the progression of American silver objects from colonial times to today. I learned so much about silver and decorative arts in general, got to hang out with an awesome professor, and held a teapot made by Paul Revere. There is really no downside to this class.",
    "American Silver was a great class, but very specific. Make sure you are totally committed to learning about silver, because there is so much, and it can get a little repetitive. However, Professor Gordon was great, and made class fun and interesting. Class was also held in the galleries, so we were surrounded by art of the same time period as the silver we were looking at. The YUAG has such an incredible silver collection, so it was amazing to become familiar with it, and to hold and look closely at some of the most important pieces of American silver. Looking through the collection online, we got to look at such a huge amount of silver; as an art history major, it was really interesting to look at the history of art through this lens.",
    "A great course on a fascinating subject. Would recommend to history of art majors and non history of art majors. However the latter may want to consider credit\/d'ing the class if one hasn't taken a history of art course before. Overall, it was a great course and Professor Gordon is fabulous!",
    "American Silver is a survey of American silver (what else?) from colonial to modern times. Most sessions are held in the gallery on Monday when it is closed, so you get to handle the objects on display. It's a very hands-on course that will really deepen your appreciation for the craftsmanship and beauty of silver. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun art history course that gets you out of the lecture hall. John Stuart Gordon is exciting and incredibly knowledgable about the collection (he's the American Decorative Arts Curator) and loves to share his passion with students. He's laid back but will push you to really delve into the collection."
