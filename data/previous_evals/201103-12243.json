    "Take it if you love to write and you love to read poetry. Take it.",
    "Yes, of course yes, absolutely take this class if you can get in. Gluck is honest and critical but also always encouraging and specific in her criticisms, so you always feel like you're learning and collaborating rather than being torn apart (the other students are the only people you'll have to worry about being cruel). You write a ton and read a ton and get a lot of great feedback on it, so take it!",
    "Yes, take this class if you get in, obviously!",
    "Writing of Verse with Louise Gluck is an awesome experience. Though we may sometimes not know exactly why Prof. Gluck says something, she's probably right. She's able to pinpoint the ideas behind your poems and cut out any excess. Highly recommended."
