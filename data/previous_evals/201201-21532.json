    "Your typical french language class, less focus on grammar then FREN 140, but same amount as FREN 150. I would recommend it if your grasp of the language is still shaky but 140 is too easy for you. TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR SKORUPAA!!!!!! SHE IS INCREDIBLE!!! She COOKS for you, and if your overwhelmed she'll work with you so you get a fair test, she is funny. Take it with professor Skorupa, definitely one of the best french professors at Yale.",
    "Definitely take French with Madame Skorupa! She is amazing--so nice and so accessible.",
    "I would recommend the class, but not to take credit\/d. There is too much work due everyday in class to get away with not doing it. But it's definitely not too hard to do. It's basically the same as 150, but I like the readings\/movies a little more in 151.",
    "I improved so much in both speaking and writing. My vocabulary also got substantially bigger. It can be a lot of work, but you really do get into the groove of things and it's not as much work as it initially feels. Also Prof Skorupa is the nicest person EVER. She brought us baked stuff and candy sometimes, and you can talk to her about anything in office hours. Class can be lots of fun while learning tons. Take it!",
    "Yes, it is a great class. Yale's french program is incredible.",
    "It's a good class with interesting readings and a solid grammar review. Definitely worth taking if you want to improve your French.",
    "Recommended!",
    "French 151 with Madame Skorupa was so much fun. She is an excellent professor who constantly goes out of her way to make sure that students are comfortable in class and enjoying the class. My French improved greatly over the course of this semester."
