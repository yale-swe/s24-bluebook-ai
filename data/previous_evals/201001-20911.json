   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent and current overview of political affairs and the structure of the European Union. We were very lucky to have Professor Wolfgang Plasa teach this course, given his extensive experience and directly applicable career route. His lectures were excellent. The readings were a bit dense and dry; so, it might help to have other alternative texts to read in preparation. I recommend this course highly, especially to students (both undergraduate and graduate) who would like to achieve a better understanding of the EU, EU law and structure.",
    "Yes, I absolutely can recommend this class. It helps to understand contemporary challenges of the European Union.",
    "A solid foundation with minimal theoretical involvement.",
    "A great insider's perspctive on the development of the EU and its role in the global order.",
    "The course covered a lot of topics on relevant to the EU.",
    "Good for anyone interested in the EU affairs and its repercussions for the international system.",
    "Yes, it would be useful to anyone who is aspiring to understand the EU"

    "This course is an excellent contribution to European Area Studies. I learned a tremendous amount about the European Union, it's development, as well as current issues. It is great for students who are in IR and area studies; also, it is very good for students who plan to work abroad and\/or with the government.",
    "This course prepared me for this summer's internship in Germany, and provided a framework for understanding the institutional foundations for policy- making and evaluation."
