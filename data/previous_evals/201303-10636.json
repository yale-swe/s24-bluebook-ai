    "This course involves great texts of ancient Chinese philosophers which I think are important to read. I feel that the texts actually increased my understanding of myself and my environment, which I truly appreciated. The course has one midterm, one paper, and one final. Professor Chin gives lectures on the readings and there is a section that meets once a week outside of the course. It was mostly TA-run (with the TA grading papers and tests and running section), with Professor Chin almost exclusively giving lectures, although both the TA and professor are excellent.In the end, I don't think it was worth it to take the course to read the texts; it would have been better just to read them in my spare time (which I somewhat ended up doing since I was continually behind because there was never much of an incentive to be on top of the readings). However, I do feel that I gained an important understanding of Chinese culture, for which I am grateful, but I don't think I gained as much out of this course as I could have.",
    "Good overview of major works in the Chinese philosophical tradition. Professor Chin is a good lecturer and helps make a potentially dull topic interesting. However, unless you have a genuine interest in the subject matter, you most likely won't end up getting much out of this course.",
    "Hist 314 is not a history class, it is a philosophy class with minimal historical context thrown in. If you want to learn about Chinese history, then don't take this class.If you want to learn about Chinese philosophy, then this isn't a bad option, but I feel like there are better options out there.",
    "It is hard for me to say, not having heard much about the other new ancient China classes that were being offered last semester. I would say definitely shop it, but be aware that you might like a discussion format better.",
    "Yes, take it! It is a wonderful exposition to some of the major classics of ancient Chinese philosophy, covering the Confucian, Taoist, Mohist, and Legalist texts. The reading assignments were manageable, the midterm was fair, the term paper was a lot of fun, but the final was quite challenging. I don't think you need any background knowledge in ancient Chinese history to do well in the course, but a rudimentary grasp of the Chinese language could only help. Be sure to take good notes in Prof. Chin's lectures--some might find her soft-spoken, ruminatory lecturing style a bit difficult to follow, but if you manage to stay on track, you would get a lot out of classes. I really hope that Mark Baker continues to lead the discussion sections for this course; he was one of the things that made this class so enjoyable.",
    "It is a good overview ofancient Chinese history and philosophy, especially if you want to get a better sense of the different \"schools\" of thought - Confucianism, Daoism, Legalism, etc. The readings can be somewhat challenging and on the longer side, but they are definitely very interesting. Professor Chin's lectures are informative, but you can get easily distracted if you are not motivated. I would suggest this class to those who are serious about learning more about ancient China, as you can take a lot from the course if you are willing to put in the effort."
