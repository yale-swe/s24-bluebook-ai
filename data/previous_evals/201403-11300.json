    "It is a class on how to conduct proper research. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in conducting social science research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone in the social sciences.",
    "I recommend this course because it gives a great opportunity to learn research methods for social science and their logic. It is rare but essential to start own research. The course realized me the reason why I conduct research in a certain procedure. Thus, I recommend this course especially for graduate students who have researched only by own heuristics."

    "The knwoledge from this course helps to build my research design approriately; that must imporve my research quality. I also understood careful points to read papers and make good critiques. Thanks to this course, I could learn a lot from other papers. I think this knowledge also help to improve the quality of my dessertation."
