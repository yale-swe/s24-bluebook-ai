   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course, and I would summarize it as a seminar providing a survey of various theories and approaches to the study of ancient history. Far from merely teaching students about particular theories, this seminar encourages students to evaluate various theories and methodological approaches in order to provide them with a better understanding of the discipline as a whole.",
    "Classics 851 is a discussion of the Ancient Economy using various historical techniques such as archaeology, papyrology, GIS, linguistic theory, social sciences, alongside an examination of ancient primary sources. I'd recommend only if the individual had an interest in studying ancient economic models.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is one of those classes you don't realize is vital to take until you take it. I would summarize History 515 as an examination of the past, present, and future of the discipline of Ancient History. It is a conversation about what makes a good historian and what are the responsibilities of historians.",
    "This course is a very good initiation to the challenges of doing ancient history today. Tje emphasis is on social and economic history, which is one of the most thriving fields in ancient history."

    "The methods and concepts that I learned from this course will stick with me for the rest of my life and will certainly prove directly relevant to all research projects that I undertake from here on out.",
    "I believe this is a course that should be required for any Classics or Ancient History student at Yale. It is truly a class that examines how to do history and be a good historian. How can you begin a dissertation without first understanding these things?",
    "This course has helped me broaden my horizons and sharpen my views on certains aspects of ancient history. It gave me much food for thought. My general perspective has been refined, my understanding of the social scientist point of view, improved."
