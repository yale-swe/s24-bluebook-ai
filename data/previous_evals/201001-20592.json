   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was rigorous, rewarding, enjoyable, and well-taught.",
    "Marxist theory is a very interesting and relevant topic, I definitely feel that students should be familiar with the texts that were set. So I would definitely recommend this course; however, it would be very difficult for those not yet familiar with any Marxist theory. It is best suited to those who would have already read some of the works, otherwise the workload and volume of things to understand would be too overwhelming. I would advise students to obtain the reading lists in advance and get started before the course begins, as it is impossible to keep up intellectually during the semester.",
    "It is probably best for someone who has some idea of the history of Marxism but who is interested in seeing how specific problematics play out, although some absolutely essential material (Brumaire, Lukacs) is covered as well. It is also excellent at putting figures who are neglected or marginal either because of their heterodox politics or because of their areas of expertise--I'm thinking of Sartre and Volosinov in particular--within the main lines of Marxism.",
    "Take this class. You will not regret it \u0097 any class with Prof. MacKay is a joy! Discussion is fruitful and there is a definite sense of intellectual community created..."

   "comments": [
    "The course gave me a brief, somewhat disparate overview of Marxist theory, but not a deep understanding. It did not contribute to my dissertation research in any way, but fulfilled one of the theory requirements of the program.",
    "Marxist theory will be an important component of my own methodology; this class therefore was of great help.",
    "The course deepened and rounded my knowledge of literary theoryand the Marxist tradition very considerably indeed."
