    "Interesting course, challenging but fair if you come to lecture and spend time reviewing the material. I would recommend it.",
    "Some self studying is required. Yes, because it is a great opportunity to learn about spectroscopy in detail.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to every graduate students as long as the research is related. This also applies to the other two related courses (MoRad I, and experimentation in chemistry - also by Prof.Johnson).",
    "Take it!",
    "This class provides an introductory examination of traditional spectroscopy from a quantum mechanical background. If you can keep up with the, at times, unorganized small, highly interactive lectures, you will learn a lot from this class. The homework is useful and the computational assignments were very satisfying when perfected. Would recommend to others."

    "Although I am not going to look into the details of spectroscopy for my research, these background\/advanced knowledge are especially important to avoid pitfalls when using any related tools."
