   "comments": [
    "Absolutely tremendous seminar. Wendy Lee is wonderful and brilliant, and the novels are (while not easy reads!) absolute monuments to the form. Lee expertly combines accessibility with scholarship to create a class that is both a ton of fun and highly substantive.",
    "Engl 235 works to chart the birth of the novel as a form. Although this history was interesting, most of the reading was dry and longgg. Wendy Lee is kind and smart and tries to be understanding. Discussion was wonderful (and focused on surprisingly modern issues, i.e. consent), books were fairly terrible to read, although important and somewhat entertaining.Take British Novel for a pre-1800s prose course.",
    "Take it. There is a lot of reading, but Wendy Lee is such a fabulous teacher that she makes it all worth it. I had some of my best seminar discussions at Yale in this class.",
    "18th Century British novel represents a very specific niche of semi-difficult reading and the load is heavy. There is not a lot of work but attendance is mandatory and each week there's about 300-350 pages of reading. Definitely a great class worth taking, even if just for Wendy Lee, but definitely avoid if epistolary novels are not your things",
    "Yesyesyes take it you won't regret it.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student. Professor Lee makes an often intimidating subject very approachable, and her light-hearted nature always made class something to look forward to. I feel like reading these texts is incredibly important in terms of understanding the development of the novel, and I am very glad to have had the opportunity to engage with them. That being said, there is A LOT of reading. Most of these books are over 500 pages. Yes, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re novels, but you have to be prepared to read 150-200 pages per class. Also, Professor Lee demands a very high level of writing from students, something that is obviously challenging, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to put the work in will make you a better writer and thinker.",
    "This was a really interesting class that covered the development of the novel through the 18th century. Covered a lot of questions of female consent and interiority, social politics, etc. It's heavily discussion-based, and the discussions were usually lively and really interesting. The reading was heavy and sometimes a HUGE struggle--Clarissa and Tom Jones are the two longest novels in English literature, so don't take this class with other reading (especially novel-heavy) classes. That said, it's pretty entertaining reading, so although long and dense, it's still fun.",
    "The 18th Century British Novel is a good class taught by a great teacher. If you already like novels of that period, then absolutely go for it. If you're a bit more hesitant to read some long epistolary novels that can tend toward the boring, do your research before signing on; but know that even if you don't end up loving the material, the class can still be a good experience simply because Professor Lee is so great. And, you may actually end up liking the reading! I did.",
    "The material is difficult at times (and long), but Professor Lee is incredibly understanding about the work load and will make the 18th-Century requirement not only bearable but more than worthwhile.",
    "thousands of pages of reading on British white female \"virtue.\" Take it if you need a pre-1800 and are tired of the usual Shakespeare\/Chaucer offerings.",
    "It's a great course, but ONLY if you're interested in the eighteenth century british novel. You will be doing a TON of reading -- a lot of which is pretty dense and dry -- so really make sure you like the subject material. That said, class discussions were never boring.",
    "great class for English majors. If, like me, you aren't, the workload will definitely take effort to keep up with. On the other hand, you will learn so so so much. Even if you're not interested in the subject matter, give this course a try.",
    "TAKE THIS. Best class ever. Wendy Lee is a genius and awesome and the overall best. The texts are actually not bad at all even though there's a ton of reading. I strongly recommend this class, it's amazing in every way."
