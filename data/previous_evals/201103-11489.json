    "I would recommend it. The topic may not sound that fascinating but you learn a lot of important things about the Middle East and it's really interesting over all.",
    "If you are looking for an easy Econ Seminar take it. Grading consisted of an article presentation, class participation, and a final paper.",
    "Economic History of the Middle East is a course mainly about the Ottoman Empire (although some other parts are discussed) from the 18th century through the mid 20th century. In each class, you will cover a different economic topic. The class is not too much work: you are required to give a presentation on the paper and you have to write a final paper. The final paper is broken down into stages, so that it is very manageable.I would say take this course: if you are interested in learning about the economic history of the Ottoman Empire, if you are looking for an easier economic seminar, or if you are looking for a good professor. In fact, Professor Agir is a great professor: she does a fantastic job of guiding class discussion and she does a great job of giving feedback on the paper. Do not take this course hoping to learn about the Middle East of the last 50 years (unless the syllabus is changed)My only complaint is that many students did not read for class, and so discussion was slightly stagnant. That was a class-specific thing, and not Professor Agir's fault.",
    "Definitely. It was engaging, fair, and taught by a great professor."
