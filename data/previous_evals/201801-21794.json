    "I learned a lot about Europe post 1914",
    "I learned about the European Union, its history and its interaction with neighboring countries and regions.",
    "I learned about the political, economic and foreign affairs of Europe from 1914 to the present.",
    "Writing and learning history",
    "Taking \"The New Europe,\" one will develop a deeper understanding of the rapport between European nations, the history of continental integration, the institutions of the EU, and current problems facing Europe.",
    "A valuable course that teaches the history underpinning modern Europe. This course also gives students a better understanding of where Europe is heading in the future and the crises challenging European integration today.",
    "I developed the ability to analyze historical and political events in Europe with a critical lense.",
    "I learned a ton about the EU. It's an institution that does far more and far different things than you might expect. I thought this course was valuable to my understanding of the world.",
    "Learned a lot about formation of current Europe, and the development of the European Union",
    "A background and further understanding of the history throughout Europe",
    "A lot about the history of new Europe",
    "I learned a great deal about how the EU progressed after World War2. I finally understood the Crimean crisis",
    "I've gained a much better understanding of recent European historical events, like Brexit and the Debt crisis, while also viewing them in the lens of the recent European world.",
    "I gained an insight into not only the events of modern European history, but also how they happened and what they mean for the future.",
    "As European, I was very interested in the topics of the course. It was amazing to get to know all the background information about current discussions in Europe. It was also delightful to discuss those issues with Americans during the section and to see their view on the EU.",
    "You learn the interactions between the European states and the current problems facing the EU.",
    "Deeper understanding of Europe's recent history and the most pressing issues that need to be dealt with moving forward.",
    "I learned a gargantuan amount about 20th and 21st European history in this course. The New Europe and Professor Cameron take the word \"comprehensive\" to a new level - Professor Cameron effectively exhaustively covers all major political and diplomatic developments in Europe since 1914, a very impressive feat.",
    "I learned about the history of Europe post WWI and the events that have led up to the EU and how the EU works."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Course is really interesting but the material can be really dense at times",
    "It is a good course.",
    "More spice to the slides, so it is not as dull",
    "More engagement",
    "Great content",
    "I found the optional section to be particularly helpful and the professor David Cameron earnestly dedicated to the course. Professor Cameron published all the slides so even if the class moved quickly, you could return to his detailed notes later. Further, the readings were quick and interesting. I believe the class suffered from poor attendance but the material was impressive.",
    "The topics covered in this course are extremely interesting, ensuring the course's popularity. However, the organization could be improved and Professor Cameron's lectures can be dry at times. Slides are loaded with information - sometimes too much - and many students leave this class losing the forest for the trees. I wish this course focused more broad themes and takeaways rather than minute details.",
    "Strength was interesting material and weakness was the boring lectures given by the professor",
    "Strength: comprehensive Weakness: not compelling",
    "I think the ability to select whether or not you want to be in a section is perfect. Personally, I learn plenty in the lectures and my grade often takes a hit from participation, so this class was perfect.",
    "Could have the class be more engaged",
    "I could have had better lecture attendence but I attended section religiously",
    "The lectures are dry, and I think there could be more communication with the students.",
    "This course does a great job of connecting today's events to the problems of yesterday and how they are still relevant and manifest themselves in different ways today.",
    "A strength of this course is definitely the amount of information Professor Cameron is presenting in lecture. His knowledge about Europe is remarkable and outstanding. However, his engagement with the students during lecture could be improved.",
    "Interesting material but the slides can get a little technical to follow at times.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics, low workload, passionate lecturer\/TF Weaknesses: Slides text-heavy, lectures slightly dry at times",
    "The main strength of this course is its content, which is both fascinating and important. The supplementary books and book chapters were also quite interesting. The course regrettably has some weaknesses as well, however, associated with Professor Cameron, which I will discuss later."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if they are interested in the topic",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they want to learn more about the European Union.",
    "Sure. Great course",
    "I would take this course if you are interested in 20th century European politics as well as getting up to date on global challenges centered in Europe (such as Brexit, the refugee crisis, Ukraine, CSDP, Euro Debt Crisis). The grades are 1\/3 midterm, 2\/3 final, so the class is light for much of the semester, but a grind at the end of the term.",
    "Yes definitely! If youre looking for a good understanding of European integration and the EU, this course is excellent. A great mix of history and contemporary events of which everyone should be aware.",
    "If you are truly interested in the subject material, then this course is a decent choice. However, the amount of detail in each lecture makes this course difficult for students who don't have a decent amount of background in European history or politics, even though no prerequisites are required.",
    "Absolutely, this was one of my favorite course as all the lessons were relevant to the political environment of today and all the ideas were easy to understand and write about.",
    "Yes. If you enjoy history and want an in-depth look into European history, this class is for you.",
    "Yes great way to learn about Europe with minimal workload",
    "Definitely, it was well structured and interesting.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in recent European history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another Yalie as interesting topics such as Brexit give us a better insight into the topics of debate currently being dealt with today.",
    "Yes, if he's interested in the history of the new Europe and would like to know the challenges the European Union had to fight and is tackling right now.",
    "Definitely recommend to someone who wishes to be well versed in European Politics.",
    "Yes I would - interesting topics and low workload. Couldn't ask for more!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in 20th century European history or modern Europe. However, the amount of material covered in the course is daunting, so I would not recommend the course to anyone who's not dedicated to studying these periods in detail.",
    "Yes, I found it very interesting to learn about European politics that I did not have much knowledge about."
