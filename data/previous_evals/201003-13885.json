    "IF YOU ARE A NATIVE SPEAKER WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO READ OR WRITE THIS IS PERFECT",
    "If you are able to speak Hindi relatively well (enough to engage in basic dialogue), I'd recommend this class as you'll learn to read\/write and your vocabulary will improve.",
    "You will learn a lot throughout the course if you already kinda have a grasp on the Hindi language. I, for one, learned to read and write from point zero to a somewhat analytical reader of poetry and prose in hindi. The class is a lot of fun as well, it's a small sized course, and you'll often end up having dinners together. There's always plenty of outside activities to do. Also, Swapnaji is a wonderful professor. She will go out of her way to help you from her own time if you need it. She cares for her students, and she's quite an interesting individual herself. She's very artistic, and may even sing if you in class when things get going. If you want to drastically improve your hindi while still having a wonderful time, I cannot recommend this class strongly enough for you.",
    "take it, you will learn the script quick",
    "I would recommend it if you are just trying to brush up on your Hindi skills, but not if you are trying to learn grammar, etc. really systematically.",
    "Yes I would. Important opportunity to practice my hindi and learn to write."
