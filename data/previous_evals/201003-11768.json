   "comments": [
    "I took it because I had too, but do feel like i am slowly learning to be able to speak Spanish.",
    "Take it with Barbara! seriously, do absolutely everything you can to get into her class. Spanish L3 will be more or less the same with whoever you take it with content wise, but she makes it bearable, and sometimes even fun (seriously). She is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met, so if you can get in, definitely take it with her..",
    "I would recommend spanish 130 to a student who wants to learn spanish. It is a fast paced class, but you learn a lot in only a semester.",
    "Basically, it's an intermediate Spanish class. It's easy if you know it, not hard at all if you don't. If you're really keen on the language try to place out of it and into L5, but honestly it's not that bad.",
    "Take this class with barbara safille. shes the best. she wakes you up in the morning and makes this potentially super boring class fun.",
    "If you are taking Spanish 130, you are probably taking it to fulfill your language requirement. If you are placed into the class as I was, obviously you do not really have a choice but to take it. The only unfortunate part is that there is homework every day and sometimes the homework seems meaningless. If you are a native speaker, I might try to take that class because it does not meet every day. Overall, this is an easier course that is enjoyable to take.",
    "Only take this painful class if you have to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "Barbara is a great choice for this course. It's not too hard if you do the readings and participate in class and go to class and do the homework on time. I liked refreshing my high school Spanish.",
    "It's a language course at Yale. They're all the same. Pick Barbara Safille if you're going to take it. She's great.",
    "It's largely a review of L2 but reinforces all of that material in addition to introducing new vocabulary and a little new grammar.",
    "It is a good continuation of L1\/L2 because you start to use the skills in conversation instead of just learning grammar.",
    "This Spanish class was a good class, but it was fairly easy. It is similar to a high school course and covers the same topics. This class basically reviews most of the grammar and tenses of Spanish (similar to level 2). Barbara Safille was a great professor and I recommend taking the class with her. She is very engaging and extremely helpful.",
    "Take it if you have the time to."
