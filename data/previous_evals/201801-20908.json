    "This class taught me a lot about evoking music and writing about it to someone who has never heard it before. It also taught me a lot about journalist style writing.",
    "I learned how to evoke music with words, how to structure a musician profile, and how to read carefully for craft.",
    "From this class, I learned how to analyze and read journalistic and academic papers written about music and the music industry. From analysis and class discussion, I learned how to write journalistic articles and academic papers on music. I learned how to engage with these pieces with my class, workshop each others writing, and have an enjoyable creative engagement with music criticism and writing.",
    "I learned to think critically about music and writings on the subject. This meant considering some works that I see everyday (reviews, profiles, etc.) in a new light, or looking at types of works I'm much less familiar with (academic works, e.g.). It was a great way to open myself up to thinking more about music beyond something that I listen to. It also was a through-and-through english class, so I definitely learned to write better.",
    "I learned how to write about popular music in a seemingly New Journalism style through projects like profiles, reviews, and academic papers.",
    "I learned how to evoke music with words, discuss the oeuvre of popular musicians, and to analyze journalistic writing for specific rhetorical devices.",
    "Journalistic writing, how to evoke sounds and describe abstract things like music in articulate terms"

   "comments": [
    "This class is really good because you read so many cool papers and listen to awesome music. The class has four papers with workshops and that is really helpful for developing the paper. The class was difficult as journalistic writing was new to me and I really tried to work on it, but that's more of a me problem I guess.",
    "The chance to write about one thingmusicfor the whole semester was deeply valuable. It improved my skills as a writer and made me a deeper listener about an art form that plays such a huge role in my life.",
    "Everything about this course is a strength. Professor Sextons weekly musical writing assignments, the readings assigned, the papers wrote and his editing on our papers, were all super incredible. Not to mention that the class environment was super friendly and enjoyable. One thing that could be improved about this course is that Professor Sexton could give a bit of a warning in advance in class about the readings getting much longer at one point in the course. At one point, we go from reading articles to books. I got used to checking the syllabus only a day or two before class because the readings were short, but when they got longer I had a hard time keeping up. That advance warning could help, as a result. Another thing is, I wish there were a bit more room at times to talk about the kind of music we like and connect the readings to our own thoughts and theories about the music industry. Sometimes, we spent the whole class writing about just the readings (which makes sense, and is very fun) but it would have been better to be able to have the bigger discussions about music\/industry\/pop culture as a whole.",
    "This was a great class! It was led wonderfully and the readings were always exciting. I would say sometimes the structure, because of how many units we were trying to get through, felt a little uneven. That's my only note for improvement.",
    "The course was very helpful for letting students pick up writing techniques from pieces we read. I also thought we were given a lot of opportunity to reflect on the content of the articles we read as well as their structure. One improvement I would make is to spend more time on the novel-length books we read, since we went through them at the same pace we used for newspaper articles and journalistic pieces.",
    "The strengths of this course are its fascinating readings, weekly in-class listening, and knowledgeable professor (Prof. Sexton). One weakness of this course is the primary focus of the readings on music from the last 30-40 years, which limits the extent to which class discussions explore all of \"popular music,\" although blues and jazz are explored in one week of readings. An improvement that could be made is the inclusion of an optional fifth essay of any topic or writing style.",
    "AMAZING COURSE. Very very engaging and extremely fun. I lived every second of it and it went soo fast"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this another student, who has some inclination and experience with journalistic and personal writing. The essay topics are fantastic but really hard. This class makes you think about music in a way you hadn't before and introduces you to some new cool music.",
    "Yes! Prof. Sexton gives the best, most pragmatic writing advice anywhere. You will become a better writer and you will enjoy music more.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially one who is musically inclined in any way (not that they are good at producing music, but just enjoy listening or engaging with it in any way). This course allows you to engage with whatever kind of music you like in such a valuable and exciting way. Also getting to know Professor Sexton is an amazing part of taking this class as well!",
    "Definitely! A great class if you love music and want to be able to write about it or think more about it--not so much the technicalities, but the context surrounding it and how we listen to it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student passionate about music, regardless of music training or theoretical background.",
    "I would without hesitation recommend this course to every Yale student even mildly interested in popular music regardless of his\/her musical training or background. Being able to evoke music in writing is a valuable skill and the writing abilities I developed in this course have improved my writing in general.",
    "YES YES YES YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. One of my most favorite at Yale and Professor Sexton is simply lovely and an amazing discussion facilitator."
