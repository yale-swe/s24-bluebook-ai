   "comments": [
    "I would if the subject interests you.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Wood is very amusing and you will learn a lot about language and grammar you didn't know before.",
    "Intro Ling was a pretty broad overview of linguistics; since the field is so broad\/diverse, you can't really spend more than two weeks on any of the individual topics, which is too bad. Jim was a solid professor and I enjoyed the class... pretty stress-free also. Three quizzes that were only ~30 mins long and the final wasn't even 90 mins.",
    "I took Intro. Ling with Professor Wood, who was a very worthwhile, entertaining teacher for a broad class that requires a lot of widespread knowledge to teach. I would strongly recommend this class to anyone - I am of the opinion that linguistics is the one science that everyone likes to posture on and talk about like they know up and down; this course will definitely pretty quickly blow those ideas out of the water and reveal language to be a deep, complex, intricate science instead of what people perceive it to be.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in linguistics or CogSci, or if you are looking for an easy social science credit. The material is very interesting, and there is not a ton of work.",
    "Amazing class! Definitely take this if you're at all interested in languages, communication, social sciences, it's a really fascinating and important field of study that not enough people are learning about. You will come out of this class a better person--you will understand that language is extremely flexible and that it is only detrimental to say there is a right or wrong, you will understand why people have the habits and speech patterns they do, and it's a really chill, fair workload and very fair testing. I really loved this class.",
    "The class provides a nice introduction to linguistics and covers a wide variety of topics. I will definitely recommend the class for someone who wants to get a taste of the subject.",
    "As a STEM major who is interested in language but is not familiar with linguistics, I can definitely recommend LING 110 with Prof. Jim Wood. First, the basics: the course covers the basics of many major areas in linguistics: syntax, morphology, phonology, and a little bit of semantics. We had a really fascinating unit on sign language, too. The problem sets took me about 5 hours every week, which for me is a bit less than an average course load. If you know LaTeX, your problem sets will be very easy to write. Anyway, even though it took Jim quite a few lectures to really warm up and to find his footing as a lecturer, the class was always quite interesting. Jim almost always brings really fascinating examples from life into lecture that are amusing and thought-provoking. Lecture is worth going to. I also really appreciated that Jim really cares about his subject and his students. He's very approachable. The problem sets are not terribly difficult, but you do have to pay attention to not make lots of little mistakes that can add up. Great class, especially if you're interested in language. Lots of really cool information and not a terrible amount of work. A fantastic 5th credit if you want to put in the hours to learn the material.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the field of linguistics and covers a wide range of topics: morphology, syntax, phonetics, phonology, historical linguistics, dialect variation, sign language, semantics, pragmatics. This also means that you won't have the chance to really go in-depth with any one topic (but that's what higher-level linguistic courses are for anyway). The workload (about 1 pset a week) and 3 quizzes are pretty fair. Overall, I would recommend this course if you're curious about linguistics and are looking to gain exposure to the field.",
    "It's worth taking if you think you might be interested in linguistics. It's cool content and it makes you think about language differently.",
    "It's an easy SO that also happens to teach you about the basics of human language. You should probably take it if you have even the slightest level of interest in the study of language.",
    "Intro to Linguistics is a fair course. The homework depends on both the lectures and the readings, and the tests draws almost directly from the homework. There are weekly homeworks, section, and three tests. Professor Wood taught this course for the first time, and I did not find him to be a particularly interesting or helpful professor. But if you want to get the basics of linguistics, I suppose it would be a fine course to take.",
    "I am so psyched about linguistics now! Before this class I never really knew much of what the field was about, but now I am familiar with all the larger disciplines within the field and can talk intelligently about any of them. One of my favorite parts of the course is all the interesting examples from English, my own language, of various linguistic phenomena that illustrate all the complexity going on. This class is applicable to all humans because all humans use language, and I think the world would be a much better and more interesting place if everyone understood a little linguistics. I'll definitely be back around in the department!",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you are not interested in linguistics (if you're not considering it for a major). The format of the class when I took it was not fascinating and as it's a lecture it's impersonal.",
    "This class is a good introduction to linguistics but does not deal with any of the topics in great complexity, and as such is not a very stressful and work intensive class. It does, however, require a large breadth of knowledge. The problem sets and quizzes are fairly graded and good learning tools and should not be a great source of stress. The classes main drawbacks are that some of the work can become tedious during the Historical Linguistics unit, but this is simply the nature of the subject. For anyone who wishes to pursue any of the many fields that comprise linguistics, this class is completely necessary.",
    "This was a great class, and I think everyone should take it at some time while they are at Yale. It helps you to understand so many things that we do every day without thinking about it and gives you a whole new appreciation for language and the human brain.",
    "Great course. Fair grading, interesting topic and Professor Wood and the TAs were always very helpful. I genuinely felt like Professor Wood payed attention and cared about the students in the class, which is not common for Yale classes (so that was a nice change). The pace and size of the class were perfect and allowed for collaboration in class which was so helpful in understanding and really mastering some of the required techniques. The class has weekly psets that are not too demanding but require a fair amount of time to complete. 3 quizzes that were all fair. The final exam was much harder than expected and seemed to ask questions about obscure facts that were not really important or essential for the main purpose of the class. So that was frustrating.",
    "If you are interested then good intro",
    "If you have any interest in language, you definitely want to take this class. It's a very manageable course, and Professor Wood is amazing and helpful."
