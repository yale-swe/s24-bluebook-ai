    "Some conceptual material wasn't very well explained, particularly the bioenergy section. It would be nice to have a textbook or non-journal reading to supplement.",
    "There is wide range of knowledge that is interesting.",
    "I enjoyed the way the course was taught and both Jordan and Bridget were very helpful, but I sometimes felt like not diving into a deeper background when using equations confused me and I didn't know how to use them correctly",
    "Strengths: Very interesting material. Enjoyed a lot. Weaknesses: Did not like having the turn back and forth to see ppt slides",
    "The professor explained the concepts very well, and I did not have much difficulty following his teaching style and pace. The one exception was the final 3-4 lectures, where I felt it was a bit more rushed than usual.",
    "Have example problems for exams. Be slightly more clear in class what all the formulas are for, by doing a few more example problems in class.",
    "The strengths were engaging lecturer, good order for course topics, and fair exams. The course could be improved with more organized and detailed course slides. Also, the homework assignments had some mistakes which should be corrected for next year."

    "Yes, but warn students of the large workload.",
    "Yes, I think it was an interesting class and one beneficial to individuals who want to work in water treatment; Jordan was also a great professor to have and made class enjoyable",
    "Yes, because material was very interesting and useful for a lot of fields in environmental engineering",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, it is a helpful course for environmental engineering but it would have been more helpful to have more information about microbes and how we study them instead of just modeling growth and such.",
    "Yes, I believe the topics are very important to understand and the course is taught in a way they can be learned."
