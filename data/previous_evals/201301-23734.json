    "I would definitely take it",
    "THIS IS A HAPPIYL BACTERIAL GUT CLASS AND THE GUT SHOULD BE EMBRACED WHOLEHEARTEDLY",
    "great class especially for QR",
    "really really good course interesting material and an amazing gut. i am an idiot when it comes to math but this was completely digestible and reasonable. 5 psets and a creative project and submitting two questions is pretty much it. seriously, if you need a qr and you're not good at math you NEED to take this course.",
    "Interesting topic and way to think. It is an easy class in terms of workload and if you like working with other people, then the final presentation is nice.",
    "Take it. A good introduction to a new way of looking at the world: networks. It was interesting seeing how networks played into basically everything. The course does not have a heavy workload at all, which could be a pro or con depending on whether you need that expectation to keep up with the material. However, the final project was definitely a strong plus for the course because it allowed the student to literally pursue whatever his or her interest was and find how it related to networks.",
    "This is a great class if you're not a \"mathy\" person. It was more of a conceptual math or logic class. You learn new ways of interpreting and presenting information without relying on much calculus or algebra. It's not that much work but you definitely learn a lot.I highly recommend it for a humanities major looking for a QR that won't butcher their GPA.",
    "Definitely recommended. Excellent instruction combined with a relaxed atmosphere that enables you to delve deeper into your specific interests. A Yale gem.",
    "This course was a great way for non-science majors to get a QR credit, as it used quantitive methods in an understandable way and related them to other topics that may be of more interest to these students - terrorist networks, social networks, networks in the arts industry, etc. Super easy, only 5 easy problem sets and one group presentation!",
    "Definitely recommend to people who aren't great at math",
    "I recommend for someone not great at math. Problem sets can be confusing but TAs are very helpful",
    "I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who is not very strong in math",
    "Great course for the non-math type",
    "Interesting introduction to graph and game theory. Most manageable qr I've taken at Yale. Helpful professor and TFs. Homework doable and interesting. Final presentation instead of exam. Take it, it's great!",
    "A great class for a non-mathmaitcal student. If you need an interesting yet straightforward QR, this is the class!",
    "Very easy math credit",
    "Very straight forward class. None of the math is toodifficult, and only really touches on some game theory, and probability. Low workload, with no exams but a substantial project at the end.",
    "As long as you know basic math, the class will be easy enough to follow. After that, if you're genuinely interested in mathematical studies, it wholly depends on you to get much out of it. But as a non math major student, I didn't learn that much about math in general. But definitely interesting.",
    "Yes absolutely recommend it! I am no good at math so this class was fantastic",
    "Take it if you need an easy qr and do not hope to learn anything"
