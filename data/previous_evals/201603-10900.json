   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of content about Earth science and processes. Aside from that, it's a pretty standard science course.",
    "Inter-disciplinary knowledge and more about the Earth's processes and an appreciation for really long timescales. I feel like I am able to use the knowledge to make sense of real-world issues like sensationalist news reporting, global warming, fracking etc. It has also given me an appreciation for how fascinating the world is.",
    "I learned how old, old is. And I allegedly learned how to use Google Earth.",
    "I learned how to look at a landscape and extract geological features.",
    "I learned the basics of how the earth works. I gained a new perspective on time, and how events occur on large timescales and small timescales.",
    "This class gave a good general overview of several different aspects of geology, from the theoretical to the practical.",
    "I improved upon my notetaking skills and learned a bit more about basic geologic concepts.",
    "I learned so much about geology! This course was so much more than I was expecting, especially as a humanities-type person taking it for an Sc credit. I learned everything from basic planet structure to the elements and effects of climate change. So fantastic.",
    "I learned a lot more about geology and earth processes that I had previously only touched upon in other environmental science classes. We covered a lot of topics and got a really broad view of the discipline. The biggest takeaway for me was learning to think about these processes on huge timescales and see the history of the earth as encompassing both many millions of millennia and also fractions of a second.",
    "I learned a very wide variety of information on how the Earth works. As the course title suggests, content focused heavily on the ever changing nature of the planet, and how various systems were kept in balance and interacted with each other. I think this method of looking at the Earth system is very helpful in gaining a more intuitive sense of how the Earth works.",
    "This is a great introductory geology class. It is a great course for all students, whether they have an interest in studying geology or not. It provided a different way to see the Earth and structures that exist.",
    "I learned some of the basic information about the natural world around me and the forces that brought it to its current state.",
    "This was a great introductory course. I learned a lot about the Earth and the timescales geologists use to consider it, and the material felt applicable to today\/ other disciplines\/ environmental change and energy studies.",
    "I learned about earth's processes and explanations for things we observe in the natural world. I developed insight into the history of earth and life.",
    "I learned so much in this course! I felt like Dave Evans did an amazing job covering a wide array of geologic processes, and I left feeling like I had learned a lot about tectonics, glaciation, Malankovich cycles, earth history... the list could go on. I also learned a lot about how to take advantage of what Google Earth has to offer!",
    "Definitely demands spatial logic and the capacity to think conceptually, so that you can see the interrelations between systems as opposed to simply understanding the rules of systems in isolation.",
    "A basic understanding of a wide variety of geological principles",
    "General understanding of geologic concepts, how to look at geologic time, and how different environmental topics relate.",
    "I learned about geological processes and their significance. Some skills I acquired from this course are understanding of geological terms and maps. The discussions of climate of human effects on the earth are important topics that I will take away from the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: lecture format was nice because they were relatively short and compact with good information, nice spread of topics, course never felt too rushed Weaknesses: the TEAL classroom (which could really be a strength if more activities were planned specifically around the room's tech), the relation between the text and lectures",
    "Strong intro geology course, manageable workload. Sometimes I did not feel the classwork had prepared me for the problem sets, though.",
    "I really enjoyed the team aspect of the Dynne Cup - I was able to make friends in class and the competitiveness helped to motivate me to work hard for the quizzes. I also think Prof Evans makes learning fun and interesting by making us play simulation games, bringing in rock samples, showing us pictures of geological sites.This was a fun class. A weakness is the reading - I find it very dense (very detailed, but I feel it is too much) and I sometimes fall asleep, or get bogged down in the details.",
    "This course is interesting, but the information is presented in a very dry way and the lectures were very unclear.",
    "This course is the perfect balance of engaging and entertaining. The powerpoints were always beautiful and helpful to look at, and classes were all so stimulating.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is that it covers a broad range of topics, allowing students to figure out what specific topics they enjoy studying. Furthermore, I enjoyed the \"team\" set-up and the dyne cup. The team aspect and dyne cup made the course light-hearted and more enjoyable. A weakness of the course is the evaluation. The midterms and final questions were a little vague, making it hard to figure out what answer the professor was looking for. To solve this issue, tests could have more specific questions or more variety in format (not just multiple choice and free response). In addition, it seemed like test-prep was just a lot of memorization and the problem sets weren't very related to the course work.",
    "A lot of people take this for a science credit, while there are some people who are clearly geo majors. It's definitely accessible for everyone though. The textbook is a little too dry, but Dave is awesome.",
    "The course's lectures were interesting and engaging. However I consistently was confused about the content covered in psets- they never seemed to pertain specifically to what we were studying.",
    "I really don't have many suggestions. I liked the format (assigned seating in cluster tables w\/ lecture style instruction) a lot. I thought it complemented the material well.",
    "I thought the lectures were interesting, but sometimes it was a bit confusing because we would start a topic and cut it off halfway through the lecture.",
    "This course was good at balancing large scale, basic ideas, with the more nuanced and technical content expected of a college course. I enjoyed the visual nature of the slides for lectures. I wish there were more interactive components to the course. For example, the glacier demonstration was a helpful way to interactively feel the inner works of glacial ice movement.",
    "It's a great survey course of Geology, but because the class does not go very in depth into every subject area it can seem like a lot of memorizing. It could be improved by simply being more engaging.",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely Professor Evans. He is a great professor and really cares about his students. He presents the materials very well, is always willing to answer questions, and knows each of his students by name. This is very rare for a class size this large at Yale. The only weakness is the grading of the problem sets. I wish we received more feedback for incorrect answers. It was very neat to turn everything in digitally to save paper, however, I did not learn as much from my mistakes as I would have liked.",
    "This class seems to have gotten a lot more challenging this year, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it seems to have delved much deeper into technical information that I'm not sure is particularly valuable\/necessary in an intro level class. Some of the material on the second midterm was information that was not what had been primarily emphasized in class or in the readings, and I think the questions took many students by surprise. The problem sets, particularly the last one but also others, often seemed unnecessarily difficult, with some questions that seemed much more appropriate for more advanced geology students (on things we hadn't gone over in depth in class). Overall I learned a lot, but felt as if my knowledge was not accurately assessed, and felt as if there was little to no guidance\/help available (even though available to help were not sure about many of the problems).",
    "I found the material interesting and lectures were engaging and well done. The course attempts to cover a whole lot of material though, and some of it involves memorization which can be frustrating. I liked the system of study tables and the homework was usually engaging and interesting. I wish the homework was more regular and I wish there had been more regular quizzes to encourage me to keep up with the readings. the workload seemed more sporadic than it needed to be. The test questions were also very open-ended and hard to answer as thoroughly as was expected.",
    "Professor Evans is this class' strength. He presents the material in an engaging way. The class covers a good array of geological information, from plate tectonics, to mountain formation, glaciers, and global warming. One difficulty with this class is the tests, which are 5 general questions that require a few paragraphs and a diagram. They are so so open ended to the point where sometimes I am not sure what to include because the topic is so large. I often lose points for not including an important term, even though I thought I had a sufficient explanation for the question asked. The test layout also makes it challenging to study for the exams, because the questions are so broad and I'm not sure what material I'll be deducted for not knowing.",
    "The course is really great! I felt that one weakness was the way the exams were written and graded. The exams were largely a series of free-response\/short-essay type questions. The questions were often kind of open-ended, but were graded with specific things in mind. I felt that there were a few times when points were taken off unfairly, because they were taken off for things that I wouldn't have known we had to include after reading the question.",
    "If taught in the teal room, more clicker questions and small group discussions, and better use of TAs. The TAs were really knowledgeable, I wish they would have lead outside of class discussions or helped give more direction on PSETs It also seemed to be taught too early in the day to me :\/",
    "The course could be improved by giving students greater reason to do the reading. I, for one, found it difficult to keep up with the reading without more structured evaluations of the concepts. The periodic in-class quizzes did this, but more regular assessments of the reading (at the start of every class, maybe) would be helpful.",
    "The team aspect of the course definitely made class time more approachable. It was nice to have a group of people that you felt connected to and got comfortable with, especially as a freshman in the course."

   "comments": [
    "Take this if you need a science credit! I enjoyed the content and the teaching is great from two really kind and knowledgeable professors.",
    "I took this course for a science credit, and am very happy I did. That being said, you do have to put in the workI wouldn't call it a gut.",
    "Yes I would",
    "A really great introductory class. Professor Evans is a great professor who is very passionate about geology and makes it fun. The reading seems like a lot at first, but the textbook is very clear and helpful. Really fun class without too heavy of a work-load.",
    "I'd recommend this course to a student already interested in Geology. Otherwise, the lectures may be boring. This is a good course for students to figure out whether or not they want to pursue geology further or explore environmental science. However, I wouldn't recommend this class to a student who enjoys problem solving over memorization or to a student wanting a really thought-provoking class.",
    "Great class if you're looking for a SC credit. It gives you a good overview of geology that's interesting and also potentially practical. The midterms and exams are reasonably fair. Only downside is that I wish there had been more outside help, like review sessions, better feedback on homeworks and tests, etc. Dave is great.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to someone looking for an introduction to geology.",
    "This class is a fairly easy class. I would hesitate to call it a gut, however, because the nature of the class requires attendance and lengthy work on problem sets that you aren't well prepared for by lectures, and need careful reading of the textbook, googling, and knowing someone who can explain Google Earth to figure out. Beyond that, it is a simple earth science class that is probably good for anyone in geology or environmental science.",
    "I highly recommend to anyone of any background and skill-set. Not too rigorous but also not pandering or dumb. Really engaging and interesting topics and means of instruction.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I took it for a major requirement but I think it makes a great science class regardless. You learn a lot of interesting material but overall it's not too challenging.",
    "Possibly. I think if someone feels as though they may be interested in geology, then the course may be appropriate. However, others who have no interest at all may find the course boring.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student interested in learning about the Earth and basic geology terms and structures.",
    "I'd recommend this course to another student if the kinks that seem to have arisen this year get worked out. It's incredibly challenging at times and very easy at others, and there's little to no guidance.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a great introduction to geology but accessible even to people with little science background. It also feels relevant to today. The workload is pretty light although you will be expected to take in a lot of information. You will get out of this course what you put into it.",
    "Yes, this class is great and professor Evans does a awesome job. His lectures are entertaining and you learn the basics of geology, which is helpful for explaining questions of how earth works and how something got to be the way it is now. It will change your outlook on the natural world and you will be able to see the geological history of a place in a way that you hadn't before.",
    "YES!! really cool, interesting class for all students (not just STEM or geology)",
    "The course is pretty great, not a demanding workload, but not at all a gut. The course really is enriching if you can adjust to think geologically, which is not only a matter of scaling up the timeline of your understanding of the world, but also scaling down your focus to perceive how, for example, an (over)abundance of plankton could send the entire planet into an ice age.",
    "It is worth it to take this class if you also take the lab. I think my experience would have been much less valuable if I wasn't in the lab.",
    "Absolutely. You get out of it what you put in, but the concepts are fascinating and Evans has the remarkable skill of being able to make anything he talks about interesting. I went into the course with a strong interest in geology and environmental science, but I think that even those with little interest in geology greatly enjoyed the course. The topics are confusing at times and there's a lot of information thrown at you, but it's manageable if you attend all the lectures and keep up with the reading.",
    "Yes! The instructiors rock, and the class is developed to facilitate the needs of students.",
    "Majestic d is great. Great course."
