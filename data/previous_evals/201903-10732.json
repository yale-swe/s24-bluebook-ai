    "how to study diligently. and how to speak Mandarin",
    "I had never studied Mandarin before this course, so seeing where I am now with the language, I've learned a ton. You start with simply learning to read and pronounce pinyin, then you dive right into character writing, reading, oral production and listening. We've learned hundreds of characters and many extremely useful grammar concepts. The course is designed to teach you what you need to survive in a setting where Mandarin is the only language spoken, but this is also enriched with cultural concepts, and you're given the tools to be able to say one thing in multiple ways--at one point, you can really start to put the pieces together yourself and express yourself in unique ways. Personally, I feel very strong in character writing and reading comprehension. The course definitely gives professors the freedom to teach in their own ways, too, so we worked on oral production heavily. I would say I know enough of the language to make very basic conversation, go shopping, ask for directions, introduce myself, etc., and I have the building blocks that will aid me in continuing with the language.",
    "Writing Chinese characters, conversing in Chinese (topics ranging from self-introduction, talking about family, transportation, shopping, etc.), and reading and speaking in Chinese",
    "introduction to Mandarin",
    "I developed a basic understanding of the Chinese language. I took this course as a challenge to myself and it was worth it. I the different parts of the Chinese language and why pronunciation is so important. This course also offered me brief insight into the Chinese culture through language.",
    "This course does a fantastic job of teaching the basics of Chinese within a relatively short period of time, including basic grammar and vocabulary, with an emphasis on speaking and pronunciation",
    "I learned elementary Chinese characters and grammar and practiced using them in both a written and spoken setting.",
    "I learned elementary Chinese grammar, vocabulary, and characters."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths - everything! weaknesses - ???",
    "The course is strong because of its balance. As homework every day, you have your usual drills for translating, listening, reading, answering questions; you also have a daily quiz in class that tests your character writing, reading, recognition, etc. In class, we balance all that with lots of speaking; often, we'd stand up and make conversation with a partner, do skits, ask\/answer questions. Spoken fluency is probably the aspect of language learning where having a professor present is the most important, so it is definitely useful for the class time to be centered on that. It is also evident that every professor cares deeply about their students' performance, which creates an excellent environment where people feel comfortable making mistakes. One weakness is that we aren't given very many assignments where we're asked to write in length (i.e. a letter or email). Assignments like writing your teacher an email aren't usually required or are only given by individual professors and not the curriculum. Being able to write and make mistakes is really important, so I think the course would be better if it encouraged this more or even made it mandatory.",
    "Strengths: You get to improve your Chinese incredibly Weaknesses: feels like an intensive high school class (Daily homework, daily quiz, test about every two weeks, weekly oral presentation, weekly tutorial); also since there are so many parts that make up your grade (test, quizzes, participation, attendance, tutorial, etc.) it is difficult to gauge your grade when the teacher doesn't update your grade on Canvas",
    "Strength- covers a lot of material in a short amount of time Weakness- daily graded quizzes",
    "The fact that you have assignments due everyday really forces you to practice everyday, which is a great way to learn a foreign language. You get what you put into it. All the presentations, homework, chapter tests helped me a lot. I would not change a major thing about the course. Some nights, we had a lot of homework and material to go through. Maybe that could be adjusted for slightly less.",
    "The fact that class time mainly focused on speaking skills is very effective, as well as the structure of the course with weekly presentations and a fairly consistent workload throughout the semester. The weekly tutorial session was really helpful, too",
    "The strengths of this course is its frequency. I feel like there could be more emphasis on speaking.",
    "There were basically no weaknesses with the course. I went from speaking no Chinese to being able to have basic conversations with Chinese speakers over the course of one semester."

   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY! A great bonding experience. The material is difficult but it's so worth it. Only take this class though if you actually want to learn Chinese.",
    "Absolutely! Without a doubt. I learned so much in this course, and I plan on pursuing the Chinese track until L5. The professors truly know what they're doing; they are able to take a foreign language that can be so intimidating at first for non-speakers and they make it a second home. I truly felt welcomed and excited every day when I arrived in class. You're constantly surprising yourself with what you've learned, and the professors and classmates make a very non-competitive, supportive environment.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn Chinese, definitely recommend, but be prepared, it is a lot of work.",
    "Yes, this class will definitely help make tremendous improvements in Mandarin proficiency",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because all of the instructors amazing, helpful, and very friendly. Chinese is not hard to learn. This course and its instructors prove that. The course material is very structured and it is for sure that at the end of the semester you will have learned some Chinese.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. The learning environment is very welcoming, and besides the characters the language is not as daunting as it seems.",
    "I highly recommend Chinese 110 to any students who are considering taking Chinese as their foreign language. The teachers are engaging and wish the best for your Chinese education."
