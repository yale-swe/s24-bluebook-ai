    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura did a great job being flexible and finding ways to create useful assignments for our section time.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0She is very approachable and explains assignments and different means of interpretation in very accessible ways.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is quite amazing. She is quite humble yet she commands respect. Her teaching style is quite interactive and her warm personality foments active participation in each section. She is quite knowledgeable, but at the same time, she is not afraid to admit when she doesn't know. In fact, she researches the answer for the next meeting. I am quite pleased to have been a part of her section this semester.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0She has an authentic presence in the class room. She is innovative, and shows great knowledge of the field of study. She communicates well with clarity and great understanding.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura demonstrated a keen ability to facilitate discussion. Her clear and concise presentation of subject matter facilitated a better segue between lectures and particular hermeneutic practices. She facilitated section discussions with confidence and fielded questions and comments with poise and consideration.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Strengths: Laura is a wonderful teacher: is knowlegeable and passionate about the material, is compassionate and relates well with the students, able to manage the section time well, inspires a sense of self-efficacy in her students, and is available via email and outside of class for help\/support as needed. Laura also asked for feedback at some point in the term to make any mid-term \"course corrections.\" This is an excellent way to grow as a teacher, which showed me she really wants to grow and excel as a teacher. I very much appreciated the pre-exam sessions TFs ran. I am not sure what she plans to do in the future, but I sense she is on her way to being an excellent teacher. I feel so lucky to have had her. I know that her teaching helped me to master the material to the extent I was able to do so. I really hope I can have her next term in OTI II. Suggestions: It would have been good to sort out the section arrangement with less communication and to have them start earlier. I think this was all about process used for making the groups. In another course, the TFs passed out a paper with all section times on it and we had to rank 1-4 for which times were our preferred (1 high, 4 low, and indicating where there was a conflict like another class). This seemed to sort us out very quickly and with almost no communication needed other than telling us what section we were in.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0My TF Laura, was absolutely amazing. She was engaging with students, she had knowledge in the OT material, and she conducted tangible ways for the students to understand the material. She inspires me to become a TF.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was very clear in her instruction, positive, helpful, available.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is very knowledgeable. She is very effective, and is passionate about what she's doing.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was very knowledgeable about the material, and encouraged discussion and questions from the course. I have no advice for improvement because I thought that it was great.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was wonderful as a TF. I thought her sections were very engaging and enjoyed that she not only explained to us the basics of different methods of interpretation, but helped us try these out on different passages while in class together. She was very helpful in preparing us for the paper and the tests as well and made herself very available for meetings.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Best TF I have had. Approachable, listens well, section was well laid out, and she responded to emails frequently.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was an incredible Teaching Fellow. In sections, she really cleared up the confusion that students had in regard to certain reading assignments. She is one of the most patient persons I have met. She did not mind answering questions about Lectures, Exegesis papers, and more.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Ms. Carlson was a very committed teaching fellow and always was well prepared for her duties during sections.However, after reviewing my mid term exams with other students and comparing them to mine, I will allege that her grading standards was arbitrary. For some, she graded high for the same answer that for mine was graded low. When asked to give specific answers on how to go about structuring my exegesis paper, I was met with resistance and given vague advise.When I asked other students if they had the same experience, they commented that she was very helpful and provided as much information needed.I can't answer why Ms.Carlson treated me with such disparity, but I'm left to wonder was it because of my age, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation?",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was prompt to answer emails and meet outside of class. She was on top of email communications throughout the semester. Laura did not provide us with any information in section that we did not have in our assigned readings. She was unable to answer any question that was asked during section. She did not explain the exegesis clearly, and she was not able to articulate during section. She is not able to effectively teach material.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was great!",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is hands-down the best TA I have ever had. Absolutely excellent. She runs an amazing discussion section --- well-organized, with well-conceived and well-executed activities that tangibly make sense of otherwise complicated biblical criticism concepts. She explains concepts extremely clearly and always answers questions promptly and is helpful in office hours as well. Such a clear teacher with a natural ability to run a classroom in an engaging way. WOW! Greatest TA ever.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0I thought Laura was an excellent TF. Her weekly sections were always interesting and dynamic. She knows her material extremely thoroughly. She has (or at least she seems to have) a lot of experience teaching and therefore knows how to get a group of students engaged and thinking. Regardless of whether she herself assigned the material for each section, she knew how to use it and to encourage our learning. I have had really frustrating sections in the past because the TA's were simply not very good, whether from inexperience or from lack of knowledge. Laura, however, was simply outstanding. Her grading was very fair, and her feedback was informative and helpful. Her review sessions were especially valuable and thorough. I really enjoyed them because she was always so good about covering as much information and to get as many people talking as possible. I felt them really helpful at their purpose: reviewing the large amount of material and helping to prepare for the exam format. On top of all of that, she is just such a nice person. She always seemed excited and willing to work with me. I felt like she encouraged me so much, and I wanted to do well in the class because I wanted to do well for her. I felt I wanted to prove to her just how amazingly she did her job. Plus, she was always very conscious of the time and made sure we were let out at the exact minute the time was up. That was actually very disappointing because it always felt it had come too soon. She knows exactly how to fill every single minute. All of these traits are very difficult to come by, and she is just naturally a good teacher. Those characteristics simply cannot be learned. And frankly, I have no idea what to say about a \"weakness.\" She seemed to do everything I wished past TA's of mine would have done.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0She was quick to help me and so very kind. Thank you, Laura!",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was an excellent TF and I cannot think of a single negative thing to say. She is a fantastic classroom manager and facilitated engaging discussions, allowing her students to freely debate while also guiding the discussion to the desired ends. She answers questions well and punctuates longer lecture-like answers with good use of the white board. I especially appreciated her critiques and comments on my paper; they were encouraging in what I did well and she provided excellent feedback on how to further improve my paper.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is extremely well organized and enthusiastic about the material. She is an asset to the class.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0My Teaching fellow was very well organised in leading discussion groups. I personally had a lot of difficulty in the class and am truly grateful for all the help that I was given in working towards papers.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is a wonderful TF! She is consistently animated, passionate about the material, efficient, and able to communicate clearly. She strikes a great balance between structure and freedom for discussion in section. She was always very helpful whenever I had individual questions. Her comments on essays and exams are very thoughtful. Her section was my favorite part of this course.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0She is organized, leading group discussions well, and always available to answer additional questions.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0nervous and not always great about managing our small section - she should have had more of an agenda for us to do that said, as the semester went on she improved, and it is a REALLY hard job to be a TF. she was timely in returning our materials for class, with a lot of comments. she made herself available for questions always, which was fantastic. I think with time she will become a great TF!!",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima's knowledge of the material is solid, but she needs to work on her lecture and presentation skills. When speaking in discussion section, she often paused for very long periods of time, as if she had lost her train of thought, or she'd start explaining something, stop halfway through, and then start over. This makes her difficult to follow. No doubt this will improve with time and experience (I saw some improvement over the course of the semester), but outside practice would probably help too - even something as simple as reading her lecture aloud (from notes) a couple of times before section.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0There seemed to not be a set goal of what was to be conducted in section. It was not very well organized and I do not feel that it helped me understand the material any better. I believe if there was more structure and if she did not constantly change her mind when giving instructions in section it would improve it.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima didn't seem confident in the material. She mumbled a bit and didn't finish sentences which made her a bit hard to follow. I think she would benefit from more experience or some teaching in how to be a teacher.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Definitely good at integrating approaches other than the basic historical-critical approach we were getting in class (especially feminist and postcolonial approaches). I'd encourage a more confident approach in class, since the content and knowledge are good!",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima led good discussion groups and was very organized. I felt like the expectations for the first test could have been better explained.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima was a very good TF. Our first couple sections were organized a little badly, in that we made a lot of lists on that board that didn't always seem directly relevant to what we were doing in the course. However, this got better as the semester progressed. Throughout the semester, she was great at presenting broad topics in section, such as the various critical methods we learned about, and encouraging discussion on those topics. She also was very good at communicating important course information in a timely and clear fashion.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0She was great!",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Unfortunately, the weaknesses of the class had nothing to do with Professor Wilson, but with the discrepancy of experience between the two TAs. I felt disadvantaged in engaging with the material in section and was particularly frustrated during the final exam, in which the TA interrupted every few minutes. Further, I'm unsure how she will determine grades. Pratima is knowledgable in her field but struggled to engage the class and share what she knows so well. This was a first class for her and I'm sure that instruction will come easier to her in future.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima was at times a very good TF, but often seemed ill fitted to steer the class in the right direction. Sections were often void of valuable learning. Exegesis direction was left unclear. In personal discussion with Pratima, I was able to gain a lot more clear understanding of pertinent material, and this is where she excelled.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Always responded well to questions when asked and sought to be very helpful! When we had questions about the course, she made sure we knew where to find answers or to provide them. Sections got better through the semester. Second exegesis section we discussed the whole hour without any framework was set for what we were actually focusing\/discussing about, which led in a different direction than syllabus designated. I only found 1 or 2 of the discussion sections actually helpful. I think giving better directions and information about how to prepare for sections and what the format will be like would make them more successful.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima engaged very well with her section. She helped me through recurring points of confusion, clarified my misunderstandings, was patient when I had difficulty framing a question. She encouraged section participation and was clearly the thought leader in the room.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0TF was very smart - we could tell. And I think she really loved the material. However, she lacked the ability to teach the information. Each section was painful in trying to understand what it was she was trying to get us to learn. It would help if she started with the big picture and then explained how she was going to get us to the learning points for the day. I think I missed out on not having the other TF. I was originally signed up for the other TF and we were told that we were morally obligated to switch to the other TF if we could make our schedule work. I rearranged to make it happen and in the end I believe I was at a disadvantage to learning as much as possible because the TFs were that much different in their ability to teach.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0I felt that the TA could use more confidence and overall decisiveness in leading the section discussions. I understand that this is a difficult and somewhat nebulous skill-set, and appreciate the challenge of trying to lead the group through the dense and contradictory material of the course.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima was a good teaching assistant but it was difficult to get through the text in discussion sections because it did not directly correspond with the class material from that week. I think she did a really good job of directing class discussion but I would like some more guidance outside of the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Good focus on trying to dig out the most salient elements of the course material. Felt like she could have done better in the reviews before exams and exegetical paper.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima was very engaged as a Teaching Fellow. Her style of teaching is that of quiet but astute leadership. She had a high degree of knowledge about the subject matter and was very skilled at allowing class participation in an orderly manner, a skill that is not to be taken for granted (as it compares to other classes and sections!). It was also greatly appreciated that Pratima would participate in exam review sessions although the style that she and Laura utilized where the class guides the topics reviewed was risky at best, since we would have very limited insight on what topics were best to cover and review. Lastly, Pratima was somewhat insightful when providing written feedback on exams, section write ups and final paper. Her efforts are very appreciated. Perhaps there would be opportunity for additional teaching skills consolidation and a higher level of comfort with student interactions if she (and the other TFs) would be even more accessible for questions and collegial thematic debates throughout the whole semester, not just at exam time. This is especially important for those of us who are at the point of a second career or may have done previous research on theological topics so that we may welcome more dialogue and collegial interactions. Overall, a great effort for such a challenging class.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Gopalakrishnan prepared very good classes and she was very ready to answer questions and go beyond the text. Imcould see she did a good efforts to control very politely the sessions and she provided with useful information. I would have liked a little bit more of encouragement on small group tasks. Good comments on papers.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0offers detailed comments on written work and exams. that is good. although comments were constructive, they felt very negative. section was rarely helpful and was often confusing. section activities did not inspire confidence in the instruction given by the TF.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0It did seem like Pratima was trying to do her best, but this was possibly her first teaching experience. I found her section unhelpful and when I did go to her for help, her responses almost felt like a scolding for asking questions. She was also inconsistent in the sort of assistance she would give and how she was grading us, which was incredibly frustrating and felt unfair. During our final exam she continually and repeatedly interrupted us to make announcements, which made it much harder to focus. I think I would've learned more in this course and gotten a higher grade if I'd had Laura as my TF. I do think Pratima was trying and she was in a difficult situation because Wilson was so far off the syllabus, but I think the end result was that the combination negatively impacted both my learning and my grade.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0Pratima is incredibly bright. While her in-depth knowledge is clear, she is still learning the adaptability of a seasoned instructor, which I'm sure will develop in time. The sessions when she shined the most were our discussions on post-colonial and feminist interpretation. I think if she gains confidence that her lense is not just an opinion, but a legitimate scholarly approach, this confidence will give way to a more flexible way to guide students.",
    "Instructor: Pratima Gopalakrishnan \u00a0It seemed at first that Pratima hadn't fully gotten her sea legs under her in front of a classroom, but she appeared much more at ease as the term progressed, which in turn made all of us students more comfortable asking questions and engaging in discussion. I expect that with further experience, she will grow into the teaching role well."
