    "I definitely understand the course material. It wasn't a \"wow\" kind of class, it is Intro Calc after all. However, it was not the worst! Definitely had a better time than I was expecting to-- definitely because Ian is a good professor. He has random fun tangents about spheres and we watched Sesame Street once to introduce a topic. If you have to take Intro Calc, you just have to--but take it with Ian.",
    "Basic intoductionary calculus skills",
    "The skills I developed in this course include being able to apply concepts and rules in Math 112 to real life situations including Economics.",
    "I gained an in depth knowledge of derivatives and their applications, as well as an introduction to integrals.",
    "i got a good foundation in calculus",
    "I developed a basic understanding of calculus 1 concepts that I expected to refresh myself on before moving on to calculus 2.",
    "I learned how derivatives work conceptually rather than just mechanically taking them. I learned how they can be used for real life applications.",
    "I solidified my calculus and problem-solving skills.",
    "This course was a great introduction to Calculus that suggests many real-world applications of the methods we were learning.",
    "I developed a new understanding of how to think through Calculus.",
    "Basic techniques for taking integrals and more techniques for taking derivatives. For all subjects we learned a good amount about real life applications of the concepts we were learning.",
    "The course strengthen my understating of Level 1 calculus.",
    "How to take derivatives and antiderivatives and how they can be used to solve problems.",
    "I developed and improved my understanding of calculus as well as certain pre-calculus material, I feel very well prepared to move onto Math 115.",
    "I understood the theorems and explanations behind calculus and can now apply it to real life situations.",
    "I felt like I had a greater understanding of AB calculus not only conceptually but how important it is in a practical setting as well."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - course has multiple different grade breakdowns so that you can get the best possible score - psets and online assignments may seem a lot at first, but does help with evening out your grade - peer tutoring hours helped a lot, especially when it was a particularly hectic time during the semester Weaknesses - textbook costs so much, unavoidable because you need to have an online code - the online code is for WebAssign, which did not facilitate learning at all",
    "The course was well organized and effectively taught the material.",
    "Strengths of this course include organization of the lectures, diversity in learning activities (lecture, partner work, etc.), and enthusiasm of the professor.",
    "The course was very structured and I appreciated that. I also liked how there were many examples and practice problems to go over.",
    "I thought it was well taught, but it would've been more helpful if there was more example problems in the class.",
    "the teacher explained things clearly and with good examples the only issue is that sometimes psets were much more challenging than the class prepared me to do and more support on these would have been good.",
    "The main strength is the teaching style and smaller class setting. The weakness is probably a standardized way of preparing for tests.",
    "I didnt like how complex the problem sets were. However, I thought Ian was a great instructor and really broke everything down.",
    "It is strong in its evaluationstests and quizzes are very fair and cover the material of the course. It is weaker in busy work. Some of the web assign work is too easy and some of the problem sets are unrealistically difficult.",
    "I struggled to find balance keeping up with the work of this course.",
    "WebAssign wasn't very helpful because there wasn't feedback and if you can't get the problem there's not much way around it but giving up. It would be impractical to go to a peer tutor every two days for both us and the peer tutors.",
    "I think the problem sets were not helpful to understating the material, and the webassign assignments were tedious and boring. The primary strength of this course was attending the class because most of the section professors are pretty good.",
    "Strengths: The pace of the course is ideal, content is relevant and well-taught. Problem sets are challenging but not too difficult. Real world relevance of the concepts in the course is often emphasised. Weaknesses: the in-class worksheets didnt seem to add much to the course.",
    "The problem sets were sometimes graded very harshly for an introduction math course, but it was a good foundation for higher math."

    "Yes, if you are interested in learning or calculus or taking any upper-level math, it is unavoidable.",

    "Yes, if they are interested in pursuing math or need it for their major, this is where they need to start.",
