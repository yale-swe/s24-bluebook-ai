    "It's a good expansion of dynamics from physics, and probably a good supplement to physics majors who want something less strenuous than classical mechanics to spend a credit on. But in all likelihood, you're a Mechanical Engineer (or maybe BME), and this class is what it is. It's a boring lecture, but the topics are useful math theories and the workload is medium to light. The optional final exam policy is awesome. The TA was excellent too.",
    "Unless this class gets more organized, take it only if as an ABET requirement.",
    "I would talk with Professor O'Hern before you sign up for this class regarding how it would fit into your undergraduate curriculum to make sure it is relevant.",
    "You learn stuff, but you're not sure what you're learning. The material comes at you a little disorganized, so you have to organize it yourself. I do think I learned a lot in the end, though.",
    "This is Dynamics taught from the Physics perspective, so it might come as a surprise if you are expecting a more Engineering-oriented course. Even then the course material is manageable and Professor O' Hern is a fair grader."
