    "The lectures were very boring, and they essentially summarized the required readings. There was absolutely no student participation, even when we raised our hands to ask questions. The readings, while occasionally interesting, relied on understanding of topics which had not yet discussed, so I felt lost while reading them. We also had to write discussion questions before every class, which is a good thing, except that we nevernot onceaddressed the discussion questions, so they were never answered or discussed."

    "No. I would not recommend this course to anyone. I took it because it had a low work rating, but between the teaching, the engagement, and the absolute lack of any student participation and discussion, I would not recommend it to anyone else."
