   "comments": [
    "An excellent course, especially the Plato and Aristotle components. Although perhaps the least obviously interdisciplinary of the DS curricula, it is easy to find yourself applying the ideas of these philosophers in all kinds of other contexts. Jay Elliott is an absolutely brilliant teacher and lecturer, with great explanatory abilities and great ideas of his own. This is definitely a section to seek out, and a very worthwhile course.",
    "Do not do Directed studies at all if you aren't naturally wired for the Humanities and really love it. Its just too much reading and too intense to be worth it for anyone else.",
    "Directed Studies is worth it if the idea of a classical education appeals to you and you're okay with doing a fair bit of writing. I highly recommend it if you fit that bill.",
    "I would highly recommend you even try to transfer INto his section!",
    "I thought that this was a fantastic class. Dr. Elliott is great. There is a lot of work, but you learn so much and get a great overview of ancient philosophy. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Directed Studies will introduce you to the major philosophical ideas of the Western canon and show the development of theories about the nature of the good life, how one ought to live, how it is that we know and other ideas. I would recommend the course highly for anyone with a serious interest in taking on arguments and seeing how they develop. On the other hand, I would not recommend the course to anyone who finds analytical philosophy (a step by step analysis of how conclusions are reached) dry.",
    "A phenomenal course - probably the most coherent of the three branches of DS, since the thinkers featured are all responding explicitly to each other. Professor Elliott was an extraordinary professor - in fact, my favorite of my three DS teachers. He is extremely sharp and could perfectly summarize entire classes-worth of discussion in a few sentences. Most importantly, he took every comment from and interaction with a student very seriously. I never felt that his responses were formulaicor predetermined, as I did with some of my other teachers. I came out of every class feeling giddy, with a wonderful sense of having been intellectually stimulated. His comments on papers were also excellent, and I feel that he has helped me improve as a writer and as a thinker.",
    "Take directed studies if you like the humanities. It's challenging, but nowhere near as scary as it's reputed to be. It is what you make of it, and whatever you make of it, it will be fun and enlightening.",
    "Jay Elliott is the man. If you think I'm joking, you're wrong. This was by far my favorite DS section fall semester. His lectures were, if not the best in the course, a close second. If he's giving the lecture on Plato's Allegory of the Cave, try to record it (Yes, it is worth it). Just so it doesn't seem like I'm not being realistic, I will say the one thing about Prof. Elliott that was a little annoying: His handwriting can be indecipherable. However, he was always willing to explain his comments and go over papers with us, which was very helpful. On top of that, we spent an entire section discussing the proper way to write philosophy papers, which really helped out for the rest of the semester.",
    "The best way to get a good-faith introduction to the Western philosophical tradition, in a way that's not geared towards criticizing it but really understanding it, so that those who you can make your own judgments on an informed basis.",
    "I would summarize this course as having been the first semester of a crash course in the development of Western philosophical thought, necessarily focused a good deal on the Greek thinkers. I would definitely recommend the course, and the Directed studies program in general, to those students who are interested in becoming well read and knowledgeable on the evolution of philosophy and its importance. The class is also just generally a lot of fun, it comes highly recommended.",
    "I came into this course knowing very little about philosophy and at first I was pretty intimidated by the whole subject, but it ended up being one of my favorite courses in Directed Studies. Jay Elliott is a great professor for both lecture and discussion, and he's very helpful with papers. It's important to him that we find a way to make philosophy personally relevant, that we go beyond simply analyzing arguments to see why these ancient ideas actually matter. He's also hilarious. Some of the reading is tough (Aristotle's Metaphysics... and Physics... and Categories...) but it's generally short so it's pretty manageable. I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Jay Elliott.",
    "YES! though the reading list may seem intimidating, it is worth it in the end. Try to take with Prof Elliott if you can",
    "I loved DS philosophy. The books are interesting, but really hard to understand. I had Professor Elliott, who was incredible -- really relatable and incredibly smart. He helped us understand the material, and made section something to look forward to. It made me want to major in Philosophy.",
    "You can't go and read books without a sliver of these people's thoughts in your minds. Philosophy is the root of everything and even if you only get an idea or two out of the course, is unquestionably useful.",
    "DS Philosophy gives a really good overview of classical philosophical thought focusing primarily on Aristotle, Plato... It's a good introduction, though by no means a comprehensive education in philosophy.",
    "Professor Elliott's DS Philosophy section is as close a representation of a Socratic Seminar as I have ever experienced. The DS Philosophy syllabus takes on a far more interactive and meaningful role thanks to Professor Elliott."
