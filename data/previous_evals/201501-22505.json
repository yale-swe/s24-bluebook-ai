    "The course was thorough and engaging. The vocabulary this year focused a lot on politics, though with Youness's new textbook, the course will probably be even more culturally nuanced. Youness fosters an extremely warm classroom environment, and he encourages participation without being intimidating. He is also extremely responsive and helpful. Highly recommended.",
    "A quick run-through of the second half of al-Kitaab book three, with the second half of the class focusing on reading and discussing the news. You run through a lot of the material too fast to learn it very well, but still a good way to keep your Arabic skills up. Would definitely be better off as a five-day a week class (there's not that much you can accomplish in only 3-ish hours a week), and could use a more structured focus on grammar.",
    "The class will definitely help you with reading Arabic. You will get out of it what you put in, so if you spend a lot of time on the homework and studying vocab, you will learn a lot.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy class discussions in Arabic. We read a lot of news articles at home and presented them in class. It was great for speaking practice! There are a few vocab tests and written homework assignments every night, but I usually did not feel like the homework was overwhelming. Also, Youness is great!",
    "Yes, take it. Read the articles, discuss them in class, and your Arabic will get better."
