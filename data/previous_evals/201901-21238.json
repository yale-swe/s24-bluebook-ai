   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professors are relatively responsive to the needs of the students (previous evaluations mentioned the difficulty of hearing lecture in the lab classroom, with the various noises of the building rumbling along, so the professors started using a microphone system, etc). The design of the course seems to be well-thought-out (the first experiment spans many weeks and connects many different types of procedures, which is impressive). Weaknesses: The result of that design is an unreasonably long (20+ page) lab report that slams you right around midterms if you're taking the class in the spring. There's also a second, slightly smaller one at the end. This semester, the professors did offer time in class to work on them, which was greatly appreciated, but the amount of time and work that goes into the class (with the reports and the hyper-specific quizzes and the video viewings outside of class) are not commensurate with a half-credit course. Also, the in-class instructions are vague and you're addressed with exasperation for not knowing what's going on (you have to read the lab manual before class, but then oral changes will be given to one student while the others completely flounder). This made lab time a constant stress.",
    "The labs are well organized (though the instructions are a bit wordy). The lectures are helpful, but some more hands on demonstrations would be great for people with less lab experience."

   "comments": [
    "If you're MB&B and you have the option to place out of it from your lab work... do that instead. Especially if you'd have to take it in the spring.",
    "No. Please do not take this course. It is entirely a waste of time, and it's very frustrating for no reason. If you are pre-med and need a bio lab, take a different one, and if you are MB&B and need this for the major, get it waived. This class is very archaic in everything you do and you learn almost nothing, yet have to waste a ton of time. It was a very frustrating experience, and I really wish I hadn't taken the class."
