   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The structure is a Friday, lecture and Wed discussion with one paper per week. The paper involved a critique and proposal of experiments to follow up two articles assigned by the Friday lecturer and discuses on Wed by two student discussion leaders. The class involved several important aspects for grad school including listening to talks, leading discussions, asking questions, proposing experiments and writing papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, it is the best journal club or seminar you've ever taken. You will make great friends and really learn awesome neuroscience.",
    "Principles of Neuroscience is a course that gives you an overview of many areas of active research in neuroscience at Yale. I would recommend it. It allows you to see the options for research at Yale and provides a nice overview of the field of neuroscience.",
    "It is course that helps get broad (but not very deep) understanding of neuroscience field and it also largely helps to improve the writing ability. More importantly, students are required to think critically rather than just accept the knowledge, which is a good habit to form for future research."

   "comments": [
    "I learned about topics (computational approaches, mechanoreceptors, dream decoding) that I didn't otherwise have exposure to. I learned more about new techniques and gained practice planning experiments and describing my scientific thought process in a precise manner.",
    "This course was a first step to designing experiments and asking intelligent questions outside of your own field.",
    "I am an undergraduate, but this course is one of the factors that solidified my decision to pursue a PhD in neuroscience. It pushed me to think critically and skeptically about areas of neuroscience I know nothing about.",
    "This course gave me a broad overview of many active areas of research in neuroscience. It helped me see many options for a potential dissertation or research project.",
    "Training in literature reading and writing is very helpful. It covered materials in various sub-fields, and extended my understanding.",
    "This course largely helps me to improve my reading and writing ability. It allows me to discover what my real interest is and how far scientists are making progress in this field. Critical thinking is another important ability to be cultured in this course, which is not only required in the dissertation but also in everyday research."
