   "comments": [
    "Take this class even if you don't work on the Middle East. It can be difficult to get into some of the debates if you aren't familiar with them, but the class is engaging and fun enough that you should do it anyway",
    "This is a survey of the historiographical debates surrounding the modern Middle East. While each week focuses on a new topic, there are several themes that run throughout the course: the legacy of Orientalism, the politics of knowledge production, and the meaning of modernity. There is a pretty heavy emphasis on theory in this course. I found it thought-provoking and useful.",
    "A large amount of reading, but worth it to develop a thorough understanding of Middle East Historiography.",
    "Hist 855 is a demanding class, but you get a very good overview of the debates and works of scholars of the Middle East. It is an essential class for anyone interested in the middle east."

   "comments": [
    "As I will be doing fields in areas related to this class, it was very helpful for me, and familiarized me with debates which will be important for me in my work in the future.",
    "For me, the main thing was that this course made me think more carefully about social theory. It turned me on to Foucault and Gramsci, whose work I need to read more of. It also made me think more about the meaning of Ottomanism and its legacy for the Arab world. I am still unsure how this course will contribute to my dissertation but I have a feeling that it will because it made me more sensitive to theory, as well as some of the existing debates.",
    "I learned much needed information about the field of Middle East Studies. The paper I wrote provided the impetus for first conference paper that I have had accepted.",
    "it deepened my knowledge immensely. I have a very good understanding of the scholars in the field, and the subjects. It is a great launching pad for further study."
