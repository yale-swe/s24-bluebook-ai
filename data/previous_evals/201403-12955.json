    "I would say that it's NOT an art history course by any flight of the fancy. I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in archaeology and architecture, but not to someone who is interested in the sort of art one usually thinks of when one says \"art history\", which is paintings and sculptures and things.",
    "Take HSAR 236 if you want an awesome introduction to archaeology and the ancient world. Professor Foster is fantastic and caring and you will not regret this course. The world load isn't too bad, and because the readings are very engaging you actually want to do them. I loved going to lecture because Professor Foster is awesome in general and is so well read about the ancient world. Take this class!",
    "This class is an interesting, invigorating, yet mellow way for folks who do not know a lot about history of art or ancient cultures to dig in to this new material. (How did I never hear of the Minoans before? They are fascinating!) Art of Ancient Palaces is totally suitable as a 5th class that you engage with for the excitement of learning something out of your field.",
    "Solid class",
    "I would recommend HSAR 236 to a fellow student. It is an extremely interesting history and art introduction to the Aegean Bronze, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. It focuses on a small selection of palatial archeological sites and pays special attention to pottery, sculpture, metal and historical context."
