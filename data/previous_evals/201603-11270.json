   "comments": [
    "Fluids is very detail-oriented and I learned how to work through problems systematically.",
    "I learned practical skills in engineering fluid mechanics. I dreaded taking this class at first but I found it to be quite applicable to my future career goals.",
    "I gained an appreciation of the complexity of fluid dynamics, and learned a variety of different types of flow situations and how to analyze them.",
    "I feel like I gained many skills in applications of mathematical concepts. This is the first class I have taken where I feel like the math classes I have taken have finally become relevant. Professor Smooke also consistently reminded us that this class connects to all the theory we had to slog through. I also feel like I gained a large amount of knowledge about the course material. It is one of the first classes that made me feel like an engineer.",
    "I was really hoping to come away from this project with an intuition of fluid behavior, and I have gained that intuition only somewhat. Like most Yale engineering classes, the lectures are proofs\/derivations and the problem sets require you to apply some of this knowledge. Smooke does a good job of coming up with real-world examples to mix up the lectures.",
    "I learned about several fluid mechanic processes and equations such as flow through a pipe or a duct, different types of flow (compressible, incompressible, inviscid), boundary layers as well as how to calculate certain properties about these flows.",
    "This course provided a solid foundation of fluid mechanics and was structured well, as it closely followed the textbook.",
    "This course taught me about fluid mechanics, including pressure calculations, compressible and incompressible flows.",
    "This course gave me a background in fluid mechanics and the ability to solve problems related to fluid mechanics. Other than that, everything else that the course involved, i.e. math, physics intuition, etc., I got elsewhere.",
    "This class is the culmination of Multivariable Calculus and Diff EQ. So hopefully you had Smooke in either or both of those classes. However, the material is taught well and you do gain an understanding of fluid mechanics",
    "This course provides a solid foundation in fluid dynamics, spanning compressible, incompressible, inviscid, and viscid flows. Comparing this course to the fluid mechanics course taught at top-rated engineering schools actually shows that the Yale course is superior in the scope of topics that it covers. So overall, the course does a good job of teaching students the theoretical skills necessary for solving complex fluid dynamics problems.",
    "Learned a wide range of topics about fluids.",
    "I develop greater problem solving skills and advanced fluid mechabics.",
    "I learned introductory to intermediate properties and behaviors of fluid statics and fluid dynamics. This class taught me new ways of thinking about fluid behavior and its impact on daily situations.",
    "Basic intuition for fluid mechanics",
    "Learned a lot more about fluid mechanics. It was helpful to improve problem-solving skills, understand how to solve fluid equations from standard diffeq, learn the concepts through derivations, and how to apply the concepts. Smooke did a great job teaching the concepts and applying them, and it was one of the best taught mechanical engineering classes I've taken here. The format of having three midterms throughout the semester was wonderfully done and it helped me better internalize the concepts without having to cram everything for a final.",
    "I learned about ways to study and analyze the flows in a variety of fluid systems, and I learned what state most people in the class were from.",
    "This course was a very quantitative take on the mechanics of fluids. I developed rigorous mathematical skills for fluid analysis, understood the proof of theorems for fluid motion and solved examples from real life. I really enjoyed the aspects of the class that connected to real life, and the rigorous analysis of the material.",
    "I learned a lot about how math relates to fluid physics",
    "I learned a lot about fluid mechanics, problem solving, and the application of differential equations. I really enjoyed this class, though Smooke's grading curve is very very difficult.",
    "I learned a lot about the flow of fluids and the different types of effects of flows on surroundings. Lots and lots of great applications!",
    "I really learned a lot in this class. It was much more like a math class than I was expecting, which I enjoyed.",
    "I learned about fluid mechanics!",
    "Applies methods learned in Differential Equations to model (mostly ideal) fluid flow patterns. Helped us with techniques in Order of Magnitude calculations, dimensional analysis, etc.",
    "Basic fluid mechanics knowledge of relevant equations to field, overall approach toward field.",
    "Not much--got a little refresher of DiffEqs because I had to, and learned some formulas having to do with fluid behavior, but can't say I remember them particularly well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The TA sessions were difficult to attend due to my practice schedule.",
    "I think this was a good time of day to have the course (as opposed to 9am). I despise evening exams and think it is unfair to ruin someone's day by giving exams at 7pm. They should be conducted during class-time.",
    "This course is good in that it provides a very thorough theoretical background in fluid mechanics, going into much more depth on certain areas than most courses in this area. I think it could benefit from introducing few applications along the way ... i.e. if we're studying flow in pipes with head loss, etc, maybe analyze a real-world pipe system rather than staying purely theoretical. This would help ground the course more.",
    "Tests should reflect what is done in class as well as problem sets handed in.",
    "DO NOT CHANGE THIS COURSE. Let Smooke teach it just as he is forever. Please.",
    "Strengths: offers more opportunities to apply the theory to real-world applications than some other engineering courses. Weaknesses: As much as I would hate to have a separate lab class, I wish the course offered some hands-on or experimental component, or that Smooke did some demos. That would go a long way in providing the students with some actual intuition about fluids.",
    "This class does a good job in developing students' knowledge about different fluid properties in a logical structure. All of the concepts built upon each other well. It would have been nice to have a regular discussion session with smaller groups of people where it would be easier to ask questions.",
    "It was extremely helpful that this course finished earlier in the semester, while still covering the same amount of material. I felt like I learned everything I expected to learn in the course, but I got a break at the end of the semester which allowed me to focus more on other courses.",
    "The review for the first midterm was not equivalent to what was on the first midterm. The rest of the course was fairly well taught and was by the book, so very easy to learn yourself and review.",
    "Professor Smooke does a great job at giving lectures, I think for an engineering class, this was definitely one of the better ones I've taken. One issue is the lack of structure when it came to exam material. The midterms all felt a little random, the material he chose from all over the place, and we never really got any practice questions. Some more structure and guidance would have been greatly appreciated, not only for exams but also generally: I feel like I learned a lot of details about fluid mechanics, but failed to acquire a more holistic overview, a more macro picture, of what the subject entails.",
    "The strength of this course is that Prof. Smooke is a very good lecturer. The weaknesses were: poor TA's (common in engineering courses), a lack of communication (this was the largest weakness), and the fact that we met on Fridays even though the course was not supposed to meet on Fridays.",
    "This course was a very solid lecture. I thought the information was presented clearly and taught everything that we were tested on. Smooke is a good lecturer and I don't think there is much room for improvement in the course while he is teaching it.",
    "The course is great in the breadth of material covered. The only improvements that could be made are in the pset problems; they were not always related to the lecture.",
    "Finishing the class early with Friday lectures was helpful.",
    "Good teaching",
    "Learned a lot more about fluid mechanics. It was helpful to improve problem-solving skills, understand how to solve fluid equations from standard diffeq, learn the concepts through derivations, and how to apply the concepts. Smooke did a great job teaching the concepts and applying them, and it was one of the best taught mechanical engineering classes I've taken here. The format of having three midterms throughout the semester was wonderfully done and it helped me better internalize the concepts without having to cram everything for a final.",
    "Great course. I actually think the class did a great job pulling in real world examples and giving us a sense of what we were doing meant physically, unlike many (most?) of my engineering courses.",
    "Assuming you're a MechE this class is required but either way this is an overall great class. The workload is relatively low (Psets can be done the night before and are from the textbook) and if you go to class, do the home work and a few extra book problems you'll be prepared for the exams. Smooke is a fun professor who wants the students to succeed.",
    "The strong aspects of the course were how the textbook was closely followed and elaborated on. I enjoyed learning about the proofs and mathematical derivations of the material in class, and applying those skills to solve textbook questions. The class can be further improved if we go into how to solve problem types during the lectures, which would help significantly with completing problem sets.",
    "I wish the tests were better balanced to reflect the homework",
    "Strengths are that you actually learn how to approach and solve problems in fluid mechanics that could be encountered outside of school, in an engineering position. Weakness - Smooke doesn't change the exams, so the average this year was artificially inflated because apparently some students had last year's exams.",
    "The course was unique in that we finished it 2 weeks early. Professor Smooke is super kind and invested. A difficult course though.",
    "Make the course flat grade instead f curved so people would work together more. It dd wonders in PHYS 181 with Meg Urry.",
    "If he does the extra classes again, it would work better if the problem sets were changed to keep up with the course. But overall I liked having the course end early.",
    "The good: Lecture is pretty engaging. The material is more interesting than some other engineering classes. Fluids are cool! The textbook\/lecture gives some exposure to the empirical side of fluid calculations. (Reminds you that some of this stuff IS actually applicable to real life) We were able to finish the class early by having class on some Fridays. (Less stress during finals week) The bad: Homework will often not resemble at all what you are tested on. The textbook, while good, is ridiculously expensive. Like, what the hell. The thing is $400 for the edition we use. Can't we just use the previous edition? Rumors that some people had test banks for the last two tests makes me sad because it messes up the curve and made the average way too high. Since Prof. Smooke likely uses problems from tests he's made in previous years, this is a problem.",
    "It could be improved by more student engagement.",
    "Professor was clear and organized, often asked for the students opinions on when and how tests should be conducted.",
    "Not sure there is much to improve upon--Prof Smooke does his best but it's just boring material."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to a student not majoring in engineering; however, I wouldn't discourage people from taking the course.",
    "In general it was not a hard class. The average on exams was low because there was always 1 stupidly hard question on each exam which only had a few questions each. The homework problems were often unrelated to class and exam material but were mostly manageable. You are supposed to have taken Diff eq before taking this course, but we hardly used it at all except for extremely basic separation of variables questions.",
    "You're taking it because you have to, but it's not that rough. It's pretty useful.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are really interested in pursuing more advanced fluid mechanics coursework. It was not a bad class by any means, but it was very difficult, conceptually, and therefore if it weren't required for your major, it would seam silly to struggle through all that material if you didn't have a larger goal in mind.",
    "Only take this course if your major requires it. Tests are hard, problem sets take some time but aren't too hefty. Material is difficult and complex.",
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to any engineering major or even anyone interested in STEM. Smooke has created one of my favorite engineering courses at Yale. Even if you find the material difficult, Smooke's teaching style leaves nothing to complain about. His lectures are incredibly straight forward. The psets are always based on the lecture (until maybe the last one which deviates slightly). The exams are also based on his lectures and the psets. I never walked out of exam thinking \"I've never seen something like that before\". Overall one of the most well taught and completely fair engineering courses I have taken. 10\/10 would recommend. Also, Smooke did something cool for our class where he hosted lecture on Friday during the time slot where our class was on Monday, Wednesday and as a result we finished lecture by Thanksgiving and took our final the week before reading week. A couple extra Friday lectures really ended up taking pressure off my reading week. Finally, overall format is: weekly psets and three exams. The third exam that took the place of our final was simply a third midterm (read: non-cumulative). Previous years had four midterms with less content on each.",
    "If you have to take it, which you probably do, you can be happy that the class is not that bad! If you don't have to take it and are just interested, it would be a pretty good choice. It's not too difficult and not a ton of work, and is also pretty interesting, especially in the second half of the semester.",
    "Compared to other Mechanical Engineering classes I have taken thus far, I found this one challenging yet worthwhile because I feel comfortable with the knowledge I have gained.",
    "Yes, if you are in engineering it is very helpful to understand fluid mechanics. Smooke is a good professor to take it with.",
    "I would not take this course unless I had to. The course is hard, but very doable, but the course material is not particularly engaging or useful to people not in the majors who are required to take the course.",
    "Not really. Unless you have to take it. Actually maybe I would take it for the TAs -- they were awesome, perhaps the best I've had at Yale so far!!",
    "MENG 361 taught by Mitchell Smooke is one of the best mechanical engineering courses at Yale. The lectures are clear and straightforward, and you are tested exactly on the material presented in the lectures. The problem sets were also straightforward and only took a couple of hours per week. There were three exams throughout the semester, all of which were very fair and only tested the material from the lectures. This course is required for mechanical engineers, but it is actually enjoyable for the most part.",
    "Definitely take this course the material is suprisingly interesting and Smooke does a great job relating the info to real life examples.",
    "This course is very useful if you plan on becoming an engineer of any kind. Take it with Professor Smooke, who is a brilliant man, clear lecturer, and fair grader.",
    "It was definitely a really fun and interesting course. The professor is also a very fair and likeable person.",
    "Only if you're an engineer.",
    "Take this course with Smooke. He's one of the few really good engineering professors and it's definitely worth it. The material is complex sometimes but he's very straightforward about the types of problems you need to know how to solve. The exams are all fair and we even finished class early because Smooke got through the lectures quickly enough.",
    "Learned a lot more about fluid mechanics. It was helpful to improve problem-solving skills, understand how to solve fluid equations from standard diffeq, learn the concepts through derivations, and how to apply the concepts. Smooke did a great job teaching the concepts and applying them, and it was one of the best taught mechanical engineering classes I've taken here. The format of having three midterms throughout the semester was wonderfully done and it helped me better internalize the concepts without having to cram everything for a final.",
    "If you need to take fluids, take it with Smooke. He's funny and he cares, even if the derivation lectures put you to sleep.",
    "Not sure I would recommend it if you don't have to take it, but that might only be because I didn't find the subject material very interesting compared to many other courses I've taken here. Doesn't mean it was a bad or poorly done class, I'm just not sure what insights it would help you develop if you didn't need it as a basis for future study.",
    "Very quantitave and mathematical take on fluid mechanics, sometimes even like a physics course that is applied to real life. The course material is challengingbut definitely doable. It is a very rewarding class, and Professor Smooke is amazing. He is a clear lecturer and always brings interesting videos to class and makes connections to the material we are learning. Would recommend it to everybody interested.",
    "Smooke is the guy to take this course with. He is amazing and makes a difficult subject comprehensible. I would be wary of taking it with anyone else",
    "I would recommend this to any student in STEM who wants to see how differential equations can be applied to problems and enjoys fluid flow and mathematics. I really enjoyed the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to other engineering majors but it certainly was not a course for the faint in heart. Quite difficult with a lot of difficult material to master.",
    "Make the course flat grade instead f curved so people would work together more. It dd wonders in PHYS 181 with Meg Urry. You'll need this fr ABET and you'll learn, too.",
    "Yes, I like the way Smooke teaches, and the course was interesting.",
    "Yes. It was a challenging but worth it.",
    "Most people don't take this course \"for fun.\" We are taking it because we are engineering students and have to. With that said, fluids taught by Professor Smooke was a wonderful experience, and I would recommend.",
    "Interesting class but definitely designed for Engineering majors.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise don't."
