    "I would recommend ENGL 127 with Professor Smith. He's a great professor who really cares about and knows the works you read in this class, and he comes to class every day prepared to look at passages as a class. He's also just really cool and fun to listen to and talk to. I would have liked to have improved my writing a bit more--I feel like this class ended up being more about reading than writing--but it was a lot of fun to take and a great professor.",
    "I would summarize it as a comprehensive survey of american lit. You get as much as you want out of the experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 127 to a fellow student. It's a class that focuses on American literature and without reading every major American literary work allows students to explore what is actually a relatively new and unique category of literature. Assuming you have a good professor, the class is not too much work and actually is enjoyable to participate in. Overall, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "English 127 is an incredible class, especially with Caleb Smith. He is an unreal professor who is so incredibly knowledgeable about all the works and authors that we read. He will provide really fascinating insights and inspire the same sorts of thoughts in you. Take this class with Caleb Smith. He will make American Literature connect and come to life in ways I don't think other professors can.",
    "I think this is an excellent course for anyone who wants to take a very interesting course that might demand a little more than other English classes.",
    "I wanted an opportunity to read great works of literature, and I got it. Each instructor's reading list varies a bit, so check that out beforehand. I really liked Professor Smith's teaching style and his choice of works. Assignments weren't too difficult, and were graded fairly. A great fifth class or class to do Cr\/D, especially if you want to focus on reading and thinking, less so on writing."
