    "I really enjoyed that this course taught us more about the Kenyan and Tanzanian culture through the many readings that we did. I enjoyed how we discussed current issues through the reading\/listening of new articles\/reports. I think the individual presentations were a great way to practice speaking but also to get to talk about something you care about, not just what we were learning about that week. I did not like that so much of the class and tests were based around the memorization of massive amounts of vocabulary, as I think there could have been more application or culture-based learning methods.",

    "Yes. Kiswahili has been a great language. Professors are engaging, the language isn't too difficult, but it's still very interesting to see the ways in which it is constructed, and the ways in which it is different from more traditional languages students learn in the West. It's also interesting to get to talk and learn about the history of Eastern Africa, which often isn't taught in American schools (or at least it wasn't in mine)."
