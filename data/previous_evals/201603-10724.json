   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about both other people's writing and my own. I feel I have a better handle on writing for bigger audiences now.",
    "I've gained a greater understanding of how to write creative nonfiction. I feel I have become a better writer in some respects and also have learned partially how to think like a writer.",
    "great class. believe the hype. you will actually become a better writer (and i was skeptical about this!) i feel my writing has improved so much and professor sexton gives excellent feedback that's always spot on. the readings are interesting and the class doesn't feel 75 minutes long",
    "I learned about New Yorker style writing.",
    "I learned how to write very concisely and with a public point. The public point was something that Professor Sexton stressed for the entire term.",
    "This course pushed me to be a more conscientious writer and reader, and made me more aware of techniques and styles I could use. I also improved my writing skills and tried out new styles of writing that I wouldn't otherwise have.",
    "Little. This is certainly not skills focused, and whilst we read Zinnser's On Writing Well, you certainly don't need to.",
    "This course taught me to read and appreciate and write essays in a whole new way. I learned practical and tangible techniques that I can use to make my writing more concise, more vivid, more powerful, and more effective in keeping readers engaged.",
    "I learned how to read a modern essays, and break down its literary techniques. I then learned how to apply these techniques to my own writing.",
    "I learned to view writing and the essay not solely for its literary content. In other words, through unpacking each component of the essay, I learned to view it as a very intentional system in which a writer chooses to explore a topic, rather than an accidental series of parts that follow an idea. In this way, I became much more intentional with my own writing. I pondered the \"why\" question and the \"how\" question that went beyond the mere \"what.\" I learned to see readers, in this case my professor, as an audience not required to read or enjoy what I had to say. To write for others is to write; there is no distinction.",
    "I developed personal writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the biggest strength of this course was the way in which students got to workshop each other's pieces. I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
    "The structure is great. The readings are awesome, and discussions with Prof. Sexton were thought-provoking. Workshops are insightful and hugely helpful to both the workshopped and the critics. Prof. Sexton's feedback was also very helpful. A weakness I found was that the grading\/critique between first draft and final draft seemed unfair - I was given only small things to fix in one essay and when I thought I fixed those Prof. Sexton critiqued a whole slew of things I didn't find mentioned in my feedback.",
    "An excellent beginning English course for freshmen. This is a good sort of refresh from high school with incredible readings. I'd say that the weakness is that the quality of the class depends almost entirely on the professor. Some professors conduct very different courses.",
    "I think the biggest strength of this course was that we got to see and read many different types of pieces, and consequently try them. In that sense, the course pushed me as a writer, because I wrote types of pieces that I would have otherwise never attempted. In terms of improvement, I don't think there really is any. I do think it might be nice if we could have been able to retry some of the formats we did to try and improve our first attempt (ie. doing another personal essay), but at the same time, I also liked being able to try so many different types of pieces, so I'm not sure it's worth the trade-off.",
    "Discussions are second to none.",
    "A major strength of this course is the way in which it is structured. The course consists of five essays that the students must write, and the class reads and analyzes sample essays of the same genre\/topic before students write their own. This was a very effective way of focusing on and studying various types of essays. The small class size and seminar style of teaching\/learning was also extremely effective and engaging. A weakness of this course is that it may start to feel repetitive towards the end. My professor resolved this problem by taking our class to the art gallery for a writing exercise to vary up the class structure a bit.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it's taught in such a small group. This really facilitates learning, in that you're really able to engage with the material. One of the weaknesses is that sometimes, you feel put on the spot--the essays are also quite time consuming to edit.",
    "Strengths: Sufficient rigor in terms of writing requirements Just the right amount of reading to understand the tools we could learn from Wonderful feedback from peers and professor after each draft Weakness: Sometimes I wish we could have written down the strategies we \"discovered\" in each essay. It was very easy to forget\/gloss over what we were learning.",
    "The course was very interesting and had a good variety in the type of work we did."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in writing.",
    "YES! You become a better writer and learn how to think like a good creative nonfiction writer. Prof. Sexton is awesome - he's funny and truly thought-provoking in both discussions and critiquing your essays. Only five essays for the semester, which isn't awful. The readings are also quite great, and a great break from academic reading.",
    "definitely!! also i dont know why pepole always say the workload is high - i found it incredibly low. you have to write like either a draft or a revision once every two weeks or so. that's seriously like nothing, they are 5 page papers and bot hthe drafts and revisions are pretty low key. you dont reallyh ave to do all the reading if you dont want to, could probably read just one of them and contribute but geneuinly theres so litttle to read and its interesting so you might as well. no reason not to take this class",
    "Absolutely! Especially for freshmen this is a wonderful course.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a fun course that's different from the \"traditional\" English course (ie. reading and analyzing books), which made it even more interesting.",
    "Take it credit D, if you're not the best writer.",
    "I would very highly recommend this course to another student. This was by far my most enjoyable and useful course this semester. Not only does this course provide techniques for better writing, but the selected reading material and class discussions are very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but with its challenges and workload in mind. Don't take this course too lightly.",
    "I would not hesitate to fully endorse this course to another student. In each of us there is a voice, a point of view, a history upon which we can craft our individual selves and contribute to the larger narrative of what it means to be human. No other class I've been a part of has given me such a platform. This class assumes the practicality of the essay and simultaneously disputes this very notion by exposing us to countless writers who invent and reinvent the essay. It teaches that the voice is not just the what, but the how and the why. This class made me a writer; it will do the same for you, if you allow it to.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course because it helped my writing quite a bit, and was very interesting."
