   "comments": [
    "I learned some new methods of writing history from Prof. Thaxton's incredible books. The layered interview model is really powerful and is able to explain Dafo's history on a granular level that is far more than the sum of its parts. I learned a lot more about the position and origins of Communist rule, both in China nationally and in the villages in particular.",
    "Contrary to the courses title, we never got to contemporary Chinese politics. In fact, we never even made it past the Great Leap Forward. It was instead mostly a sweeping view of china's history since the early 1900s,",
    "I gained a through understanding of the post-Famine situation of rural China through Professor Thaxton's valuable firsthand accounts of his research and fieldwork experiences in rural villages.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about 20th century Chinese history",
    "I learned a lot about Chinese history leading up and through the Cultural Revolution. It was more history than expected but I gained an interesting perspective on China and enjoyed the class.",
    "Didn't understand the full extent of the tragedies, death, and violence that took place under Mao's regime; now I feel like I have a better grasp on it.",
    "We learned Chinese History in Depth up to the 60's. Professor Thaxton was incredibly knowledgable on the subject, and it was a lot like a mini lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Even though it is listed as a seminar, Prof Thaxton ended up talking for the LARGE majority of the time. However, he is such an expert in the field that it was warranted because we all wanted to learn more from him.",
    "I think the course could have benefited with a more evenly distributed reading schedule and more class discussion. To be honest, if I were doing this class over I would want it to be a small-scale lecture class meeting for two sessions a week of 75 minutes. The lectures from Prof. Thaxton were very impressive, both packed with important detail and explanation, and also emotional and entertaining. But we didn't really use the seminar format for discussions as often as we could have, so a lecture schedule could have maximized the best parts of this class. I definitely felt like I wished for more classtime to cover all we could.",
    "this is probably the most disorganized course I've ever taken at yale, which ended up being extremely stressful as most people did not know what was happening and what the assignments were from week to week. no regular office hours and poor communication as well.",
    "Thaxton is usually missing from the class and never responds to emails. The class was very haphazard and the assignments didn't really follow the syllabus at all. They would be sprung upon us a week before they were due, meaning the two midterms and final paper as well as some miscellaneous stuff. The final was honestly impossible, we had a week to read 2000+ pages and write a 10-15 page paper that had pretty specific questions about the reading.",
    "The strength is the professor- amazing teacher and passionate about the subject",
    "Strengths: a ton of history knowledge, and a ton of Chinese development and first hand experience stories from the professor Weaknesses: basically a lecture course in a seminar time frame.",
    "More concrete deadlines and course syllabus.",
    "Loved how Prof. Thaxton was able to share personal stories of his field work in China, which really helped to underscore many of the points he made in class. I feel like this course would have worked better as a lecture, rather than a seminar. Prof. Thaxton had so many great things to say, but we were always running short on class time.",
    "We covered a ton of material incredibly quickly, so I learned a lot. However, at times it was stressful ensuring that I was caught up with the 100's of pages of reading. Nevertheless, Professor Thaxton was so knowledgable on the subject, and he truly cares about his students. I thoroughly enjoyed the class."

    "Very thought provoking and makes question conception of China. Work\/grades are not worth worrying about, he is very lenient!",
    "If you're interested in Chinese peasant life and want to understand how Communists take over countries, and how they treat people after they've done so, then this is a great class. Prof. Thaxton is incredibly knowledgeable and his books will blow you away. His classroom manner is a little strange, but a lot of fun.",
    "This class provides you with a unique angle with which to study contemporary Chinese history and politics. It's interdisciplinary perspective is really refreshing and Professor Thaxton's stories are at once entertaining and educational. Take this class!!!",
    "Absolutely- Professor Thaxton is amazing",
    "I would. Throughout the semester the workload was easy but the final was a TON of work which was kinda BS but he was a visiting professor so I guess that happens.",
    "Yes! Prof. Thaxton presents you a China that you've never seen before.",
    "Yes! Learn a lot and read great books.",
    "Take this class! Professor Thaxton is knows everything there is to know about Chinese history! The workload can be intense sometimes, but Professor Thaxton is a fair grader!"
