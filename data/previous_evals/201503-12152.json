    "325 was a fine course. Overall pretty boring material. If your really want to design a research project to do over the summer, then it would be useful. However, the fact that all global health fellows have to take the course but don't have to conduct their project makes it a fairly boring experience a lot of the times. The professor and TAs are really good though and give tons of feedback on your work and are always willing to meet.",
    "Take this class if you are interesting in global and public health!!!!",
    "The majority of this seminar's students are the Global Health Fellows, as it is a required course for all GHFs. If you are a GHF, you already know a lot about this course from the program administrators. If you are not a GHF and you have an interest in performing your own research at some point in the near future, I highly highly recommend this course. Prof Curry and the teaching fellows are truly a wealth of knowledge, and I will be tapping their expertise for years to come! They walk you through the entire process of designing a research proposal, and they are with you every step of the way to answer your questions and give you as much information as you want. You are not required to actually carry out your research proposal--but if you do, they have pledged to be with you every step of the way as you apply for funding, seek international review board approval, and travel to finally carry out the research! This was a fantastically useful class, and I am very glad that I took it. Note: If you are not a GHF and wish to take this course but are unable to enroll because of space, I still recommend that you approach Prof Curry and the teaching fellows for help! Introduce yourself, befriend them (they're really cool people!)--and if you have an interest in designing a research proposal in the future, having access to their expertise will be a lifesaver.",
    "Semi boring class but practical I guess. If you are a Global Health Fellow, you have to take this class anyways. Find a way to stay engaged and do yourself a favor and like get help from the TFs and from Leslie early on like along the way, not just right before the assignments are due.",
    "HLTH 325 is a really interesting class that gives you an opportunity to develop a research proposal with the help of a dedicated teaching staff. Though the course is designed to help students prepare independent research proposals for summer projects, it is difficult to simultaneously prepare for a summer project and submit the necessary project assignments. I would recommend going into the course with a good idea of a research proposal, because this helps make the process feel less rushed and this way you can get more out of the methodology portion of the course.",
    "This course is the Global Health Research Methods requirement for the Global Health Fellows program. If you are a Global Health Fellow, you are expected to take this course your junior fall and then use your proposal to conduct a summer research project. During your senior fall, you are supposed to analyze the data you collect for a final paper in the Global Health Colloquium. This sounds like a great timeline on paper, so you might be excited for this course, but there's still a lot of tweaking needed to be done here. The biggest issue with the course is how you're expected to choose a topic, if you don't already have on in mind. They basically ask you to pick your favorite health topic and your favorite region, mash them up, and design a research question accordingly. This isn't realistic at all. The best projects are probably the one where students already knew of a faculty member or organization working in a particular community, and they wrote a proposal based off of ongoing interest in a particular area. Many students sort of just made up a research proposal because they weren't able to identify a professor or organization to partner with. The other issue is the lack of assignments. You basically write a literature review in the beginning of the semester (~5 pages) and then this becomes part of the final paper at the end (8-10 pages). But in between, you have zero incentive to listen during the lectures or be engaged at all because the final paper is always so far away. This course really really need some reworking. So if you don't have a choice, seriously, good luck. Try your best to find a faculty mentor or some in-country connections like literally the first or second week of school. This is really the only way that your project has a chance at being real."
