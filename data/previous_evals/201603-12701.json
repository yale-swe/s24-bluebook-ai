    "I got an excellent foundation in the historiography of European and American art history. I learned how to compare methodological approaches. I was able to practice critical writing skills throughout the semester, whereas in my other classes all of the writing was done at the end of the semester.",
    "learning to read foundational art historical methods readings in a more nuanced way and in conversation with the preceding chain of scholarship",
    "-critical reading of seminal art historical texts -synthesis and comparison of multiple art historical methods",
    "It has improved my understanding of the development of (especially) the German tradition of art history as a method and, to a degree, the Yale's department place and positioning within art history methodology. The group presentations have been helfpul at tackiling certain tricky topic with a group of colleagues. I considered the response papers excellent writing practice and appreciated Prof. Gaifman's comments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Mostly excellent readings. Focus on methodology instead of the history of art (I'm glad we didn't choose one period of art history and compare methodological approaches to the period, because the focus could easily slip to the art rather than the art history). Position papers were incredibly helpful. Having a shorter final paper (10-12pp.) and no final presentation was a relief, particularly since the class was so intensive throughout the semester. Weaknesses: Too much reading, typically between 300 and 500 pages per week. I do not think it was a good idea to have students lead discussion every week. I wanted more participation and guidance from Professor Gaifman during class discussion. A better model would be for the students to lead discussion with the professor, or to have students give brief presentations to set the agenda for the class and let the professor take over from there. Also, although we frequently read passages from the texts in class, I wish we would have devoted more time to close reading of the passages. Finally, I wish Professor Gaifman would have given some lectures or provided some readings on developments in the discipline over the centuries to supplement the \"primary\" art historical texts.",
    "great discussion with many people who had great comments. millette ran the discussion extremely well also. the way the readings were structured was really cumbersome, however. if i had known how many readings were required of *separate* individual books i would have approached the class differently. the constant weekly need to hunt down new readings if they were not available online was burdensome. i'm not sure what a better approach would be as it's a survey course so no solutions really. critical theorists of art like french 20th century thinkers would have been nice to read as well.",
    "strengths: -engaging class discussions -texts were important to the discipline weaknesses: -texts were sometimes too early, not much on contemporary theories\/methodologies.",
    "I was encouraged by the inclusion of writers who rarely get discussed in methods courses. Additionally I appreciated the discussions on the language and writing of art history and the art historian's responsibility (or not) to make writing engaging and beautiful in its own right. While I would have liked to have read a more diverse set of authors with regards to gender and race, for example, I understand that every methods course is unique and the structure of this course made perfect sense with its focus on the origins of art history as a discrete discipline, rather than its later permutations.",
    "My two suggestions for improvement is structural\/organizational in nature. First, I would have found it helpful if the readings had been available a little earlier. Secondly, if the goal is to assist students with understanding where they stand methodologically as art historians, it might be helpful to solicit feedback from students before the course begins. The structure of the course as it was set up could, I think, handle ocassional departures from the main methodological narrative of the dead German art historians into a more contemporary realm, if that is what is ultimately useful to certain students. That said, I very much enjoyed seeing the history of certains concepts unfold within the field and the interplay of approaches across different generations of art historians."
