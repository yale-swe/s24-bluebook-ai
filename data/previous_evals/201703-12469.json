    "I received critical feedback on a chapter of my dissertation. I learned more about my peer's projects and practiced analyzing and giving feedback on the argumentation, arrangement, theoretical framework, and other aspects of graduate level work. My work benefitted tremendously from workshopping common issues with the group.",
    "Further professional development such as peer review practice and practical information for research and writing",
    "In this course, I learnt how to give substantial and constructive feedback on the work in progress of other graduate students.",
    "The work I chose to present as a part of this course was improved by the exercise. I also consider myself slightly more competent at coming to terms conceptually with an argument based on unfamiliar material."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is the level of engagement with one another's work. Pre-circulating papers greatly improved the quality of feedback that WIP previously provided. In the future, I think the meetings should be advertised to all of the faculty for participation. The burden placed on the DGS to run this seminar successfully seems too high, unless this counts as a course in their teaching load.",
    "I think this is a really important innovation in the department. In the past, work-in-progress meetings have been very poorly attended and informal and could really only ever offer superficial suggestions. It is difficult to appreciate and comment on all the details of a colleague's work immediately following a half hour presentation. This class offered a formal and rigorous forum for substantive feedback. By precirculating papers, it was possible to make small comments on particulars that would otherwise not be noted in a presentation while also discussing big-picture aspects of colleague's work. I think this was extremely beneficial and I have never felt so engaged with my peer's work and felt part of a real intellectual community. I think it is also a real virtue to be able to read and discuss the work of colleagues who have very different interests and methodologies. The class also allowed a more sustained and prolonged conversation over the course of an hour rather than 20 minutes. I would say that the time commitment for this was quite high. I think it would be better to have just one precirculated paper and keep the session to one hour (although I understand that as this is a formal seminar, this may not be possible). I also think it would be nice to invite non-dissertation year students, even if not sign them up to the course.",
    "Course environment was conducive to personal growth in multiple areas. It is a strength that the course is intended as a workshop for students in later years of the program and looks past the dissertation stages.",
    "The course was well-organized and all students, as well as the faculty leading it, were very involved. Particularly helpful were conversations on the aims, expectations, and rules of specific categories of graduate academic writing: prospectus, article, first draft of a dissertation chapter, polished draft of a dissertation chapter.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was Professor Peirano-Garrison, who ran it (Qu. 10). The largest flaw of the course, in my opinion, was the decision to have two students present at each meeting. People varied in the amount that they would submit to be read and the time at which they would do so, and having to heavily engage with two (often alien) works for each class was challenging. Not only was it difficult to prepare for each session, but the sessions themselves seemed somewhat unwieldy and incongruous because of the back-to-back presentations. Ideally, only one student would have presented per meeting. Another flaw of the course was its nebulous role as a \"mandatory\" course. I think the class should either be optional, in the form of the current WIP, or mandatory in the sense of a typical class where everyone enrolled comes to all the sessions. I think its current status led to uncertainty about general expectations for the course. I am unsure of the following idea, but the process might have been improved if the person(s) presenting in the following meeting would have included a few simple questions about their work posed to readers to indicate the intended direction of discussion. Being given a work-in-progress and told to comment on it was a useful experience but sometimes left me feeling like I had nothing to say.",
    "This was a useful course in many ways. I personally received excellent practical feedback that was generously given both verbally and electronically. The atmosphere was supportive and the regular participants were eager to help each other succeed. That being said, I was hoping for more faculty involvement. Although Irene's presence was vital, and students gave each other helpful comments, our time could have been better spent if advisers came on the days their students were presenting. One scheduling suggestion is to put students with common advisers\/committee members on the same day. It would have been beneficial to hear the kinds of feedback that faculty give their students, since many of us are teachers-in-training and need to give our own writing feedback, and I believe much of what our professors have to say can be applicable to all student writing. Many of us students already read each other's work on a regular basis, so this time slot could be better utilized for professorial feedback. Another issue was with consistency. Both the page count and submission deadline should be more firmly enforced. Some participants noticeably put in more effort than others, both in attendance and the quality\/amount of feedback. Also, the type of feedback varied from formatting to argument-related and everything in between. It might benefit everyone for the week's presenters to highlight what they need help with most and\/or specific sections needing the most work. Finally, when I first heard about this seminar, I was not expecting it to happen every two weeks. Every 3 or 4 weeks would have been preferable for me this semester, and perhaps 3 instead of 2 student presentations per session."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This is a great way to stay involved in your peers' work when you are no longer taking courses together and reap the benefits of their involvement in your own work. It is also an opportunity for professional development. Analyzing other graduate work is a learning experience, as is giving your feedback in a collegial and productive manner.",
    "Yes. The course provides excellent opportunities for improving review skills and receiving feedback on written materials.",
    "This workshop has been essential for me for two reasons: first, the deadline of my own presentation forced me to think, write, and correct a chapter of my dissertation. It made it fit into my dissertation writing schedule and that was a huge help. Second, I got to know about the work of other graduate students in the Classics department in a way that goes beyond the elevator speech or the content of casual conversations. That is why, in my opinion, it is very important to attend such workshops.",
    "I think it needs to be tweaked before being offered again, especially in the capacity of a course that is required as part of the program. As it stands, the WIP system already in place may be a preferable forum for one wishing to present their work-in-progress, given its simple and accessible format."
