   "comments": [
    "English 126 is an intensive course in Milton, Pope, Wordsworth and Yeats. I would recommend it to someone who is very interested in learning more about these poets specifically or more generally how to approach analyzing poetry. However, it is a tough class that requires a lot of essay writing so I would not recommend it to someone who is not passionate about the subject.",
    "Yes. You obviously have to take it if you want to be an English major, but I think the reading is generally manageable and easy to read. This class is extremely dependent on your professor, so try to shop sections if you can.",
    "I would really recommend taking this class with George Fayen. At first, it'll be confusing, but if you stick with him, you can feel yourself getting smarter.",
    "English 126 is a solid survey of English literature taking you through Milton, Pope, Wordsworth and Yeats. If you're prepared to do the reading and write an essay for each author, I would absolutely recommend it for any student who is either a prospective English major or interested in getting a fundamental overview for a study of the Western literary canon.",
    "English 126 is A LOT of work - five 5-8 page papers, one final, and several one-page memos throughout the semester - and you should be prepared to commit a lot of time to it. Still, it gives you an excellent grounding in poetry from Milton onwards and it's gratifying to see the lines of development across the four poets emerging at the end of the course. Fayen is a good professor for those who are comfortable discussing literature in elevated, abstract terms, and who don't need any help with the basics of English paper-writing.",
    "A fantastic introduction to the English language. Everyone at Yale should read Paradise Lost at the speed and level of exploration of this class. Learn how to read not only poetry but the English language in this class!",
    "This is a good class--Paradise Lost is great, and the other students are pretty much across the board interesting and motivated. Professor Fayen is sweet but leads classes in a very circuitous way, focusing on many small details that don't necessarily add up. When we met about my papers, he encouraged me to disregard the thesis and just write with momentum. So...it can be a bit confusing.",
    "If you're not an English major, take it for a general introduction to poetry: it covers the greats.",
    "Interesting class. Good readings. The highlight was definitely the time with Milton. Most people who take it are English majors. No reason not to take it, except for the frustration with the teacher and the old-school grading.",
    "Reading through the great poets, paper-writing as meditation."
