   "comments": [
    "If you like to read, if you like to write, if you like to talk about reading and writing, do it.",
    "It's a wonderful class in which you'll be reading not just great works of creative writing, but also plenty about the theory of writing. You'll also be doing plenty of writing yourself. I would recommend it for anyone interested in writing, regardless of experience level or talent. Professor Deming could make a Nobel winner out of a Capuchin monkey.",
    "You need to be pretty devoted to creative writing. This is listed as an intro course, but it demands a good deal of time and dedication.",
    "A great introduction to creative writing, especially if (like me) you haven't written creatively before. The course has three units (on prose, poetry, and drama), so you don't really get the chance to practice and develop your skills in any one of them; that being said, it's fun to try all three and learn where your strengths lie. It helps you become a better reader of all genres, especially because the class brings in frequent guest speakers who are often quite famous and successful writers.",
    "This is a great introduction to creative writing. TAKE IT WITH DEMING. He cares so much about his students and provides insightful feedback on your writing. Be aware that he has very high standards-- but that he is immensely helpful in getting your work up to them. Expect one page single spaced responses to even a 15-line poem!Lecture\/seminar format worked decently well. The other members of your section are quite important, as they will dictate the quality of workshopping that occurs.",
    "Yes. It is a great intro course for someone who has never taken a poetry, fiction, or play-writing class. I had never practiced writing any of the three forms before and found the class was very helpful, both for the forms we were studying and for my writing in general.",
    "ENGL 123 is a truly wonderful course. If you have any interest in trying to write fiction, poetry, or drama in a supportive environment with a great teacher, take this course! It's fun and only as much work as you choose to make it. Your final portfolio will include revised versions of a short story, four poems, and a scene, though you will do some other small writing along the way. Another great part of the course is that great speakers like poet Louise Glick and playwright Sarah Ruhl come in to lecture students in-person about their art; it's a great learning experience.",
    "Engl 123 is an excellent course for anyone interested in creative writing, regardless of your writing background. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes take it! Wish there was more time on each unit but it is great!",
    "Take this class with Deming! No matter your comfort or level of creative writing, this was a great into class. Not very reading heavy, but you will do a lot of writing (I don't know how it's not a writing credit), and your writing will improve if you put in the effort. Deming reads everything and gives comments- it's a great class, take it if you get in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is interested in creative writing, regardless of your major. It's a great intro course.",
    "This is a really, really great class. It's a combination of small, seminar-style discussions, workshops and critiques and then bigger lectures with published authors. There is almost no other opportunity like this at Yale- to take a writing class without havingto apply and without prior writing experience. Which is not to say if you have written before you shouldn't take it. Even if you have taken a writing class in one genre, this class gives you the opportunity to try your hand at poetry, fiction and drama. Take it with Deming if you can- he's the best.",
    "If you're looking for a sampler of different kinds of creative writing, take it. Even if you think you've settled on one form, take it anyway-- I thought I would enjoy the short stories most, but I fell in love with poetry during the class.",
    "TAKE IT."
