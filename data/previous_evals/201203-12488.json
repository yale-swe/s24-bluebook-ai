    "The class was a mess because students started out this semester with different levels of Persian. Some had a very weak foundation, while others, were familiar with high level vocabulary with their previous exposure to Arabic. There was even a student whose mother spoke Persian and as a result could speak the language quiet fluently. It took time for the professor - who was new - to adjust to this as she definitely tried, but it didn't work out very well. Hopefully, in the future, the students' level will be more homogeneous.If you started Persian at Yale though and are familiar with Shayesteh's teaching style and pace, I am sure that your L3 experience would be very different. Besides, if you want to learn Persian at Yale, there is no other option.Persian is a beautiful language though!",
    "Intermediate Persian class. Take it if you want to learn Persian and you're ready to work hard (or already know Arabic)",
    "Yes, I recommend this course. It probably helps if you are fluent in Arabic or if your family speaks Persian at home.",
    "Take it if you're interested and can bear a very demanding instructor",
    "Shop it first. Farsi is a cool language, to be sure, and will open up a lot of doors in foreign affairs, if that is what you're interested in - but make sure you fit well with Prof. Shayesteh and like the approach of the class. It was a lot of work, in my opinion, without a lot of payoff, but I'm sure things will be better the second time she teaches. Just know this won't be L3 Spanish."
