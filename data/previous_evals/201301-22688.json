    "yes, it is a course that will help you improve",
    "I would recommend it. It's a great class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who would like to 'revive' his or her Spanish skills. I don't think I became fluent in any way by taking this course (nothing beats going abroad and putting your language skills in practice), but it was still an excellent way to get back into Spanish while reading some pretty interesting articles and novels.",
    "Conversational spanish isn't going to be offered again, but I would recommend not taking a class with Barbara Safille. She wasn't terrible - if she's all that will fit in your schedule don't freak out or anything - but try for someone else if you can. She talks a LOT and isn't clear and gets overwhelmed all the time. When I noticed her craziness during shopping period I thought it was just the beginning of the class and she would change, but she was actually exactly the same through the whole semester. Avoid if possible.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone looking to practice their spanish in a relaxed atmosphere. The workload is not bad at all, and you get to know your classmates well.",
    "It is a spanish class with almost no grammar which is really nice, but if your grammar is not very good I do not recommend it. I also do not recommend it unless you need a language credit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class.",
    "Rumor has it this course may be disappearing in the future, which is a shame. It is an excellent way to learn spoken Spanish, since class was all about discussion, and it was definitely the right choice for someone who wants practice in real-world discussion more than academic topics like literature. The themes were varied, but some (immigration, ethics, the novel at the end) were great conversation topics. The level of discourse was high, hovering just below that place where you can discuss real issues without worrying about fluency. The workload was lighter than the 1.5-credit courses (ie, L4); it was slow and steady, with a little reading for each class and an occasional assignment, a great structure for language-learning I think. Barbara is dedicated and passionate, although she is also decidedly bipolar. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re considering her, whether for this or another course, go to the first few classes. She might say that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re different, that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking more than normal or something, but that is not true; the first classes are actually fairly representative of the semester. I personally think she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great professor, but I am well aware that she can be polarizing, so trust your gut."
