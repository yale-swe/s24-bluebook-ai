    "This class is a mix of Russian history and culture, so you should take it if you're interested in either or both of the two. It would be a perfect class to take Cr\/D\/F. You will get out of this class what you put into it.",
    "Take this course! You'll love Russian culture.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The reading and coursework is not too heavy, and the material is fascinating. You typically would not learn any of this information in another course, so I would recommend taking this course if you have any sort of interest in Russian history.",
    "Would definitely recommend if you are at all interested in Russia. Russian art and literature are amazing, you'll get to read some wonderful stories and watch some great movies in the class, and it's all integrated very well into the Russian historical narrative. The course really gives you a sense of the intellectual history of Russia, and how that arose from the political events to create the complicated Russia that exists today."
