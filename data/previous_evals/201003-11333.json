   "comments": [
    "It is a collection of pharmacological principles with some great lectures and some less interesting and less informative lectures. I would recommend this class to another student just because I learned a lot about both health issues and therapies\/therapeutic targets and got to interact with faculty in a small discussion-like setting. This was my favorite class this semester.",
    "The course offers an introduction to basic pharamcological principles (e.g., pharmacodynamics), as well as an introduction to the most common pharmacological targets in various areas\/diseases as well as some specific pharmacological agents.",
    "I would recommend pharmacology 504. It gives a wide understanding of different drugs on the market.",
    "I would recommend the course. It covers fundamentals of pharmacology important to continued pharmacology study."

   "comments": [
    "Several segments of the course will help with future research and the course put the whole pharmacology field in perspective for me from finding a therapeutic target to finding a drug to getting it approved and starting a new company.",
    "I had little knowledge of the specific pathways and targets of common pharmaceuticals, and this course introduced me to many of them. In general, this type of overview gives me a better idea of the types of pharmacological targets that can ultimately prove valuable for drug development, and this perspective allows my future research to remain pharmacologically relevant.",
    "This course highlighted a number of hot topics in pharmacology. It did not greatly deepen my knowledge of the profession, simply because I was already well aware."
