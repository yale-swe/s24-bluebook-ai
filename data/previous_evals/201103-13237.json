   "comments": [
    "Strengths: having math assignments to help us apply equations and concepts to real-life problems, having two papers to help us apply toxicology to everyday problems whilst putting what we've learned to use.",
    "This class had really interesting subject material, but it was conveyed in a way that was very confusing and not necessarily well structured. It's very difficult to cover all the material necessary to get a basis for toxicology in one semester, but I think it could have been done better.",
    "The course would benefit greatly from homework assignments that guide the students to the information that the instructor considers seminal. It was extremely difficult to go into the mid-term examination so late in the semester with virtually no feedback beforehand. Though I did well on the mid-term exam, it was unclear to me what was expected of us on the examination. As a result, preparation was extremely difficult and stressful. The course would also benefit from following a text book more closely, giving students additional grounding in the material. Though the text book was helpful in clarify confusing points, the course did not follow the book closely and therefore it served only as a supplement.",
    "I liked that Dr Borak gave us lots of examples to illustrate concepts.Overall, I found toxicology to be very interesting, but if I didn't have a solid foundation in chemistry I think some of the material would have been difficult to understand.",
    "good",
    "I very much disliked this course. It was extremely unorganized. There was little stated of what was expected for us to know. There were no review sessions and class time was not used effectively but rather to talk about things that were of no relevance.",
    "This course is a great introduction to toxicology that is accessible to a wide range of students. The content was well-selected and well-presented. I would have liked to have more intermittent assignments to act as a more consistent gauge of progress, whether in the form of weekly short homework assignments or quizzes. Until the first midterm, I was genuinely unsure of whether I was on the verge of failing or whether I had a secure grasp of the course material, and it would have been helpful if expectations were made more clear from the outset.",
    "could learn a lot",
    "I thought the course was very interesting. I thought it was confusing at times and would have liked to have had further readings to go with the slides beyond the first half of the semester.",
    "It's good.",
    "This course was very challenging and really confusing. There is a large amount of material on exams. The grading system is still very unclear to me, was never discussed in the syllabus, and seemed to change every time we asked an instructor how we would be evaluated.I was very disappointed in this class - it seemed like it had potential to be an outstanding and interesting course, but it proved to be more of a \"can you figure out exactly what the instructors want to read in your papers\/exams and regurgitate information that agrees with these expectations\" type of course, rather than one that allowed us to explore how toxicology could be utilized within the scope of a student's individual interests.",
    "I didn't like this class very much, which is disappointing considering the material could and should be really interesting. It was a very dry lecture class, but the main problem was that nobody knew what their grade was throughout the semester. We had 4 things that were graded: two papers, midterm, final. We had a number grade on our midterm but the first paper was returned late in the semester with a HP\/P\/H type of grade and no one knew what that translated to. The second paper was turned in later in the semester and not graded before the final exam so everyone was in the dark about where they stood going into the final, which is a very uncomfortable position.",
    "Course was presented very thoroughly and simply for an introduction to Toxicology course - great professor who made the material applicable and highly interesting!",
    "This course is very good if you have a strong science background or want to go into toxicology. For everyone else, it's very technical and boring.Something to be fixed: all of the assessments come in the second half of the course. It's hard to know if you're doing well or failing until it's too late to drop the course or fix your understanding. The midterm, 2 papers and the final all come in the last month of the course. That's not fair to students. There's no time to fix what you don't understand b\/c you continually have to move on to the next assignment (which assumes that you understood the last one.)Something else to be fixed: There should be prerequisites for this course including biology, chemistry, or organic chemistry. The course relies on the fact that you know basic scientific principles. If you don't you're going to sit in the bottom of the class. I had no science background yet was required to take this class. When I saw the TA for help and she realized I had no science background, she said \"oh dear.\" That's not good. But at least she was willing to help me out.",
    "With a couple of exceptions, the lectures were interesting and well planned. It would have been helpful if the professor had assigned specific page numbers from the textbook (rather than having us pick through it for the sections relevant to a particular week\u0092s lectures). Also, some lectures (eg. TCE) were very detailed and it was easy to get lost in the details. Starting and ending the lecture with a clear statement or some bullets explaining what we should be taking away from the lecture would be helpful.",
    "Overall, I disliked this course. Sometimes the lectures were interesting but often the material was difficult to grasp. The organization of the course is poor. Assignments need to be better spread out across the semester (The majority of the work occurred during the last half)",
    "Just a mess. The class is set up where you literally have NOTHING at all the first half of the semester. And then in November and December you have a midterm, final, and 2 papers. Just terrible structure that is very stressful for everyone.",
    "The introductory section of the course was good. It gave necessary background and presented fundamentals of the subject matter. As the course progressed and the topics became more focused, the material presented did a good job of explaining individual examples.",
    "The course presented some very interesting concepts and topics. Some of the topics were difficult to understand.",
    "Weaknesses: The exams were detailed so studying for exams consumed SO much more time compared to other YSPH classes (and especially for an EHS class that is only a general YSPH requirement course). Students spent more time in studying for (and stressing over) this class than the other EHS class offered this fall, given that both classes were general requirements.Although power points were available as notes, the power points and the lecturers could have been better in explaining the concepts more clearly. Sometimes the power point notes lacked enough information to give the students a clear understanding of the concepts and referring to the book was a waste of time. The book did not offer the information that the instructor expected us to know. Thus, the book rarely served a purpose because it did not serve to complement the lecture.Lastly, since no formal structured outline of the major topics covered were discussed or given to students in order to guide them in studying for the mid-term and final exams, it was hard to know what concepts the instructor stressed and wanted to test the students on. There was SO much information, so an outline of what the instructor thought was essential should have been made available. It should not be about guessing (even if it is an educated guess) on what topics and\/or how the professor would test us on certain topics discussed in class.",
    "Interesting content but personally I found the professors' teaching style was erratic and often hard to follow.",
    "Strengths:Weaknesses:The second paper - do something more applicable to the class population.",
    "I was really excited about this work. The material at hand is of great interest to me. I believe the expectation of material we had to memorize for tests was too much. There was too much material to be expected to analyze and master for an introductory courses. Perhaps the best solution may be to offer an alternative more in depth Toxicology course other than this one and make this more introductory.",
    "The material is very interesting, but I felt very unwelcomed",
    "Sometimes the class is a little bit difficult to understand.",
    "strength: I feel like I am able to understand the general principle and theory behind toxicology studies. I am now able to follow toxicology mechanisms and determine why it is important to epidemiology.weaknesses: I did not like the teaching style of the instructor. It was difficult to determine what is and isn't important from the lectures. The instructions for the assignments (papers and math sets) were also not clear. For example, mathset 1 had questions on the degree of ionization, but we were never taught how to find the degree of ionization. Almost every body missed the questions because we were never taught this topic. The instructors also had a condescending tone when going over the assignments, asking why we didn't know how to do these problems.",
    "I thought this course was really interesting, but it has a few flaws. First, the construction is really weird- having a midterm only a couple of weeks before finals meant that 75% of the material was crammed into the midterm, and then the final felt like a repetition of the midterm. I thought the papers were really good projects, and it seemed like everyone learned a lot from them.",
    "The subject matter was not very useful for the MPH degree. The teacher expected an understanding of the material which is not necessary for the degree that students are obtaining. The course would be better if it focused on broad concepts rather than specific mechanisms.",
    "Interesting content. Could give more guidance for the papers.",
    "The way the course was structured gave us an excellent introduction to toxicology and a manner of thinking about toxicology and public health that will serve us well whether or not we continue with toxicological studies. I really liked the way we learned using examples, allowing for previous material on basics to be concretely applied to examples. I thought that the concepts and the manner of thinking was well explained and exemplified and that this prepared us well for the writing of papers\/exams. The only thing that might be improved is the setup of assignments- I felt that there could have been more work at the beginning and that the end of the course was very heavy in terms of workload.",
    "Not useful. Poorly taught.",
    "Strengths: The topics discussed were interesting; the papers were great opportunities to independently explore topics in toxicology.Weaknesses: We did not receive any feedback\/grades before the semester was more than halfway over; expectations for the papers were not very clear until after they were turned in; a couple of critical lectures\/homework reviews went past the designated time and I felt like I missed critical material since I could not stay.",
    "The course could be improved by providing clearer expectations of what is expected by including a grade percentage breakdown by exam\/paper.",
    "The course overall was very interesting and strove to emphasize approaching toxicological issues in public health from a critical thinking perspective. The first half of the course, before the midterm, was excellent and laid a great foundation for toxicology in general, as well as establishing terminology and mechanisms. After the mid-term, however, it felt that the course became incredibly specific in one or two topics and it was difficult at times to understand what the most important points were and what to focus on. That being said, Dr. Borak and Cheryl were very good about advising and explaining these points."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He was a great teacher. He always had examples to share with us and made concepts easy to understand. He formatted the class in a logical manner so that a base could be established from which everything else we learned could build upon.C. Fields was a fair instructor. She often seemed nervous and would rush through her lectures skipping several slides at a time. She was more concerned with getting through the material than explaining the ideas and making sure they could be understood. Lectures given by her had to be learned on my own time.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is obviously very well versed in toxicology and is very eager to help students, which was helpful throughout the semester. However, many times his explanations would be very wordy, which would dilute the message that he was trying to get across, and make it harder to understand the material.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Brings lots of experience and outside knowledge to the table. No question is too difficult or too simple for him.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The instructor is passionate about the material and clearly enjoys teaching. I enjoyed his lectures. However, the instructor was often unclear about expectations, which is what made the course difficult. If expectations were laid out more clearly, either through homework assignments or verbal directions, the course would likely have been a pleasure.The assistant instructor had a problem managing time. The answers to homework problems and exams were not posted online. However, the assistant instructor ran the class over up to an hour late going over those problems. For students that had another class following toxicology, it was impossible to see the correct answers to the problems without scheduling an additional appointment with the instructors. This was a source of frustration.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Both Dr. Borak and Cheryl Fields are good lecturers. The PP slides they prepared were very useful, and they were always available to meet with students who needed help.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The professor along with Cheryl Fields did not use class time effectively. Instead of pointing out the key concepts and what was expected for us to learn about toxicology, the professors went so much into detail and overloaded us with unnecessary information. They did not differentiate what was important information from what was not. Also class time was very inefficient and spent discussing issues that we were not expected to know.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0I personally enjoy the instructor's teaching style. He has a way with words that is helpful in distilling a discipline that often involves complex terminology into a layman-accessible body of knowledge. I found that his lectures were as essential complement to the accompanying powerpoint slides and could not be replaced with merely reviewing the slides.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0very inspiring",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak and Cheryl were great. Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very good speaker. Very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak starts out very humorous and interesting, but students learn as the class progresses that he is really just confusing and good at talking for a long period without end. I can handle the arrogance, but I can't handlehim attempting to assume students understand challenging concepts that he does not coherently explain.Ms. Fields always seemed flustered and confused when she presented information to the class. She was often late for classes she was leading and seemed to often drop homework assignments in puddles or spill water on them. It was difficult to tell if she really understood the material, or was simply regurgitating what Dr. Borak wanted her to say.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is obviously extremely smart and he knows his stuff, but his teaching style is very dry and I felt like he didn't convey the big picture stuff very well. He would also say don't get bogged down in the details but then he would spend the entire class talking about random little details and factoids.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is an excellent professor - knows how to grab students' attention and increase level of learning within the classroom - made independent study much more manageable. Willing to help outside lecture...Dr. Borak and Cheryl overall wonderful instructors!",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He's interesting some days and boring others. He knows his toxicology very well.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0J Borak: delivered lectures well and kept my interest during class.Cheryl Fields: \u0093but I digress\u0085\u0094",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak does not present information clearly. Most of my understanding of the material occurred outside of the classroom. I enjoyed Cheryl's lectures and meeting with her outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is extremely smart and has an engaging personality. With that said, he tends to go on tangents when lecturing, and it is tough to follow the train of thought of his lecture.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak was obviously very knowledgeable about the course material. His presentation style was somewhat difficult to grasp, as it was often difficult to discern what material was important and what was irrelevant.Cheryl Fields was somewhat less knowledgeable about the overall subject matter than Dr. Borak, but his influence on her was largely present during lecture. I believe the material that she presented was more difficult to decipher in terms of applicability and relevance to the overall scope of the course.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor Borak had a very thorough understanding of the material. He was very approachable and genuinely wanted to help his students as much as possible.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Outside of class, the professor seems to genuinely care about his students. However, the way in which the class was taught could definitely be improved. Refer to Question #6 for comments.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Borak likes to talk and it's hard to parse out what is useful and what is rhetoric. He's very smart and likes to make sure you know it. Cheryl is sweet and is confident so long as Borak isn't around.Honestly I didn't think that they were very good educators, obviously smart but not very good at disseminating the information they care so much about.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Looks and sounds like Geoffrey Rush. All he needs is a pirate hat and monkey. Recommended for class on Halloween next year.Gets a bit distracted and often answers questions rather circuitously. Great slides that are easy to follow later.Cheryl is great!",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Jonathan and Cheryl, I believe, were concerned for their students. They put a lot of effort in grading our papers and tests. However, till this day I do not know how grades are formulated in this class and how each assignment is distributed.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very poor job.Belittles students consistently.Very arrogant and patronizing.Please find a new Toxicology instructor.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Sometimes hard to follow the thought of the teacher.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor Borak seems like a really fun guy- I think his anecdotes add to the lecture, but I also felt that they sometimes muddy concepts by adding too many examples, which can make them easy to mix up. I also think that he sometimes forgets what he has emphasized in lecture when he is writing the exam; for example, a student in our review session asked if there would be definitions on the final, and though he said there wouldn't be, there were two questions of that variety.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Class was interesting and the professor was engaging. He is clearly passionate about toxicology. However, he expected students to also want\/need to learn this information as a toxicologist rather than making it something that could be more usefully applied to the MPH program.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Knowledgeable in what he teaches.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Jonathan Borak is fantastic- he is an entertaining lecturer and very articulate in everything that he presents. In office hours, he was extremely helpful and not at all condescending despite his extensive qualifications. He made such an effort to make sure to meet with me and ensure that I was understanding the concepts, especially for the papers. It was a pleasure to be in his class and to get to know him.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Borak is an okay teacher. He just reads from his powerpoints mostly. His assistant, Cheryl is horrible. She is easily confused about the information. In several instances she didn't even know what she was teaching. She clearly doesn't have a mastered grasp of toxicology and should not be teaching the course.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The instructor's lectures were engaging. I did not feel that he was always sensitive to students' varying levels of knowledge\/understanding of the material.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is an incredibly intelligent and enthusiastic professor. I greatly enjoyed his lectures, particularly tangential stories to the power point lectures.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak was an excellent instructor with an engaging style. He never rushed through topics that would have otherwise been difficult or completely impenetrable. The lecture slides were very helpful and were usually posted before class."

   "comments": [
    "This was a good course. It was a bit intense but was well-formatted. I would recommend this class to other students because it helps to understand exposures and how different materials can affect people differently.",
    "If you're interested in the material, definitely take it - it's a really cool subject and Dr. Borak has a lot of experience with it. However, if you're not interested, this will be a long semester.",
    "A survey course of toxicology principles, that will give you insite in dealing with such issues in the professional world.",
    "I would not recommend the course to another student only because of its lack of structure and expectations. Though I feel as though I've learned a lot about the material at this point it the semester, it was not without an extreme level of stress (more so than any other course I've taken at the university so far). The stress was unnecessary and only due to a lack of clarity of expectation. If this aspect of the course were improved, I think another student would benefit from the material, which was quite interesting.",
    "The course was interesting. However, for someone in the SBS or policy track it might not be particularly relevant.",
    "I think this course is not very useful for public health students",
    "I do NOT recommend this class for another student. It is not what I expected coming from a very science intense background. I thought that the class was going to be more fulfilling, but I did not take away much at all from it. The class discourages you from using an epidemiological approach which contradicts being in public health. Studying for the test is a guessing game because you have no idea what will be on there since there are no review sessions or practice exams. They bombard students with loads of unnecessary information, which only confuses us and gives us unnecessary stress.",
    "A little disclaimer before I begin: I did well in this class, so this evaluation is not fueled by anger due to a bad grade, but more due to the frustration I had towards it this entire semester.This course is not intended for someone without a chemistry background. Although the title of this course is 'Introduction to Toxicology', the material is presented assuming the entire class understands fairly complex biochemical concepts. Dr. Borak reiterated himself multiple times saying that the goal of this course isn't to memorize the material, but to understand the concepts. I hope that this evaluation is a clear warning to those without knowledge of biochemistry to avoid registering for this class.The grading scheme of this course is also not explained at any point during the semester, and is still not clearly understood by the students.",
    "This course may seem intimidating, especially to a student without a strong background in organic chemistry of molecular biology, but such a student would be surprised at how accessible the course material is. It is a great introductory course that teaches us how to see beyond the minutae to grasp the bigger picture, which is essential as a gateway to pursuing more advanced topics in toxicology.",
    "exam is a little bit difficult, and two papers are not easy to write out, but you could learn a lot from this course",
    "good intro to tox. It is one of the two EHS courses we can choose from. It was interesting and sounded better than the other option to take. Helpful to have a science background but not necessary.",
    "It's a good class.",
    "Unless toxicology is REALLY something you find interesting, do not take this course. If you're on the fence between toxicology and contemporary issues in EHS - TAKE CONTEMPORARY ISSUES - you will be so happy you did!",
    "I suppose I learned a decent bit but I still don't think I would recommend this class to someone. The exams are pretty difficult and the lectures are really boring.",
    "Introduction to Toxicology is an excellent course - highly recommend!! Easier if you majored in biology or chemistry in undergrad and have taken organic chemistry before - if not, Dr. Borak and Cheryl are always willing to help.",
    "As stated before, it's a great technical course, but is very detailed for anyone looking for a survey course. It's also a lot of work in the latter half of the semester. Don't take it if you don't like chemistry or biology.",
    "Read, remember, regurgitate. If you would enjoy memorizing 500 slides, this is the course for you.",
    "Do not take this class if you don't have a strong science background.",
    "Not a great class. If at all possible, I would avoid. There is a serious need to re-structure the format of test and paper distribution throughout the semester.",
    "The entire structure of the course was and remains mysterious to me. I have no idea what percentage of my grade that any of the assignments and tests constituted. The fact that the first test consisted of approximately 75% of the entire course material and didn't occur until 2\/3 of the way through the semester was confusing and made preparation difficult. Additionally, the final exam consisted of much of the exact same material from the first exam, which made me wonder what the purpose of the first test was to begin with. I don't necessarily agree with the grading thus far, as i find it, for a lack of a better word, nitpicky. The instructors stressed not getting caught up in the details of the material, but then penalized answers which did not contain the exact details for which they were looking. Much of the material given for writing papers left questions unanswered and the topics were incredibly open ended. Additionally, I never received a grade for my second paper, meaning that, as I type this, not only do I have no idea of what percentage of my grade that my papers and tests make up, I'm also unaware of my grade on 2 of the 4 major assignments. Taking these issues into account, I would probably hesitate to recommend this course to another student.",
    "Although this class had less work load per week, overall, studying for exams balances this out. The lectured materials were detailed so studying for exams consumed SO much more time compared to other YSPH classes (and especially for an EHS class that is only a general YSPH requirement course). Students spent more time in studying for (and stressing over) this class than the other EHS class offered this fall, given that both classes were general requirements. So, unless the way in which this course is taught is changed, expect to put in time studying for one's mid-terms and final!",
    "No. I felt like their hearts were in the right place but that didn't take away from the distress this class caused me and I didn't feel as though it was worth what I actually got out of the course. In general I have nothing to say nice to say about this class or the professors. I would not recommend this course.",
    "Interesting, not too much work. Recommended over the other EHS core options.",
    "I don't think I would recommend it to another student. I think that if there were some restructuring of the course it could be a very good course. Jonathan and Cheryl are very knowledgeable in their field. New teaching techniques other than seminar style should be used for students to better absorb content and apply.",
    "Take another class, because toxicology is taught very poorly",
    "May not recommend.",
    "I think this is a very interesting class, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a chemistry background. I think those who had this background had a much easier time with the concepts and especially the papers.",
    "The choices for fulfilling the EHS requirement are not that great. If you have a background in chemistry then the class is at least interesting but the information learned is minimally useful for the MPH program.",
    "The course is an introduction to toxicology and you will be exposed to all the common and classical toxicological problems. The course also teaches you how to think about mechanisms and toxicological\/mechanistic considerations in epidemiological studies. The course is a lot of work, but it is totally worth it- it will transform the way you think!!",
    "Don't take it.",
    "This course was very interesting but most of my learning was done independently outside of the classroom. Great resources were provided and the lecture topics were thought-provoking. I would recommend that students take it if they had a sincere interest and previous coursework in organic chemistry.",
    "Of the three Core Environmental Health courses offered, I would recommend this course for those with a science background, particularly an organic chemistry background, and interest in chemical metabolism.",
    "This course presents toxicology through the lens of public health and epidemiology."
