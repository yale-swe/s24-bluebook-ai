    "This course gives a pretty good introduction to language in the brain. It address some theoretical aspects, including the kinds of questions that should be asked in order to come to an understanding, and more concrete ones like specific features of aphasia.",
    "Only take this course if you are very interested in and at least somewhat familiar with linguistics. Expect a very in-depth, specific look at the research literature rather than a more general overview of the field.",
    "Yes. It is a very challenging course, so take it only if you are interested in linguistics and some techniques in cogsci, but if you put in the work, it can be a very rewarding class. Prof. Pinango is great also."
