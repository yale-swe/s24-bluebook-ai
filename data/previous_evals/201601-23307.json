    "I wish there had been more focus on the first years. It would have been nice to present our background research, and talk about our plans for the summer (aside from the last week or two where we did so). It just got very repetitive and frankly boring to sit and listen to the same presentations over and over again, and then listed to 30 minutes of feedback that was super specific to that one presentation and usually not something I could apply to my future presentations. I did like having other people (like the presenting coach) come in ate mix things up. More of that might be helpful, or potentially bringing in other second years from other labs to hear about what they are doing.",
