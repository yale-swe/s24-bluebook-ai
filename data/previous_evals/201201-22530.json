   "comments": [
    "Yes, the material this semester is very interesting.",
    "A great course, although sometimes it's difficult to practice speaking. There are three chapter tests and about three essays. Often, it's up to you to go above and beyond - Zhou laoshi is great in posting links to materials that go beyond the textbook, but doesn't require you to know them for tests.",
    "I would absolutely recommend CHNS 155 to a fellow student. It was a good balance of class discussion and dialogue, presentations and projects, tests, and essays. I felt like I improved my vocabulary, which was especially great given that it was vocab that related to relevant issues and topics in modern Chinese society. This is a great way to keep practicing your Chinese in a fun environment.",
    "Great, not-too-strenuous continuation of the Chinese sequence. Take it because Zhou Laoshi's the best thing since 3-kuai pijiu.",
    "An excellent class. You learn a ton about Chinese culture and current events and issues in the country. You won't improve your speaking skills too much but you will learn a couple hundred characters and definitely come away from the class with a deeper knowledge of Chinese culture.",
    "Fun and engaging Chinese course. Zhou Laoshi is fantastic as always. The textbook covers a wide range of surprisingly relevant subjects and builds up your vocab in crucial areas. The main takeaways from this course are improved listening ability, understanding of more complex grammar structures, and some chance to engage with Confucianism and classical Chinese. The workload is light, however, and you may feel yourself losing some fluency in speaking and forgetting characters from time to time.",
    "A good class if your advanced-level Chinese is not all that great - good segue to harder classes like literature and film. Pretty easy otherwise. Lessons and textbook are interesting.",
    "I thought it was a great class, very easy to understand and very insightful. Learned a lot about the culture and history of china.",
    "yes!",
    "Take this course if you'd like to continue your Chinese in a stress-free class.",
    "I love the textbook that Zhou Laoshi started using for this course. I highly recommend it as a way to stay on top of your Chinese and begin learning specialized vocabulary. For those who are not taking classes on China outside of language, Zhou Laoshi does a great job of contextualizing the lessons within the culture and history of modern China.",
    "Whether you\u0092ve taken L1-L4 at Yale or are coming back from Light Fellowship, I would definitely recommend this course. Zhou lao shi really cares about his students and it shows in his teaching."
