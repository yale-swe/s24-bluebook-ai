   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Actually. It is amazing. The reading is very manageable and the topics are something EVERYONE should think about.I repeat, TAKE THIS CLASS. (If you are a junior or senior you are basically guaranteed a spot, no matter what major - it is very interdisciplinary)",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale! I would take it again in a heartbeat.",
    "This class was really, very interesting. We analyzed concepts from a variety of academic systems (not just straight sociology), and also learned a bit of science.This class is a great way to formalize your liberal standings by learning and understanding the theories that propagate class structures. Also, the work was very manageable and interesting.Definitely take it if you're interested at all in the geneticization of society.",
    "A survey of all the topics that are relevant in genetic testing that allows for students to voice their opinions and learn from one another.",
    "As a non-sociology major, this class was definitely accessible and enjoyable. The readings were interesting, current, and well-chosen. The conversations were fun, provocative, and educational. Prof. Almeling does a good job running the seminar discussions, which makes it much more of a dynamic, interactive class than a back-and-forth question and answer session.If you're interested in reading a lot about the sociological side of genetics and genetic testing, I would recommend the class. The weekly homework is about 100 pages of reading and a short summary\/response. These are supposedly graded pass\/fail, but we didn't get feedback or grades on any of them except for one.Not a super hard class in terms of work and a great introduction to approaching current issues from a sociologic perspective.",
    "SOCY 311 is an in-depth conversation-led seminar about the intersections of racial identities, gender, and the genetic testing industry. I would recommend this course to other students, but warn that there is a lot of reading and the course lacks some structure. Otherwise, great course!",
    "Look over the syllabus from last year, and if the material sounds even remotely interesting to you, take it. It's probably been the most thought-provoking, eye-opening class I've taken at Yale, because it made me question all sorts of assumptions I'd had about the so-called \"objectivity\" of science. We studied genetics from many different angles -- research, medicine, commerce, personal experiences of living \"at risk\", and more. The readings were so interesting that I looked forward to doing them! Professor Almeling is also very nice and great at leading discussions. There's a long paper at the end, but since you can write it on whatever you want it's easy to find a cool topic. Take it!!!",
    "Readings are really interesting, but discussion can be a little disappointing depending on your classmates. It's easy to get into personal experiences in this class and that's cool sometimes but other times it gets distracting. Take it though, the readings make it worth it!",
    "Yes, take this course-- and make sure to participate: it is only as illuminating as the comments your classmates offer for your reflection and feedback. So contribute: your insights (however unrefined or genius) will enrich everyone's experience",
    "Really great class. I had a lot of experience talking about genetics in other classes at Yale but I found this class still had a lot to offer and tied together a lot of loose ends. The workload is absolutely manageable and the professor is great. If the subject interests you, definitely take the class. Just be warned that the discussions are guided but often get off track - two hours seems long but you will run out of time almost every week and still be left wanting to continue. Don't be afraid to speak up and get your thoughts in there.",
    "This was a seminar that posed a lot of questions but never really came to any answers on the general topic of how science plays into society. If you are interested in the readings, definitely take it, as each class revolved around student discussion.",
    "Definitely! The reading is really interesting, and the material is relevant regardless of your field of interest. It raises a lot of personal ethical questions while you also learn some fascinating material about genetics."
