    "Absolutely! If you have room for it you should take it. The practicum was an amazing experience. Chapel Haven was the best.",
    "I would not take this course again. The practicum portion of the class was unorganized, difficult to get to (by taxi), and overall a bigger pain than it was worth. Maybe the experience was better with a different practicum placement (mine was at Chapel Haven).",
    "This class covers everything there is to know about autism from every angle. Tons of guest lectures from leading researchers in the field and it's taught by the most renowned researcher in autism across the world. The teacher is GREAT... funny, smart, concise, captivating. All the qualities you would want in a professor. It meets only once a week and the grading is based almost entirely on the final paper. There is also a weekly observation requirement at either the Child Study Center or one of the Benhaven Residential homes for autistic kids and adults, and all of it is extremely interesting.",
    "If you want to learn about autism and related disorders, take this class. The practicum placements (at Chapel Haven and Benhaven) are the highlight--I have some amazing memories from my time as an intern at Chapel Haven and it really helped me better understand what we were learning in class lectures. Plus it's very little work (weekly reading and one paper) and all guest lecturers.",
    "Take this class. It is just one paper, an amazing observation, and a fascinating lecture every week. You won't regret it.",
    "Definitely recommend. This class was a lot of fun to attend, and you learn a ton about autism spectrum disorders. It also gives you a really unique opportunity to work with kids. You hear from a lot of the leading researchers in the field. The professors are all fantastic- it's always great to see a video of your esteemed professor sitting on the ground trying to make a toddler laugh. They're absolutely brilliant, and manage to conduct class in a relaxed but informative way.",
    "Great class. The only assignment is a research paper at the end. Professor Volkmar is actually world famous as an autism expert. The practicum is also really great.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The practicum isoften hit or miss--you might occasionally observe something interesting, but you might also spend most of your time watching anime. Because almost every class is taught by a different guest lecturer, there is somehow simultaneous overlap and disjointedness--the lecturers don't know exactly what was covered previously. Also, don't expect this to be a seminar. There were opportunities to ask questions, but there were never any discussions.There are assigned readings for homework, but they tend to be redundant with the lectures, and I seriously doubt the majority of the class did any of the reading.Professor Volkmar is great, but he's sooo busy. He does an amazing job replying to emails pretty quickly, but it was still very obvious that he didn't really have time to devote to this class.I felt like the main message of this class was just \"hey! autism is an important field that you should care about!\" and that disappointed me, because I was looking for something that would go into a bit more depth and facilitate thought-provoking conversations and debates.",
    "An interesting class. The lectures can get a bit boring at times because there are many different guest lecturers, some better than others, but the material keeps it fascinating. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A comprehensive course on autism taught by the foremost expert in the area, with many guest lectures by other researchers that are currently making huge strides in the field. You also do an observation in one of a number of sites. I would definitely recommend the course. You learn a lot, and the work load is very manageable.",
    "Awesome class! field experience is eye-opening. a great opportunity!",
    "I would recommend this class. Although every class is a different lecturer, so it's a bit disjointed, but each lecturer is an expert so they have a lot to say and most of them are really interesting. The best part of the course is the practicum placement where you get to work with people with autism--either adults with Aspbergers at Chapel Haven or more low-functioning kids and adults with autism at Benhaven.",
    "its a great hands on experience. spending time with people who have ASD is so interesting, and the lectures are kind of disjointed since they are not really related to each other, or to your observations. they are really interesting though. Volkmar is great, he's so nice, and friendly, he brings the class food all the time, he's also really funny :) Jamie is also great, really clear and comprehensive lecturer. good class is you can get in! also be prepared to travel a looott.",
    "A great way to delve deeper into one specific disorder. The practicum placement truly makes the course, allowing you to learn from individuals with autism alongside lectures given by leaders in the field."
