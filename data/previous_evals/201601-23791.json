    "This class is amazing! If you have any interest in cultural heritage, world politics, issues of identity, archaeology, ancient history, human rights, etc, definitely take this class! You will learn to think about all these things (and more) from new perspectives, and complicate your understanding of many key issues facing the modern world. Further, Shana is an incredible teacher and makes each class an engaging, enjoyable experience. I looked forward to every meeting and wish there could have been more!",
    "The course explores connections between ancient history and modern politics and nationalism in the Middle East. It's totally fascinating and there's no previous knowledge assumed, so you learn about history and perspectives not usually taught in normal MMES courses. Perhaps at times there is not enough effort made to bridge the divide between the ancient and the modern, so this course should be applauded for doing just that. Courses on minorities are also sorely needed, as MMES courses can be a bit monolithic in their presentation of peoples and cultures in the Middle East. I mean who talks, or even knows, about the important role of the Hittites in Turkish nationalism? This course is a corrective of sorts by highlighting the diversity and complexity of the Middle East--beyond just Sunni-Shi'a. It is thoroughly fascinating and worth taking.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to any student interested in the middle east, history, religion, or identity politics. This was a really great class!"
