    "Became familiar with online databases of early modern printed sources such as The Makig of the Modern World, Early English Books Online, etc through the research project. I am sure to think of Steve's formula (have a \"why\" question, explain how others have answered the question, explain your answer to the question, explain why it matters) whenever I am putting a new project together.",
    "I learned a lot from both professors, in class and during office hours. During discussions about my research, I was always pushed to consult new sources by both instructors, think about new ways to approach my questions, and received detailed feedback from Prof. Pincus on my historiography which helped me think more clearly about the project and taking it forward. Outside of readings and class discussions, the way the course and deadlines were structured forced me to get on top of my research early on, which invariably helped me complete the project in a more professional way than other graduate courses might have. Both Prof. Pincus and Prof. Priest made themselves available and seemed interested in supporting my research by pushing me to more critically interrogate certain types of questions I had not considered but were very useful.",
    "Understanding the historical development of legal system during the period leading to American Revolution."

   "comments": [
    "I thought that the materials we read as a class were carefully selected. I was surprised by the truly global breadth of the material. The course did not focus on the American Revolution as much as I thought it would, but connected the colonies to India, the Caribbean, European Empires, etc. I appreciated the reminders from professors to come in and discuss my research project one-on-one. When working with a new person, you don't know how often they want to see you, and you don't want to ask for so much help that it's like they are doing the project for you. So it was nice to be encouraged to seek help and ask questions. To improve, maybe it would have helped to have guidance at the end of each class about what to pay attention to in the readings for next time. Some weeks' readings were pretty eclectic, and I could have used a preview of what the class would be discussing in the upcoming week. One other weakness: there were a lot of people in class that I really remember hearing from until they gave their final presentations.",
    "Great professors is the strength. Weakness would be a little bit lack of organization in terms of connection between readings."
