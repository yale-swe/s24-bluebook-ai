   "comments": [
    "Definitely would recommend it - the material is fascinating, McKee is energetic and passionate, and it is great training in reading\/writing economics papers",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who wants to get a better idea of what it's like to read and compose economics research papers. The material can sometimes be a little challenging, but that only adds to the awesomeness of the class.",
    "If you have a chance to take this class as an econ major, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST. It was a fantastic class with a fantastic professor. I didn't know how to read an econ paper going into it and came out with a really strong grasp of how to do that. Learned more in one semester than I did in the rest of my time as an econ major at Yale. Really wish I had taken it as a junior because this class is a great starting point for a senior econ essay. JUNIOR - TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Read a lot of econ papers and learn how to interpret methods and results. In addition you'll learn a lot about Latin American countries and their social programs. Professor McKee is by far the biggest strength of the class. Great professor. Sitting through presentations can can tedious at times if you know you can coast through the class.recommend it if you are interested in applying stats or econometrics, if you're interested in development in latin america, or if you're interested in having a great professor",
    "This is a great class. Professor McKee does a wonderful job and if you are interested in Latin America at all, then you will enjoy it.",
    "One of the best classes given at Yale and enormously helpful to all econ or social studies major looking to write a senior paper next year. Teaches research methods and basically by the end of the term, you will have all the econometrics tools you need to design, write, and implement a research study analyzing a hypothesis. The topics we go over in the class are very interesting also and you'll learn all about the policy experimentation of Latin America countries.Definitely take this class if you're a junior and also worth it if you're a senior. Fun class, not too much work, and totally worth the effort you put into it.",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor McKee is awesome and you'll learn about some interesting developmental economic issues in addition to understanding how to read\/write an empirical economic paper.",
    "This is an amazing class.try your hardest to take it as a junior so you can have the tools to decide whether to write a senior thesis and make it a great one!",
    "This class gives you an overview of economic challenges in Latin America and simultaneously equips students with the necessary tools& understanding to really comprehend what the academic field of economics is all about. It's a course that ties all the loose ends together -- I highly recommend it to all economics majors, even if your primary interest is not in the region of Latin America.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Without having taken any of Doug's other classes, I would recommend those to you too because he is that good of a professor. This specific course covers all of the important aspects of human capital using case studies from Latin America. DO TAKE!",
    "I would recommend this class!",
    "Human capital in Latin America: education, nutrition, immigration...and much more",
    "definitely! if you're interested in in Latin America or even just economic development this is a great class! it will really help you with your other courses.. might be even more useful to take it junior year"
