   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class. It was more work than I expected, but you get a lot out of it. Don't take this class if you want to learn photoshop or indesign. You use those programs, but they're the tools, not the subject of study. Also, do NOT take this class Credit\/D. Either you do the work or you don't.. the people I know who Credit\/D'd didn't get nearly as much out of it, and it's embarrassing to present shoddy work in front of the rest of the class. If you're interested in learning about form and function and its use in design, definitely take this class.",
    "Intro graphic design is a very theoretical way of learning the fundamentals of graphic design. I would certainly recommend the class to someone interested in actually pursing graphic design or at least something in the arts but not for someone who wants to learn how to use graphic design programs like InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator because that is not the focus of the class at all.",
    "I would recomment Art 132 to another student. The class teaches students about the basics of graphic design, such as how to compose a piece and how to convey an idea or message through the piece.",
    "Take it, but know that it's going to be A LOT of work. Be ready to dedicate a disgusting amount of time to this class if you want to learn anything. And trust me, if you do it the right away, you will learn soooo much. Not about InDesign or Photoshop, but about the building blocks of graphic design. You will see the world through different eyes, for sure. Yeju is fun and accessible, and scary smart -- great instructor, traditional yet modern."
