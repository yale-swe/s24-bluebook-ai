    "100% recommend this course. I wanted to take this course to increase and improve my Korean ability and reconnect with my heritage. By the end of this course, I can safely say that I'm able to write very strong and complete sentences, understand and speak Korean well. Professor Choi is a loving teacher who really cares about you even more as a student - she was like a second mom to me, always being very thoughtful and caring for me.",
    "Korean",
    "I improved my speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills in Korean",
    "I learned greater proficiency in the Korean language.",
    "This class helped me add onto my previos knowledge of Korean, particularly by strengthening my pool of vocab.",
    "Intermediate grammar, improved reading comprehension, increased vocabulary.",
    "Learned a lot more grammar structures that allowed us to make more complex sentences as well as more aspects of contemporary Korean culture.",
    "I learned new vocabulary and a couple of new grammar structures, but I definitely feel like my Korean got worse ever since coming back from the Light Fellowship",
    "I improved my Korean speaking, reading, and listening skills.",
    "By taking this course, I was able to refine my understanding of the grammatical structures and writing styles that comprised the Korean language. I had been familiar with a lot of words and phrases in Korean as a heritage speaker, but had lacked the foundational education that I needed to detect the nuances of the language. This course was immensely helpful to learning the differences between certain word and style choices.",
    "I learned advanced Korean grammar, contemporary Korean cultural values and expanded my general vocabulary.",
    "Broader grasp on certain grammatical concepts and understanding of select cultural practices\/ideas in Korea."

   "comments": [
    "This class is really unorganized. Compared to what I've heard about other languages L3 classes, there doesn't seem to be a lot of structure. Oftentimes it was very confusing. That and this is a heritage class but they suggest that anyone who's complete a summer abroad also goes into this class. I don't think that really works, unfortunately.",
    "Strengths - you really have a lot of interactivity in this class and you must participate. You really get what you put in, and if you want to learn Korean, you definitely will. The course did seem unorganized at times, but Prof. Choi does a really good job of teaching the material and making sure that you really understand concepts.",
    "Weaknesses - Horribly disorganized, especially compared to regular L1 and L2 (which was taught by the same professor). I'm incredibly disappointed at how poor the instruction was compared to the previous Korean classes I've taken.",
    "Professor Choi was very encouraging and engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed the course.",
    "A good class to beef up on certain vocab for non-heritage speakers. Grammar was for the most part simple and taught for hertage learners to understand. Speaking practice is limited.",
    "The class was very disorganized, and it was often unclear what we were supposed to do for many assignments. In terms of class content, I wish that we had more speaking practice. This class could be most improved if people at different levels were more accurately separated into appropriate levels!",
    "Strengths: Fun and interesting way to learn Korean. Weakness: course was a little bit disorganized so sometimes the assignments were confusing.",
    "This class needs to be separated into heritage speakers and light fellows to facilitate proper learning and teaching.",
    "The strength of this course is that we are able to learn Korean and not be afraid of making mistakes during the process. I wish the course was a little more structered at times, however.",
    "The course was overall a great learning experience because it was able to engage students without overwhelming them. It progressed at a pace that was conducive to fully grasping different aspects to the Korean language. This course was also well-organized in that it introduced material in order of increasing difficulty.",
    "Lacking strong organization, which could be very frustrating at times."

   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class only if you're heritage or have an extremely strong background in Korean.",
    "If you're a heritage learner trying to get a more formal education in Korean, sure. If you're a returning Light Fellow, you're likely going to be very disappointed with the quality of instruction compared to the kind you got in Korea.",
    "Yes, it has helped me become much more comfortable with Korean.",
    "Yes. It is fun language class that is not very stressful. Professor Choi is entertaining and caring.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you are a returning light fellow, I would consider taking L4 and skipping L3. L32 was not a good course and I feel as if my Korean got worse since coming back from Korea.",
    "Yes, I felt I was able to learn Korean in a friendly but motivated environment.",
    "yes, non heritage and heritage students alike",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students because it was enjoyable in all regardsfrom mastering the material to interacting with the professor and other peers.",
    "I think it's inevitable for students that came back from the light fellowship. I think without the proper attention to learning vocabulary, your Korean skills could regress."
