    "great things to read, great way of looking at the world, incredible professor. honestly so cool. you get to write this paper at the end looking at the cultural construction of an icon and it was honestly the most engaging and interesting paper ive ever written.",
    "A necessary, deeply fascinating and supplemental course for almost any major.",
    "The class is essentially dedicated to investigating why objects (and commodified object) in modern culture have social meanings or serve a certain iconic function, and the ways in which the \"aesthetic surface\" of these objects relates to their \"moral depths\". You spend the first few class sessions reading various theorists, and then each class session after that is focused on a specific topic (such as, the Grand Canyon, Cigarettes, Motorcycles, Movie Stars, Modernist Architecture, and so on). I think that whether or not you would enjoy the class has a lot to do with whether that sounds interesting to you and like something you want to study. There definitely aren't many other opportunities at Yale to talk about movie stars, and Professor Alexander is a great discussion leader, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a generally strong course. The first half of the semester focuses on sociological theory of aesthetics, the iconic, relationships to material culture, totems, etc. The second half of the semester applies this theory to different themes such as nature, art, architecture, branding, pop culture, celebrity, etc. The readings for the second half are especially fun. There are reading papers at the close of each half and a final term paper. I would definitely recommend this course--it offers a way to interpret the world around you.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who would like to read interesting material on aesthetics and materialism. I think with this class, it is really more focused on what you decide to make of it."
