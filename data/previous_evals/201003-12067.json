    "Take it with Tolga!",
    "Economics 108 is for those who are willing to put the extra work in, to learn a lot about microeconomics. I would definitely recommend this class. It's target is to increase quantitative reasoning skills; so those students who desire a math heavy economic course should take this one.",
    "Economics 108 01 is an introductory Econ class, with a large focus on math and conceptual thinking. I would recommend this to any student interested in Economics but with little to no background. A great introduction into the Economics field.",
    "Yes definitely take this class if you are able too. This type of seminar is much more rewarding than the big lecture and is also less work.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS",
    "Econ 108 is a great class---Tolga is an EXCELLENT professor, very helpful and understanding. The workload is manageable and the seminar setting makes it very easy to go over difficult concept in class or on the homework. Take this class if you're looking to take Econ but somewhat wary of a large lecture.",
    "I would summarize Econ 108 as a moderately difficult quantitative reasoning course perfect for those who find their strengths to be in other disciplines. The professor is always available for extra help; the problem sets can be completed in groups; and the material is such that if one listens in class, takes notes, and supplements the lecture notes with textbook reading, he or she will do well. Also, make sure to take it with Tolga. He fosters a wonderful classroom dynamic and you will enjoy learning from him even if math isn't something you usually enjoy learning!",
    "A must take, one of my favourite classes so far at Yale. You actually learn a lot, and Tolga is such a great professor that it is really hard not to understand the material or fall behind."
