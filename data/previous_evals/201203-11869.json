   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a very good evaluation of the Tudor and Stuart dynasty. If you are at all interested in the English monarchy, this is a very good class to determine how the past has influenced today's reign. Professor Wrightson makes it very very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is enjoyable and low stress. You only have to show up to lecture and section. There are two small papers which are not hard to do; you can write about anything that you want. Professor Wrightson is really engaging and kind. He's extremely approachable and knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "Survey of early modern england. Covers mostly the basics, so if you are looking for an in depth course, look elsewhere.",
    "Yes, great way to get pre-industrial credit for history majors too!",
    "It's cool and not much work.",
    "Keith Wrightson is a really knowledgeable British historian and a great lecturer. You'll get out of this class what you put in - it's possible to do well with very minimal work, but if you put effort into your essays and final you'll end up learning a good deal. Reading is super doable and the final is exactly what you'd expect it to be.",
    "Take this course! Interesting material, not too much work, and a great professor.",
    "Overall, a delightful course if you're interested in the period and\/or British history.",
    "Yes. It's very interesting and well-taught.",
    "This course was really interesting and I had never learned about British history before, so it was new information. Professor Wrightson is a brilliant lecturer and you can tell that he is an expert in his subject. There are readings assigned every week, but you really only need to complete the ones for discussion sections. There was a short paper (5 pages), a long paper (10 pages) and a final (which was 2 essays out of 20 choices). The class was super fun and totally manageable. This is a great fifth course.",
    "This is a good class to take if you are interested in learning social history, and more on your own terms. The class focuses less on big figures than on daily life or societal trends. You really can choose what you'd like to study, which keeps the stress level down because you don't worry about struggling if you miss something. Professor Wrightson is a great lecturer and clearly really enjoys teaching the class.",
    "This course is pretty straightforward in my eyes: if you like this era, you'll probably enjoy it. If you don't like this era, you probably won't. Personally, I enjoyed the class, particularly because Professor Wrightson casts a wide net and doesn't dwell overmuch on the \"big-name\" stuff you're probably familiar with in this era (e.g. the Tudors, Shakespeare, the Powder Plot, etc.). I love Shakespeare, of course, but it was refreshing to get topics like rebellion, the role of women, magic and witchcraft, etc. Also, the optional \"field trips\" to the British Art Gallery are awesome and well worth taking!",
    "I would recommend this class. It can at times be a bit boring and dry, but overall a great class.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in a taste of studying abroad. It boasts a little bit of everything - politics, social issues, economics, and even art. The period is incredibly interesting and Professor Wrightson is an engaging lecturer.",
    "Great course on political, social and religious history during 16th and 17th century England.",
    "History 251 is a great course for any student to take. The lectures, readings, discussions and ideas were all very inspiring and interesting. The topics covered in this course are very relevant and I found the lectures to be very thorough and enjoyable.",
    "This class is a look at the important trends in Tudor and Stuart England, covering nearly all of the significant topics of the time. I would recommend this class to someone who has an interest in learning more about British history. Lectures were interesting, though always brimming full of information."
