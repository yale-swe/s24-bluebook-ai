   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class as a good class to take along with a heavier course load as it is fairly little work on a day to day basis. But a significant amount of time should be spent with the material to get much out of this course.",
    "Yes - there are a lot of details, but it's fun to learn!",
    "I really did not enjoy this course. If you haven't already taken physio or neuro, it's kinda hard to follow along, and the class if full of grad students. It's nice that the assignments are take-home, including the mid-term and final, but I can't say I've learned a ton from this class. The main instructor is also really hard to understand. Also, there is no assigned textbook, which is super frustrating if you want to do any reading outside of class. I'd avoid this if you can.",
    "This was a super enjoyable course, because of the amount of responsibility it placed on the students to do well. This is a gem among upper-level bio classes at Yale. We were required to understand different concepts about membrane proteins very well in order to do well on the exams (which were take home, work with partners, and open class notes and other references), and this liberty made the class much more low-stress and enjoyable than any other upper-level bio class I've taken at Yale. If you want to learn about membrane proteins, you'll really love this class!",
    "This class is easy. Sigworth's lectures are good, so you may actually learn something. Boulpaep's lectures are incomprehensible, so you should only attend if you think they are helpful. Two to three easy homework assignments. Two take-home exams. Highly recommend for seniors.",
    "I took this class as a senior because I needed another credit when a class I wanted fell through, and I have to give the class credit for being probably the easiest class I've ever taken at Yale. However, I hated this class. It meets at 9:25 three days a week and is stone boring. Attendance waned so much by the end of the course it was ridiculous because there was no need to even come to the lectures to complete the minimal work for the class. If that's your style, go for it. But why are you even wasting your time here?",
    "A really interesting class, would recommend it for anyone looking for a high-level biology class. Really nice because midterm and final exams are take homes and collaboration is encouraged. Be sure to pay attention to the slides as they are really key and important. Don't wait until the last minute to do the exams but they are definitely interesting topics and you learn a lot!",
    "Disorganized. Informative. Strange.The profs are perfunctory. A bunch of them at the end just taught random stuff. A take home midterm and a take home final. Pretty lenient grading. Don't bother with going to lectures. Just Google the questions on the take homes. Great to get that 400+ Bio out of the way!",
    "MCDB 415 is a nice, small lecture. There are a few problem sets, a midterm, and a final. You get to collaborate with friends on them all. Halfway through the course, people stop showing to class though because there's no incentive to go :(",
    "This is a chill upper-level MCDB course. Every thing is take home so you might not be as motivated to actually learn the material, so it definitely is what you make of it. The material is fascinating though, I wish I'd been more motivated to stay on top of it (for example through weekly problem sets or quizzes instead of one big midterm and final?). The various guest lecturers were really interesting too. Don't fret too much if you aren't able to make it to every single class as long as you have friends who will help you catch up when it comes to exam time.",
    "Supposedly this class is not that difficult. That might be true, but I actually went to EVERY lecture (unlike the vast majority of the class), and I still found the take home exams to be wearisome. It's basically googling for the answers, not using stuff you've learned in class. And it was annoying since I actually went to class at 9:25 m\/w\/f. Boulpaep is NOT a good lecturer (which considering I had taken Physio, I really should've known this would be a problem), but the rest of the lecturers were fine, especially Takizawa.Because I don't know what grade I'm gonna get, I can't really say whether you should take this class. The work I put in compared to some people is annoying. Why did I even bother if we're just going to be tested on our ability to google things.",
    "It's a pretty chill upper level bio course, though not always the most stimulating. 2 take home exams and psets.",
    "The course is basically an examination of physiological systems through the study of the number of membrane channels\/proteins that regulates chemical species across the membrane. Fairly interesting stuff and not too stressful.",
    "Good course for premeds looking for application of biology. Recommend for fulfillment of requirement.",
    "Take this class!!",
    "I would summarize it as a very low-key way to learn about physiology at the cellular and molecular level and learn about it's applications to human diseases. I would recommend it to someone who's really interested in the material. Because all of the lectures are posted on classesv2 and the tests are take-home, you can get away with not going to class, but you're probably not going to learn as much...",
    "Take it! Interesting stuff, and also the assignments are just some psets and take-home midterm and final! Also, go on the hike if you have a chance. I couldn't personally, but it's a good chance to chat with professors.",
    "This is a wonderful class. I wish it wasn't early in the morning because I really did want to attend every class, but over slept a few. The class notes\/ lectures are very helpful and the psets, when we had them, were low pressure but also informative. It goes into a lot of depth at times, but the learning is on you. If you wanted to, you could make do just looking at lecture slides for the take home exams and do fine in the class and not really learn. The low pressure style is great though. It lets you learn on your own time and presents a lot of great information.",
    "Good, clear lectures.",
    "It's an alright course. Not much work, but make sure you find a good group to work with on the take home assignments.",
    "This course is a gem, definitely take it. Don't be intimidated by grad students or students who have taken physiological systems; the take home tests give you time to catch up.",
    "Fairly interesting and very easy! One take-home midterm, two homeworks\/problem sets that were around 3 (math-y) problems each, and one take-home final. Some of the lectures by guest faculty were kind of simplified, but others were actually fascinating current research. Boulpaep's clinical case presentations were also interesting.",
    "Take the class! Not very stressful but interesting material and definitely great to take senior year.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any biology or BME major. This class goes over some very medically relevant material from the molecular biology prospective. We learned how membranes are involved in numerous physiological functions. Sigworth in the beginning taught mostly the physics and math behind membrane transport. Boulpaep covered more medically relevant content. Each lecture he would start of with a medical case. There were a few p sets and a take home midterm and final. It was a very chill and educational class. And there were many great guest lecturers."
