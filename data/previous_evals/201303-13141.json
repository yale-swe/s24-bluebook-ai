    "This course is a mixed bag. It's an interesting topic, although I think you'll get a lot more out of it if you have a strong music theory background. It is attempting to be an interdisciplinary experience in the classroom, but it focuses more on the theory than the cognition aspect of the topic. There is definitely a lot of work, weekly readings and responses as well as a sizable group project of creating and performing an experiment, and an individual paper at the end of the semester. Somehow, it felt like the work I put in was not proportional to what I got out of the course, so it left me a bit unsatisfied. But if you're really interested in the different facets of rhythm, there is definitely a lot to be learned and Eve has a lot of knowledge to impart. She is really approachable and dedicated to the students and the course."
