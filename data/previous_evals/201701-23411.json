    "I think that this class could have been better organized. I would have preferred if there had been more structure to the powerpoint presentations, which may be aided by not having as many guest lecturers. Additionally, I think it would have been helpful to have organized the diseases into units, so that it was easier to group related diseases together in our minds.",
    "I loved this course because I'm very interested in the material. It was really fun to learn about different infectious diseases from someone who has been out in the field, in the lab, and worked within large institutions. Strengths include Dr. Child's enthusiasm and readiness to answer questions and explore other topics. Weaknesses include the randomness of lecture topics and having too many guest speakers-- the speakers all had different presentation styles and emphasized very different aspects of the material they presented. I know having 8:30 courses may be inevitable, but if at all possible it would be so nice to schedule this class for a bit later in the day, since it's required. I had several late classes this semester, and it was really hard to be awake and engaged at 8:30 am after spending the previous night in LEPH and trying to cram homework in, too.",
    "The guest lecturers were good, but it made it hard to keep a consistent theme throughout the course. But the difficulty of the course was right where it should have been.",
    "This course is hard to stomach as someone not interested in vector-borne diseases. I found myself constantly disengaged throughout the semester. I wish that there were more organization of the topics into discernible units\/groupings. I found the guest speakers interesting but thought the class as a whole lacked cohesion.",
    "The guest speakers made things very hard to follow and actually learn.",
    "Very good! It's great to learn about the research that EMD faculty conduct. The homework assignments were really interesting as well.",
    "This class was very strangely organized. I did not feel that there was any structure. Also we had so many guest lectures that had different styles that it was difficult to know what we were expected know and not to know. Also many of the guests were not aware of what kind of exposure we've had to the topic so sometimes it would be too simple or way too difficult and complex.",
    "I love the topics we covered and how overall concept based the class is I think it would have benefited from more administrative organization - for example if we could lump similar disease into units - that would be helpful. Also if the lectures could be posted before class rather than after we could take notes on them directly.",
    "I hope the series of lectures can be more structured by different kinds of diseases (e.g. Food borne diseases etc.), and each lecture may be in modified in a particular structure (e.g. Biology of the pathogen, seriousness of the issue, what we can do to prevent\/protect population, some cautions we should take) 1 more thing, I wish this class might have not been an early 8:30 class.",
    "The great thing about this class is the seminar-like structure. You get to hear from lots of different experts talk about their areas of focus. There is a lot of variety. However, my biggest complaint about the course is that it lacks cohesiveness. It was hard identify themes across guest speakers. In addition, the classes where we spent time brainstorming cross-cutting patterns were not very effective. I would suggest cutting the unstructured classes and filling them with more linear material. I also think it would help if every guest lecturer began with a slide or two of notes about what students should really focus on learning from their presentation. This would also assist in identifying what material to study for the exams. I might also suggest building more discussion around the homework assignments, which served as a valuable synthesis exercise for the course material. I felt like we needed to spend more time discussing the thinking of the assignments and getting feedback on our writing.",
    "I liked the course because it was interesting. The topics were great though I sometimes found the structure a little too sporadic. I would have liked the course more if we did not have a midterm and just had weekly homework assignments. I thought I had learned more through the assignments more than trying to cram and memorize stuff for the exams. I felt more engaged with the assignments. I also feel that it would be fun if instead of a final exam if we had a group project or report on present day infectious diseases and how we should approach the issue as epidemiologists or advisers for the government.",
    "The class does not feel cohesive.",
    "A little redundant from the previous semester but good information.",
    "The topics were interesting. I did feel that the course was a bit disjointed because we had so many different lecturers, and there was not necessarily a flow between topics.",
    "This course needs a lot of work in its organization and teaching methodology."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie Childs is a god among men. What an absolute gem.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0I think the strength of the class is the depth of the knowledge that Professor Childs has, as well as his passion for the material. I think the way he organizes the material makes it slightly challenging to fully absorb the concepts.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0I personally enjoyed Dr. Child's causal style and blatant enthusiasm for infectious disease. This was my favorite course of the semester because of the material and how much excitement he brought to the course. However, many of us felt like there wasn't enough structure in the lecture topics or exams. I would gladly listen to Dr. Childs lecture for hours, but I would have been completely lost studying for the midterm if not for our TA's review session. In the future it might be helpful if students were given a little more information about what to focus on for assignments and exams ahead of time.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0I really like Jamie as a person, but I found it difficult to understand what he wanted us to take away from his lectures or the guest lectures. Thus it was difficult to know what he would ask for on tests. Some of those choices remain surprising, now that I've seen the exams.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is extremely valuable to the PID series, however at times things can feel a bit unorganized.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0The instructor had an amazing background in the practical application of public health policies and was very enthusiastic about the subject material. The course was engaging and the guest lectures brought a wide variety of expertise on many different subjects.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0He is so passionate about what he does and I respect him for that. However, sometimes I felt that he was a bit absent. There were times he said he was holding office hours and he just did not show up.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Really great resource, clearly knows a lot about infectious diseases and has some great insights to share.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is terrifically intelligent and definitely know what he is talking about.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Professor Childs is great in the classroom! He brings so much practical experience to the department.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is great and awesome! Very approachable and chill. He's like a mad scientist but cool.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Great lecturer, and very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0I think more effort needs to be put into the course."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this course because I love infectious diseases. It was a really fun lecture that always got me excited about whatever disease we were covering that day. However, it's lacking in structure and I spent more time than I would have liked trying to synthesize all the information I learned before exams and assignments.",
    "This class is almost entirely vector-borne or at least zoonotic diseases. Basically the only people who will be there are second semester, first year EMD students who have to be. If I had the option, I would take two semesters' worth of Melinda's version of PID instead, but I know that some people preferred this semester.",
    "A required class for EMD, would not recommend to someone outside the department as an elective.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Important aspects of infectious disease",
    "The course is overall good, and I've learned a lot from the class. The lecture can be more structured, and hopefully it will not be an early morning class.",
    "The second semester of PID is fun and laid-back. It focuses a lot more on tropical infections and such, which I find more interesting than, say, food-borne illness. You may find it similar to EMD seminar, except with more opportunity to ask questions of the presenters. Low workload, though the midterm was challenging1",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in infectious diseases and not in EMD. If you are in EMD, it's required so it doesn't matter whether you want or don't want to take it.",
    "Be prepared to have a lot of guest speakers. Some are great, while others are not so great.",
    "Not as good as the first semester, although the topics remained interesting. If they like the EMD seminar, then they'll like this, which felt like more of the same."
