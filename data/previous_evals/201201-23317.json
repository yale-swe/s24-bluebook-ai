   "comments": [
    "You shouldn't graduate without reading these books. The course itself isn't demanding besides the reading. The essays are interesting and there aren't very many. The lectures can be a bit boring, but they are captured online so it's okay to miss. It was difficult to keep up with the pace, but luckily you could follow along in lecture even if you hadn't completely finished the books.",
    "This is a great course that allows you to read a whole long list of amazing novels and to think about them in context. Amy Hungerford is an engaging lecturer and you will learn a lot, but the number one reason to take this course is for the reading list.",
    "Great books (mostly), good lectures. Grading is rather spurious. No discussion section, which was odd. Pop quizzes, which are very annoying.",
    "I definitely recommend it. It was just plain fun.",
    "English 291 deals with very diverse subjects and writing styles, but I highly recommend it. As I mentioned, these were novels that I would not have normally chosen from the shelf. Now, I didn't enjoy every single one, but I thought each one was intriguing because it gave me a new insight into types of writing and presentation, along with the subjects of the time period. Plus, Master Hungerford is an incredible professor, so each lecture was exciting and enlightening.",
    "I would recommend this class, but the grading is harsh and without section the communication between TA and students is non-existant. In an English class, that connection is often vital, I feel.",
    "The syllabus of this class is great - all books you ought to read before you graduate. That being said, I honestly can't recommend the class. The lectures were horrifically boring, and the arguments presented were often inane and pretentious. If you're an English major who can stomach bs minutiae, you might like it. But there are much better english lecture courses out there. Prof. Hungerford is nice but I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of her lectures. The books are fantastic, but then the whole lecture picks up on one obscure feature and argues something ridiculous. Buy the books and read them on your own, or take it credit\/d.",
    "A really interesting, thought provoking, and oftentimes entertaining class. If you are an English Major definitely take it. Even if you aren't I still recommend it, but take it Cr\/D. You will fall behind on some of the readings and if you have never taken an English literature class before (I hadn't) then it will be a whole new world. Take it as an extra class and take it Cr\/D. It's a great class but not worth the stress of grades.",
    "I would recommend this class because the syllabus is great. However, I felt that the amount of reading due for each week was too significant to be able to read all of the texts, which was unfortunate. The pop quizzes were really annoying because they tested you on your ability to remember minor details, like \"what was the painting of on Giovanni's wall?\", as opposed to important concepts in the novels.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. I am an English Major and loved reading more modern texts, but I know quite a few students in the class who are non-English Majors and simply wanted to take an English class. There is only one essay, so for non-English Majors it has one of the lightest writing workloads possible. There is a lot of reading, but it is not particularly challenging reading and I almost always found it enjoyable.",
    "Great overview. Much harder than I anticipated, but then again, I'm not a lit\/english person, so critical analysis was difficult for me. But still a good class to take (credit\/D). I feel more educated already.",
    "I would recommend this course",
    "Yes.",
    "YES!",
    "yes. but you have to put in the work and read the books.",
    "This is a fabulous class and everyone at Yale, English major or not, should take it at some point! The reading list is incredible and there is no better way to go through this reading list than with a professor who really understands literature in this period and with other students who are excited about the class.",
    "Definitely take this course. The reading is fantastic and the lectures are a lot of fun. However, might be a good class to take credit d because there are a lot of little assignments that sneak up on you.A really fun course in the english department for non-majors.",
    "I LOVED this class. The lecture was amazing and it gave me space to read the books I've always wanted to get through. I felt that one of its weaknesses was the midterm. It was incredibly difficult and having taken no english lectures previously I came in very underprepared. We should have had some instruction as to how a person answers such broad prompts. If you're not an A+ writer this class is extremely difficult to get a good grade in and I think that takes away from the sheer enjoyment of the readings.",
    "Take it if you want to read a bunch of great books.",
    "Good as a credit D- you get to read great books and the lectures are good but skippable if you have conflicts (just don't miss too may quizzes. We sort of had an understanding where there were never any on mondays). Not exactly a gut though--the grading is harsher than I expected, so you'll have to work for an A.",
    "This is a great class, but it can be difficult to keep up with and the midterm\/paper are graded fairly harshly. Definitely not a great choice for a 5th class or Credit\/D.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in getting a broad overview of American literature after WWII. I feel much more well-read after having taken the course, especially since my knowledge of late 20th century literature was severely lacking before.",
    "Great class. Lots of reading -- DO NOT get behind. Got to read so many books that are now among my favorites. This class was totally worth it, no matter what grade I get. I believe this class is essential to English majors; you get such a great grasp of postwar American literature that will definitely help you in your other lit classes. Loved reading Lolita, Lost in the Funhouse, Beloved... Very grateful to have been forced to read novels I otherwise might not have read. Some of the texts are also challenging and need to be read in an academic setting (esp. Lost in the Funhouse -- now one of my absolute favorite novels).",
    "If you have the time to commit to the reading, it's a great class and I would definitely recommend it. The work isn't too bad; the quizzes are really easy if you've read. Hungerford is a terrific lecturer, and I really enjoyed it.",
    "Great class. Only work is reading a book a week.",
    "Pretty hard English class on some fascinating books. It is a lecture though, so don't expect much discussion.",
    "This course is amazing for the works you read and for the chance to listen to Hungerford's lectures, which were truly some of the most impressive I've heard at Yale. I do recommend the course but with the reservation that one keeps in mind that it is a literature lecture andthus one will likely not develop as intimate a relationship with and understanding of the text as is possible in seminars and\/or lectures with sections.",
    "I would say this is a really fun, interesting class, but it's not easy. It could be a fun class for non-english majors (i might suggest taking it credit-D fail) because the focus is on big ideas and not super analytical arguments, and Professor Hungerford also tailors some of the reading quizzes to make them easier for non-english types.",
    "You can get a lot out of this course (if you read the books on schedule) or not as much, but the reading list alone makes it worth taking. The lectures aren't the most helpful or engaging, but the TAs are approachable and it's interesting to approach reading literature in such a large group atmosphere as opposed to the seminar format that I'm more familiar with.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because I did not like the style of Professor Hungerford's lectures or the type of literary analysis she used. I would have enjoyed these books better had I read them on my own - and these are books that I would likely have read on my own, which is not true for many English courses. I would recommend watching a lecture on Open Courses before deciding to take this class.",
    "It's an amazing class if you have A LOT of time to do A LOT of reading. Hungerford is fantastic (I love her enthusiasm and passion for the work), but you're doomed if you can't keep up with the reading schedule.",
    "Yes- just to learn a bit about American literature. Only about 1\/2 of the books are good though.",
    "Amy Hungerford is as wonderful as the reading list. Take it.",
    "Great class and a very interesting syllabus. Took this as a non-English major and I found is very enjoyable. Work load is not too much.",
    "I would recommend this course. Beware that the reading load is quite substantial. If you are not an English major, I would highly recommend taking this class Cr\/D.",
    "Great course--take it.",
    "This class has a really great reading list, but maybe sit in or watch a few of the lectures online to see if you'd find it interesting before taking it. Also, even if you take it Credit-D, you do have to put in a lot of work to do all the readings.",
    "I would highly recommend this lecture. It's more work than the standard English lecture, but well worth the effort.",
    "The class is really interesting, and the reading is great. It would be better with a section. It is a lot of reading and the curve is fairly tough (curved to make the average a B).",
    "American Novel was a great course. The reading list could not be better, and the lectures were really interesting and well delivered. The work is also very manageable. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "American Novel is a great lecture course in the English department, but it is NOT a gut course. You will need to read most, if not all the novels, and it will take up a good deal of your time. If you do the reading, though, the assessments are, for the most part, fair. Be wary of taking this course if you're not a major though, since there isn't a lot of follow up.",
    "Highly recommended for a general survey course into literature.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wants to know more about recent literature -- or even who just wants to witness brilliant literary analysis!",
    "This is, I think, an absoluteley must-take class - for English and non-English students alike. Professor Hungerford is incredible, as are almost all of the novels you read (Barth is an exception). Lectures are engaging and enlightening, if occasionally somewhat over my English-major head, and the paper is actually fun, given the wide variety of books you get to write about.",
    "This is a good course with a fantastic reading list. Professor Hungerford is a very good lecturer, and her analysis was helpful and insightful. There was one annoying aspect of the course that detracted from my experience, however: in exchange for an hour-and-fifteen-minute class period, Professor Hungerford dropped discussion sections but added pop quizzes. These quizzes often took up a lot of class time and actually changed the way I read books, in some cases. I would recommend this course to anyone, especially upperclassmen, but with the caveat that pop quizzes may alter your experience, if she decides to structure the class again in such a way.",
    "Great class. Awesome books awesome professor.",
    "We read one book per week, had a take-home midterm (although don't be fooled by its being a take-home; some people I talked to spent about 14 hours on it), a 4-6 page paper, and a final. I would definitely recommend it because the books were so great and Professor Hungerford is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "The books are wonderful, Professor Hungerford is fabulous, but it is a lot of work. If you're worried about the time-commitment, take it CR\/D\/F.",
    "Survey of modern American lit. A lot of work.",
    "If you're a non-English major looking to read some awesome books while you're at Yale but intimidated by some of the department's other offerings, this is a great option. The reading list is incredibly diverse, so you're bound to find something you'll like. And reading the books is--for the most part--a pleasure. Do keep in mind that the reading moves quickly, about a book a week, and there are sometimes pop quizzes to make sure you're on top of it. But Professor Hungerford is a wonderful and engaging lecturer who will show you things you never would have discovered on your own. The workload is a take-home midterm, a 5-page paper, and a final. Having a final is really annoying but the overall workload really isn't so bad. I definitely recommend this class!",
    "I have done nothing BUT recommend English 291 to friends since taking this class. If you make it one and do all of the reading, it is an \"experience,\" not just a class you check off your requirements list! I learned so much about writing, reading, people, myself...I really could keep gushing but will stop now! Just sit in on one of the first lectures and see for yourself.",
    "This class would be better as a seminar, but Hungerford is a great lecturer. Take it if you have the time and desire to complete the readings.",
    "Lits of reading, good books",
    "English 291 is a good introductory class to take, but I don't know if I'd enjoy taking another English class of this size. If you're taking it as a requirement (either for a major or distributional) then you may find it immensely rewarding, but I had a hard time with the large class size. However, it was an excellent class for its size; I think I personally just enjoy seminars more.",
    "An overview of some of the most important works of American literature in the latter half of the 20th century.",
    "If the novels being taught interest you, this is a great opportunity to read them under the guidance of a gifted teacher.",
    "Definitely take this class if you like reading fiction at all. It's fantastic!!!!",
    "If you want to read a lot of novels that you always tell yourself you're going to read--take it.",
    "Wonderful course! The books were great, and Professor Hungerford was a wonderful lecturer and professor. All the lectures were very interesting, even contestable, and she invited people over to her home for a movie viewing, which was great!",
    "Survey on american novels after 1945. A little frustrating as an English major",
    "Standard English course with low workload, just a lot of reading. Good books.",
    "As a non-English major senior just looking for an enjoyable class, this was fantastic! It really allowed me to reconnect with my love of reading. Amy Hungerford is a really good lecturer too. If you're okay with reading a novel a week, definitely take this! Work load other than the reading is light.",
    "Great class if you want to read some of the best and most noteworthy novels of the 20th century",
    "Yes! First, the reading list is a true pleasure. Students should be prepared to keepup with a sizable (but manageable) reading load, but the payoff is well worth the preparation time. If students have the opportunity to take the class with Professor Hungerford, take it - you won't regret it.",
    "Yes, yes. It's a lot of reading (a full novel every week), but you'll love almost all of it (I feel like everyone hated one book, but that's because such a wide range of material is covered). If you feel like you've fallen out of the habit of pleasure reading in college, this is definitely the class for you. And Professor Hungerford is a great lecturer! Just be sure to turn off your wireless Internet before class starts, because it's hard to stay focused for 75 minutes straight.",
    "A fantastic overview of the major works of the latter half of the 20th century in American fiction. I would definitely recommend it to another student, as the course does a great job of connecting all the pieces together, and Professor Amy Hungerford's lectures rock.",
    "Great class and definitely fun. The reading list is awesome, the lectures are interesting and there isn't too much work outside of reading. If you're able to stay on top of reading the novels each week, then this is a great course.",
    "Read a book a week and learn interesting things about it in lecture. Highly recommended.",
    "Great if you want to relive your 9th grade English class, complete with pop quizzes and lectures on how to integrate your quotes into sentences by \"fitting the quote into YOUR grammar\".",
    "In American Novel, you'll get to read a lot of really good books, and that's just the beginning - the lectures and assignments are fun and informative, and lead to a deeper appreciation of the material.",
    "American Novel since 1945 is a great class. Whatever the minor changes in the reading list might be from year to year, you'll definitely read a large number of really wonderful books, and your understanding of what a novel is will be greatly expanded. You will also certainly improve as a literary critic. Of course, this is all assuming that you will actually read. Don't take American Novel if you're not going to read; it will be a waste of your time. Professor Hungerford is an insightful, charismatic, often funny lecturer and is very willing to answer students questions, talk, meet, etc. even though it's a big class. The TAs were also very good and helpful (TAs lectured occasionally for part or all of class).",
    "Incredible class to take, even in your senior year. The books are all phenomenal and Hungerford will likely be your favorite lecturer at Yale. TAKE IT.",
    "Absolutely recommend.",
    "A lot of reading, but they are all really interesting books. Lecture is great and the Midterm, Essay and Final a are completely manageable if you've done the reading.",
    "yes - credit d is the way to go with this class. it's a great reading list but there are a lot of books.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The best English lecturer I've taken. Amy Hungerford is just the best.",
    "The reading list is excellent. Some new favorite books were discovered here. But even for the books I didn't like, Hungerford's lectures about them made me want to read them--a surefire sign of a good lecturer. Hungerford will be one of the best lecturers you see at Yale. She lectures extemporaneously from notes, which makes her far more engaging than the professors who read their lectures from paper. She actually makes lecture participatory. She always has something eye-opening to say about the books. Be careful if the class still has reading quizzes--those were a pain. Also, the grading is a little tougher than you might expect. I switched the class from Credit\/D to a grade after doing well on the first couple assignments and then wished I hadn't. It's very easy to fall behind because the class moves fast over books with lots of pages.",
    "Great lectures, great syllabus. Take it. Especially good class to take second semester senior year. One thing to be aware of--the lectures are all on Open Courses. So if you feel bad taking a class whose lectures are available for free online, then maybe not the best use of a credit. Otherwise, absolutely take it."
