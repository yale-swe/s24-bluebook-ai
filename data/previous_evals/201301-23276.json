   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this class if you want to learn how to write clearly and concisely. Make sure you're interested in the topic, which is capitalism and democracy. If you don't like this topic, you won't like this class, because almost all the readings relate to the topic. However most of the critique revolves around how the essays are written, not the content itself (although that inevitably comes up).",
    "ENGL 114 Global Markets and the Future of Democracy is a course that involves a bit of reading, but the workload is manageable. In terms of papers, you write four throughout the semester, but they're all back to back. You rewrite them all except for the last one, so you have an opportunity to improve.A thought on grading, for an intro english course, I believe Prof. Komorowski graded very difficultly. If this were an advanced course in economics I would understand the grades, but this is an introductory english class so I expected the focus to be on improvement over the year, which was not the case at all.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only if you are interested in the subject matter. It is a lot of reading that can be dull at times, but it is a rewarding course if you are willing to put in the effort to improve your writing.",
    "It's a lot of writing, a lot of reading, and not much fun. That being said, my writing did improve.",
    "Not too much work. Focus more on writing than on research. Good and useful tips for writing beyond. Reccomend",
    "This class topic and readings were very interesting, andyou will learn much more than just writing from this English class. The papers were great indicators of our progress throughout the course. I could see my improvement with each paper. Class discussions always went smoothly as long as some people did the readings.Michael Komorowski was amazing; he is one of the best professors i have had at Yale so far. Seriously. He was always very outgoing and happy to be in class, and he guided class discussions well. The questions he posed to us were ones we had not considered, which helped to enhance our critical thinking. His office hours were very flexible, and he was always willing to meet outside his office hours as well. Most importantly - As a writing class, I obviously expected to receive feedback on my essays, but I was happily surprised (almost shocked) at the amount of effort Michael put into critiquing and editing our essays. I always received a full 3 paragraph response to both my rough draft AND my final product, which were full of potential questions that I could\/needed to answer in order to strengthen my argument. He also straightened out any flaws of logic in my argument. This ways helped me to get my essay on track, and I developed strong writing skills as a result. Once again, I highly, highly recommend Professor Komorowski and his class.",
    "Yes, good intro to writing",
    "English 114 was a fantastic introduction to writing argumentative-style essays. While the main focus of the course was 'Global Capitalism and the Future of Democracy' (one that I found particularly engaging), Professor Komorowski is very forgiving when it came to choosing topics for the research paper. Prof. Komorowski is always looking for students to contest their arguments, push their motives, and strive to make claims as cogent as possible. I found my writing improved drastically by the end of the semester and has already had positive effects on how I write for other courses. Take this class!",
    "I think this is a great class for students with some background in Econ& politics and\/or for students interested in the topic that are willing to put in the time to actually do all the readings and some outside reading and research to keep on par with global developments. I really think the English department should think on investing on an English 114 section for non-native speakers, because the course becomes quite challenging with the disparate levels of exposure to writing in English. Writing tutors for international students are not enough and even after 2-3 rounds of edits papers still didn't seem to improve after months.The type of essay written in English 114 is essential and I'd recommend most people to learn how to write it.",
    "I would highly recommend the course, especially for a writing intensive fulfillment."
