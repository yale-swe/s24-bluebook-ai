    "I felt like the TAs ran the class rather than the professors. In addition, it seemed like the class was not well designed and planned because of the confusion that arose.",
    "The course's objectives (as presented) were interesting. The individual project was very useful and worth-while, and the field work was fun. However, my experience in this course suffered dramatically from what I felt was a) a lack of organization on the part of the instructors and b) what maybe seemed like a lack of time or interest on their part, as well. The lecture portion of the class was almost non-existent, even though topics were outlined on the syllabus and readings were assigned; lectures were repeatedly postponed, cancelled or presented in a manner that suggested a lack of preparation. The field work was fun, but often not thought through very well. The TAs did a great job of answering questions and helping out with projects, getting resources, etc. The workload of the course was oddly distributed: we had almost nothing to do outside of class for the first 5 weeks (and during that time, class was fun but not intellectually strenuous) and then the written labs and individual project really piled up on top of each other, and it made it difficult to give any of the those assignments the attention they deserved. I felt like what I got out of the projects was entirely based on the work I put into them: the lab write-ups took many hours of research into statistical methods, etc. - things that I felt like we could have spent more time on in class. The course at times felt more like an independent study than a course.",
    "Question 1: In the absence of several of the scheduled lectures (see below), this course could have benefited heavily from the use of a textbook (even an optional text).Questions 2&5: I was disappointed by the fact that very few of the scheduled lectures actually materialized over the course of the semester. The topics listed on the syllabus were somewhat basic given the intermediate to advanced experience level of the target audience, but I was looking forward to them as a good review of key concepts. The instructors did begin giving some of the scheduled lectures in response to student input halfway through the semester, but the overall number of topics covered was somewhat inadequate. I do not know why so few of the lectures happened, but it made the course far less useful than it should have been.Question 9: The field trips were a welcome break from the monotony of classroom instruction and yielded several excellent lessons on the application of field methods in ecosystem science. However, many of these lessons were \"don't dos\" rather than positive examples. I think this was largely due to the lack of organization surrounding the lab experiments, particularly the upland forest lab. The TAs did an excellent job lining up logistics and providing a good description of each experiment, but it was apparently very little site scouting was done by either the TAs or the instructors. This led to confusion over some very basic (and easily avoidable) questions once we got into the field on several occasions."

    "- working with the other students in the course - I found them motivating and helpful- the TAs who always seemed to have time and patience for us- being in the field",
    "The independent project. As advertised, the course offered an excellent opportunity for students to design, execute, and write up an actual scientific study over the course of the semester. This is a rarity and I very much welcomed it. However, the guidance by the instructors on the independent projects was somewhat lacking. Only because I sought out considerable guidance was I able to make my project even halfway productive. This is not a course for those who are not self-motivated! The value of the project (which I hope to explore in greater depth on my own during the spring semester) outweighed the somewhat negative aspects pertaining to class meetings and lectures."

   "comments": [
    "This class had so much potential. The complete lack of organization, especially in regards to data collection and lab instructions\/guidance really diminished what I was able to actually gain\/learn from the experiments. More guidance on the scientific methodology and theory for individual projects would have improved that component as well.",
    "The class suffered at points from lack of organization, malfunctioning instruments and guiding vision.",
    "Planning and teaching from the professors. I felt there was much more to be gained from the professors than what was given. It would have been nice to have more lectures to talk about what we were doing on the field trips.",
    "- organization- workload distribution- revamping readings and assignments: either keep them and teach skills, concepts required of them or ditch them.",
    "1. Lectures (see above; the absence of several of the scheduled lectures was really inexcusable).2. Field trip pre-planning (see above)."

   "comments": [
    "It was relatively difficult to get in touch with Professor Raymond. Cynthia and especially Maura were very prompt and helpful in their responses to any questions I had about my project or lab reports.",
    "Instructors and TAs were available and willing to discuss all aspects of coursework and were supportive with independent project concerns.",
    "Maura was an amazing TA that was always there to help me and answer questions. I contacted the professors and the TA depending on the circumstance. However, I contacted the TA much more than the professors.",
    "I felt like the TAs were available and willing when asked, but I didn't get the sense that the instructors had much time for the class. They cancelled and rescheduled more often than I would have preferred. I was really disappointed by this last point: the rescheduling and cancelling. I understand things come up, but it happened often. As a student paying a lot of money for graduate school, I felt really let down by this. I didn't feel like it was respectful of the time, effort, resources, and coordination it took for me to fit the class into my schedule. I think there is a sense that when professors cancel class, the \"kids\" are really grateful for the extra time. This might be the case once, but not really more than that - especially at the graduate level.",
    "For the most part, good. The TAs both did an excellent job. Both instructors were very good about responding to e-mail in a timely manner."

    "This course (as described) would have perfectly fit into my overall program and is important to FES in general. There is nothing else like it at the school, which offers few natural science courses to begin with. In theory, it gives you a chance to learn field techniques, stats, to read articles current to the field, and do a whole independent research project. It just needs some attention, organization and rigor from the professors.",
    "The independent project allowed me to explore scientific questions relevant to my academic program in some depth. The format allowed for exploration of specific questions (and development of experiments to test them) to a more significant degree than just about any other class at FES outside of a master's project course."

    "Not really. What I got out of it was entirely based on what I put in it. I know student engagement, etc. is an important part of what you get out of grad school, but I would have benefited more from the course if I felt like I had access to the professors' knowledge, experience, insights, etc. I felt like we got very little of that.",

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you have an existing background in ecosystem dynamics. Do not expect any hand-holding.It's a good opportunity to try out an independent project. But that does come at the cost of several excruciating lab write-up experiences.",
    "Anticipate every opportunity for glitches with data collection and equipment failure. Focus research questions with precision.",
    "You need to be able to work independently. In addition, you need to be able to do things without someone telling you everything but you asking questions and going to people. Do not wait on others to tell you what to do, you need to get the ball rolling.",
    "Be aware of what you are getting into. If my expectations had been different, I might have appreciated it more forwhat it was. But instead of keeping the course the same and asking students to adjust their expectations, I would recommend that this course be restructured. It is perfectly reasonable to keep all of the class requirements (projects, readings, field work, etc.) but they should be tackled one at a time. A possible syllabus looks like this: a) students read journal articles about concept or technique, b) class has a discussion about articles and\/ or professors give short lecture on relevant topic or technique, c) field work is conducted, d) class has another discussion on articles in light of field work and lab-write up is presented in an organized fashion (including lessons on relevant analysis, etc.), e) students complete write-up. Then, the class moves on to the next lab. This cycle might take 3 weeks, but it would give more coherence to each field experience, and prevent all of the work from piling up on each other in a confusing way. I understand that the course is probably organized this way (all field work in the first 4 or 5 weeks) because of seasonality, but it makes the class unworkable. It might mean cutting out some of the field work and doing lab work instead. I would have enjoyed more lab work, which is really missing in the FES natural science experience and would fit nicely into this particular course.",
    "Self-motivation is the key to success on the independent project. Do not expect hand-holding&be proactive in seeking out help and guidance over the course of the semester. Otherwise, you will be headed for failure (this was evident in some of the poor presentations by other students at the end of the semester). If the scheduled lectures are actually given as listed, you can expect a good refresher on some basic topics in ecology."
