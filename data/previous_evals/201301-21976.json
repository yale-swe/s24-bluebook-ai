    "The senior essay. Nuff said.",
    "Senior history majors have to take it. Make sure you choose an advisor who will actually have time to meet with you.",
    "Pick your advisor wisely. Pick your topic early and stick with it. Pick an advisor who will help you find a good topic and stick with it.",
    "This is a great course that is a central part of the history major at Yale!",
    "The senior essay is a year-long project designed to have students contribute an original piece of work to the scholarly field. I would certainly recommend it to another student. The opportunity to work with a professor for a year one-on-one is an outstanding one.",
    "Opportunity to dive deeply into one subject area.",
    "It's a phenomenal capstone experience. Pick a topic you love, put in the effort, it's worth it.",
    "Yes. Do the history major knowing that the senior capstone is substantial and worthwhile.",
    "Do a bunch of research. Write a big essay. Stress a bunch. Pull an all-nighter before it's due. Celebrate.",
    "You write an approximately 40 page essay. It is not really 50, like they say, because that number includes all of the extra stuff (citations, bibliographic essay, etc.)",
    "I really enjoyed writing the senior essay. My adviser set firm deadlines throughout the semester, and that really helped in the writing process. I think that these intermediary guidelines are really important in not falling behind."
