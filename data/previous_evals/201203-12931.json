    "No unfortunately I would not. Some of the texts are really great, but I did not enjoy class discussion. Firstly, most of the class is a lecture (even though it is a seminar), and secondly, discussions were not focussed. We were given a lot of freedom on our assignments, which is good if you aren't worried about what is expected of you, but not so good if you prefer to have more structure.",
    "Very fun, light class. Interesting to hear Professor Sussman's thoughts on the works (make sure you like his teaching style first, some people find him hard to follow), very light load of assignments and reading.",
    "The course is interesting. I loved all the readings--which were all incredibly diverse and interesting. However, seminar was oftentimes disappointing, because Professor Sussman spent a majority of the seminar session lecturing. There's not that much work: there was not a lot of reading, and the papers felt pretty relaxed overall.",
    "I chose this course for it's wonderful reading list, and definitely made the right decision. This class has great readings (readings that you actually WANT to do, because they are so cool): we read everything from Alice in Wonderland to German Fairy Tales to Freud.The class itself it basically a seminar, although Professor Sussman often spends the majority of class time talking. He is very caring, very quirky, and very understanding. The course, therefore, is pretty easy (just two 3 page essays and a 10 page final essay). You get out what you put in, but overall it's a pretty enjoyable experience. If you like the reading, the course is well worth Professor Sussman's ramblings. Highly recommended for students looking for an easy, yet interesting course!",
    "If you're interested in the subject matter, you should take the class. The discussions and the papers are very much oriented toward what about the subject is interesting to you, and it's a great way to learn a lot. There is a lot of reading, but the discussions are less analytical and more thought-based. It's a great class.",
    "Yes! A really wonderful course. Covers fairy tales, child psychology, virtual space, and anything and everything you want it to. Professor Sussman allows you to explore\/further your own ideas in class, so you can make this class anything you want it to be. TAKE IT.",
    "A great reading list, caring teaching staff, and workload that involves a good deal of creativity without being unreasonably demanding.",
    "As I mentioned earlier, I think the syllabus for this class was wonderfully designed, and I'm so glad I got to read the texts we covered. The variety of texts very stimulating. Discussion, however, was less inspiring, and I think that was largely because of Dr Sussman's teaching style, which I think doesn't mesh well with everybody in the class. I think Dr Sussman has a great deal of fascinating ideas to impart and is so wonderfully enthusiastic, that it's a shame discussion falls so flat. I think if he led discussion with a little more critical moderation, asking more specific questions, things would go a lot better and everyone would gain a great deal more from the class.",
    "Take this class! It's a little bit of everything - some children's lit, some psych, some modernism, and even some music and art. Professor Sussman touches on everything and then allows his students to take the topics that interest them most and run with them. He encourages creativity and embraces open discussion which made for a very fun classroom environment.",
    "This course is terrible. It's a terrible shame, too, because some of the readings are amazing and hard to come by in other courses (Walter Benjamin, D.W. Winnicott), and the overall project of a course on childhood and memory in the literature of the past two centuries could be really fruitful. But the syllabus is meandering and often incoherent, and its instructor even more so. Neither a lecture nor a seminar, class meetings rambled and deteriorated into monologues on side topics. There was little effort to engage systematically with the material actually on the syllabus - as opposed to tangentially related to it - and certainly no attempt at anything resembling a dynamic conversation between the instructor and the twenty or so students. Be advised, too, that the TA appears to have final authority over all grades for the course, which is mildly perplexing, to say the least, given that there are only the aforementioned twenty-odd students. This is not the course you think it is. Don't take it unless you can welcome its wishy-washiness with open arms.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this course. It is a great review of some really great literature on children and for children. And Professor Sussman is clearly remarkably knowledgeable and really quirky and fun. But it isn't really a seminar, it's more of lecture where he pontificates, sometimes on topic, sometimes on tangents, and says some really great stuff. And we occasionallyparticipate. He really cares about the students and is very generous and flexible and wants us to do everything in our own time, so it's very manageable as a course in terms of writing assignments--2 short papers, 1 10 page due before reading week so it's not when everything else is, and then an ungraded presentationy thing that's super chill and on whatever you want. Basically all the papers are on whatever you want to write about as long as it's related to something we've been discussing. The truth about the course is you really get out of it what you put in--you can definitely get away with only doing enough of the readings at the last minute to write the papers. But you will probably not enjoy the class if you do, because you'll have nothing to say and you'll get lost when the professor is talking. The readings are actually fantastic and interesting if this is a topic you are interested in, but there are a lot of them. So if you do them, you'll probably enjoy the course more, but it will definitely be way more work. It's kinda a mixed back, week to week can be very different. SHOP it first and go with your gut on your response to Henry's style. It's not quite as advertised, but he is really great, and so it still might be something worthwhile, just depends on the person.",
    "A course that can seem bewildering at first in its selection of texts and Professor Sussman's teaching style. If you follow the readings and really engage in discussion inside and outside the classroom with Professor S and TA Julia Frienan, you will find the course very enriching. Course-load is not too heavy, but papers require some unwrangling. Take it if you are interested in childhood, psychoanalysis, cognitive science, identity, and exploring these things through cultural texts ranging from literature (Virginia Woolf, German Fairy tales, Hoffman...etc) to texts on childhood psychology ."
