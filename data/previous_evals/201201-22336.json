    "If you're an environmental studies major, you're going to take this class. It's much more like an independent study project second term than it was first term, though I imagine it'll keep evolving in future years. There's very little you're required to go to, though you're encouraged to attend most of it. The first half of the semester we met over lunch and heard from people about writing tips and post-graduation stuff. The second half we just did final presentations to the whole class. Pretty relaxed; just keep working steadily on the essay!",
    "The second semester senior colloquium included many lunches dedicated to things other than the senior thesis such as bringing in green job consultants, etc",
    "meets less than once a week and is generally optional. just have to finish your senior essay",
    "Required course, really try to put effort into imposed deadlines and try to make the most of your one-on-one time with your adviser.",
    "You have to take it if you're in the major. My advice, make gradual progress over the course of the semester. DON'T LEAVE IT ALL FOR THE END!!!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "As I mentioned before, despite its explosive growth in enrollment and absurd, interdisciplinary breadth of subject area, EVST somehow remains one of the best-run, most cohesive majors at Yale.",
    "Adhere to deadlines, take advantage of professors' office hours, meet regularly with your adviser, and go to all of your classmates' presentations. Really great range of work done."
