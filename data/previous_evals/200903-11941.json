    "Yes. Great opportunity especially for art major seniors to begin work for their thesis.",
    "Your basic photography formatted class with more emphasis on individual interests. There is more freedom allowed. Definitely take it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for students who want a course with a lot of freedom and opportunities to work on individual style, etc.",
    "Yes, its the ultimate photo class at yale.",
    "yes, but only if you're a very serious photographer.",
    "Yea. But definitely have a project in mind from the get go.",
    "This is a good class for those looking to develop as a photographer. You'll get out of it what you put in, and the class largely will depend on those taking it with you. Not sure if Greg will teach the course again anytime soon but if so - I recommend him as a very good teacher but with some reservations (he's an understandably busy guy, but seemed to lack the time to commit fully to the class). But yeah, take it!"
