    "A very structured course (as compared to Freshman Organic Chemistry) that takes you through the first 11 chapters of the Wade Organic Chemistry textbook. It's clear and certainly helpful as a litmus test for whether than you want to pursue chemistry.I would recommend this course to everyone even slightly related in chemistry; especially if taken with lab, the applications of chemistry become quite clear. It's well-taught (with Jorgensen and Miller), well-structured, and you come out feeling like you really learned something.",
    "The professors were decent; however, be warned: your experience in Orgo will entirely depend on the professor you get. The problem sets become extremely long as the semester winds down and if you don't keep up with your work, you can get lost very very quickly.",
    "Chemistry at Yale is a disaster.If you've got a natural aptitude or have loaded up on it in high school, then you'll do fine in gen chem and probably orgo. However, if you think you're going to be taught chemistry at Yale, you've got an ugly surprise ahead.Yale teaches chemistry the old-fashioned way: you teach yourself. You take the textbook memorize it and then do lots and lots of problems. The professors and TAs are superfluous.Lots of universities are reforming the ways sciences are taught (e.g. MIT) with a real appreciation for the fact that science literacy is vital in today's world, thus, classes are being made smaller, group problem solving is emphasized, and other novel ways to get difficult material across are being explored.Not at Yale. Orgo is about learning on your own, memorization and cut-throat competition. Many Yalies do fine with that approach, but it's really not teaching at all.Remember, we have great professors at Yale, but particularly in the sciences, their life is about grants, papers and tenure, not undergraduate education.",
    "If you're pre-med definitely take it with these professors.",
    "Chem 220 is hard, but if you stay on top of your workload and get help when you need it, it can be really rewarding and for me was one of the better classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, but if you're premed you have to take it. Try to take it with Scott Miller if you take it, though- he's the best lecturer you're ever going to get. Look at the class as a look into a new interesting subject rather than as a requirement, or you'll be suffering through it.",
    "Do the problem sets.They're not graded, but do them.Work your BUTT OFF.It's ok to go to office hours and be the stupid one who still doesn't know whats going on.",
    "I personally do not like lectures, but if you are going to be pre-med, a chemistry major, or a biology major you'll be taking this. Don't dread it as much as everyone makes it out to be. It really isn't that bad.",
    "I loved this class. I'm not pre-med, I took orgo purely for the fun of it, and I don't regret it at all. I only regret that I waited to take it after CHEM 118. Unlike the stereotype, orgo really isn't that bad (and other people I talked to like it also). Yes, it's a lot of work, and the tests are hard, but you get to really learn how chemistry works at the basic level. Professor Miller is awesome, and really funny, too. I always looked forward to this class.",
    "Unfortunately, this class is at 9:25 at the top of science hill... if you make it up there that early, you will enjoy class. If not... well, get ready to read a lot. It's orgo, it's tough, but you knew that going in.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student who needs to take the class. It isn't the easiest material to learned but it is retainable.",
    "I enjoyed reading the textbook and learning orgo from it. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the class. Orgo itself is a hard subject, but the problem was compounded by how poorly the class was taught and TAed. Miller was engaging and funny, although he references how important he is and knows every big fish in the science world and whips out wikipedia pages on drugs, every class. Jorgensen is drier than peanut brittle, but he's an orgo god--that is, omnipotent. But their tests are unfairly hard (the averages were around 60, and I don't know how any professor would think that the average student coming away from the class having gleaned 60% of the material was \"doing all right\", in their words), and sometimes they would make the tests like jeopardy and put random trivia questions about things like the gasoline industry and electric cars.But I guess okay teaching and unfair tests and brilliant professors can be expected of many Yale classes, especially science ones. Orgo really is hard though.",
    "It's an enjoyable class if you are really interested in organic chemistry. A lot of people take it because they're pre-med, so it's pretty competitive grade-wise. Definitely not an easy A class.",
    "I was really happy that I took this class as an intro to organic chem, particularly because of Professor Miller. His enthusiasm made it easier to understand the material.",
    "Given the time commitment to this class, I would only recommend it to those who need to take the class to satisfy a requirement.",
    "It's really not as bad as everyone thinks if you're willing to put in the work for it. I really think it teaches a way of thinking that other science classes do not. There is no easy way out of it, you have to practice every problem you can find until it's automatic. Also never skip over something that may seem confusing and pray that it won't be on the test, you have to assume that it will be.",
    "If you are considering this course, you most likely have to take it anyway. I don't know how the other professors are, but I would recommend taking it with Professor Miller. Don't expect to have an easy time. The weeks during midterms were absolutely miserable.",
    "Very well taught for a class that most people in have to take. I would suggest it to people who are interested in science who may not have to take it.",
    "This was a really good course. I felt it was a great introduction to organic chemistry, a subject I was very apprehensive of in the past. But the professors (especially MILLER!) were great and made it approachable and enjoyable. I really really liked that the problem sets were graded pass\/fail, and this should definitely be kept in the course. It really made the class a lot less stressful. I just wish that the final hadn't been 50% of our grade, because that was really stressful; as soon as classes ended, all I did was study organic chemistry because 50% of your grade is a ton. In general, I would only suggest that maybe 2 weeks tops be spent on the first 3-4 chapters, as I think we really spent too much time on this. This made it feel very rushed especially towards the end.Miller is one of my all-time favorite professors. Never a dull moment when he lectures-- we loved his stories and his multi-colored chalk. I almost wish he had taught the whole semester: Jorgenson only taught for a few weeks and it would have been more seamless to have one person do the whole thing. I really hope Miller teaches us CHEM221 in the fall, since I can't imagine studying organic chem without him.Jorgenson only taught a few chapters so we didn't really see him much. However, I thought he seemed like a great professor and very nice. I think he just spent a little too much time going over the more basic stuff at the beginning of the semester, which meant we had less time for mechanisms at the end.In sum, take this class ESPECIALLY if Miller is teaching! I'm so glad I didn't take this in the fall (when it was a nightmare, apparently) and waited for spring. Exams could be tricky, and there were a few surprises in each one (despite the profs saying there wouldn't be). I'm giving this class a \"very good\" rating instead of \"excellent\" because I felt some questions on the exams were very unfair (especially on the final). However, the material itself isn't really tricky-- there is just a ton of it.",
    "This class is not awful, but its sole goal is to create a grade distribution, rather than teach organicchemistry.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and, if you have the opportunity to take this class with Scott Miller, DO IT! He engages the class during lectures (even in a class of 80+) and transforms Organic Chemistry from simply a requirement that Chem. majors and pre-med students take to a really fascinating subject that has a ton of relevance and significance to everyday life. He occasionally goes on digressions but, rest assured, these are often very funny and you will soon grow to love Professor Miller's unique charm.My only complaint (and it's not a big one) is that I sometimes felt that the lectures proceeded through the material a little slowly and that the class skipped over some important sections\/reactions mentioned in the book.",
    "With Miller and Jorgensen, a great class. A lot of work, but not as bad as people say.",
    "Take it if Scott Miller is teaching it! He is an amazing professor! Jorgensen is good too, but not to the level of Miller. I loved Organic Chemistry. I learned so much and I felt what I learned was important.",
    "Orgo certainly has its reputation and no, it's not easy. But that being said, it's not impossible either. Definitely takes some hard work but if you put the time in, it is extremely rewarding. Recommended, especially if you can take it with Miller.",
    "This class was an excellent and well-taught introduction to organic chemistry. Although it is a difficult subject, Miller and Jorgensen were both outstanding professors.",
    "Jorgenson and Miller were both great teachers, I definitely recommend taking it with them :)Their lectures compliment the textbook in a great way that make both worthwhile. I feel like I ultimately learned most things from the book, but lectures definitely helped me understand the book much better.",
    "Take it its cool.",
    "It is an intro to Organic Chemistry, that is set up in a very manageable pace, and with the two professors that taught it this semester is very enjoyable. Not saying that it is not demanding, it was definitely my most demanding course this semester. I do recommend the class.",
    "Highly recommended. Tough tests but the professors make the class worthwhile",
    "I think so much depends on the teacher. Orgo isn't really my thing; I think I'm realizing that I'm more of a physics person. But because Professor Miller was such a great lecturer, I enjoyed what I could of the class and the subject matter. Personally, I find the subject a bit tedious\/uninteresting, but I know quite a few people who like it. However, whether or not you like orgo, it's a difficult subjectto learn. A bad teacher would have made this class unbearable. If you have to take Orgo or you want to take it, take it with Miller. Seriously.On Orgo as a subject: it's very different from general chemistry; there are practically no numbers or equations here. Doing an Orgo problem is like solving a jigsaw puzzle where you need to memorize what all of the pieces look like beforehand.",
    "Yes! You should probably be a science major and you definitely need a chemistry background (intro chem classes 114\/115 or 118) but overall it is a worthwhile class. It's such a milestone!",
    "This course provides a sturdy explanation of the major themes in organic chemistry, with a heavy focus on the functional groups alkenes, alkanes alkynes and alcohols. lots of mechanisms and reactions to learn though.",
    "CHEM 220 is the first half of organic chemistry and most of the students who take the course are either pre-med and\/or chemistry majors. Consequently, the course and its material may seem intimidating to a non-science major or someone not following a pre-med curriculum, especially since the final course grades are curved. The students who succeed in the class are those who keep up with readings, complete problem sets, and regularly attend sections. Though the material may seem difficult, the course is definitely doable if students keep up with the work load--the class covers about a chapter a week and students should be prepared to commit lots of time to reading and studying. In addition, the professors and TF's are extremely helpful and good resources to ask for help on problem sets, difficult topics, etc.",
    "I actually really liked this course. It is a lot of work, and you learn an overwhelming amount of material, but it is really interesting, and you feel incredibly accomplished at the end when you realize how much knowledge you have accumulated over the course of the semester.",
    "Orgo takes a lot of time, be prepared to dedicate yourself to it.",
    "I would recommend Chem 220 to another student, but only if they really want to pursue Chemistry. I took it to see if Chem was something I wanted to do, and I'm pretty sure I've decided that it's not for me. Take Orgo because you want to take it and are interested in the material.",
    "Miller is awesome. Material can sometimes be a bit dry in class and you have to put in a lot of time outside of class to master the material. It's really nice when it all comes together at the end, not as scary as people say it is. It's fun problem solving. Problem sets every week aren't terrible, but the most work comes in around the midterms\/final.",
    "I know orgo gets a bad rep, but this class was actually one of my favorites this semester. IF YOU CAN TAKE ORGO WITH SCOTT MILLER, ABSOLUTELY DO IT!! He is constantly making connections between real life and the material which not only makes it meaningful, but also I rarely found myself looking at the clock. Miller is very dynamic always moving around the room, even sometimes onto the table. He makes jokes and keeps students awake.As for the workload, orgo actually was not that bad week to week. This is because the only work is textbook reading and a problem set. But there are FULL SOLUTIONS to all of the problems. As a result, the problem sets are all pass\/fail. Clearly it is better to do the problems on your own, you will never feel too stressed about orgo during a normal week - so if you have other work to do, orgo does not take too much time. However, you have to be careful, because it is really easy to let orgo slip to the back burner which you really should not do!! because the tests are expansive!! They are hard, but definitely NOT IMPOSSIBLE if you've studied, which simply takes time since there is so much material. Actually studying a bit each day for like a week before the exam will help a ton. And even if that doesn't work, the average is so low anyway, you won't fail compared to everyone else.Also! Definitely buy the book: Organic Chemistry As a Second Language by David Klein!! It will help SO MUCH.GREAT LUCK! You can do it - don't worry, orgo will not stand between you and your dreams of being a doctor.",
    "Most obviously take this class to fulfill either major or pre-med requirements. You hear a lot of complaining about it at both Yale and other schools, but truly, these complaints often paint a very inaccurate picture. Yes, you do cover a good amount of material, but most of the chapters mirror one another in form, allowing you to easily add new knowledge, only requiring that you remember a few differences and exceptions here and there. It lacks the serious negatives you hear of, and in fact, it has some great positives do. Most notably, it will teach you how many modern industries\/goods operate\/are created. If you like science because you see it as useful, alive, and growing, take this class (especially with Scott Miller)."
