    "Question 2: I would have liked it if there were more contemporary readings and readings that focused on the environment as that is in the title of the course but very few of the articles dealt with the economy in terms of environmental exploitation. I very much enjoyed the section on contracting.Question 7: The instructor is very good and puts an enormous amount of thought and effort into each lecture and class. I didn't think that learning about the author's bios was always necessary, as that is something that can be easily done outside of class.",
    "the curriculum of the course is ideal for students looking to gain insight into economic anthropology. the syllabus is an incredible resource and the professoris meticulous about reading comprehension - which is very much a positive. the topics build on each other from week-to-weekadditionally, professor Carpenter is excellent at facilitating discussion, conversation and debate - very willing to discuss topics that are relevant to specific student interests, but also keen on drawing discussion back toward central themes as appropriateprofessor carpenter knows the readings\/material incredibly well - has a very strong pedagogy that is helpful given the difficult and faceted nature of the materialthe structure of assignments - summary sentences, though time-consuming, is an excellent way to guarantee participation.all in all this course was excellent - the best, in total, I took this term - held my interest strongly from beginning to end*the TA, Amy Zhang, also taught an excellent course section toward the end of the term - very sharp. and very helpful throughout, available for one-off discussions"

    "Carol Carpenter was the best thing about the course. Yes, the course was well designed \u0096 the lecture topics were interesting, the readings were relevant and well chosen, etc. but it was always Carol\u0092s vibrant lectures that I looked forward to and enjoyed. She is incredibly smart and does a fantastic job of furthering our understanding of the readings by blending her lecture with anecdotes, historical background, and her own sharp insight. She also genuinely cares about her students and notices how well we all perform, which keeps us all closely invested in the class. This is the first class in my life that I have done 100% of the readings for (which is amazing considering how difficult they were) and this is entirely because I knew that Carol cared so much and that made me care too.",
    "The engagement of the instructor and how much she cares about the subject and the interest of the students",
    "(as above) the interwoven syllabus and prof carpenters mastery of the topics = great discussion"

   "comments": [
    "Our class was pretty quiet, and there wasn\u0092t as much discussion as there could have been. Perhaps in the future, more harsh accountability can be heaped down upon discussion leaders to step up on leading discussion.",
    "I think that the instructor could have involved more students in discussion through asking more questions of the class. Often times a few students dominated through interrupting the instructor. I feel that if a small amount of time was set aside for discussion at the end of class for discussion more people would have participated.",

   "comments": [
    "Both the instructor and TA continually amazed me with the level of thoughtful, insightful feedback they had on the work and performance of every individual in class. I always walked away from every office hour encounter with a greater understanding of the material and what I needed to do to improve my own reading of the material.",
    "Both are extremely responsive and very helpful.",
    "The TA was often available to meet but was very slow to respond to email. While she attempted to be helpful, I found that she was dismissive and always telling me that she would help me later. For example, when I was trying to get ideas about my final paper and trying to find sources she told me that she would help me once I did more research on my own. By the time this happened, I didn't feel that I could incorporate her suggestions. She also seemed a bit short over email. The lecture she gave was great and the readings she selected were very interesting.",

    "I am in the process of analyzing data from my summer research, and this course helped me to identify and become familiar with a body of literature that has helped me put together a theoretical framework for furthering this analysis. I knew that the course would cover important issues and authors I had not had the chance to read and explore through previous classes with Amity Doolittle and Michael Dove.",
    "this course was the perfect launching point for my studies at Yale F&ES - an introduction to economic anthropology that really helped me understand how to apply anthropological critique to isses of economy (a catalyst for my other classes). very helpful."

    "Because my advisor was the instructor and because I wanted to build a relationship with her. I believe I accomplished this during the course and I enjoyed learning from her and how she can guide me during my time at FES.",

    "Yes. This course was exceedingly, exceptionally, crucially valuable. It is particularly valuable because it marries the disciplines of anthropology and economics in a way that is very valuable to any student in an inter-disciplinary school like FES. Taking this class was a fantastic experience I do not regret. I would do it again in a heartbeat and recommend others to do the same.",
    "I came into the class without many expectations, and just wanted to see what I learned, so in this way it met my expectations. The only thing I was disappointing with was the lack of focus on the environment.",

I found that my own reading ability improved over the semester to the point where at the end I could read well and understand the arguments and implications of the reading in less time than it took at the beginning of the semester. I also found that the whole thesis sentence exercise is improving my quality of life at large, because I inevitably need to write thesis sentences when writing papers and literature reviews for other classes and projects \u0096 now I can do it easily. It\u0092s such a time saver.",
