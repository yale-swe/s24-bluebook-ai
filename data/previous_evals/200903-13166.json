    "Yes, it is challenging but very rewarding.",
    "Egyptology 571 01 is a course in the Diachronics of Egyptian Grammar, meaning that it examines the way grammatical forms change over time, and the reasons behind these changes. In many ways, however, it establishes the remarkable consistency of forms over time.",
    "I would strongly recommend taking this course, as it changes the way you read and refer to Egyptian Grammar, and I believe it to be an essential course for every student in the field. Nevertheless, this course requires knowledge of the different levels of Egyptian before hand, and especially Coptic.",
    "Absolutely. The course exposes students to a wide variety of scholarship in linguistics."
