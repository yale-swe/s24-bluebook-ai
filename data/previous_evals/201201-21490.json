   "comments": [
    "Yes! You learn a lot of useful, real-world stuff and it's a great intro to the psychology field in general, in my opinion.",
    "I would definitely recommend. A slightly stronger psychology background is beneficial, but you can do without it. The information is very interesting.",
    "CREDIT\/D\/FAIL this class if you take it.TOO much reading.Professor is weird, talks about random stuff which is not tested.Go to section, the TAs do all the teaching.",
    "Do not recommend this class. Psychology and Politics seems to be a rather interesting topic, but professor Bullock does not do a good job of engaging the students in lecture.",
    "Yes! It's a great class that challenges your way of thinking about more than just politics or psychology. The format of the class also brings out a better student in you.",
    "Take this class!!! Prof. Bullock is easily the best lecturer I have had at Yale so far! His voice is very easy to follow and the lectures are always neatly organized!We had 3 cumulative exams, no final. Be careful though! The last exam is on the last day of classes and covers everything! So basically, youhave a final but you don't get to use reading week for preparation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a good class with solid psychology concepts. I would say it has less to do with political science though.",
    "Interesting introduction to the political realm of psychology. Professor Bullock is wonderful.",
    "Boring, the exams are cumulative and there usually isn't enough time to finish them",
    "This is an interesting class on what I would call, whatever John Bullock finds interesting. Fortunately what he finds interesting is interesting, so I would recommend this class. It is not that much work.",
    "Boring class, don't take this class unless you have to. It's not as easy as advertised.",
    "The second half was definitely more interesting than the first. Good to know, but not enough application to real life political events in the class to make it that exciting. good class though, only 3 tests. very fair.",
    "It's your basic psych class with political examples. It's very boring, but a decent credit if you need.",
    "Maybe. It sort of turned me off from the study of psychology but at the same time, I did learn useful concepts.",
    "I recommend this to another student if she or he enjoys the course material. Other than that, I'm not sure if this a course he or she should take.",
    "Terrific class! Very interesting material, great professor. It's really incredible to see the tie-ins between the work we do for the class and every day life. Just the right mix of psychology and political science for someone intensely interested in politics with a fascination with the workings of the human mind! Take it!",
    "I made the mistake of assuming that I'd be able to apply what I learned in the class in real life--I am not. Do not come into the class expecting to become a masterful politician or whatever. It's interesting if you want to know how psychology relates to politics. Very little emphasis on the applications. A lot of the stuff is pretty intuitive.",
    "Take it if you are interested in understanding the scientific process better, but in a relatively relaxed manner. Professor is really thoughtful about presenting the studies in the course, making sure to explain the thinking behind each one and not just present them at face value. It forces you to understand in which ways studies are true or false.",
    "This course will teach you how logic is supposed to work and why humans screw it up. You'll learn more about the realities of politics and life than in any political science course, and the psychology isn't half-bad either. Highly, highly recommended. John Bullock is a young genius who will be a legend in 20 years. I actually looked forward to lectures.",
    "I would summarize political psychology was a great way to learn about psych for poli-sci majors. The lectures were really interesting (although the readings could be long, dull and not always relevant to the classes and\/or exams) and Prof. Bullock was great. I would definitely recommend this class to another student and let them know that the grading get MUCH easier after the first exam.",
    "Yes, but don't go looking for deep insights. Both psychology and political science are shaky fields.",
    "Take the course!",
    "This class is great if you are interested in phycology and politics. I would have definitely never known about really important studies of human behavior if I hadn't taken this class. It is not too hard if you just put enough time into it and do the readings. Moreover, the fact that it had three midterms and no final was pretty nice.",
    "Yes take if interested in the material. Good readings for the most part.",
    "Take it! Fair tests, no papers (as of spring 2012), no final, very manageable workload, interesting material.Tests are fair and overall straightforward: (they're basically 3 tests comprised of 8 short answer questions, which u can answer using your laptop in class if u want, so that you can write faster), there's no final, material is interesting -- it applies psych to real-world political examples, which i loved. Also, the concepts are not difficult to grasp.Lectures are interesting: Professor Bullock has a low voice, but you get used to it and you find yourself learning a lot and happy to go to lecture -- I was never really bored.Workload: You can skim most of the readings, since lecture and section almost always cover the topics that appear on the test. NO PAPERS!",
    "Political Psych is an interesting course about who particular psychological phenomenon can and does effect Politics on a broad, but impactful sense.",
    "It's a survey of different topics in psychology that relate to politics. It's alright, not too much work, and a good idea for a fifth course.",
    "good",
    "Ayo so I would recommend dis class right herr. Dis brotha Professor Bullock got a mind of his own nah mean. He be teachin you how to think and feces, and not take no feces as it is from people. In other words, don't be jus acceptin information as it is nah mean. only thing about this brotha is that he got a monotone voice nah mean. the stuff he be talkin about is usually interestin but some time you might just doze off nah mean. but he cool. tests are pretty fair, he ain't tryna make you fail or anythin. but ya betta study for that feces or else you gonna fail. yeah, if anythin, you learn to not take feces from no one nah mean.",
    "It's an interesting combination of intro psychology and its applications to certain aspects of political science (e.g. voter behavior, prejudice, etc.) Would highly recommend it if you're at all interested in that.",
    "Extremely well taught class if you are interested in the subject matter, which is more psychology than political science. Take good notes of the lectures, both because Bullock is an extremely clear and methodical lecturer (one of the best you could ask for), but also because this is what will come up on the midterm more than anything else. Go to office hours to take advantage of Bullock's brain, not enough students in our class did.",
    "Yes because it definitely opened a new way of thinking.",
    "The class is okay. Definitely very psychology heavy, most readings are psych studies which can be dense and the lectures are dry.",
    "It's a fine intro course, and if you've taken any intro psych courses or intro plsc courses the material should be easy and\/or familiar. It's a fine course to take if you're interested in the material, and Bullock is a solid teacher, but try to take it before you take more advanced PLSC or psych courses.",
    "Yes, Bullock is a great lecturer, the material is interesting, and it's a great class to take especially for Poli Sci majors.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in the intersection of politics and psychology, but who is not too concerned about having a politics heavy course. This is definitely a psychology class, and as such, there are lots of psychological studies assigned as reading. This can be disappointing for someone who was hoping for a more political angle.",
    "I would recommend the course. If you are interested in social psychology, or in political philosophy, it is a must-take.",
    "I would for the knowledge of the readings etc, which is interesting.",
    "Yes. This is a very interesting class and not too much work",
    "Not very difficult. Definitely go for it if you want a So.",
    "the professor is weird and gives a speech for every lecture. overall, the material was not exactly what the title implied. it does not really talk too much about the psychology of politics. a bearable class, though.",
    "Would recommend if you have an interest in both sides (poli sci and psyc). I am a psych major with no experience in Poli sci and found it too my liking, I have the feeling it may suit this approach more than if you are a poli sci major in the same position.",
    "Lectures came off as rather monotonous, but they were incredibly easy to follow and made sure to include different views, not just the professor's on a given issue. Very interesting material, for the most part, and the tests were straightforward if you knew the basics to each assigned article's methods and findings.",
    "Political Psychology was a fascinating course, but I think that it best suits those interested in Psychology. Other students may find the course overly technical. The lecture and readings were great, but I gradually lost interest towards the end of the year.",
    "If you haven't taken a psych or poli sci class before, this class might be challenging for you, as it sometimes was for me. However, I enjoyed it and I learned a fair amount. Prof. Bullock is clearly very interested in his students and the subject matter and is a nice professor. His lecture style is very clear (though I wished he'd used the board more). My main suggestion to improve this course would be to add a textbook or something similar -- the course readings were *only* from often quite technical scholarly articles and I often wished I had some secondary text that defined terms, gave a general overview, etc. Overall a solid class.",
    "Highly, highly recommended, especially if you don't have a great psychology background. Prof. Bullock also really emphasizes learning the fundamental concepts and critical thinking skills necessary for analyzing studies, statistics, etc., so it's a fantastic help for future coursework in both psych and poli sci.Prof. Bullock is just really amazing, perhaps the kindest and most encouraging I've met at Yale."
