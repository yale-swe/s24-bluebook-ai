   "comments": [
    "This class is a must-take for anyone interested in anthropology and East Asia.",
    "It is a difficult course mainly due to the methodology. However, it is a useful skill to learn and it will undoubtedly add another dimension to your research.",
    "This course spans from being an in-depth introduction to Chinese anthropology to one that introduces higher-level analytical frameworks not just for anthropology but for deconstruction in any other discipline, and also an exercise in being able to take an ordinary problem and learning to view it from an unconventional yet revealing perspective.Take this course and be prepared to be very very challenged.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. For anyone interested in anthropology, this course providesan invaluable set of analytical tools. Professor Siu is an expert in the study of people, societies, and cultures, and any student of the humanities should seize the opportunity to gain some of the anthropological perspective she provides in this course. Students with an interest in China should also take this course. It provides a very unique look at unity and diversity in the Chinese nation and different ways of questioning existing paradigms.",
    "The course is a deconstruction of the major schools of Chinese anthropology. I would only recommend this course to students who satisfy at least two of the following three conditions:1. well-versed in social theory (Durkheim, Marx, Weber, Foucault, even James Scott)2. well-read in post-imperial Chinese history3. prepared to have their understanding of \"China\" thoroughly challenged"

   "comments": [
    "This class allowed me to look at my research topic from another angle and, in doing so, opened up new spaces for me to explore.",
    "I will simply say that this course challenged my mind in ways that other courses have not. Professor Siu problematizes everything. This may be tiring and tedious for some students, but I found it fascinating. I fully embraced the idea that nothing should ever be accepted at face value, and I found this course uniquely enriching in terms of analytical training.",
    "This course was a complete application of anthropological theory to nearly every aspect of Chinese culture. The readings were grouped topically, rather than chronologically, so each week was an exploration of a certain concept, instead of a single time period. This helped us to examine and criticize the readings through a focused lens each week.We regularly tied the readings in to larger trends in anthro theory, and to other non-anthropological scholarship."
