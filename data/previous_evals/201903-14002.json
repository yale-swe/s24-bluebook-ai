    "Info about Alaska American environmental decision making",
    "I learned a lot about bristol bay in particular, which seems like a relevant environmental topic given how long it has been an issue. I also learned about causal loop diagrams, though I remain unconvinced about their effectiveness.",
    "I learnt basic skills that will help me as an environmental manager. I also gained in-depth knowledge about the Pebble issue, and learnt how to dig deep into an issue.",
    "I learned about causal loop diagrams.",
    "Developed deep knowledge of the case study. Learned \"systems thinking\" skills and causal-loop diagrams, but not in depth.",
    "Learning and becoming very passionate about something I previously had no knowledge of. Keeping an open mind and critically evaluating opinions.",
    "Causal Loop Diagrams",
    "I developed an interdisciplinary approach to an environmental issue through the various perspectives and views presented.",
    "I thought this class was a great bonding experience for the class\/continuation of MODs. I really enjoyed the discussion section and the Bristol Bay topic\/content. However, I did not find the CLDs very helpful. Also, the course became somewhat repetitive towards the end of the semester. However, to be fair, this happens to a lot of classes down the stretch.",
    "I enjoyed learning about the Pebble Mine conflict and discussion with my peers.",
    "I thought a bit more about the ramifications of creating a decarbonized future",
    "I learned about the case of Bristol Bay and Pebble Mine. I also thought more about systems thinking then I ever had before.",
    "Absorbing and incorporating multiple opinions and perspectives into potential solutions to wicked problems.",
    "I developed my analytical skills and my ability to compare information from different sources.",
    "I loved hearing from different people involved in different aspects of the Bristol Bay\/Pebble Mine case study.",
    "By taking this course, I have learned about how to use social science concepts to approach environmental problems. I also learned how to use system thinking with the help of causal loop diagram to try to understand the bigger picture of a problem.",
    "What a Causal Loop Diagram is. Sometimes the things that are missing in an evaluation are more important than the positive things that were said.",
    "CLD and systems thinking. Great to have had the opportunity to hear from stakeholders with different perspectives.",
    "it was interesting hearing from the mining company and some of the native representatives, but this was a subject matter I was sufficiently familiar with already.",
    "I would say \"flowcharts\" since even the professors admitted that was the only skill they decided we needed to learn, but literally everyone knows how to make\/read a flowchart. That's not something you need to go to Yale to learn, so I think we know someone was just being lazy. Supposedly the professors thought we were going to get something out of the 200-page \"Thinking in Systems\" book, but if they genuinely thought anyone came to Yale Forestry not know what a \"feedback loop\" is, or that \"sometimes you have to look at the big picture,\" that's insulting to all masters students. If FES genuinely thinks it's a \"professional school\" for environmental managers, why was there absolutely no attempt to teach WORKING with stakeholders, collaborating with people we disagree with, building consensus, learning on the ground, or literally anything that would actually be helpful for real-world environmental management? Is FES lesson to us really that we in the ivory tower can figure it all out after a couple Q&As and flowcharts, and locals will just shut up and listen to whatever we say because we're from Yale? And seriously, FLOW CHARTS?! Whoever at FES decided MEMs need or can possibly benefit this course needs to leave the ivory tower and try actually meeting REAL WORLD environmental managers before they try to design this course again.",
    "Basic information regarding systems thinking. However we only covered one framework\/type of systems thinking and not in depth enough for me to confidently say Im proficient. In terms of the case we looked at, we did get enough information, so it worked as a case study",
    "I learned to think and evaluate every component and factor of a project.",
    "It was a great concept to have speakers from diverse backgrounds and level of engagement with the issue. The objective for students to think about any environmental problem from diverse perspectives was successfully delivered. However, it would have been beneficial to have the economic and financial aspects about the problem, since it forms the core of the issue at hand.",
    "The instructors taught this course as if none of us have had experience with systems thinking - and this is simply not true of young professionals who have just come from collaborative and regional organizations. I learned very little, gained few skills and had minimal insights during this course. The majority of what I learned was about Bristol Bay, Alaska and not, as the course intended, about solving super wicked problems.",
    "Multiple disciplines and their applications to the same environmental issue",
    "How to make casual loop diagrams in order to analyze and work through tough problems and situations.",
    "I learned about the case study of Pebble Mine and Bristol Bay. I reviewed how to construct causal loop diagrams.",
    "absolutely nothing. Creating Causal Loop Diagrams did not prepare me for anything or provide me with any additional skills, knowledge, or insights.",
    "Insight into systems thinking and causal loop diagram, however very few hard skills and tools were learned.",
    "In depth knowledge of the pebble mine case and the different actors involved",
    "Discussion skills",
    "The content of this class (Pebble Mine\/Bristol Bay issue) represented an important and pertinent topic so I was grateful for this class because it gave me the resources\/discussions to help develop my knowledge related to that topic. While CLDs were a good tool for us to use to think about these issues, I don't know that I gained any skills I didn't have before through this class (maybe other than the CLD, which could have been covered in 1-2 weeks rather than a full semester).",
    "In theory: a method to attack a complex issue by considering multiple perspectives and thinking deeply about the scale, feasibility, and permanence of multiple potential actions. In practice: something approaching what I learned in theory.",
    "Systems thinking and making causal loop diagrams.",
    "I learned more about a case study that I already was aware of.",
    "Knowledge and strategies about tackling issues that imperil ecosystems.",
    "I learned a lot about Indigenous communities' discrimination and saw how politics directly affect the solution to certain problems. I did not gain any particular skills, besides learning how to create a causal loop diagram, which I find helpful only for understanding a bigger picture and not for working on details.",
    "Systems thinking, Analysing problems from multiple perspectives",
    "Developing causal loop diagram Responding to online discussions",
    "I gained experience using the Systems Framework and this was insightful to me because it provides another lens for looking at environmental issues. I learned a lot about communities and environmental issues in rural Alaska through in-person meeting opportunities. I gained knowledge and insights from the other students who are skilled in different areas than myself and this was a great way to get to know other disciplines. It was also nice to reflect on what my interests are and consider how I can use my time at F&ES to achieve my goals.",
    "I'm not sure I developed new knowledge or skills in this course. I had already used the system thinking tools and frameworks that were taught previously and I have studied natural resource\/extractive industries cases\/engaged with these topics previously and I feel like this case followed a very similar pattern to what I had seen previously. I think the biggest take away from this course was the engagement with my classmates. I think it is extremely valuable to have a collective first year experience and my discussion group helped me get to know and connect with a new group of students in my class, which is extremely valuable.",
    "I learned about causal loop diagrams and systems thinking. I gained insight into how to take multiple perspectives into consideration while thinking about possible solutions to socioenvironmental problems.",
    "How to approach complex problems and analyze its parts and stakeholders. Cooperating with peers and stakeholders from different backgrounds.",
    "Perspectives from guest speakers was extremely valuable",
    "Looking at different perspectives, causal loop diagrams. Working in teams on group projects\/CLDs. Writing a white paper.",
    "This course was certainly an eye opener for me as I had to come to grips with a variety of cultural differences and differences in presentation when assessing a multidimensional problem relevant to the North American context. I see perspectives as an elaborate case study that has socio-economic, regulatory, scientific, ecological and emotional dimensions. The insights for me included not just my own opinions but also opinions of others - I was kept engaged with how people view such complex issues and how opinions are formed. I believe in the end most people shared an opinion that there is no clear answer. It's difficult to say yes or no - grey areas are what we need to navigate through. This is certainly very representative of real life situations that we encounter and opinions need to consider all sides and valid arguments presented. An important skill here is to differentiate good and bad arguments in what seems as a maelstrom of activity.",
    "This course helped demonstrate different communication methods used by stakeholders and demonstrated some techniques that are helpful in understanding the complexity of environmental problems. The small-group discussion section allowed for very insightful discourse with peers holding diverse perspectives.",
    "Systems thinking and causal loops diagram. However, I felt like I learned a lot more about the Bristol Bay case rather than concrete, practical skills.",
    "I learned to work better with others in my field and how to understand the value of varying perspectives on a given issue or topic.",
    "I gained an understanding of the Pebble Mine issue as well as the approval process for natural resource extraction projects. I also gained an appreciation for the challenges and difficulties of environmental management",
    "Systems thinking, collaborative working",
    "None",
    "This course rises the awareness that any issue is formed through a lens of perspective. It teaches us to switch among many different lens to achieve multiple answers to the same problem. It also emphasizes the importance to combine lens into system thinking.",
    "System thinking",
    "I learned about the case study and the different perspectives on it. The class touched on levers of change and systems thinking. I learned about the specific tool of causal loop diagrams.",
    "systems thinking, developing and realizing there is multidimensional perspective to any problem at hand, importance of engaging with opposite views to get a full understanding of the situation",
    "I learned about the Bristol Bay\/Pebble Mine case study from various perspectives including indigenous peoples, fishermen, scientists, engineers, government officials, and more. I developed my ability to make a causal loop diagram.",
    "Integrated, systematic thinking of problems. Analysis of solutions from multiple fronts and perspectives.",
    "Causal loop diagrams, and specific knowledge on mineral extractive industry, salmon fisheries, and policy governance of indigenous land in Alaska.",
    "I have gained a more well-rounded knowledge of the Bristol Bay\/Pebble Mine issue. It's important to view an environmental issue with system thinking."

   "comments": [
    "not much",
    "Well - I didn't really have expectations going into the course.",
    "They aligned moderately with my expectations. I was expecting to learn some more tools especially around decision making.",
    "I had heard pretty negative things about this class before I started so I wasn't expecting to learn a lot. In that way I suppose it did align with my expectations as I don't feel I gained as much knowledge from this class as from my other ones.",
    "Honestly, the class was so repetitive and not a good use of my limited time here at FES",
    "This is a required class for first-year students so I didn't really have set expectations. I enjoyed the course.",
    "The class met my expectations.",
    "The course aligned with what I expected for the course.",
    "I liked the course a lot more than I thought I would. However, I believe that it was more of a valuable bonding experience than an academic exercise where I gained new skills.",
    "I did not have very high expectations of this class and the coursework aligned with my expectations.",
    "Not well. I expected to come out of the class with tools to combat environmental challenges, but all I really know now is how to make a casual loop diagram.",
    "I think we missed some important stakeholders in the Pebble Mine\/Bristol Bay standoff. Nevertheless, I think that given the time constraints the insights I gained aligned with my expectations.",
    "The knowledge I gained from the class more or less aligned with my expectations.",
    "It mostly aligned with my expectations (especially around the speakers!), although I would have preferred to learn more tools and frameworks besides just causal loop diagrams. In general, perspectives might be better off as a seminar class worth fewer credits that does not include CLD assignments or discussions and instead involves speakers and a final writing assignment (policy brief, op ed, blog post, paper, etc).",
    "Pretty well align with my expectations.",
    "Honestly, poorly. For a three credit class, I was expecting more than just guest presentations every Monday with unstructured time for sections at another time during the week. I was also expecting more skills and ways of thinking to be presented. But however the professors wanted the course to go at the beginning of the semester, the course structure that they carried out focused more on listening to guest lecturers say whatever they wanted (sometimes overlapping knowledge with others, other times giving insufficient background or support for their arguments, and at times even talking about things outside the scope of this class - such as when one lecturer tried to sell us on his personal business\/charity venture).",
    "Not bad.",
    "Not well. I was expecting this to be a class that taught critical thinking skills and decision making strategies for managers, but it mainly presented problems about an issue with no solutions-oriented discussions.",
    "Financial Aid estimates FES's full cost at $64,720, so this course cost each and every MEM about $8,090 to take (not including lost income we could have spent in the workplace, or time on classes that provide tangible professional skills). So how do YOU think the knowledge, skills, and insights into flowcharts gained in this class aligned with students' expectations?",
    "Very poorly. Aside from learning a lot about the case study, in my case, no new skills were learnt.",
    "This course was more informative than I thought it would.",
    "It aligned well within expectations",
    "This course fell vastly short of my expectations. As a water resource professional, I was excited to be working on a case study that would be so water-forward. But two weeks into the semester, I realized that this would be a busy work class with no real value in my education. We were not challenged, we were not pushed - we were merely herded toward the answers that the professors wanted to see. This class is too large and too convoluted for students to learn about innovative problem solving - especially when we are presented with only one method. Furthermore, I had hoped that there would be some sort of meaningful product to come out of the lecture. I know my classmates have organized something in this vein, but the professors should have anticipated this and incorporated it into the curriculum.",
    "Pretty much what I expected",
    "They aligned well with the course.",
    "The class and the skill sets gained were below expectations.",
    "The class was very confusing for me and I did not relate well with the ideas the course tried to convey. My expectations were different, that of being trained as an Environmental Manager with the skillsets required to tackle real time problems. The course took another turn where it was more about the mInes and the movement and less about the practical skills.",
    "I had hope that this class would be integrating what we had learned in MODS and the backgrounds of everyone to synthesize what it means to be an environmental manager. this class literally did none of that. It was all about Paul and Julie spouting off about systems thinking and speakers essentially telling us the same 3 stories from different viewpoints.",
    "Would have liked to better learn causal loop diagrams",
    "Moderately well",
    "Great",
    "I expected to learn a lot about Bristol Bay in this class, which the course accomplished. In terms of skills, systems thinking was not new to me so I don't feel like I gained any analytical skills through this course.",
    "Below expectations.",
    "This class did not meet my expectations whatsoever. The causal loop diagram assignment was extremely redundant and did not seem relevant to professional students.",
    "To some extent especially related to water ecosystem and toxicology.",
    "I was expecting much more from the required course for environmental management specialization. Basically, I was hoping to learn what exactly can and should be done when dealing with such cases like Pebble Mine. I also thought that we would be taught different tools that environmental managers use in their work.",
    "Aligned pretty well",
    "I expected to have more classes on system thinking and related approaches but we had only one or two. The rest of the course was more like a seminar course, with a number of different speakers.",
    "One expectation I had for this class was that I would gain a stronger skill set in identifying, analyzing, and suggesting solutions to environmental problems. I don't think this was achieved very successfully through the coursework because we lacked training in the class's theoretical framework. Systems thinking is a powerful tool and we did not devote nearly enough class or section time to this practice early in the class. As a result, I found myself frustrated by the deluge of content without a clear direction for my analysis partway through the class. In response to this frustration, which seemed to be broadly felt by the class, our TA started teaching us content from Systems Thinking by Deborah Meadows and this went a long way towards providing us with a theoretical framework for analysis. I wish we could have started in on that sooner and with more structure.",
    "I don't think I really knew what to expect at all for this course.",
    "I expected to learn different approaches to analyze problems instead of only the CLD approach. I would also have appreciated more insights into problem solving approaches and skills of how to interact with stakeholders.",
    "Expected more guidance from instructors for tools to navigate various perpectives presented",
    "I was hoping for more applicable skills outside of CLDs to systematic thinking and problem solving.",
    "Honestly I couldn't possibly have had any particular expectation at the beginning but in hindsight it was an organized chaos that is reminiscent of real life situations and the greatest skill this course imparts is that acknowledging that decisions are taken with a lot of grey areas.",
    "I didn't have clear expectations coming into this course, and was open to any number of experiences in this mandatory class. I was happy with the takeaways that naturally came with the course, but some of the imposed goals of the course, specifically the implementation of a systems thinking framework and the construction of a proposed intervention, were not met and ultimately detracted from the course.",
    "OK... would have liked to have left the course with more practice and knowledge of causal loop diagrams and systems thinking.",
    "They were about spot on.",
    "The class material exceeded my expectations (I was expecting less in-depth information and lectures). However, the structure of the class did not meet my expectations.",
    "I was hoping to do more active, guided, group systems thinking work with respect to the case study. I was also hoping to see more examples of completed causal loop diagrams with context to guide my own work.",
    "Far less",
    "Discussion on the issue, such as socio-economic conflicts, can be done beyond the level of just facts.",
    "Not very gpod",
    "I expected more from this course. While I learned a lot about the case and found it interesting, I wish this course had dug deeper. I feel like I could have learned more from Julie and Paul.",
    "it was just what I wanted to learn in my first semester, knowledge and skills will help me understand the other subjects better",
    "I don't think this class met my expectations as to the knowledge I was hoping to gain.",
    "This class was below my expectations because I was hoping to have more of a practical impact. The case study was fascinating and had a lot of potential but the way it was executed was heavily theoretical and didn't engage students in analysis and application. I expected that Perspectives would bring together the various skillsets and diverse backgrounds of MEM students toward concrete outcomes; however, the large lectures didn't allow for meaningful interaction with other students outside of our small discussion groups. Given that Perspectives is mandatory to MEM students and the limited chances to take classes in the fall, I would have preferred that this course and the case study were more relevant to my academic and professional goals. I don't think the course was worth all the carbon emissions from sending so many speakers on planes from Alaska. While I appreciate how much effort has gone into developing this course, honestly and respectfully, I do not think that Perspectives should continue.",
    "Not well. The intention and objectives of the course are very good, but the execution is very poor.",
    "I didn't have defined expectations of what the class would offer before I started. I feel that the class aimed to offer a liberal arts\/ holistic foundation for environmental managers that would be most beneficial to those students that had been specialists prior to coming to FES. The work I've done prior to FES has been quite community facing and intersectional, so the way of thinking that Perspectives offered felt like review for me personally."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "weakness- a very lopsided case study in which 9\/10 people were opposed to mining. A case study which had equal proponents for both for and against would be better case studies should not be crowd sourced. Instead, a case study should be selected by the instructors and the TAs. More focus should be on actual skills and tools like systems thinking",
    "The course did a good job soliciting different perspectives and giving students a pretty thorough understanding of everything surrounding Bristol Bay and Pebble Mine. I've heard this was much better than last year. The course could have done a better job of teaching frameworks for decision making in complex situations. It seemed maybe 2\/3rds through the course we had learned most of the perspectives and it would have been valuable to understand \"what now\"? As leaders in the environmental field, we need to make these tough choices where there may be winners and losers - how can we do that effectively, recognizing who the losers are and taking responsibility for that? We could probably cut the 1st intro session and the last one with Dean Burke\/Os to include more material on decision making at he end.",
    "Strengths - Hearing from diverse speakers and understanding their stances, small discussion sections to pick apart the case Weaknesses - Sometimes what we discuss in the section does not seem aligned with the final goal",
    "Unfortunately I do not agree with the idea of this course in general. There are four other basic knowledge courses that we must take that are already eating into our time here. I only have two years and 16 classes I can take. For the amount of my resources it requires to do this degree, I would like the freedom to choose which classes I take and don't take. Additionally, I took a similar class in undergrad about systems thinking and how to engage with different stakeholders thus I really did not get much out of this course.",
    "Don't make it feel like an undergrad entry level course. As adults, we know there are perspectives to everything. Embed it into MODS if it's so important to cover systems thinking",
    "The course meets for one hour every week and is all guest lectures. The guest lectures are the strength because it was so cool to meet and hear from actual stakeholders and their points of view, and many were willing to have lunch and\/or dinner with students. The weakness is that, outside of those guest lectures there wasn't a lot of cohesion. The discussion sections were all very different - my TA and group of people were great which made the class a lot better, but it can vary by your group.",
    "Discussion groups and guest speakers were the strengths. Amount of readings, and repetition of introductory information from each speaker were the weaknesses. First, it can be improved by choosing a case that is not personal to a member of the class. Second, it can be improved by giving clearer guidelines on assignments and fewer readings. The last class session was unnecessary as the speakers were not versed in the issue, detracting from the class.",
    "It is not clear what the goal of the course is. If the goal is to introduce different systems thinking tools, then more than one tool should be introduced. If the goal is to work towards solving a problem, then there should be more organization around determining a clear solution. If the goal is to explore the diversity of \"super wicked\" problems and their common elements, then more than one topic should be addressed. The course seemed poorly planned and, worse, the concerns about the course that the students brought up during the semester were not taken seriously.",
    "Strengths: discussion sections, variety of presenters Weaknesses: final papers, difference of expectations amongst discussion groups",
    "The discussion groups were a strength. The TAs and professors also put a lot of effort into attracting great speakers. In terms of a weakness, I felt it was very easy to lose track of the bigger picture. While the big picture was effectively explained during the first class, periodic reminders and prompts at the beginning and end of lectures would help remind students WHY we examining the questions introduced by the class.",
    "- This course was not meant to be able Pebble Mine - this was not clear at all. I as well as most people in the class thought it was about the mine, the view points of different stakeholders and the role that each of them play. However, at the Wednesday night meeting we had, we were told this class was not about Pebble Mine. The intention of this course should have been discussed from the beginning. This then made the final paper awkward since no one knew whether to write about the mine or general environmental problems. - I enjoyed the Pebble Mine case study and actually think centering the class about the case study was great. - I did think about the environmental footprint of flying all those speakers in from Alaska was especially in an environmental course - This particular case study involved many legal issues (this was impossible for the professors to know this prior) but I wish we had a beginning class discussing the legal issues at hand and going over the legal process (i.e. the EIS, NEPA, role of EPA versus Army Corps)",
    "If this course is going to continue to be a 3 credit class, there must be more concrete skills gained from it in order to justify making mid-career professionals take it.",
    "There is too much emphasis on CLDs. I would have appreciated using other frameworks to approach the problem. Maybe instead of doing the CLDs, we write a policy memo to learn about how policy can engage in environmental problems. Another week, we read the science from the mine, and critique it to understand science's role in environmental decisions and know how to read and understand scientific literature as environmental managers. Additionally, it felt that there was little effort coming from the professors, making me put little effort into the class as well. Assigning a whole book and telling us to read as much as we can does not motivate me to do any of the reading. Finally, the last class was a mess. The faulty speakers brought in to give their \"perspective\" were not even educated on the issue. We were told to boycott Apple until they recycle, but Apple does recycle and given the expedited NEPA process, boycotting isn't going to stop this mine. One faculty member didn't even know if the mine was in the NEPA process.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of speakers who came in to talk to us, but a little disappointed that we didn't engage with the material more head-n.",
    "Strengths: -real world grounding in a case study -interesting case with relevant topics in it for everyone -loved being able to suggest and vote on topics -the discussion sessions with TAs were valuable for learning and absorbing and critiquing what we have learned that week Weaknesses: -not enough real world outcomes, such as ways to use what we learned to engage with the situation (eg, final could have been a blog post, or an op ed or a letter to a policymaker, etc) -carbon emissions from flying in speakers -systems thinking was presented to us as this new thing we've never considered before, but as interdisciplinary environmental students (many of whom have worked before) we already understand that framing and understanding environmental problems is an important aspect of solving them. This class certainly did not push us to go beyond what we already know and felt condescending. I would have liked to see more social science and movement building covered in the course -professors did not show willingness to listen to constructive student feedback I think the course could be improved by functioning more as a seminar class worth fewer units and centered only around speaker talks.",
    "The size of the class may be too large so that people might feel hard to engage in the lecture.",
    "Strength: It brought in people from outside the university. Weakness: The strength was not the objective of the course. If the course is designed to use Bristol Bay\/Pebble Mine as a case study, then use it as a case study while focusing on different ways of thinking and different skills. As it was carried out, this class was structured more as a course on Bristol Bay\/Pebble Mine, and tangentially on how to examine varying perspectives, conduct systems thinking, or apply the course knowledge to cases outside of Bristol Bay\/Pebble Mine. Furthermore, graduate students often have great experiences and backgrounds that may help the rest of the class understand certain concepts behind parts of the case study. Space for this during class would be great to have.",
    "Strengths: exposure to stakeholders with first hand experience. Weaknesses: We could have spent more time talking about solutions rather than spend almost all the sessions hearing about the problem only.",
    "I think this type of course is incredibly important for a program like FES with the MEM degree. My main critique is that there was little to know targeted learning about developing solutions and decision making as a manager in this situation. I also felt that the case study selected was presented as a very black and white, good vs evil issue; which didn't allow any nuanced opinions to shine through. I also feel that the CLD and final projects and and assignment process were not well thought out, and I did not feel that I came from the class with any new insights or applied skills.",
    "The professors made very clear to us during the mid-semester session that they have no interest in listening to student feedback because they've been doing this a long time, and unlike us naive students, they know what they're doing. So seriously, start from scratch because the current format of this class is truly unsalvageable.",
    "strengths: great speakers, great opportunities to engage with them both in class and in the additional events that were organized Weaknesses: no tangible skills were learned, repetitive exercises in perfecting causal loop diagrams were pointless, not a lot of guidance",
    "I feel some of the speakers said the same issues repeatedly.",
    "Strengths: - using resources to hear from a wide variety of stakeholders - hearing all the points of view was valuable Weaknesses: - too large to achieve goals - professors have blinders on when it comes to CLD - there are other problem solving methods - far too much work \/ reading for 1 credit class - bad communication - many of the course notifications came to us with under a week before lecture to read a vast amount",
    "Strengths: potential for collaborative projects and freedom to explore Weaknesses: One case study forced upon the whole class constricted relevance and engagement No tangible take-aways. Skills such as using the system dynamics modeling program were not taught or run through, we were expected to just know them already.",
    "Great topic, but I felt that it could have been covered differently. I do not think the TA's properly understood how to analyze casual loop diagrams. I feel that some of them were just as confused as us.",
    "There was poor communication from professors on expectations and the purpose of the class. Making this course mandatory for all MEMs makes little sense because very few skills are gained by taking this course. The case study and guest speakers were interesting and informative, but using those as a tool to teach systems thinking was ineffective, at least in the manner that it was done for the course. Instead of spending a semester attempting to teach graduate students how to draw simple causal loop diagrams, I'd recommend making a systems thinking professional skills module that is mandatory for F&ES professional students. Or, incorporate it into MODs. Then students will gain the systems thinking \"tool set\" without having to use 3 credits on a mandatory semester long course.",
    "The strengths were the TFs. They made the class bearable. The class is kind of a joke - what were actually supposed to get out of the class? What did Paul and Julie think they were teaching us? We never learned anything about CLDs or how to create them or really what Paul and Julie's expectations were for the CLDs. The speakers were interesting but did we really need to fly them all out to New Haven to hear their stories? And then to have Os just go off on how technology is bad at the end - when we created how many tons of carbon emissions flying people from Alaska!? Nothing about this class made sense. It was a complete waste of time.",
    "Strengths: -A real world case study presented from the perspectives of 12 different people presented access to individual perspectives we would not have been able to see otherwise. Additionally researching an ongoing case was more beneficial than studying an already settled case. I felt the classes recommendations could actually be valued and used by the community. -Excellent layout to the course. I think it could be improved with not making it a required course that way a smaller class could lead to more in depth discussion. If the course was limited to 60 I think every spot would still be filled. - The professors and TF's were extremely dedicated and hardworking. I felt they had a passion and vested interest in the topic. Weaknesses: -Not enough counter view points to the mine - *suggestion if not considered: a Rep from the US army Corp of Engineers and Alaska state government rep -Systems thinking (the way it was presented) is a limited framework in that it relies too heavily on causal loop diagrams. Causal loop diagrams are weak in assessing background trends and social processes as well as integrating goals and outcomes. Additionally, systems thinking does not take chronology of events into account which is a very important aspect to this case. CDL's are very good at identifying leverage points, but I think there are better frameworks that incorporate the entire process of decision making. -It seemed there was a large difference between the teaching styles and topics covered by the TF's in the discussion sections. I felt my group wanted to have more discussion about the topics talked about at the lecture section, but we spent a lot of time doing CDL's which most did not find useful. There many different perspectives in my discussion section and I would have liked to talk more about that. *Suggestion - a less structured discussion section where TF's may come prepared with questions but only use them if discussion slows. I realize something needs to be graded for class which CDL's worked great for, replacing these with the discussion posts would be a good alternative.",
    "The strength of this course was in the talks given by invited speakers and listening to their side of the story. However, it got extremely repetitive in the second half of the semester and we really didn't need to create 4 CLDs. I think the class understood the systems thinking concept sufficiently enough by CLD 2 and towards the second half of the semester the course seemed more like busy work than actual learning. One lecture on the importance of CLDs and systems thinking approach was quite enough. Perspectives felt more like an undergraduate class than a masters level course, perhaps more clear focus on creating solutions to the problem in the second half of the semester would have kept students more engaged. I enjoyed the discussion sections and Robert was a wonderful TA. This course was really useful in highlighting a difficult problem and letting us have in depth knowledge of the issues involved. But all this could have been much much compressed, my recommendation would be a half semester course.",
    "Meaningless discussions",
    "I think the Perspectives course could still be incredibly valuable to the FES curriculum but the way it is currently run and managed needs to be changed. This course fell short for a lot of us this semester, largely because expectations and goals of the course never really seemed clear and the way Julie and Paul ran the class seemed incredibly condescending at times. Spending the first two classes defining whether a bowl of fruit counted as a \"system\" or not was a waste of time for graduate students at Yale, and was honestly borderline offensive. The speakers were good and the TAs did a great job helping us talk through what we were digesting through speakers and readings each week, but it seemed that the management of the speakers and guidance on Q&A in the class time could be done far, far better. I heard a classmate say during the last class meeting (where Indy spoke) that if a prospective student had visited on that day and sat in on that class, it would have been an embarrassment for Yale. I agree. The speakers that were chosen to come in that day were not knowledgeable about the topic at all and didn't add anything of substance to the curriculum. Perspectives will be a valuable class next year if there is a higher level of respect between the class leaders and the students, and expectations for what should be taken from each speaker\/reading is much more clear each week. We felt lost, confused, and talked down to throughout the semester but that does not have to be how the course is conducted in the future if some serious thought is put into changing how it is run.",
    "The teachers, TFs, and students did not seem to align well. I thought the root of the issue may have come from a lack of alignment between the professors and the TFs. The effectiveness of the class depended on the TF sessions and the main class being coordinated and well-planned. However, I don't believe the TFs received enough guidance from the professors.",
    "I enjoyed hearing from various speakers but was incredibly disappointed in the lack of gender diversity of the speakers. Each male speaker was allowed an entire class period, while the few female speakers were organized into panels into 2 class periods. Each speaker should have received more guidance on the amount of readings they assigned - some speakers assigned short articles or chapters while others assigned entire books. Flying the speakers to New Haven had a massive carbon footprint - why wasn't this addressed? It seems that we would have had a similar learning opportunity if they presented remotely. The case study seemed like a poor choice - I realize that the students crowd-sourced this case study, but I don't think an active case study should have been chosen because the professors did not seem to want students to actively engage in the case study but rather use it as an example of systems based thinking. If this is the purpose of the course, they should have chosen a case study that was already resolved. The causal loop diagram assignment was redundant and not helpful. I think it would have been more appropriate for two professors with different backgrounds to teach a course on 'perspectives' together, i.e. a chemist and a social scientist. Overall, this seemed more like a course that I would have expected to take during my undergraduate degree and definitely not of the caliber that I expected a graduate level course at Yale to be.",
    "It is a good initiative; but things seem a bit unclear in some cases - instructions to assignment.",
    "By the end of the course, I had more questions than answers and even though our final task was to provide a solution to this problem, I felt that the amount of time that was given is not enough to create a precise plan. Also, I would like to have more guidance when working on our solutions, maybe it could be a supervisor for our specific topic. Overall, I felt that we did not dedicate enough time to learn how to find solutions.",
    "Strengths: Was able to bring in a wide range of speakers associated with the case study and thereby provide perspectives from across the spectrum on the issue Was able to facilitate deeper systems analysis Weaknesses: Course could have been better if it provided a platform where speakers with different views came together to directly address concerns raised by each other. This would have enabled better synthesis of the wide variety of knowledge and perspectives that were being shared. The course should have had less readings. There was a lot of repetition in the knowledge shared by the speakers. Did not particularly find creating multiple causal loop diagrams very useful\/effective.",
    "Strengths - The way that students are required to respond to questions and to each others viewpoints in smaller discussion groups. It's a great skill to develop, especially responding to online discussion threads. Weaknesses - There isn't much emphasis on the theory of system thinking",
    "Strengths: - All of the MEM students are together and this is a shared experience - The topic was interesting and complex - I enjoyed learning about tools for systems thinking - I enjoyed meeting people from Alaska and learning from them first hand and also learning from the analysis of my fellow students - I appreciated the diversity of perspectives Weaknesses: - The theoretical framework for this class, Systems Thinking, was offered to us in a much too abbreviated way. Most students had not encountered this content and it is impractical to expect us to skim\/read the entire book during the first week of class and then apply those skills throughout the class. I would suggest applying some group teaching techniques (for example, everyone could read the intro chapters one week and then sections could break up into groups and read about certain techniques and teach the rest of the section those techniques). I think this would go a long way to alleviate the frustration that happened in the middle of class. - I was disappointed by the attitudes of our instructors. I felt talked down to throughout the class and I believe this created a lot of tension between the students and the instructors. I felt like our instructors were resistant to feedback and instead blamed us for for not getting \"the point\" of the class. The instructors' behavior eroded my trust in the class. I would suggest that the instructors treat us like they would professionals in a work place who are trying to do their best rather than as if we were unruly high school students. - There were several last-minute \"highly suggested\" meeting times that fell outside of regular class meetings and were scheduled last-minute. I was unable to attend many of these events and this was frustrating. During one class the instructors seemed upset that many of us were unable to come to these meetings and implied that we didn't want to come, which I do not think was true of the student body. I would suggest announcing extracurricular meeting times at the beginning of the course. - This class seemed a bit \"thrown together\" and I think a bit part of this was because the instructors did not know what the topic would be until late last year. I would suggest that the topic be set earlier (perhaps the \"voting\" by the current class is not possible) so that the class could have more defined structure. Also, the reliance on in-person speakers could be limited. Maybe some would be via Skype only. This way we could focus more in the theoretical and technical skills offered in this class and actually have a chance to master them. - We did not get a state government perspective on this case. I think this was an important knowledge gap that may have improved our outcomes.",
    "Strengths: First year unifying experience, Teaching Assistants, Professor Zimmerman's insights in class specifically, my discussion group\/the discussion group structure in particular, the workflow for the class -- read, post, lecture, discuss. Improvements: Could we have built on the case a bit in the second half of the term? What are similar cases happening around the world? In our own hometowns? Introduce the idea of how would we address these cases using our chosen specialization early in the term. Maybe simulate\/have groups mock negotiations? arguing cases? Connect Systems Thinking tools to other tools\/frameworks students may be familiar with to get more buy in and demonstrate that these tools essentially do the same thing as Design Thinking, policy sciences, anthropological methods etc. Choose a more \"confusing case?\" Where the class is more split\/it feels harder to take a side? I DO feel the class got stuck on pro mine vs anti mine and it really got in the way of broader learning",
    "The strengths of the course were the chance to interact with different stakeholders and the guidance in creating causal loop diagrams. Also, the input by the two students from Alaska were very helpful. Weaknesses: little conciseness between discussion groups. Not enough input from lecturers. More preparation and reflection of lectures needed. The lectures and the whole course became very repetitive after a while because the guest speakers repeated themselves and the students had fully understood the case early in the semester. A case study from a different country would have been fairer for the international students because their lack of knowledge about the American legal system and permission processes made the course harder for them. Moreover, an international case study would have been more interesting and would have provided more content to be assessed by students. Alternatively, several different case studies over the course of the semester that could be analyzed with different methods (CLD etc) would have been good. Guest speakers with different opinions could have been invited via Zoom together for each case study, providing the space for discussion between them.",
    "Strength: variety of speakers, sections were well facilitated as open discussion sessions Weakness: overall framing could have been improved",
    "More applied skills outside of CLDs. If the intention was to write a white paper as the final product, would have liked more guidance\/review\/structured learning on how to write a white paper. For a grad-level class, felt it learned heavily on expectations to know things rather than learning new things (ie, writing a white paper but not given any instruction on that new skill)",
    "Strengths - exposure to making decisions with complex and interdisciplinary grey areas. Weaknesses - course evaluations should consider discussions on canvas rather than just submissions of causal loop diagrams and final paper. Ideally point system evaluations should be kept to a minimum. Also there are better tools to evaluate than causal loop diagrams.",
    "One main strength of this course was the integration of small groups, which allowed students to discuss the complexities of the issue and environmental issues more generally. I also appreciated the great lengths you went to in order to bring relevant speakers to the class (and even allow for meetings beyond the 12:00-1:00 class time). Contrary to the views of some of my peers, I did feel like it was helpful for all students to share one unifying course experience, as it allowed for discourse across specializations, and most of what I gained from the course (and the semester) came from my small group discussions for this course. I enjoyed the topic of this course, and the relevancy of a live case added excitement and intrigue to Perspectives. One thing I would have liked to see in a class with many different perspectives was greater flexibility towards differing student expectations and desired outcomes. The course deliverables could have been better suited to the course curriculum-- I rarely felt like the CLDs provided insight or aligned with the conversations in the course, I felt under-prepared by the course and lecturers for the white paper, and the individual paper was irrelevant to the parameters of this course. Additionally, the course materials (specifically readings) could have been more carefully selected, as many readings were relevant only to the broader issue of Bristol Bay and not to the specific perspectives presented in the associated class period. If guest lecturers could have been more focused, possibly through more in-depth briefing, or specifically selected, in the case of the guest lecturer from the Air Force Academy, the course may have been improved. Some of these",
    "More instruction at the beginning of the course about systems thinking\/frameworks would help.",
    "Pros: The most enjoyable and interesting part of this course was having different speakers present their perspectives and expertise on Bristol Bay and Pebble Mine. I also ha a great TA for discussion section. Cons: We spent too little time on causal loop diagrams and systems thinking. We should have spent more time on this at the beginning of the course, especially since we had to talk about the skills we learned for our final papers. It felt like we brushed over these skills and were then asked to write about how we would use these skills in our future studies and careers. The end of the course got a bit repetitive with some of the speakers (felt like we were hearing a lot of the same things), so perhaps it would've been useful to dedicate a couple of our last classes to talking about systems thinking and causal loop diagrams.",
    "The strengths are the discussion groups and the amount of people that come to speak to the class. The weaknesses are the lack of structure and grading style.",
    "Strengths: - Format of requiring pre-lecture readings followed by lectures by an expert\/stakeholder and small-group discussions was useful in ensuring students engaged with the material in a variety of ways - Selection of speakers appeared sufficiently diverse (with the understanding that the lectures are limited by who agrees to attend etc.) Weaknesses: - Too much time was spent in the first two classes on introducing the case, causal loop diagrams and systems thinking. While the concepts may be new to some students, they are not difficult to understand or conceptualize - I believe the majority of the students understood the purpose and advantages of systems thinking early on - For critical documents such as the DEIS and NEPA procedural documents, students were not given any guidance before\/during\/after the class on how to read and engage with the documents. These documents are expected from all projects and follow a generally accepted format. However, they are also highly complex, containing highly scientific information and technical data that may be outside the scope of an environmental manager's field. Given this context, I believe the course should've included a section\/half-lecture\/guidance document focused on the skills and approaches needed to handle this highly technical information. For example, the DEIS contains highly technical hydrological and geological information. If the goal of the course is to ensure that students are prepared to manage the complexity of environmental projects\/issues, it would be critical that they are aware of how to read reports that contain technical information. Some guidance on generally accepted hydrological standards or where students could find those standards\/regulations would've been useful. Similiarly, financial projects are critical important to all projects; however, there was no guidance on who\/why\/where the financial projects are, and after they were introduced in Week 10 (\"Wardrop Report\"), there was no guidance on how to evaluate the financial projection data provided by the Pebble Mine. Given that financial projections help provide the economic justification for the project, it is critical that future environmental managers at least understand how to assess the projections. - The final class session should've been one that brought home the message that the Pebble Mine issue is one of local, national, and international importance. In my opinion, appreciating that fact was more important and necessary than returning to systems thinking, which is more abstract. The final lecture session felt disjointed from the rest of the course as neither Oz nor Indy were aware of the depth\/breadth of what was covered by the students and therefore struggled to articulate a clear vision and message. - The class could offer an option for students to take on the case beyond the semester",
    "Weaknesses - narrow points of view, history never taken into consideration. Indigenous communities are not a test subject. If this course is to focus on a case including indigenous communities, FES should strive to teach indigenous studies: history, law, treaty relationships, culture, etc.",
    "A very loosely structured course",
    "I wish this case study could have gone deeper into systems thinking and levers of change. I understand a point of the course is to hear many different perspectives, but at times it felt like we were only scratching the surface of how to put the different perspectives together to analyze the issue as a whole.",
    "strengths: encouraged students to develop a comprehensive understanding of an issue, different perspectives put forth by different lecturers each week helped understand how biases are shaped and how to recognize them, helped understand the intricacies of the US federal system with respect to the environmental regulations weaknesses: took up too much time as it was a 3 credit course, could be a 1.5 credit course instead or a seminar series which culminates into a white paper(would recommend the seminar series), while it was helpful for students to see the differing viewpoints it will be more helpful and interesting to have the different guests debate the Pebble Mine issue with Julie moderating the panel.",
    "I did not feel like this course taught me much to be honest. I really enjoyed the speakers that were brought in but felt like what I learned from them could have been gained from a mandatory lecture series rather than a 3-credit required course. I mainly question why this course is required. The general concept is to ensure everyone understands the complexity of environmental problems and to provide causal loop diagramming and systems thinking as methods to help deal with these. However, these concepts weren't really taught in depth even though they were being framed as THE tools to solve complex problems, without regard for other analytical tools to understand complex systems. If this class was intentionally trying to teach us the benefits of systems thinking then we should have also been taught comparative frameworks as well. I also think it was too superficial. I think the vast majority if not all MEM students are aware of the complexities around wicked problems. I didn't suddenly learn that the world is complex or that we'll need complex tools to help address them from this class. I came to this school because I know of these complexities and I want to gain as many tools as I can to tackle them. I also felt as though many of the assignments, the weekly discussion posts and the CLDs, were largely given to us as busy work so there would be something to grade. Because I know most were just checks to make sure they were completed, I didn't feel they were as worth my time within my busy schedule. Though I liked my discussion group, and especially loved my discussion leader, I also just felt like I wasn't necessarily learning a lot from it and instead it mainly served as a place for us to work on our CLDs and to really just get to know each other better (which was definitely valuable, I just wanted more). I know this sounds incredibly critical so I also just wanted to reiterate that I really appreciated my discussion group and I really liked the lectures and the speakers that were brought in. The lineup was impressive and I learned a lot about the specific Pebble Mine issue. I just wonder what the purpose of this class was for. I didn't learn new concepts and even though I learned about CLDs, this information could have been conveyed to us in a mandatory lecture series or just a mandatory reading and exam for all MEMs (that is - if the program feels like it was absolutely necessary for us to have gained this specific tool, which I'm still not convinced was necessary). Or, this information also seems like it could be cut down and conveyed easily during MODs. I was just frustrated that this requirement took away an opportunity to take another 3-credit class that I was excited about and that I think I would have gained useful and applicable skills from. Even so, thank you for introducing me to the important environment issue of Pebble Mine, I was very interested in the case study and appreciated learning about it.",
    "My favorite part of the course was talking about the case study with my discussion group. I also liked the opportunities to meet with guest speakers in small groups. I think this course could be improved in several ways. I enjoyed hearing from most guest speakers but I wish there were more time for student questions during lectures, especially from those who hadn't asked questions yet as the mic was often given to the same people. Readings could have been more tailored and intentional, for example, by assigning a limited page rage instead of an entire 200+ page book with a few days notice and saying to read as far as you can. The professors and teaching fellows could have provided rubrics for homework assignments so that the grading and evaluation weren't so subjective. I also think they should have required fewer causal loop diagrams, which seemed like a less relevant skill. The professors were dismissive and rather defensive toward students' midterm feedback and even treated a few students rudely, which led to issues continuing throughout the semester.",
    "Strengths: the discussion sections are a great part to learn from your knowledgable classmates. Very enjoyable. Weaknesses: unclear academic expectations, guest lecturers not very well thought of and organized to provide a logical path of analysis, each TF had different criteria and understanding of what was supposed to happen. The case study was too narrow as well, and for many students it felt really irrelevant.",
    "See above. I understand that this course is still being iterated on and appreciate that!",
    "I really really appreciate the efforts bringing all these amazing guests to the lecture. The course intended to enhance our critical thinking and multi-perspective thinking ability when considering environmental issues. But to me, the nature of this case inevitably makes is a mine vs not mine debate. I wish the order of speakers could have changed, but I understand that it was not a decision that instructors could make. But I did feel a sense of 'choosing a side' even before a lot of us have gained adequate knowledge on the case. Also, many guest speakers at the end of the semester were repeating the same information with different languages..."

    "Do try to engage with the material beyond what is just presented in class.",
    "Start writing the final paper sooner.",
    "This course has loft goals and admirable objectives. Given time, it can be the crown jewel of an MEM student's time here at F&ES. As it currently stands though, this course is a product that is being pushed out on consumers without having finished the planning, testing, or vetting process, and it shows.",
    "Literally don't do any of the reading, as someone who did do the readings I can guarantee that absolutely none of them are necessary. Clearly the professors and TFs did not read the readings themselves, because some of them were written by the same authors and have passages that were LITERALLY word-for-word identical. And barely any of the class time discussed any of the readings at all, except for an EIS that professors neglected to teach students how to reach professional. Better to just devote your time to other classes that will provide you with useful, marketable skills.",
    "Guest speakers were the best part of the class. Take the opportunity to talk to them in smaller groups during other organized events. Thats when I feel I was able to ask deeper questions and get a better understanding the case study.",
    "Have an open mind.",

    "The discussion sections were a great way to engage with my peers and mull over what was covered by the speakers that week. Being engaged in the discussion sections was helpful in refining my own point of view for this issue. I would recommend taking full advantage of the one hour discussions and the posts leading up to it, because most of the learning happened by talking with my peers.",
    "It is a compulsory course so you will have to take it.",
    "If the class is run the exact same way, try to find a way to make the course useful to you personally so that it doesn't seem like a waste of time. Engage with classmates about questions you have, and look to TAs for help. Understand that hearing about these issues is very important, even if the way this particular class is organized makes you less and less motivated to learn.",
    "I hope this course is not required for future students.",
    "It gives some insights about the issue and ways to deal with anomalies in our ecosystem.",
    "Start working on the final white paper early as it requires a different approach than the discussion posts",
    "Spend more time learning about systems thinking earlier in the class even if that means skipping some of the content about the case. Don't take the instructors frustrations too seriously, they are trying their best to design a new class and it will take them several years to work out the kinks. Go to the lunches and meet with the speakers. Work in a group for your final paper, working with other students is some of the greatest value. Tell your TA about what you want to get out of the class and work with your section to design meeting times that will help you achieve your goals.",
