    "It's a very interesting class that chronicles Greek history, and especially great when Professor Cammack teaches it.",
    "This was a fresh look at ancient Greek politics. If you want to go deep into the history and mechanics of ancient Greek government, this is the class for you. More reading was assigned than was actually covered in class due to tangents in our large seminar. She was knowledgeable, engaged, well-prepared, and accessible.",
    "You should take this! You get to study the most important civilization to ever exist from an angle that classics departments normally don't get to. The readings were SUPERB.",
    "You will go through the primary sources of Athenian and wider Greek politics from pre-history to the fall of Athens. The most important thing I got from this course though was not the history but a completely new way of seeing modern democracy and modern politics that serves me every day.",
    "If you get the chance, take this class. No questions asked, just take it."
