    "Well, every English major has to take it, and instead of begrudging the requirements, I suggest you take with an open mind, even if you don't think it relates to your field of English (I didn't think it had anything to do with my interests at first...), because the base that it gives you will most certainly expand your understanding of the whatever your concentration is.For non English majors, you sure as hell better have a deep deep love for early english poetry if you're going to take this class, because it probably won't help out your biology career or whatever, so I can't imagine having much enthusiasm for it if it wasn't going to be useful for your future.",
    "Take it if only to read the texts. Great poems that were a pleasure to dive into. Shop it first because Lawler might not be the right teacher for you.",
    "If you are an English major, Professor Lawler's class is a great one. If not, think very seriously about whether or not you are willing to commit to this class before taking it. The workload is manageable but significant.",
    "English 125 with Professor Lawler was a phenomenal experience that I would recommend to anyone interested in building a strong foundation in classic poetry and becoming a stronger writer.",
    "It certainly achieves what is says it will do - give you a grounding in the major english poets. It is work heavy, relatively fast paced but thoroughly enjoyable.I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the poets, but I think it is a class very much suited to majors in English. I think there are other classes that non-majors would prefer or for people looking to fulfill a humanities requirement in a less working-intense capacity.",
    "It is a hard and rewarding class, especially with Professor Lawler. I highly recommend his section. Lots of reading, 5 papers, and a difficult final, but he really gets to know his students, and gives you little life lessons once in a while. It is probably better to take it as a sophomore unless you are certain you are an English major as a freshman.",
    "It is what you expect. A course in early english poets. It gives you a very good grounding. If you like english and poets do it. It is quite hard as a freshman though doable, very straightforward as a sophomore."
