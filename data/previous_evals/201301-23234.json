   "comments": [
    "Good introductory literature course. All Yale students should take an English course, and if you're particularly interested in literary analysis and close reading, English 115 is an excellent choice. Be prepared for occasionally heavy reading and denser papers (sometimes at the same time). On the whole, a class that improves both analytical and writing skills while providing interesting discussion of great texts.",
    "It's a wonderful literature seminar that not only gives you a fresh perspective on reading with an open mind, it also will definitely improve or reinforce your writing.",
    "Lots of reading, average amount of writing. All in all an enjoyable course. Your academic writing will probably improve. Take it with Prof. Weber if you have confidence in your ability to make sturdy, interesting arguments; probably avoid Prof. Weber if you specialize in BSing.",
    "In this section of English 115 you learn how to write a basic college-level paper. Yet, the grading is very harsh and sometimes disheartening. I spent a ton of time on this class, yet I do not feel like I got a ton out of it. I took this course after having taken English 127, and it definitely felt like a step backward, although I generally did better in the English 127 class and found it more fulfilling. I would also be wary of this section of English 115 unless you are genuinely interested in verse-- you have to read a large amount of Chaucer, which is very dense and definitely not for everyone. However, there are some great aspects of this course-- Professor Weber integrated interesting movie clips and articles into the class. He also really provides a lot of feedback on papers, so you know what to work on.",
    "This class is a great intro English class and the teacher is very friendly. Feel free to ask him about anything. Actually I highly recommend that you do approach him a lot because he is very receptive to questions. Also meet with him to go over your work once in a while. As you can tell I would highly recommend this class to another student.",
    "English 115 05 is a great option for a student looking to explore literature while trying to get his\/her feet wet in the English department at Yale. The reading list is fantastic, and the course is beneficial to a student looking to improve his or her writing. All of this would certainly lead me to recommend the course."
