   "comments": [
    "\"Doug Rae, Ian Shapiro, and friends present: Equally fascinating, but not entirely connected thoughts on the financial world.\"Take it for the awesome professors and guests.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a good chance to learn from profs. Shapiro and Rae. I think there were too many students in the class, and discussions tended to be dominated by a few individuals.",
    "Yes! This is the perfect seminar to write your thesis in.",
    "This semester at least the course was taught closer to small lecture format than seminar format, partly due to the large number of students (about 28) in it. I think it would be better smaller. I'm not an economics guy, so I learned a lot about how the financial system worked and the roots of the recent crisis. A great class for exploring how the financial world and the government are intertwined. We also spent a lot of time thinking about capitalism and how (or if) it should (or can) be regulated and managed. Discussions weren't the most stunning week-to-week, but the overall messages of the course came through clearly. Doug Rae and Ian Shapiro are great together; they team-teach it well.",
    "Absolutely! Great class if you can get into it.",
    "A cross between a business school class, a high-level philosophy seminar, and an informal political debate between smart people. Highly recommended.",
    "The class is about the relationship between banks, governments and civil society. The third less so, but given the fact that most of the us in the class were not exactly experts on financial market regulation, the discussion tended to evolve into a debate on what civil society should expect the government to do, more than the specific regulations that the government should put in place. Those who wish to propose specific regulations should take some ECON classes on Financial Markets\/Financial Theory beforehand.",
    "This class was really great and will give you a good though brief understanding of the history of capitalism in Western countries and a much better understanding of the current financial crisis. The papers are not very long and you can write about whatever interests you, and the reading is usually interesting and not very long, though some readings are dense.",
    "Big-picture discussion of the relationship between finance and states, as well as between the capitalist system and states."
