    "1. provide a systemic perspective on energy technology innovations;2. access to Prof. Grubler, TA Rebecca, and a wonderful group of classmates;3. establish a better understanding of various energy technology innovations and the LSM.",

    "The material was very relevant for different aspects. Its focus on energy technologies fitted well into the overall course of my studies.",
    "It fits in really well, although sometimes it's hard to see how because it is so historical and almost philosophical. That's why I would emphasize the practical use of the frameworks reviewed in class.",
