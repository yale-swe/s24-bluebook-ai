    "This course could be greatly improved with better speakers\/presentations. The speakers were okay, but there tended to be a lot of overlap in what was discussed. A clearer approach might help. I also would have liked to have more non-Jonathan Rose Companies speakers. And it would have been nice to have one key reading assignment for each class that could give us a simple overview of the topic, with all the additional reading provided as a supplement. It was hard to know where to start and the supplied reading was too much for a 1 credit course.",
    "Every speaker who came thought they had to give us a background on climate change. We are masters students at FES. We KNOW about climate change. We were taking the class because we wanted to learn about HOW to design land use projects to minimize CO2 emissions. I hoped to gain some practical knowledge from the course but didn't. I hoped I'd be walking away from the course with some examples of really creative and innovative projects but I'm not.",
    "Question 9: There was one field trip but I was unable to attend.Question 10: The material taught in the class doesn't fall under my primary field of interest, but I shared the information with friends who I thought would be interested, and it facilitated some great conversation and excitement about the topics.",
    "1. There were virtually no readings2. Guest lecturers ran the gammit from \"magnigicent clarity\" to \"dense fog;\" the average, as well as the organizing professor, Daniel Hernandez, was around 2"

    "Needs a broader range of land use topics: MTR, agriculture, other topics.",
    "Coordination among guest speakers to reduce redundancies.",
    "-This course was offered during the same semester as John Nolon's \"Land Use Planning and Practice.\" It is an important topic, but the two classes have too much overlap. Indeed, early in the semester they were covering the same topics on the same weeks--though this got fixed as time went on. A class like Nolon's is much more useful than this class, and so this one shouldn't be offered again.-Too many guest lecturers canceled, and the professor himself couldn't make it a lot."

Either there isn't any more to say, or this course was just not trying to break any new ground; I think the latter is more likely."
