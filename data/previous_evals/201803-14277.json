    "I got more comfortable with writing, reading, and speaking German during this semester. I learned some additional grammar and vocab while also diving into the history of German plays.",
    "I gained a greater appreciation of German literature and culture.",
    "172 is a survey course on German Theater from Lessing to Jelinek. I learned to read literary German texts as a non-native speaker while considering the texts as works of tragedy with different takes on representation and performance.",
    "Developed skills in literary analysis, improved German language long-form writing skills, learnt about key elements of theater and dramatic theory, learn about important German literary figures and movements."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings for the course are fascinating and well spaced out. Our discussions were also fascinating, although I wish we had been given more guidelines for our readings to prepare us better for class.",
    "The difficulty and amount of the material are at once the course's strengths and weaknesses, and it is a weakness only insofar as there is never enough time to do the readings nearly as well as one would in a literature class in one's native language. That in itself is really a strength however-- just as you learn to read quickly and effectively in English, it's equally necessary to do so in a foreign language. The real weakness, then, is that the course only meets twice a week. An L5 really ought to meet three times a week.",
    "One of the great strengths of this course is the selection of texts. I think I thoroughly enjoyed pretty much everything I read for this class. The variety in themes, types and time periods really makes the course more interesting and more valuable. The homework is well structured. The weekly discussion posts and comments provide a great avenue for discussion and help us prepare for in-class discussion. The vocab quizzes were also a great idea, were well structured and definitely helped me expand my vocabulary."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! I really enjoyed both the readings and the discussions and found several authors whose other works I would now love to read.",
    "Certainly! The plays are quite diverse, in content, style, and difficulty, and will all improve any German level.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, as long as they are willing to read a reasonable amount and are interesting in deeply engaging with interesting literature."
