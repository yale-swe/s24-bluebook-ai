   "comments": [
    "It is very difficult. It is fun, but everything takes a looong time. If you enjoy studio classes and are ready to put the time into it - then you should.you will learn a lot about wood and thinking in 3d",
    "A basic course in wood shop. I didn't really know what I was getting into and ended up loving it. If you like big saws, wood, or feeling generally badass, I think it's a great course. I'm very happy I took it.",
    "intro sculpture class, wood is the basic medium although not the only one you can use, two major projects with some small drawing\/observation assignments.",
    "Absolutely take this class! You will learn all about wood, and Scott lets you make basically whatever you want. I was pleasantly surprised with how conceptual this class became. You don't have to work that hard, but if you do you will get even more out of it. Fantastic class!",
    "Yes. Take it. Learning how to build things and chop things and make art is important things for a human being to know. Prof Scott is the best to learn from.",
    "I would recommend this to any student who has ever been interested in working with wood.",
    "Art 120 was an excellent studio course. Not only was I able to hone woodworking skills and expand my knowledge of woodworking techniques, but the class discussions about interpretation of how each sculptor views reality and conveys his or her ideas were especially enlightening. This was one of my favorite courses taken to date and I look forward to taking more with this instructor in the future. I most definitely recommend this course."
