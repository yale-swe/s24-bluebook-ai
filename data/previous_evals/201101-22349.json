    "Writing exercises, reading great short stories, a writing workshop at the end.",
    "This class is great if you want the basics of storytelling, but you also have to be prepared to burrow down into the short story genre, which is a very specific category of storytelling that you may be unfamiliar with outside of the classroom. I would recommend it to everyone, as it is a great opportunity to work with a talented, energetic, insightful, and very helpful professor while he is still working at Yale.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It's presented as a \"beginning fiction\" class, but I've taken \"advanced\" fiction workshops at Yale before and haven't learned nearly as much as I did in Reading Fiction for Craft. It's a wonderful balance of reading& talking about the best short stories of the century, writing exercises, and finally, writing your own story. You can tell that Michael cares deeply for this course. All of the classes and writing exercises are painstakingly planned out. Yes, he's a famous writer, but you would never know it - he's willing to meet with you at any point, read and give feedback anything you've written. If you can get in, take this class, even if you think you are beyond \"beginning\" fiction.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student. This is a great, illuminating class. We read great short stories, looked at them through the lenses of different devices for writing fiction, and learned a lot. Michael Cunningham is the best writing teacher I have ever had, and I've had a lot of writing teachers in a wide array of contexts. Michael Cunningham is an exceptional writing workshop leader. He is kind, perceptive, sensitive, encouraging, and really really smart. The exploration of the fundamental tools of fiction at the beginning gives us a language and a frame for critiquing each others' and our own fiction during the workshop portion in the last few weeks of class. An exceptional course. Take it! Shop it, and put your all into convincing him you're one of the 12 allowed in.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 134 to another student. If you can get into the course, TAKE IT. You will be so glad that you did.",
    "This is an introduction of sorts (although writers of all levels are welcome) to writing fiction. The first part of the course focuses on critiquing professional short stories and writing exercises, and the second part is a student workshop.",
    "Same answer as 'overall assessment':MC is the man, has real presence and is an awesome, insightful straight-talking, intellectual teacher. He knows how to write, clearly, and knows how to help otter write, and write better. If you get in, take the class. You only write one story soif you'd like to write more, you come out of the fiction classes with two. To get in, he calls on everyone who raises their hand on the mad crowded first day and I you say something he likes he makes some kind of mark next to your name.We read great short stories, ech week base on a different element of story-writing, and wrote short exercises each week until our own short story time came around.Take this class, I never regretted it--the opposite--and neither will you. Even though the semester is over, I'm still working on fine-tuning my short story. He's truly a good teacher, as perhaps few writers with such talent are.MC is honestly the man. A great opportunity to have him as a teacher, and I hope to take another class with him.",
    "If you're trying to choose between Michael's fiction writing workshop and his class, TAKE THIS CLASS. Don't let the low class number fool you: this is how every creative writing class at Yale should function, in my opinion. Because Michael spends 7 weeks with us deconstructing every part of a fiction story, we learned the basic rules of writing (even though, of course, there \"are no rules\") before attempting to write a story ourselves. Of course, I learned so much writing my own story, but I think I was only able to do so well because I had absorbed the lessons Michael had taught us during the first 7 weeks. We also did small writing exercises during these weeks, so you won't be at a lack of writing.Finally, the best part of this class is Michael's accessibility. He encourages you to send him drafts and stories anytime, and his advice over email throughout the semester was invaluable. He's definitely one of the best teachers at Yale. Put your all into the class! You won't be disappointed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Really, it should be required for every student at Yale. Whether or not you have had any experience writing you will get a lot out of it.",
    "For the first half of the class, you read stories by published authors and discuss them in class (each class is centered around an element of fiction -- voice, structure, character etc.). You write weekly writing exercises and one full length story by the end of the semester. I'd recommend it as an intro to fiction, though the workshop can be kind of hit of miss because the other students aren't always that insightful (there is no app for this class, so the make-up can seem kind of arbitrary).",
    "Wholeheartedly, YES. If you like creative writing, you must take this class, if you can. Michael Cunningham is an amazing writing teacher: kind, thoughtful, smart, funny, wise, and a seemingly bottomless well of amusing and interesting anecdotes. I learned so much from him this semester. Take it. You won't regret it.However, a bit of friendly advice: even though it's EXTREMELY difficult to get into this course, ass-kissing is not the way to go."
