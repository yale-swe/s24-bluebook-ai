    "If you're looking for a directing class, and want to get to learn more about how others see the art of directing, and be forced to look at scripts more closely than you probably have before: take it. I think that the text work was really useful particularly for those who have never directed a show before and are looking to how to begin, and for more experienced directors who have a lot of ideas but don't quite know how to deal with texts. For directors who feel that text analysis is their strongest quality, the first part of this class will be less useful, but the second half more useful.",
    "Yes. Take it if you want to direct something. Whether or not you think you can direct. My class was full of actors, most of whom hadn't directed in the past and didn't even necessarily plan on directing in the future. The course is beautifully laid out. It ends up being a lot of work (many small assignments; you are always doing something), but in the end it is worth it. If you do everything she asks, you will learn a ton from this course. I was shaky on it in the beginning, but ended up really liking it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It gives you practical skills to begin to tackle the mystery of directing. Toni Dorfman is a wonderful, tough yet nurturing teacher.",
    "If you're interested in directing - either for its own sake or as an actor seeking to understand it - this is a vital class. Expect to work hard, and not always be entirely clear of the purpose (or desired outcome) of every assignment, but have faith that it will pay off in the end."
