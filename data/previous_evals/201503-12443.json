   "comments": [
    "It was a really really interesting course. The material is super interesting, if not a bit overwhelming at times, but the quizzes kind of come out of nowhere and you may know the material but you still feel underprepared. There is probably too much material for one course, but the material is interesting. If you aren't scientifically inclined, tread lightly. It isn't a lot of work but the quizzes are pretty rough.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning more about vector-borne diseases, and is willing to get nitty-gritty with the science behind transmission, life cycles, immune systems and vaccines. IT IS NOT AN EASY CLASS. I wouldn't even say it's necessarily for nonscience majors. But it's definitely a very interesting class and you'll get a lot out of it. There are many components to the class, including reading questions, quizzes, a midterm, a presentation, a panel discussion and a final paper - these are all spread out quite evenly throughout the course, but there's definitely a lot to do! Overall, I do recommend the course, but only if you are willing to put in a lot of work!",
    "This is a great class, but it's not a gut. That being said,it's also completely manageable as long as you do your work. The quizzes are pretty easy if you pay attention and do most of the readings, and the final paper is actually kind of fun to write. Participate or you're not going to get as much out of it.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit, don't want to have a section, and are willing to put in work to actually understand the material. Things get busy towards the end with quizzes, presentations, panels, and papers though, so take that into account when putting together your schedule.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. It was eye opening and if not incredibly difficult, also very interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student; it is by far the best class I have taken at Yale. The professor is inspiring and the material is difficult but you learn how to apply what you learn.",
    "Lots of information and lots of reading. Be prepared for tough material and sometimes frustrating quizzes and midterm. There was no feedback given on quizzes or correct answers given so you didn't know where you strayed in your answers. The sequencing of the course material was jumbled and hard to follow, many times coming together to make sense after each quiz or the midterm.",
    "Malaria, Lyme & Vector Borne Diseases is truly an amazing class! It is specifically created for non-science majors but still provides students with a concrete understanding of a number of different diseases, not just Malaria and Lyme, as well as an understanding of how he immune system works, how vaccines work, and the challenges of finding an intervention to prevent these diseases. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in public health of just curious about diseases in general. It is a great class!",
    "This is a good class for people who aren't focusing on science in their major and want to learn about the subject matter in a seminar setting. It has manageable work, and the lectures are interesting.",
    "Were I to take the class again I would make sure to take my notes in a notebook and not on my computer.",
    "This course is great to take if you don't have a lot of experience with science, but you are interested in vector borne diseases and their effects on infected population. Its very fast paced, but you learn a lot and the material is very interesting.",
    "Yes, but only if you're willing to be challenged!",
    "It was a tough course but I enjoyed it. I learned a lot. It was heavily involving",
    "This is a very interesting course, and the subject of vector borne diseases is great for common knowledge. It is challenging, and there is a lot of memorization needed. I would recommend if you're a non-science major looking for a science credit, but be prepared to put work into it."
