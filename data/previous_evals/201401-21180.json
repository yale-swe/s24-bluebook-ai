    "For the truly invested and engaged junior in the English major -- and pretty much anyone looking for a really awesome just-for-fun-hey-why-not-this-is-Yale course! If you liked English 125, here is the perfect part II of your Chaucerian pilgrimage! Margery is FANTASTIC, incredibly quirky and delightful autobiography of an unforgettable woman with some really fascinatingly (quasi-incestuous?) bending of Catholic theological teachings. Mandeville's Travels are not to be forgotten -- a sort of whirlwind tour reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz. Latin scholars in particular, come one, come all! You will LOVE Trevisa's dialogues and much of the latinate interlocution of Piers Plowman. The opportunity to engage closely with manuscripts in the Beinecke is also an AMAZINGly unique feature of this course, this university, and this professor. Friendly, cautionary amendment: Reading the works in the original Middle English is NOT to be sneezed at. English majors, beware: Even on a work-heavy night, it is impossible to breezily skim the readings in this class! They are encoded in a deceptively similar but-really-not-plain-English language! Readings will take a great deal of time, care, attention, and consideration. Just block out the hours and you'll be fine -- and it's ultimately worth it. Discussing the texts is incredibly rewarding, and pondering the linguistic nuances of the texts in their original language is quite exhilarating, especially with Professor Cornelius and your merry band of fellow Medievalists. Just be forewarned; I wouldn't advise pairing this course with a particularly heavy spring courseload -- these readings deserve your full time and attention.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I found Readings in Middle English to be a great course! I came into the class knowing nothing about Middle English, and ended up being delighted by much of what I read. Much of this, I think, was due to Professor Cornelius' passion about the subject matter. The size of the class (six people) made it incredibly interactive. A lot of the learning felt like we were all discovering together. The Beinecke visits also really encouraged the spirit of curiosity for its own sake--after Professor Cornelius' introduction, we were given plenty of unstructured time to page through manuscripts. The texts can seem dry or difficult at times, and the reading is very time-consuming, so be aware of that. Otherwise, I think Engl 158 is a great introduction to an area of English literature that many students aren't exposed to.",
    "If you've had even a little experience with Middle English and enjoyed it, I would recommend this class. The readings are challenging, especially near the beginning of the semester, but they will get easier as you gain experience, and you will feel so accomplished every week. Professor Cornelius is great and the class was probably my most rewarding this semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 158. ENGL 158 was a fantastic seminar class. Professor Cornelius was brilliant - an expert if there ever was one in the field. He guided conversation with a masterful hand and was especially thorough with his essay critiques. One of the best English teachers I've had thus far. The class had a great selection of readings, which provided rich and diverse content, and all seemed to tie together well under the class's theme of the symbolic power of language. You get to learn Middle English as well, much different from modern English. The frequent visits to Beinecke tied everything together seamlessly. I came to appreciate immensely the world of English pre-Chaucer and the class has greatly expanded my knowledge of the language."
