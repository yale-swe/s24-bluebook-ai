   "comments": [
    "The course could have explored more of the modern day implications of how we reflect on the Holocaust with a few more contemporary texts.",
    "I thought the course had a very interesting and rather diverse range of sources! I especially appreciated the inclusion of sources such as Shoah, that would not have perhaps immediately come to mind for this kind of course. I enjoyed the class discussion thoroughly, and will definitely remember much of what we discussed and how I reflected upon it for a long time. I thought both Prof. Truestedt and Cecilia did an excellent job of leading this class. I think to improve it I would definitely want even more variety in the type of source we select- I would enjoy reflections that are perhaps more modern and more broad in scope, or the combination of older, more specifically Holocaust-oriented sources, with more modern, less directly Holocaust-oriented material. I think that would really allow us to better delve into the reflective process that I think this course should achieve, beyond just exposing us to the classic materials of this area. There are entire fields of media that we did not touch upon- as an example, fiction work is something we did not touch. I think that there is a lot more diverse material that could be very applicable to this class that unfortunately we did not touch upon. That being said, most of what we did discuss what definitely very interesting and valuable!",
    "The materials and discussions were very interesting, and I found especially impressive the way in which this topic was handled, balancing sensitivity to the emotionally hard events and complicated materials of the Holocaust, with nevertheless maintaining intelligent, sharp discussions on the controversial materials and questions. The group was also great, and everyone contributed to the discussions - and it was really interesting. I would have loved more discussions in later philosophical reflexions and the way that they formed the philosophy of the 20th century."

    "Yes, I learned a lot about critical theory and witness theory that i had previously not explored and the course was taught in a very engaging and explorative way.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Yes. It was very thought-provoking, and also made students think, I believe, about the relationship between the intellectual work that we are doing in the university, the world and the human."
