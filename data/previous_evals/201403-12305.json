    "Take this class if you're interested in nuclear weapons + international relations. It's a very good survey of different ways of viewing the issue. The readings can get a tad long but definitely do try to keep up with them.",
    "Take this class! Professor Debs makes the information easy to digest. The class is really not that difficult, yet you will learn a lot. I used information from this class in other classes too! Work is manageable. Be sure to participate in class a couple of times because he keeps track of it! Enjoy.",
    "Take this course! I learned a lot and the work was all very manageable. Professor Debs is a great professor and, if you keep up with the work, it is not hard to get a good great.",
    "Yeah, an interesting class covering all nuclear-related issues",
    "To be honest, I was quite dissapointed in this class. Although Professor Debs is very nice and clearly very knowledgeable, his class is not particularly engaging or well-structured. In fact, it's very poorly structured: it consists of a lecture in which he summarizes the reading for that day, and then a discussion section among the tens of students who take the class. This is to say that, to receive a good participation grade, you must be ready to speak frequently in front of all one hundred or-so students. The class focuses primarily on high-level academic research, so there is not much consideration of the ways in which these issues intersect our own lives. Grading is rather tough, and Debs can be at times inaccessible; given the size of the class, his office hours fill up, meaning that you may feel directionless or confused when it is time to complete an assignment. (These assignments had little explication--with a group research project, there was no more information available than to respond to a prompt in no more than fifteen pages.) I would say that this class has made me less interested in pursuing Political Science in any capacity, and for that, I regret taking it.",
    "Nuclear Politics is a great class for a political science or history buff. I can imagine it would be kind of boring if you weren't into that kind of stuff though. The workload isn't too heavy, but you do need to keep up with the readings. It's not a gut by any means, but it is not a super strenuous class. You can enjoy it as much as you want, and put in as much work as you want, but your grade will reflect it. Lectures are just that, lectures, so don't expect a lot of hands on work with the professor or TAs, though they are accessible if you want to see them outside of class. Overall, this is a great course that does not have too much work, aside from four short reading responses, a midterm, a 15 page max group paper, and a final.",
    "take the class for an interesting analysis of nuclear weapons! not a gut though",
    "Whether you want an idea about what political science at Yale is all about or are interested in the material, take this course. It's a lecture that feels like a seminar, assignments are reasonable and meaningful, and you'll get a lot out of it if you put in the time. Professor Debs is awesome to boot. Highly recommend.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the material. It got dull at times. There is a lot of reading, but you don't need to do it because he goes over all of it in class. The grading is easy.",
    "Extremely interesting, will fully equate students with nuclear politics.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "An excellent look at nuclear weapons, why the are use or not used, what leads to their proliferation, and the efforts to control them. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "A complete class on nuclear politics. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Tough grading at times, but the midterm and final are easy if you put the time in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is very informative without being too much work. Make sure to get a good group for the group project.",
    "A very interesting lecture on how nuclear weapons affect the politics and international dynamics of the world. Professor Debs is a great teacher and the class is very interactive and involved despite being a lecture. Workload consists of weekly readings and 4 response memos over the semester to those readings, along with a 12ish page debate statement in November + a midterm\/final. Pretty reasonable time commitment for a very unique class. If you already have some knowledge of the subject you might get bored quickly because there's only so much history to talk about w\/ nuclear weapons, but if you don't know much about their impact beyond WWII and want to learn more this is definitely the class for you.",
    "Nuclear Politics is a great course. You will learn a lot about nuclear weapons and how they affect international relations. Professor Debs is a great lecturer. I would recommend shopping this class at the very least.",
    "This is a better than average class, I think I can now tak intelligently about the nuclear climate today. The readings were interesting, and I liked the multidisciplinary approach as well.",
    "Take this class. Great lectures and interesting content.",
    "Nuclear politics is a good course. Four response memos (short essays), a midterm, a debate statement (essay, and a final. It was nice to have opportunities for class discussion in a lecture of about 60 students. I would recommend it. While the course wasn't extremely difficult, it was by no means easy though, especially if you do not have much experience in global affairs or political science courses.",
    "GLBL 260 is a great in-depth look at nuclear politics since the Atomic bombs: how they have changed political relations and how political relations have altered the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons. Lectures are interesting, and Professor Debs is a fantastic professor, but expect to do (meaning, actually do) a lot of readings for this course, especially for the final and midterm exams.",
    "YES if you are interested in finding out about nuclear politics. Otherwise the class will bore you.",
    "To be honest, this course was a disappointment. It is not particularly engaging or well structured. In fact, it is quite poorly structured: lectures review the reading for that day, and the lack of sections means that to do well in the \"discussion\" component of the class, students must speak about the reading in front of the other hundred or-so students daily. Due to the size of the class, I found Professor Debs to be somewhat inaccessible, which is to say that when I needed direction on an assignment, his office hours were already full. (My grade on that assignment reflected this lack of direction.)",
    "I would recommend this course to any student remotely interested in modern international political theory. It wasn't a high level theory course over all, but rather well founded in real challenges and real examples. Not all readings are necessary, and lectures cover the same material in good depth.",
    "An extremely interesting course concerning an analysis of nuclear weapon's role in international politics since their advent. The syllabus of the class covers explanations of nuclear-use and non-use, the explanations of nuclear proliferation, and attempts of nuclear control. I'd recommend it as a good course for international relations, especially in terms of security.",
    "Take this class. It is interesting and changes your outlook on nuclear weapons. It is only going to get more important as we grow up.",
    "Nuclear Politics is a fascinating class about an incredibly important topic in the modern era. The classes are excellent, and allow for both lecture-style and section-style learning with both detailed presentations and open discussions. Professor Debs is outstanding and his teaching skills are admirable. I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in the effect of nuclear weapons on international politics.",
    "If you're at all interested in nuclear weapons or international\/domestic policies for approaching them, take this course. Professor Debs works diligently to make the class engaging and while there is a not inconsiderable amount of reading, they're well chosen and interesting. Professor Debs tries to create a seminar-like atmosphere, so definitely try to speak up, even if it's a little nerve-racking to do so in a lecture hall. You will regret not doing so later if you don't.",
    "Take it! Dens is wonderful and the subject matter is super interesting. There's a good interplay between history, theory and the empiracal\/predictive aspect of IR theory - especially deterrence, along with other rational and non-rational positions. The readings are long, but informative.",
    "Yes. If you are interested, this is a good course. A little challenging on the amount of time you need to put in both in work and during exams but still take it.",
    "I would strongly recommend the class to another student. In a world where nuclear weapons are relevant and ever-present, this class is a must for anyone interested in the influence of atomic weapons throughout history or even anyone interested in foreign relations in general.",
    "This course is highly recommended for anyone who's interested in the topic area. It's pretty light on homework (the work there is is nicely spread out), and pretty heavy on in-class discussion of the reading for the day. You should definitely expect to participate in class, because the class is much more fun when you do.",
    "Prior to taking this course, I had never really studied nuclear weapons or was particularly interested in doing so. However, I really came to appreciate the role of nuclear weapons in international relations through this class. Professor Debs is GREAT, he organizes and breaks down the material really well for students and it's clear that he genuinely wants to make sure the class understands the subject matter. Keep in mind that this is a lecture-sized class with a seminar-ish component, meaning that you are expected to participate in the discussion portion of the class. Overall I recommend taking this class, especially if you're interested in how international relations are shaped by nuclear weapons."
