    "I learned SO MUCH in this class. We had awesome discussions that spanned from the female experience of slavery to questioning what is \"blackness\" and what has it been in the past to how the repercussions of slavery are still with us today in the united states.",
    "I loved how this class primarily looked at the history of slavery through the lens of literature. I initially thought \"Afterlives of Slavery\" would deal with ways in which institutions similar to slavery are still present in America today (ie: mass incarceration). However, I loved that the class focused on ways in which we internalize, write about, remember, and perceive of the peculiar institution by exploring slavery as a form of capitalism, and by reading both contemporary diaries from slaves and modern literature on slavery."

    "This class was excellent all around",
    "I am torn, because on the one hand I love that we got through so much material, but on the other hand I wish we had gotten to spend more time on each of the works we read. That being said, I loved the array of works we were exposed to, including the films. I also loved that each of us got the opportunity to lead the seminar.",

    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for a tight-knit seminar, and someone who loves literature. While some of the readings could be challenging, as a class we broke them down and made them all manageable. Overall, I learned a great deal and definitely think about slavery in a new light."
