   "comments": [
    "I definitely developed a better understanding of computers and skills in programming Arduinos. I think that a lot of the material overlaps with MENG 390 (mechatronics) but is more interesting and better taught. Even though in theory I should have already known everything since I had taken 390, I learned SO MUCH.",
    "I learned how the Arduino UNO microprocessor worked through both coding and lab sessions, and from these projects I learned about broader topics such as data transmission and encryption.",
    "I learnt a lot of things about Arduinos that I didn't even know were possible before.",
    "Microcontrollers, programming, register commands, PWM, computer communications, soldering, binary logic, and a lot more.",
    "Really extensive analysis of digital systems and writing arduino code. I had no idea that regiser commands and interrupts existed, so that was very helpful. Code snippets and demonstrations in class were very helpful.",
    "This class teaches you how to program an Arduino to do many different tasks including encryption, optical communication, I2C, SPI, communication with Matlab on a PC, and other tasks using both hobbyist commands and register commands. The course also provides experience with implementing circuits in hardware by soldering onto an Arduino shield.",
    "I learned the basics of microcontroller programming, digital communication, and hobbyist electronics.",
    "I learned how to build practical projects on the Arduino platform. The course focused on hands-on projects and the technical minutiae of the Arduino, so you will come away with usable skills for that device. There are a few basic CS and EE concepts taught as well, but they are not the focus of the course.",
    "This course was an overview of the engineering principles behind microprocessors. Topics included programming in c, the components of an Arduino and techniques for using the arduino.",
    "Learned about microcontroller hardware and its many applications."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this class could actually be improved by having smaller weekly assignments. The projects were fun and interesting but kind of came out of left field and there was definitely a gap between the lectures and the projects which could have been bridged by regular homework. That being said, the best thing about this class is Kuc. He's a unique guy but a great instructor and clearly very smart. Very willing to help if\/when you need it, so don't be afraid to ask! The weakness is that we never got any feedback on the projects. The nice thing is that you kind of know if your project is good because the code either works or it doesn't, but it was pretty frustrating to spend dozens of hours on things that weren't even graded.",
    "I thought the class was very well done; there was little homework, but there were three good-sized, engaging projects that made up for it. The lectures were very clear and engaging, and plenty of help was available for the projects in both coding and lab time.",
    "Class involves fun projects but is so poorly organized than a fun experience quickly turned into a stressful nightmare.",
    "The three projects were super fun and cool. Lectures felt slow at times.",
    "The project based structure is great. Learning by doing is really the optimal format of classes like these. Publishing all notes online is a double edged sword. It is very helpful documentation for studying\/projects, but it decreases the incentives to pay attention in lectures.",
    "More office hours and please give feedback on submitted projects. Overall good class. The 3 midterms and optional final was really good",
    "This course provided excellent hands-on experience making practical systems that I could easily see coming in handy in any work related to interfacing between hardware and software systems. It teaches you the mechanisms in the Arduino underlying the programming commands and gives you a better understanding of how the Arduino itself works. The class is already excellent the way it is, but the only suggestion I might have is giving students the detailed final instructions for the projects a little earlier, although I know that may be impossible since to project has to be tailored to the material each class has gotten through, which is sometimes hard to predict.",
    "I love how applications based this class is! I believe this class should be an example as to how all engineering courses should be, and I am so grateful for having took it!",
    "This course is great because it gives students experience in creating hobbyist electronics projects with enough hand-holding to make it have a relatively low workload. However, the amount of hand-holding involved (going through the minutia of the arduino manual in lectures) sometimes makes the lectures somewhat boring. I think that, after the first project, students should be able to go through the manual and learn things on their own, and the lecture could focus on higher-level or more advanced topics.",
    "Projects were well-designed and mostly fun. Sometimes Kuc had an overly specific mental image for the structure of code in the projects and exams that he forced upon students (for example, declaring a function for us to write but leaving us guessing as to his specific intent for its purpose). A huge emphasis on Arduino register commands felt like needless busy-work, since programming at the register level is impractical and highly discouraged in real-world applications.",
    "The course has a plethora of weaknesses: the course material is totally disorganized and much of the class was learning specific Arduino-related functions that have no broader engineering application. Professor Kuc is a good lecturer, but an absolute nightmare when it comes to the logistics of running a class. The first 20 minutes of each test is spent by him explaining what he means by each question and he gets extremely annoyed when you try to talk to him about the level of disorganization. The highlight of the course was when we sat down to take the final and he informed us that he had changed the format and content of the final as he handed it out."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this. I think this complements MENG 390 well if you're interested in taking that as well. I'm really competent in Arduino\/C now and that's a pretty marketable skill.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone with some coding experience and an interest in microprocessors. It's a very fun, engaging, and well organized class that isn't a ton of work, but the work that is done is all really interesting and intellectually challenging.",
    "I would take this class, but not with Roman Kuc.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It's super cool and chill!",
    "Fun class with three bigger projects throughout the semester. Take it if your interested in learning more about microcontrollers.",
    "Take this class for EE and Arduino",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides great experience with programming Arduinos, which is a skill that can be applied to many do-it-yourself projects even if you aren't planning on using those skills in your future work. The projects are also a lot of fun, and the lectures are always something to look forward to because of their interesting subject material and Professor Kuc's engaging teaching style.",
    "Yes!!! Definitely, if you want to see your effort comes to life, take this class!",
    "This is a great, low-stress course, especially for CS or EECS majors (who probably already can code in C and know the ins and outs of bitwise representation, digital communication, etc.) You'll make some cool Arduino projects and feel comfortable making your own in the future. Nothing you learn will be particularly mind-blowing or eye-opening, but if you're EE you have to take it and if you're CS or EECS it can be a chill elective.",
    "Take this course if you want to really learn how to use the Arduino. Lectures are not very useful and Kuc will frequently exasperate, but the projects are still fun, especially if you have an EE cohort to work with.",
    "Absolutely not. Only take it if you have to- it seems like a manageable class for the first couple of sessions and the course material is not that difficult; however, Kuc's administration of the class is horrible and the tests will be hit or miss.",
    "This is a great course if you'd like some hands on time with Arduinos and to understand what microcontrollers are capable of. However, taking it with Professor Kuc will not be for everyone. The class is organized when it comes to lecture material, which Professor Kuc printed and handed out to each student before every lecture. Grading on the other hand was completely up in the air. At the beginning of the semester he asked the class how we'd like to be graded - this semester ended up being 3 exams and an optional final to replace the lowest of the 3 exams. After shopping period he decided to do away with weekly homework questions (they'd be included in the lecture notes and we could do them for our own benefit). There were also to be projects due before each exam, utilizing methods we were to be tested on. The requirements for these projects were often vague and changed with each lecture leading up to the due date, with only one chance in class to see what the final result should look like. We received no feedback or grades for them. The exam questions were fair, but points taken off for errors seemed extremely arbitrary. For the final exam, he changed the format the day of - which ended up being fine in comparison to the original but was yet another surprise. If you can manage with this lack of structure and are truly interested in learning how to program an Arduino and understand the hardware behind it, by all means take this class. It was interesting to see how machines all around us use microcontrollers to function, and to understand the countless uses for an Arduino. I found myself tinkering with the projects many days after submitting them just because I found it to be fun to keep improving the programs. I'd just say that I was disappointed overall with this class not because of the material or difficulty, but because of the way it was taught."
