   "comments": [
    "A much greater understanding of the history of modern Africa and the roles China and the West have played on the continent. A great deal more insight on how and why decisions about the continent have been made.",
    "The course offered an outstanding opportunity to conceive of, and debate, solutions to the most pressing problems the United States currently faces in regard to its policy toward the continent.",
    "I learned as much or more from this course as any that Ive ever taken, and I came into it with an African Studies minor. I learned how politics, development, and business really work across many different contexts, as well as how to think about problems\/solutions to the big questions in a more useful and effective way.",
    "Ambassador Thomas has significant applied experience. Because of this, he brings a great viewpoint. The largest benefit of this course is the way in which academics are blended with practical considerations."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent group of people, insightful instructor with a lot of experience who really pushed on ideas to make sure they had merit.",
    "The amount of time required for the reading responses may have been a bit high. I think it could be beneficial to shorten response papers to two pages in order to encourage conciseness in presenting arguments concerning the books.",
    "Almost everything is a strength. The only weakness is that sometimes things are a bit disorganized, especially with the syllabus at first.",
    "This course had a very heavy weekly workload. The weekly response papers ensure that students have done the reading in depth and thought about it before class. So long as you're transparent that this is a heavy weekly workload (which you were this semester), I think that this is a good strategy."

   "comments": [
    "Heck yeah. Africa is underloved and so much of what people theoretically think about in other spheres actually plays out there.",
    "Absolutely! If you really want to learn about Africa and the world, this is the place to do it!",
    "Yes. I would particularly recommend this course to individuals who are finishing their graduate degrees in the near future and looking forward to jobs, as Ambassador Thomas gets you to think in a career mindset."
