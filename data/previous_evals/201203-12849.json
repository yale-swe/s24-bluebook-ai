   "comments": [
    "Great course. I was really hoping to find a Spanish class that was not too difficult that it would obscure some of my other classes but would still provide a challenge. Spanish 150 did exactly this. I was able to engage with a range of interesting and relevant subject materials like the fate of indigenous people in Latin America and Ethics\/Morality. I believe my speaking abilities have improved greatly as a result",
    "The class consists of doing a lot of readings, including a novella, and watching a few films. You talk about the themes of the readings\/films in class, write about 6 2ish page written responses, have some written vocab quizzes, and then have midterm and final oral exams with a partner and the teacher.",
    "Great course! The conversations you have in this class are really interesting, and I credit a lot of that to Professor Valle because she's such a wonderful teacher.",
    "This is a very good class to improve your speaking and listening skills. I went into the class after struggling with my Spanish in high school, and my fluency and pronunciation got much better after the class. Valle is a great teacher and is very helpful whenever you need her. The workload is not bad at all and the grading is very fair. Take this class if you want to finish up your L5 requirement!",
    "Great class to improve conversational skills. Also helped improve my vocabulary, writing, and reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an introduction to L5 spanish at Yale and anyone who wants to improve their speaking ability. There was little focus on grammar but a good amount of time was spent actually speaking the language and learning new vocabulary. The class is essentially a place to practice speaking spanish and is very discussion based. Participation is a big part of your grade and a big part of the class. There are a few written homework assignments but other than that all the homework is reading articles and stories in Spanish.",
    "I loved this class and would definitely recommend it to another student because it made me more comfortable speaking and fulfilled my language requirement.",
    "I would recommend it for a student knowledgeable in the spanish language. it is quite interesting and thought provoking",
    "Only take this class if you're really pretty good at speaking and also have impeccable writing. It doesn't seem like there's much work, but if you're not already fantastic at speaking and writing you'll need to spend a lot of time preparing the material and making sure you have absolutely no errors. Other than that, you will get over at least your fear of speaking in front of other people and will probably improve your ability to express yourself in Spanish.",
    "This is not an easy A course, but the reward you reap is proportional to how much effort and work you put in. Shop all the professors you can, because the experience you have very much depends on the quality of the professor. Sonia Valle is a great instructor; she is my favorite of several that I shopped. She is very patient and fair and is willing to take the time to help you improve if you seek it. Workload is reasonable, but reading contains advanced vocabulary that was not necessarily taught in AP Spanish. This course will increase fluidity, but time doesn't allow for acquiring fluency.",
    "A class focusing on the skills necessary to engage in meaningful conversation in Spanish over a wide variety of subjects. I would recommend this class for anyone who wants to improve their speaking skills"
