    "Amazing class! Prof. Cole is incredible and you get exposed to material that's really different and cool.",
    "What a gem of a class! We read poetry that was not familiar to many of us, but Professor Cole is such an amazing teacher that by a few weeks in, we were already starting to get comfortable with it. The material is incredible, the people in the class were all very insightful, and Professor Cole is a wonderful teacher. I definitely recommend this class!",
    "Take this class, as I did, for Professor Cole alone. I had little interest in the material itself honestly, but he makes it interesting, rewarding, relatable, and important.",
    "great content, great to study it with PC, is a flexible course that can be experienced primarily as a course on poetry, or primarily as a course on the history of Jewish culture in Andalusia",
    "An amazing class! Great professor, great readings, great discussions.",
    "A wonderful course, with wonderful poetry that - despite being read 1000 years after the fact and in translation - is quite a joy to wrestle with. If you are coming to the course from the English major, it might be feel unfamiliar but incredibly productive to engage with poetry that requires a fair amount of cultural competency to appreciate. It is a body of poetry which cannot be extricated from the sociohistorical circumstances of its production and is all the richer for it. The course is a great opportunity to study the intimate relation between history and literature.",
    "Yes. As mentioned, it is an excellent course. The title of the course Excellent course. Prof. Cole knows the material like no other, and seems to really have a solid grasp of what is important to emphasize\/de-emphasize. Additionally, the structure and grading of the course seems to reflect a well-developed understanding of what students will want to do and what students need to be encouraged to do with grades. This is a pretty rare quality in the literature dept! Solidly one of the best-designed and taught courses I have taken at Yale. .",
    "This class is amazing, and Peter Cole is an incredible discussion leader. Regardless of your level of familiarity with poetry, Judaism, or the Hebrew poetry of Muslim Spain, I highly recommend it."
