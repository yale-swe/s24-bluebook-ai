    "This course was an intensive overview of France in years preceding and during the Second World War. While particular focus was on the Vichy regime, it provide a substantive overview of French history in general during this period.",
    "As I have taken very few twentieth-century history courses at Yale, I learned so much about France under Vichy rule during German occupation. Specifically, Professor Merriman created a fascinating syllabus that reflected the most important trends in academic study of Vichy. I enjoyed the opportunity to look both at Vichy policies and how Vichy has been remembered within France. Additionally, the films selected really enhanced and supplemented readings. Most importantly, Professor Merriman's thoughtful guidance made the class so incredible, an opportunity both to learn more about the period and to think about historical study and collective memory in interesting ways.",
    "I learned a ton about France especially during Vichy. I find it very sad for other students this will be the last such seminar.",
    "Strategic reading techniques and love for history",
    "By taking this course, I learned an enormous amount about Vichy France and France's path during World War II more generally. I had never before gone so in depth into such a small time period, and I really enjoyed that experience. In terms of skills, I also got somewhat better at reading fast\/skimming given how much reading was assigned (practically a book a week, especially in the second half of the semester)."

   "comments": [
    "Incredible history seminar, difficult to imagine how it might be improved.",
    "This course is only filled with strengths -- Professor Merriman fostered a lively in-class discussion around a fascinating selection of books. After many seminars at Yale, this was an incredible opportunity to think about the ways Vichy has been remembered over the last fifty years. Additionally, fellow students made this class so engaging, perhaps the most active seminar I have taken. Overall, this was a special course with which to finish my Yale career -- I would wholeheartedly recommend this seminar to anyone, both because of the interesting subject and legendary professor.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is obviously Professor John Merriman. He is brilliant and is incredibly knowledgeable about Vichy France and French history more generally. He is also a wonderful person - charming, funny, easygoing - which makes being in seminar with him so much more enjoyable. The approach the course takes to Vichy French history is also strong - it is both chronological and thematic, providing a comprehensive picture of the history of Vichy France in terms of both time and topic. I also very much appreciated that Professor Merriman had us watch four movies over the course of the semester. Movies provide a very different perspective on a historical time period in books, and helped me visualize some of what we were reading about in the books. Film as a medium is also a very powerful way of conveying knowledge and themes. I would say the biggest weakness of the course is probably some of the books assigned. I felt that at some point we were reading book after book (or parts of books) that addressed practically the same topics (namely the internal programs and politics of the Vichy regime). I would have appreciated more books like Vichy in the Tropics (one of my favorite books of the semester) about more unique topics related to the course topic. The other main weakness of the course is that I felt like we didn't talk enough about Charles de Gaulle and the Free French. I understand that the focus of the course is on Vichy France itself, and this justifies such a tactic, but I feel like de Gaulle is such a titanic history in French World War II history (for better or for worse) and thus deserves a bit more of our time. I think both of the concerns I've just outlined could be alleviated by taking one of the current books about what was happening domestically in Vichy off the syllabus and assigning a book about the history of De Gaulle and the Free French in its place, perhaps towards the middle of the semester around the time when we read Vichy in the Tropics."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes because Professor Merriman is such a great teacher.",
    "Though it is unlikely to be offered again, if it is the seminar is a must take if you have any interest in Modern European or French History. It is impossible to understand the current French state without confronting the historical legacy of the Vichy regime.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any students willing to commit to reading fascinating historical scholarship and participating in class discussion. If not, this class might be unenjoyable. Otherwise, the chance to converse under the guidance of Professor Merriman was a unique opportunity. Also, the final research paper was an enjoyable experience and chance to study a part of rich Vichy history more in-depth.",
    "If you have the chance to take any of Merriman's courses, do so.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. You get out of it what you put in. If you do the readings and participate in class discussions, you end up learning a ton about the course material and enjoying the often fairly casual, conversational class sessions.",
    "Absolutely, but I believe this is the last time it will be offered. Take any other Merriman course though.",
    "Absolutely. John Merriman is a legend. One of the old guard. A prolific historian and an even better human. Take the class to learn about history but also to form a relationship with a great guy.",
    "Maybe, if they're very passionate about France, WW2, or Vichy.",
    "Reinvigorated my passion to be a History major. Merriman is an incredible professor and story teller. Would recommend this class to anyone, regardless of major.",
    "Merriman is a treasure and I highly recommend any of his courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to another person. It is a privilege to get to be in seminar every week with Professor Merriman, who makes learning and life overall much more enjoyable. The course content was also quite illuminating. I would caution any student, however, who is planning on taking the course of two things. 1. Hopefully he or she is very interested in French and World War II history, because you will spend a whole semester on a very short period in French history. 2. The amount of reading for this course is quite substantial, effectively a book a week (especially in the second half of the course). It isn't a prohibitive amount, but students should be aware of it before taking on that kind of commitment.",
    "Absolutely! A very interesting course that's explores many facets of life in occupied France, as well as pre and post war Society. Learning from Professor Merriman is a privilege that should not be overlooked"
