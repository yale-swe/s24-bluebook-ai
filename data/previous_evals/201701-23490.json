    "I really appreciated the broad interdisciplinary focus of this class, which offered a range of historical and theoretical materials from across an array of different places and times. Trying to construct a syllabus that addresses the \"global\" must be a real challenge, but I felt that this class gave me a new methodological framework for thinking through questions of intercultural dialogue.",
    "I didn't feel that I really developed many skills from this course. The syllabus was so scattered around the world and in different time periods that I felt I gained a very brief insight into a culture only to quickly move on. I think this class would work well as an undergraduate seminar, but I didn't feel it was in-depth enough for a graduate course.",
    "I learned more about the framework of thinking about art globally - thinking about its production from multiple perspectives.",
    "-how to explore different themes of the \"renaissance\" in a global context (identity, faciality, etc.) -"

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought that, on the whole, this class did a really amazing job of bridging disciplinary categories organized around period, method, and \"nation-of-origin.\" There were times in which I felt that certain authors or topics were a bit overrepresented on the syllabus, including Roxburgh and his Safavid royal albums, but revisiting the same issue with a new methodological focus could also be rewarding, so this was more of a trade-off to consider than a problem to be addressed.",
    "It is strong in its ability to pull out general themes from the early modern period, but that also generates its largest weakness in that it tended to over-generalize the period and the cultures that participated in it. The course seemed to portray the early modern period as a time in which everyone all over the world experienced a sort of revolution, which minimized differences and didn't allow for much in-depth discussion of individual countries, cultures, and peoples. The course would be significantly improved if it simply focused on the Islamic world during the early modern period.",
    "I am not entirely sure how helpful the thematic groupings were for considering the issues. Or, they might have been helpful but we did't really bring them up in our discussions in class. Though that might have been a useful way of framing them. Professor Rizvi did a very good job of facilitating conversation the first few weeks, it seemed like we were not able to weave together as many themes later in the term.",
    "strengths: -organization to fit global themes -balance of theoretical and historical readings weaknesses: -lots of focus on connections between Europe and the Middle East, with little discussion of other global connections (Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Latin America\/Caribbean)"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes-- it's really a great way of framing a course. The problems and questions that emerge in discussion seem worth exploring even for those whose interests extend outside the Renaissance period.",
    "It depends on what the student is looking for in the course. If they would like a general overview of some themes that kind of apply to a large variety of early modern cultures, then yes. But if they are looking for more in-depth discussions of particular early modern cultures and exactly how they developed during the period, then no.",
    "This course seems like it would be helpful in preparing someone who was interested in tackling problems from multiple directions and thinking across cultural lines. It was not, of course, a chance to learn much about any of the individual cultures.",
    "Yes, but particularly would recommend to students who hope to gain greater knowledge of the connections between Europe and the Islamic World."
