   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in doing interdisciplinary research as this course combines faculty in different fields to teach in the same class, which is very inspiring.",
    "Dinner and discussion with scientists! Stimulating, interesting, full of good papers",
    "I would recommend it because it helps broaden the literature a student would normally read.",
    "I thought it was a great class, overall.",
    "Great. Take it.",
    "This class is good in general as a Graduate-level class. I generally recommend paper discussion\/critical thinking classes. Only complain about this class is that it really depends on the quality of the students that actually attend the class. Not to be arrogant or anything but I am really annoyed by students that did not show up to the student-only discussion sections and\/or didn't read the paper by the time of discussion.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend it, though it is not for everyone. It depends on an individual's leaning style. Due to the inconsistency in teaching styles the students who can adapt to that will benefit the most",
    "Good class. Would recommend it despite it being a little disorganized. Felt like it is really the students that make the class and my class was thoroughly unmotivated and half of them didn't come to the first class each week. Having discussions among the different disciplines was very fruitful but will only work if ppl from the different departments actually show up. Questions that people asked (and made us look bad) on Wed were answered and discussed on Mon but they weren't there.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, even biochemists. It's great to get a bunch of different perspectives on a diverse set of topics.",
    "Good paper discussion class.However, maybe the class was too big this year, so it was harder to feel involved in the discussion.",
    "Worthwhile. A great experience once a week. Free food, great papers, high-profile professors. Needs more structure but getting better."

   "comments": [
    "It broadens my knowledge in current bio-related research across different academic disciplines.",
    "Yes",
    "It broadened my overall knowledge, not necessarily deepened my knowledge of my own discipline since this is an interdisciplinary class.",
    "The papers in this course were heavily biology-centered. As a non-biologist, I found this a bit challenging, but the class was taught in such a way that I learned an awful lot of biology very quickly. Thanks.",
    "yes - you learn a lot about different subjects.",
    "This class improves my level of critical thinking necessary when reading the scientific literature which is an essential part of my entire research career.",
    "yes",
    "It helped me gain a better understanding of the inner workings of biology, both in terms of the science itself and in terms of what is required in order to be a successful scientist (I.e. getting funding)",
    "Great papers and good paper choices.",
    "It's useful to see what other people at Yale, not just in your department, are working on. This course could also be very useful for establishing collaborations etc...",
    "Gives a good overview of many different topics in biology-related fields.",
    "Yes. As an undergrad, the course pushed my understanding."
