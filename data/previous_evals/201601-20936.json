If you are someone who requires rigorous grammatical training (lots of drills\/exercises), then you'll be better of in the regular L3\/L4. If you are comfortable enough with the language to focus on conversation, writing opinion pieces and essays and 12-15 sentence skits, then definitely take Hindi 132\/142."
