   "comments": [
    "OK class if you're interested in the material. Not too much work, just a midterm and a 5-7 page paper, along with very easy reading responses. Lectures are a little dry.",
    "I loved this class so much. I was always super into Ancient Egypt when I was younger, so it was wonderful to be able to learn more about their culture. I especially enjoyed the lives aspect. Oftentimes history can seem too broad and overwhelming, but this course made it much more accessible. By breaking it down into pieces and examining certain individuals in different time periods, I felt that I could better understand the history and culture of Egypt through real people who had actually lived during that time. I took so many notes during lectures because I just found everything that was said to be fascinating. Professor Manassa also sculpted the course in such a way that concepts and events were cemented in memory, rather than glossed over. I felt that she would occasionally repeat important things so that we could really understand it before moving on to the next section. Professor Manassa was also great in terms of answering questions and things in class. There is a midterm, weekly reading responses, and a final paper. None of them are too difficult as long as you keep up with the reading. I also felt that the reading was interesting. Wilkinson somehow made the textbook sound more exciting.",
    "This course presents a historical overview of Ancient Egypt, with particular focus on the New Kingdom. Professor Manassa organizes this study around particular \"lives\"--fictional or historical Egyptians through whose records we might learn more about the civilization. I think this organization makes the course more interesting than a cut and dry history course, but there is still a lot of simple fact-telling. This course is the perfect Credit\/D.",
    "Very interesting perspective on history through the analysis of individual lives. I would definitely recommend!",
    "This class is great! If you have any interest in Egyptian history (and who doesn't?), then definitely take this class. It provides a fantastic overview of Egypt's very long and complex history, told through the stories of prominent Egyptian individuals. Professor Manassa is an excellent lecturer. She is always clear and energetic, and her passion for Egyptology comes through in every lecture. The readings, especially the primary sources, are certainly rewarding. They provide the basis for all topics covered in the class, so definitely be prepared to do them! There are \"weekly\" reading responses, but we only ended up doing about 5 throughout the semester. If you take this class, you'll learn a ton about daily life and culture in ancient Egypt.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because it has very interesting material and fair evaluations. The teacher is approachable and the class isn't overly stressful.",
    "Yes! If you want to know an overview of Egyptian dynasties and the ordinary lives in ancient Egypt, this is the class you are looking for. The professor is great and I enjoyed her lectures a lot. She is also very nice and helpful.",
    "A wonderful look at the lives of ancient Egyptians, slightly essay heavy for a history course but entirely manageable I fully recommend.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. The material is incredibly interesting! The \"weekly\" reading responses ended up being bi-weekly and were usually in response to an assigned prompt. The mid-term was fair, as was the final paper about a subject of our choice.",
    "Kind of dry at some points, but also interesting. Wouldn't recommend if you can find another interesting history class. Egyptomania taught by the same professor in a different semester was better.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, it is easy and fun even if you're not a humanities person. Don't buy the textbooks, they're completely unnecessary. Do take notes during lecture though, because the slides are mostly pictures of desert that make no sense when you try to study. Manassa is a very entertaining lecturer."
