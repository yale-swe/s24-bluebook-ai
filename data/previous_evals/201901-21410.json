    "In this course I learnt a ton of new information and developed some very useful skills. The course content covers everything from the origins of the universe, to future predictions, string theory, quark soup you name it. Its basically all the super cool physics topics in nice bitesized chunks for you to enjoy in one amazing course.",
    "I believe I learnt a great deal about the scientific method of study, and it was a rather informative class, which I believe has shaped my philosophical outlook on the world too.",
    "A broad understanding of current problems in physics",
    "I learned the basics of quantum physics (without really any math) , and how quantum physics relate to cosmology, theories of gravity and the other fundamental forces, and how quantum physics are used in modern technology. It's a tremendously interesting class that really covers a lot in modern science.",
    "Universe origin, quantum mechanics... Enough to understand scientific news involving the universe and quantum physics.",
    "I learned basic concepts surrounding modern principles of physics, specifically astrophysics and quantum mechanics."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Content is enlightening to say the least and presented in a very approachable manner that is virtually impossible to find online Weaknesses: Can't really think of any.",
    "The seminar structure of the course was a strength, since it allowed us to direct the way in which we learnt the material, which was essential in a class like Quantum Physics.",
    "Class time felt unstructured and unproductive. Maybe more lectures or formal instruction.",
    "The strengths of the class are in the readings and in professor Harris. The only weakness is how the class, despite being designed for discussion, often felt like a lecture. I think more activities like the quantum debate, where we have an opportunity to engage directly with our classmates about the interpretation and philosophical implications of the material, would go a long way to making the class feel more discussion-based.",
    "Too many readings but at the same time a bit superficial. Interesting, makes you curious about quantum physics, is a very good start.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Harris assigns many good and insightful readings. He also does a good job facilitating discussion to help students understand the difficult material. Weaknesses: Some areas are not explained enough since there is so much complex material to fit into one semester. There is also a lot of readings to keep up with."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Interesting concepts presented without difficult math for Humanities students.",
    "Yes, to any student not considering majoring in physics but even has a slight interest in either physics or cosmology.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to learn physics conceptually without the deep mathematical insight.",
    "Yes",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to other students! It was well structured, and I believe I learned a lot. Moreover, the course material was rather interesting, and I was always excited to do the readings for the week.",
    "If you need a science",
    "Yes, especially if they aren't the most sciency person. The class is designed to give you a working understanding of the material without requiring a strong science background, and I think that's great for people like me who are interested in physics but not the best at the more rigorous side of it.",
    "If you wanna learn about modern physics topics at a level enough to understand and talk about recent news and articles, this is really interesting!",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is remotely interested or considering a major in physics. Otherwise, the student would not engage enough with the material to take meaning away from this course."
