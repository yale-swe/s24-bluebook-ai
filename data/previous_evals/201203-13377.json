    "Well, if you're an English major, you'll definitely want to take 125. Professor Cornelius is great, and has an especially thorough knowledge of Chaucer and Spenser. Plus, the class will give you a lot of experience writing literary analysis papers -- and the materials you read will give you a really thorough grounding in English literature. Take it!"
