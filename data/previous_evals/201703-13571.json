Need a method to account for this. The final project should have been more of a challenge from a sustainability or corporate responsibility perspective. The winery chosen already was a leader on sustainability, which meant most recommendations related to PR and marketing...",
    "Strengths are the professor and his insights. Weakness is the overview nature of all lectures and readings. Not many in depth discussions on any particular topic.",
