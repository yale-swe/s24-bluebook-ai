    "Interesting class with a great professor. Take the class!",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "yes",
    "If you're interested in Russian history (and Russian foreign policy), take this course. You will learn a lot about the Russian empire. Bushkovitch it totally old school- he gets up and just talks for an hour, straight, on a certain topic or event. Unlike many Yale courses, this class isn't centered around a concept or a perspective, at least so far as I could tell. Things happened in Russian history. He will tell you what they were. The synthesis is more or less up to you.Because the class is so dense, Bushkovitch is sympathetic to the students who clearly won't grow up to be Russian historians. But he never dumbs it down. You get what you pay for here. Take it to have the experience of a college lecture the way they were in the 50s. You'll eventually find yourself able to answer most questions about Russian history without even realizing it.",
    "This is a really great class on a period\/area not often covered by other history courses. It's a small course so it feels like a class rather than a lectures. The professor's basically an encyclopedia with a great sense of humor\/snark. There are a lot of readings but the overall work load is very low and the assignments are graded pretty leniently. Take it!",
    "This class was a survey of the history of the Russian Empire through the lens of its foreign policy. For anyone interested in any area of the former Russian Empire, it provides great context for today's politics and foreign relations. The readings were really important for filling in the blanks that lecture couldn't cover, as the time frame was so large and so much happened in different areas of the Empire.",
    "Not a bad class. Fairly interesting.",
    "Great class on examining the true problems surrouding Russia, Bushkovitch is a all-class professor. Unfortunately he is so much of a better lecturer than the reading that it makes the reading somewhat unsatisfying.",
    "If you've any interest in Russian history, most definitely take this course. Not much work: there's a fair bit of reading, but all you turn in are two very brief response papers throughout the semester, and then at the very end a final book review (on a book of your choice) and a rather broad-strokes exam. Do realize, though, that it's not a general Russian history course; it's very much about the Empire specifically, and the peculiar situations at the Western, Southern, and Eastern borders.",
    "If you're interested in the subject matter--as I was--yes! If not, it may be difficult to get through.",
    "The course is comprehensive history of Russian foreign policy from 1552 to 1917. I would recommend it to any student interested in the subject matter. However, it is important to note that this is not a Russian history course. I think it would help to have some knowledge of Russian history prior to taking this course."
