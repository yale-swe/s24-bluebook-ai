   "comments": [
    "The biggest weakness of this class was that the first part of the class was live streamed and tests were take home. While this is likely much easier for the teachers and TAs, it is detrimental to student learning. Students don't come to class, many don't watch the videos, and since the tests were take home, they could look up answers online and were not incentivized to learn. While I would normally say that it is the student choice not to learn and doesn't have an effect on those around them, this is not the case as the class splits part way through the semester. Once students were forced to attend class, the gaping holes in their knowledge became apparent and forced the class to slow down tremendously. For example, many people in 101 initially thought that you were proving the alternative hypothesis, not rejecting the null. This lack of learning in the first semester made the last 5 weeks painfully slow and tedious. I think that Ethan Meyers is a great teacher and he took a little bit of a risk in how he was teaching the class. But due to the lack of knowledge of students, the lack of TAs in the class to answer small questions so that the whole class wouldn't be disrupted, the class didn't run as smoothly as it could have. What would be best is if there were sections from the beginning with smaller class sizes, but since that would interfere with faculty productivity, Yale will never spring for that.",
    "A strength of the course is it does teach a lot about statistics, and if you have no prior experience, one can learn a lot of important basics. A weakness is that it does go very fast, so if you do not understand a fundamental concept, you will not be able to do well or understand later on without difficulty. I think an improvement would be to emphasize the fundamentals and make clear what they are before moving on to more complicated concepts. For example, I did not truly understand the essence of confidence intervals until very late in the class.",
    "I found it very easy at the beginning of the class to follow along, but I started to get a bit confused as the semester progressed. I found some lectures engaging, while others seemed very informative. I found the midterm exams very doable & the homework challenging (but not impossible).",
    "Gave this course a low ranking for the Life Sciences section I took for the second half of the semester. Was really excited about it initially but the professor didn't explain things clearly and it was really detrimental to the overall quality of the course. Professor Meyers was really nice and had fun bad jokes but he would spend too much time going over the stats concept at the beginning of class and do it in a way that was confusing and convoluted. Then he'd try to squeeze the code into the last 15-20 minutes of class and wouldn't explain what the different lines of code did until explicitly asked. We went to the review session on Wednesday before our Saturday final SO confused about what we could possibly be tested on and it seemed like the test hadn't even been made yet. Then the test itself had a bunch of multiple choice questions that were \"select all that apply\" but so many of the choices were things that you couldn't judge right\/wrong because we just hadn't talked about the stats tests in that degree of specificity. Just frustrating because I had high hopes for this section and learning R because I'd never coded before and had heard it was useful in science\/research.",
    "Strengths: as engaging a stats class as is possible. Well organized and the assignments and assessments really did help me learn the concepts. Weaknesses: nothing major.",
    "Strengths: the second half of the semester when learning R Weaknesses: JDRS problem sets",
    "I enjoyed that the lectures and slides were online, but the pace was quite fast.",
    "For the portion of this course that was taught by Professor Reuning-Scherer (JDRS), the biggest strength was the homework assignments; they reflected class content well and challenged me to think about the material covered in lecture more deeply. Also, JDRS taught with a lot of energy, inflection and excitement, so as a result it was easy to pay attention in class. With that being said, however, I think there are many things that could be improved with the first half of the class taught by JDRS. Lectures were a bit too fast paced for one thing, which made it difficult to keep up; I often had a hard time understanding what was going on and copying down notes at the same time. However, luckily these lectures were video-captured and posted online so I often watched the lectures instead of going to class and slowed down or stopped the video when necessary (which was a lot) to understand what was going on. Also, the fact that the two midterms for this class were given as take-home tests online was really not great, because as a result, I didn't study as in-depth as I normally would for an in-class exam, and I felt like I didn't fully comprehend the material of the first 8 weeks of the class because I didn't have to actively study for in-class exams. Also, JDRS posts all the lecture slides online as one giant PPT document instead of splitting them up, which was not great because it was so hard to find specific topics in the notes. As for the portion of the course taught by Professor Meyers for the life sciences section, I often didn't even feel as though I needed to come to lecture at all (although I still did), because all of the information that Prof Meyers gave us in class could be found on the lecture slides or in the R code that he posted on Canvas, so as a result it was easy to get distracted or do other assignments in class because you didn't actually need to go to lecture to get all the info you needed for the class. This class almost felt too easy at times, because Prof Meyers would go over the same basic steps and concepts for hypothesis tests in almost every single class, and I felt like we went over the same general concepts way too often. Also, sometimes too much time was spent on answering questions in class. Furthermore, we spent a good portion of each class learning how to do each hypothesis test in R, but Prof Meyers easily could have cut down on that time since he posted the instructions on how to do the R code for each class on Canvas. Also, every single one of the hw assignments was in R, and none of them tested our understanding of course material, but rather our ability to simply repeat what we learned in class in R on our own. Thus, as I was doing the hw assignments throughout the semester I felt like I wasn't really getting anything out of them, but later on when I was studying for the final exam I did realize that they were helpful in understanding course concepts. I think less of the hw should be in R and more of it should be strictly concept-based for future courses, especially since the entire final exam was conceptual. The rest of the class did not really prepare us for the final because the course itself touched on conceptual things briefly but mainly went into detail going over how to carry out each test and how to code in R. Also, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be this way or not, but we only learned hypothesis tests in the life sciences section and not much else.",
    "Nothing was ever read solely off the slides and many examples were given to ensure the students understood the material. However, due to its fast pace some students struggled to achieve even a basic understanding of the material.",
    "The lectures arent super engaging and I think it would be more useful to apply some concepts during the lecture in order for students to develop a deeper understanding",
    "I would have liked some more resources to help me when I was confused, but I guess this is a big lecture so it's hard to accommodate all needs. I definitely liked that the first half had recorded lectures, so it was easy to go back and recall parts of the lecture that I didn't remember.",
    "The level of the final exam was more difficult than what we were prepared f or. There also seemed to be a lot of discrepancy between the level of difficulty between t he different sections.",
    "I really liked the second half of the course that was specific to the life sciences, but I found the umbrella portion to be a little disengaging because of how quickly the lecture moved.",
    "Strengths: first half was recorded - would've been great if it were all recorded tbh, energetic teaching weaknesses: lack of clarity about grades and final",
    "I think that this course could go a little slower in the beginning. I think a lot of people in that class seem to have taken AP statistics besides the fact that it is an intro class. The intro course felt like it was geared towards people who had a familiarity with statistics and I found the course difficult and quick, so I did not understand many basic concepts. I also think that statistics is of a unique nature within the sciences, and that that should be emphasized an explained sufficiently before delving into unfamiliar territory.",
    "Honestly, Professor Reuning-Scherer was immensely funny and a delight to have. My knowledge of statistics was often times tied to my engagement of the course, and he kept me more engaged than most math teachers before him. While some may disagree with his humor, I thought that his mannerisms were a strong benefit to this course and really appreciated his level of commitment to using anecdotes to keep students entertained and educated. One weakness was the structure, in that different professors for the second half hold their students to different standards-- for example, in my year very few finals (with the exception of I believe two professors') were mandatory. In addition, Ethan Meyers took a while to find his footing, as he had never taught the course before, and the homework was a little call-and-response, but I believe that he ultimately succeeded. Also, the companion textbook chapters could be reworked, as the syllabus often stated chapters that were not covered or were covered weeks later.",
    "Lecture moved really really fast lots of work in first half of class with JDRS good basic stats class to give grounding in stats",
    "The strengths of this course are that all of the lectures for the first part of the class are recorded and Jonathan is a great instructor. He made sure to make every class interesting and engaging. The weakness was that the second part of the course was much less organized than the first. I understand that a different that this is due to having a different instructor, but it would have been nicer if the structure had been kept the same. I like that the sections get more specific later in the semester. In order to make this course better, the second professors should try to have the same teaching style as JDRS.",
    "Strengths: gets the info across, necessary for a lot of majors weaknesses: is there like no communication between stats 100 and stats 101 because no one seemed to know what we had already covered?"

   "comments": [
    "I can't say that I would really recommend this course to someone who is really looking to learn about applied statistics. I thought that this class would actually teach people how to use stats. While it did teach some, I think that it really fails to educate the vast majority of students in how to properly use statistics in their academic career.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are in any field that utilizes data.",
    "Statistics is so important in most fields so I would say if you haven't taken any stats class, & you are going into science\/math\/engineering, then I would recommend. I thought I was going to get a lot more out of this class than I did, but I am still glad that I took it!",
    "I think Life Sciences has potential but definitely needs to be improved.",
    "Yes. If you need statistics (or just want to know it for your own benefit) this is a pretty solid intro course. The first half with Johnathan Ruening Sherer (JDRS) is pretty engaging, well organized, and informative. JDRS is a bit goofy but really does work hard to keep the class from being too dry and honestly is quite a clear and interesting lecturer. The homework and exams are not super extensive, but really reinforce the concepts from class and are graded fairly. The second half with Ethan Meyers was pretty good overall as well. We learned basic R, reinforced the concepts from the first half, and went on to permutation tests and one way ANOVA. The second half was about the same workload as the first, with weekly assignments that took maybe 2-3 hours and a final exam that was pretty reasonable. Prof. Meyers is pretty committed to student learning, but can be a little bit confusing at times. Overall, both halves of the course were a really good introduction to stats. I would recommend the life sciences second half to anyone bio or premed, over the medicine second half since you don't learn a ton more in that one. The workload for both is reasonable and the material is overall pretty interesting.",
    "Yeah. The second half of the semester is way more valuable than the first.",
    "I would not recommend the course to another student, only because I struggled with it even after getting a tutor (which was a difficult process on its own). Some of my peers share my sentiment, but others had a much easier time. I believe it depended on the amount of background knownledge one had on statistics before taking the course.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if you have to take it for your major (that's why I took it). Otherwise, I would not take this class if you have background in stats already, because the course is introductory and rather disorganized at that, so you will feel like you are learning topics that you already learned in the past, but in a way that is likely harder to understand than how you previously learned it (I took AP stat in high school, but since I am not the best at \"quantitative reasoning\" classes of any kind, I thought it would be best to stick to the intro class). That being said, if you have zero background in stats, this class will be quite an experience because it is a bit disorganized and very fast-paced, so it is hard to keep up and fully understand all the (many) new concepts that you learn as you go.",
    "I would because it is necessary to achieve a basic understanding of statistics and the instructor made sure to keep students engaged.",
    "Jonathan is pretty good, however, my flavor, Life Sciences, was very poorly organized and I don't really think I learned anything.",
    "Yes. The topics are introductory but fundamental to any evidence-based field of study.",
    "Yes, learning R was pretty useful for me and I had a bit of fun with it too.",
    "It teaches you statistics; take if that's something you need.",
    "I would recommend this course, and highly recommend Professor Reuning-Scherer. Unfortunately, I can offer no opinion on STAT101, as I believe Ethan Meyers will not be teaching it next year. Regardless, if the curriculum stays the same, they present a variety of statistical tests and R modeling in an introductory fashion, making this a great course for ecologists. R is a necessary skill for the life sciences, and if you have never coded before (and need a stats class) this course is worth your time.",
    "I think stats is an important class to take but if you don't have to take it or already fulfilled QR, I wouldn't - a lot of work and stress. NOT a math gut",
    "I would recommend this course because JDRS is a great instructor. He makes statistics interesting and made sure it was a class I was happy to go to. He is extremely helpful and more than happy to answer any questions you have. The class is well-organized and there are lots of office hours so you can get the help you need.",
    "Yes, just not for fun. If you need it for your major, it's really not so bad and the teachers and TAs are there to help."
