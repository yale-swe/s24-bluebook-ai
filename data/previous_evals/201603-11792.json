   "comments": [
    "I got a good sense for WGSS's overall priorities and areas of interest. In particular I think I got a lot out of the readings about the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality, as well as the gender theory readings.",
    "I learned so much from the course related to conceptions of sexuality and gender and its development over time in the US. It's so important that WGSS has this course .",
    "This class really challenged me to think in new expansive ways, particularly in how to connect theory to the praxis of daily life regarding sex, gender and sexuality, and also how to better understand how a work can be considered definitive by some but completely irrelevant and even incorrect to others, and how to grapple with that. This class also exposed me to many key theories surrounding sex and gender from many different types of scholars and schools of thought.",
    "Debating skills, critique to queer & feminist texts (by analyzing their intersectionality and applicability to the real world)",
    "This course allowed me to further develop my critical thinking skills and expand my knowledge of feminist and queer theory. I learned a lot from my classmates, too, who brought a lot to the table.",
    "Definitely felt like my ability to engage with theoretical texts improved.",
    "This class taught me a whole host of critically important ways to be critical of the world and understand various (often normalized and not immediately visible) mechanisms o ordering and regulating bodies. It offers ample opportunity for productive conversation, and has fascinating readings.",
    "Great class covering topics including gay and lesbian theory, sex work, feminist and transgender theory, and many other aspects of the sexed body. Fascinating readings and discussions every week."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was a solid foundation for WGSS. There was a pretty wide range of backgrounds coming into it, which at times made it feel easy for people who already had taken other WGSS classes.",
    "The strengths are the wide variety of topics covered and the interaction with various mediums such as art and film as well as theory. If I could change one thing it would be the 8pm the day before deadlines for forum posts and responses because it's too early.",
    "great syllabus, kaneesha's the best, could be WAY more organized",
    "The readings for this class are generally good, although they are occasionally flawed (i.e.: weirdly simplistic gender theory, not intersexual, etc)--Kaneesha did a great job supplementing vague or problematic readings with really intriguing and important transnational thought.",
    "This course is extremely organized and varied, which really benefitted the learning environment. I really appreciated the emphasis on intersectionality in this class, which can be lacking in some WGSS courses (especially Feminist and Queer Theory). The course could have benefitted from a firmer hand guiding the conversation, as often times we got bogged down with random observations and side conversations.",
    "Bodies & Pleasure is sort of a weird cross-section of people -- there are folks ready to dive deeply into Foucault but also people interested in \"what is sexism\" etc. I wonder if part of it is because the main intro WGSS class people take is Les Gay, which is about as different from this course as possible. So sometimes it felt like two classes were happening at once. I also would've liked more rigorous writing assignments -- the reading responses felt like not enough space. The level of difficulty of the readings was really incongruous with the easiness of the assignments. But the readings themselves are excellent, their organization perfect, and the way they interrogated each other was wonderful. The midterm was also great.",
    "Perhaps by the nature of the material, the classroom environment of this course was very stifling. I often sensed varying ranges of hostility between classmates because of differing opinions on readings. This is probably due to the often extremely personal and political nature of the course material, but it was still intimidating and made coming to and speaking in class a nerve-wracking experience. Because this was a discussion-based course, this was especially frustrating; I often felt like I wasn't getting the most out of the material due to my nerves about speaking in front of this particular group of my peers.",
    "The course is conversation driven, which was great for reaffirming one's grasp on the material. It also did a great job of introducing a wide array of topics in a decently detailed manner. I would have liked, however, to have an 'implementation' section, as it was sometimes difficult to visualize how these observed criticisms could be acted on.",
    "Readings each week were really engaging and interesting."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is a good course for anyone interested in getting a solid overview of what WGSS is about it's basically an intro course in seminar form. I liked it a lot although that will depend somewhat on the instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend. Even if you aren't a wgss major and are interested in really expanding your mind and your ideas of what sexuality and gender are among other topics take it! But engage and really try to think outside the confines of what we've been taught otherwise you won't learn anything.",
    "This course really altered how I considered the position of sex, gender and sexuality in our modern world. Both the coursework and the other students in the class pushed me intellectually to consider and think in ways that were totally new to me. If you are looking for a fascinating and thrilling engagement with this material, I would totally recommend taking this course.",
    "Great class! It examines various perspectives on the body and its relationship with sex & gender through very different materials: sometimes it was only papers, but once in a while you'd also have documentaries and art pieces to examine as well. Workload is pretty manageable.",
    "sure, if they're interested in reading theory, & in thinking critically about the intersectionalities and specificities of wgss related stuff",
    "This class is a good introduction to WGSS--it is a primer, and I'd be wary of taking it if you aren't definitely going to major in WGSS. Having said that, it is a fairly comprehensive primer, and because it meets once a week is fairly easy to fit into your schedule.",
    "A class great even for non-majors. You're forced to critically engage with a wide variety of theories and analyses. Hope Kaneesha teaches it again!",
    "Take this course! Especially if you havent taken many WGSS classes before, this will provide a nurturing but rigorous environment from which to explore complex gender theories and personal experiences alike.",
    "Bodies & Pleasure is mandatory for any WGSS major. 85: a great introduction to theoretical texts. Be prepared though -- it is very much a theoretical course, and geared towards Butler and Foucault much more than understanding sexism or other archetypes of what a \"feminist\" class would be like. Very rigorous material, not so much rigorous assignments.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone serious about gender\/queer theory. If not, the intellectual work of the course will begin to get frustrating extremely quickly. This is not a class for someone who needs a distributional requirement and is mildly curious about the WGSS department. However, for anyone really interested in these topics this is an incredible class, and I highly recommend it.",
    "I honestly think this course should be a distributional requirement. It tackles issues of race, class, sexuality, cisnormativity, and much more, which are all things we encounter in every day life (and if we don't, are all things we should know to combat).",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! It was a great, very interesting course."
