   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a lot of work, but it really changes the way you see the world, as pieces of color instead of icons and token.",
    "Good introduction to painting, not quite as intro as I thought it would be. I was a total beginner (I think the last time I painted might have been with my fingers when I was 4) and other kids definitely were not, but I learned a lot and it was a good class to try out. Very different from most classes but also more work than I was expecting it to be.",
    "A good class. You will learn a lot about the process of painting while being able to cultivate your own style. Professor Rush is simultaneously encouraging and critically helpful for your work. He does a good job of letting each student do her\/his own thing while still providing direction. A lot of work - be prepared to spend several hours on homework each week. But it is totally worth it.",
    "Art 130 is Painting Bootcamp. Some students have a lot of experience and a really good, others have never painted or drawn before in their lives. They are united by the fact that they are not art majors. There is minimal direction and structure. You are basically thrown materials and asked to just paint from day one. You will paint more than you ever thought you would. You will paint faster than you though humanly possible. By the end, you will realize you have improved immensely, and wonder how the heck that happened. If you like structure, don't take this class. I you just want to get your hands painty, have a good time, learn about art, and do something other than read books and write papers in school, take it! George is a nice guy, the atmosphere is very chill.",
    "yes! take art before leaving yale! george rush is a great prof for a high expectations but low stress class that will really give you a lot of actual painting time and introduce you to some pretty awesome painters of history and modern times. enjoy!",
    "I was let down by this class. I felt more hindered than helped by Prof. Rush. Any advice, when it did come, was in the form of insipid platitudes straight out of a Middle School art classroom \"paint what you see, not what you know\", etc. Rush was rude, dismissive, fragrantly played favorites, and had little concern for the cost of art supplies on students. The disappointingly lame final project requiring us to make a rote copy of a famous portrait, rather than exercise any personal creativity or style, was the last straw.The only real value of this course was that it forced me to make 2 paintings a week, and, solely because of this frequent practice, I saw an improvement. If you have the personal willpower to do this practice on your own - skip this tedious class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Painting Basics, though probably not to a serious art major. It was a great introduction to painting for someone who knows very little about painting and drawing, but i suspect someone with more experience might be super frustrated by how basic the class is. We didn't go very much into any technique, but i still found the class very enjoyable.",
    "Look, basically if you put any effort in, you'll do well. and if you decide to have fun with it, the class is a TOTAL blast. doing homework for it is like taking a fun break from your regular homework.",
    "I recommend it. It takes you out of your comfort zone. You may not realize it until you are done but it's very rewarding. You walk away with a new perspective on color, light, shadow, shape--which is a neat way to look at the world. I'm not going to lie, it can get very frustrating though, and it's a surprising time commitment. The time flies though if you appreciate it.",
    "Take this class if you want to improve your painting skills and have a good time doing it. It is a lot of work though, so don't think it'll be easy.",
    "Though time intensive and sometimes energy-draining, Painting Basics is the perfect course for pretty much anyone remotely interested in doing something creative to break the monotony of reading, writing papers, and taking exams. After taking the course, I notice things about the everyday world that I would not have noticed before; I basically learned a different way to see. It's also nice to know that now I can approach painting on my own without feeling intimidated. We painted SO much throughout the course of the semester (we made something like 30 paintings), so I am on longer afraid to try putting brush to canvas. I can paint quickly and relatively confidently, which for me means I've come quite a long way since the beginning of the course."
