    "This course is AMAZING. The breadth and depth of the material were trumped only by Shimi's kindness. He is an excellent teacher. The structure of the course was thoughtful and thorough. Office hours were a great asset (Shimi helped tremendously with problem sets).We began with an introduction to organic chemistry and the classes of important organic pollutants, followed by a unit on chemical transfers, a unit on chemical transformations, a review of remediation techniques& applications, and several important histories (legislation\/treaties regarding pollutants; Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill; Exxon Valdez Oil Spill; PCBs in the Hudson River). The knowledge& skills gained in this class are not only important& relevant, but also applicable. Good stuff."
