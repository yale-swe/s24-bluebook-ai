    "understanding of economics",
    "I came in with absolutely no understanding of economics and left with a solid understanding of both consumer and producer theory. The things I learned in class I have already found to be applicable to my every day life.",
    "The basics of microeconomics and real world applications of the subject.",
    "A lot about economics and life.",
    "I gained invaluable information not only on the foundation of microeconomics but on life values and lessons by learning how to make rational decisions.",
    "My quantitative reasoning skills and math skills definitely improved because of this class.",
    "I learned the basics behind microeconomics which was fascinating because as a humanities-oriented person, it offered a new perspective of thinking about the world.",
    "I learned so many fundamental economic skills! After taking this class you will start to recognize economic concepts all around you!",
    "I honestly learned very little except economics is borderline racist and treats the human race as a rational body which is inherently false -- mathematical equations cannot predict the future.",

   "comments": [
    "Not enough tutoring resources",
    "Focused on a smaller group of students. But needed more explanation of terms and situational problems",
    "more problem sets",
    "This seminar is great because it can go at the pace of its students. I really appreciated not having slides in a lecture, but rather being able to ask questions and have concepts reexplained over and over on the chalkboard until we solidly grasped it.",
    "Not much can be improved. Sometimes the class was too long.",
    "Strengths - very engaging, great feedback on problem sets, very available and effective office hours, makes the topics interesting weaknesses - Lecture notes were provided for the last couple of chapters. I don't think its necessary given the videos available online but if there are going to be lecture review notes they should be for all of the chapters and not just a few. Or at least the most difficult chapters.",
    "Prof. Koker went above and beyond on making sure all of his students had the most support and he was very engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed this class.",
    "The seminar style of this class is great for students who are taking an econ class for the first time. Professor Koker also spends a lot of time going over problems and drawing out graphs by hand on the board, which is incredibly helpful.",
    "Tolga's seminar was great because he gave us all the materials and help needed for us to really succeed. His explanations of the concepts were extremely comprehensible and he held multiple office hours, review sessions, and spent extra time on anything we wanted to go over just so we could excel. There are no weaknesses!",
    "This course is absolutely perfect as it is. It is very clear that Tolga has mastered his approach to teaching through many years!",
    "The strengths of this class are few except that I find math in general to be fun. The weaknesses are many, mainly that this course woos unsuspecting people particularly first years to believe that economics defines life when it in fact is literally fake because you cannot define the human experience with a set of mathematical equations. I did however appreciate how our professor was so available to support us when we were confused.",

    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes for those who have never taken econ, it is a good intro course",
    "yes",
    "Absolutely. I enjoyed this seminar with Tolga so much and will rave about it to anyone who will listen. I learned so much econ, and Tolga is one of the best Yale professors Ive ever had. He makes sitting through an hour and fifteen minute class so enjoyable.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Tolga is great.",
    "Yes, even if they were not an econ major, this class is invaluable in being able to make rational economic decisions and this class is a great way to tie back to the social sciences.",
    "Yes absolutely! You have to take intro to econ with Tolga!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course even if you think you are not great at math\/econ because you do learn quite a lot and Tolga and the Tfs are there to help along the way!",
    "I think that absolutely every Yale student should have the chance to take an economics class. If at all possible, make sure that you can take it with Tolga - he is hands down one of the best professors I have ever met!",
    "No because the course did not allow any doubt to seep into its teachings of economic theory and treated most things as absolute when they aren't.",
    "Yes, econ always relevant, it was a wavy introduction into it"
