    "A look at party politics throughout American history. Parties are a key component of American political system so this class is a must-take for poly sci majors, or if you're just interested in the subject. Readings, midterm, 5 to 7 page paper and final. I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "AA+ poli sci class. Henderson is engaging, energetic, and loves teaching, and he's only a junior professor in his first year at Yale. Material straddled the edges of \"knew that already\" to \"wait, what?\" and could use a bit of refining especially in terms of difficulty, but overall still rewarding topics if you're interested in the how and why behind political parties and their role in our political system. Readings were okay and not all required to do well, but they're interesting if you want to put in the time. It ain't Mayhew-level stuff, but it's manageable, interesting, and enticingly relevant for any poli sci major. Midterm, paper, final, section discussion, so no surprises at all.",
    "Easy material, study guides for exam are nice. No surprises.",
    "This class is a very interesting introduction to political parties in America. Professor Henderson was very organized and encouraged us to ask questions. He was also very approachable, and it is worthwhile to see him during his office hours and section. Assessments are fair, and I always learned something new in class."
