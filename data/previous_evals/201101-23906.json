   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take it! German at Yale is so much fun, so well taught, and totally worthwhile. I was happy to go to class every day, and continued to learn a lot of grammar, conversational skills, and cultural tidbits!",
    "Typical L2 course. Because the GMAN dpt is smaller it's better taught and more one to one.",
    "This is a rigorous continuation of L1 german. Homework involves memorizing vocab, writing journal entries in German, and studying for tests, and occasionally preparing for presentations of skits.",
    "I would definitely recommend German 120 to another student. It is more difficult than German 110 because there was a lot more grammar. The tests became a lot harder as well. However, it was definitely worth it. I left feeling like I knew a lot more german.",
    "YES, recommended. A chill 1.5 credit course.",
    "It is a solid course for beginners that is not as intense as it appears to be. Even if you already have a heavy schedule it is worth taking it. The way the classes are conducted makes the course much lighter. It is not very time-consuming but you still learn a lot.",
    "I would strongly recommend it. I've enjoyed it very much. I think that when one is in a smaller language department, like German as opposed to e.g. Spanish, there seems to be a more positive general atmosphere. I know people in Spanish classes that feel like they are being processed through a big machine (for lack of better words); it's just really big, and many students are just taking it because they think its the simplest or most function, not because they really enjoy the language. Whereas German seems like a much friendlier department (you know, that typical German reputation for warmth and friendliness!) and people are taking the classes because they like the language -- and who wouldn't, Deutsch ist so, so sch\u00f6n!"
