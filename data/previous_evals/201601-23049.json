    "Absolutely recommend. Such an important start to your thesis.",
    "Take it! Sucks for you that prof a-j won't be teaching it. But if you're a wgss major you have to take it and if you're considering being a wgss major you should def be one so...",
    "Too focused on senior essay, but a wonderful opportunity to hear from really stellar faculty! Sometimes didn't feel like such a \"real class\" - for better and for worse...",
    "A required class for the WGSS major, so whether I recommend it or not you're in it! But honestly don't worry, it's well run and by the end of the semester you'll have a good road map of where you want your senior research to go.",
    "This class prepares you to go off in the summer and conduct research for your thesis. It is so incredibly helpful. All major should offer this course. WGSS is amazing.",
    "An awesome course that will help you be ahead of the curve for senior year thesis stuff!!",
    "Become a WGSS major so you can take this class!!!! It is so beyond worth it. That is all.",
    "I think WGSS and AfAm are some of the only majors to do this kind of seminar, where the entire class is devoted to developing your own senior thesis. We learned about the disciplines as a whole, about different methodologies, about ways of forming and then approaching a research question. The class itself was basically a series of interviews with professors in WGSS and AfAm, which was SO cool because we got to hear firsthand about everyones amazing work, and then pick their brains about how they do their own research. On top of that, Prof. A-J was the best and well be sad to see her go. I came really far on my thesis idea this semester thanks to the guidance we received in this class, and Im grateful for it!"
