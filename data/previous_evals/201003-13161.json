    "This course is really, really great. I'm so glad I took it! I didn't know much of anything about South Asia before this semester, but I felt like the professors made an effort to make sure the class was good both for people with that background and without it. The readings were interesting, and I think the class discussions really helped with understanding them and their broader applications. Also, there is a lot of freedom when it comes to choosing your final paper topic... you can basically write about anything that interests you. I definitely recommend this course if you want to learn something about the politics (and some history too) of India.",
    "Seeing as this was likely the only India-related course I'll take at Yale, it was a good choice. It helps to have at least a tiny bit of background on Indian history going into the course, since the seminar is arranged around themes--minorities, federalism, corruption, communalism, etc.--rather than chronologically. A lot of the readings were fairly dry--especially if you're not familiar with some of the politicians or incidents they're referring to. That aside, though, I loved this course. Professor Thachil is a really sharp and effective discussion leader, and he's very good at drawing out the interesting threads from each week's readings. Now I feel like I have a (very) basic grasp of the fundamental issues in Indian political science, which is what I'd hoped this course would provide.",
    "Yes, it is a well taught class that gives an excellent overview of the subject. Not too difficult either.",
    "Take it if you have any interest at all in the topic",
    "excellent. engaging. prof thachil and prof jaffrelot are both fantastic.",
    "The course material was very interesting, and the two professors are all very knowledgeable and personable. However, the great divergence between the lecture style courses with Professor Jaffrelot and the engaged discussions with Professor Thachil were more disorienting than complementary, at times.Tariq Thachil really engaging and knowledgeable professor! Definitely a great teacher to approach if you are confused or need more information on anything pertaining to the subject of the course or the regionof South Asia.This course was excellent as a case study for anyone interested in democracy, and its development and struggles.",
    "Yes, this course is good for those who want to learn about India. The discussions are basically a rehashing of the readings, so if you want to participate, you have to have done the readings. There isn't much in the way of analysis, and the class focuses on facts. The only thing to watch out for is the grading. The expectations for the assignments are completely opaque and really small criticisms are enough to significantly lower a grade. I had a 4.0, but I think this class will ruin that. Most frustratingly, I still have no idea why I didn't do well on the assignments. That said, if you're not worried about grades or you are able to establish a good rapport with the professor, then take this course.",
    "For those interested in deepening their understanding of democracy, this course is ideal. South Asia is one of the most interesting and complex places to study the inner-workings of democratic regimes. Although the material can get confusing at times for someone with no background in South Asian political history, Professor Thachil is always willing to explain.",
    "One hour of reading per week, a couple 5 page reading responses, and a final 15 page paper is the assigned work. If you don't do all the readings completely, that's okay. Overall, generally relaxed atmosphere for a course."
