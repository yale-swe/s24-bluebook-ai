    "This was a great course, however all the assignments were given the second half of the class, so it got difficult to manage time. It would have been helpful, for example, if 3-4 weeks prior to the 15 page term paper being due to not have any other assignments.",
    "Great course, great professor with various lecturers.",
    "I enjoyed this course, and I felt like I did learn a lot about exposure assessment. I think the reading could be a lot at times (especially in the beginning of the course because there were so many lengthy book chapters). I also enjoyed when we had time to discuss the readings in class, I think that was a good way to ensure that we really understood what was going on. A lot of the assignments were due in the second half of the course, it might have been worth it to have one or two due in the first few weeks just so the work load was spaced out a bit!",
    "Very instructive class addressing relevant and current issues.Timing of the various assignments could be improved, as almost all assignments are due during the second half of the semester.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! The range of topics discussed was very interesting and well balanced and I felt that the homework assignments, particularly the article critiques did an excellent job of tieing the course topics together. I learned alot and found this to be one of the more interesting and useful courses that I've taken at YSPH so far.",
    "Excellent course. sometimes readings were too long and detailed but in class teaching was excellent and covered all of the readings if we didnt manage to do them",
    "Strengths: hands-on air monitoring activity! The class covered a range of topics from biomonitoring, to water quality, to air pollution. Most of the readings were very interesting.Weaknesses: It would have been nice to draw more direct comparisons between air\/water exposure dynamics and dive further into how air\/water movement\/dynamics affect exposure."

    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Overall Dr. Leaderer was a great instructor, its clear that this is his area of expertise and for the most part he was able to answer all of our questions clearly and succinctly. We also had some great guest lecturers as well, with different areas of expertise who were for the most part pretty good as well.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Great lecturer, responsive to students. Expectation of assignments and assignment due dates could be made clearer.",

    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0very helpful",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer is clearly very knowledgeable, was very well spoken, and was very open to the needs of students. The class was an excellent learning environment, very comfortable to ask questions.The guest lectures were overall excellent. Yet the water lectures could have been much more advanced (I can't imagine there's anyone in the class who doesn't already know how to calculate an odds ratio)."

    "I think this class is useful to anyone interested in environmental health or assessing environmental exposures. I think I learned a lot about thinking critically about study design and exposure assessment and measurement. The workload is pretty standard, with a fair amount of writing including a term paper final project.",

    "Excellent course. Appropriate help from teacher",
    "Excellent, and I'd absolutely recommend it for students interested in exposure."
