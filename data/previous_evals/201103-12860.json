   "comments": [
    "Great class, not too heavy on work. Don't expect to improve speaking\/listening, but you read some cool stuff.",
    "A good overall introduction to modern Chinese texts with an engaging and entertaining teacher. I'd take it as a nice complementary 5th class and definitely if you're going for the East Asian Studies major with your language focus in Mandarin.",
    "Not if you're at an advanced chinese level. My chinese did not improve much over the course of this class.",
    "It is a really good course for students who have a pretty good background of Chinese. It would probably difficult for Chinese beginners, but everyone in this class is fluent in Chinese so this doesn't cause much of a problem.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in getting a taste of contemporary Chinese fiction. There is a lot of vocabulary to memorize, and the readings are challenging, but I feel like I didn't see as much improvement in my Chinese when compared to earlier Chinese classes. However, the readings were much more interesting than in other classes I took, and Su Laoshi provides great historical and personal context for the readings.",
    "It's a good course to take if you're interested in learning more about traditional Chinese culture.",
    "Yes, if you want to maintain your Chinese.",
    "laid back, learn more about chinese culture than the language itself.",
    "YES. The course was fantastic.Strengths:-extremely interesting texts that showed aspects of Chinese culture that students would not have been exposed to otherwise.-great class dynamic (about 10 students)-good class structure (quiz every chapter, essay every other week, etc.)Weaknesses:-some of the vocabulary words seemed to be too literary to be useful for everyday language-sometimes the seminar seemed more like a lecture than a seminar-some of the texts were a little obscureIt's not too much work, and Professor Su is lenient with deadlines so it's not too much stress in the end. He wants you to hand in good quality work rather than crappy 3am work done in 2 hours, which really gives you time to work on your essays.",
    "I would recommend it for maintaining your Chinese. You learn a lesson every week and a half, so the class is fast. You've got to be willing to do the work. I wouldn't recommend you do it credit\/d since you will get pretty high grades if you do the work, and why would you take this class anyway if you weren't willing to do so? The work is what the class is all about (reading the lesson, studying for dictations, learning grammar, etc) so don't think that you can get around it."
