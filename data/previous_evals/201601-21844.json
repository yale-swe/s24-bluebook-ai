   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class, although it covered a lot of information in a short amount of time. All of the information was very up-to-date and pertinent to the overall goal of the class. I feel that I've gained a much greater knowledge of the field of biochemistry after this class. I recommend taking this class if you are interested in the field and are willing to put in some effort to understand the material. It is not easy, but it's worth it.",
    "Absolutely take this class! When I read the reviews for this class at the beginning of semester, I wondered why so many people had said things like \"BEST CLASS I TOOK AT YALE\" or \"HARDEST CLASS I TOOK AT YALE.\" Now I understand. This was indeed a fantastic class, probably one of the best in biology\/biochemistry. And it was also quite challenging, but it was worth it to puzzle through the problems and gain many, many new insights.",
    "Take it if you need to, take it if you are interested in DNA, RNA, and molecular research. But if not, don't ever take it because it's so much work. You can't really credit-D this course because you just won't learn much that way.",
    "Great class to take if you are interested in the foundations of modern-day biochemistry.",
    "Absolutely 10\/10 would recommend. You get to learn about the incredible ways that life regulates itself, and what it really means to be an experimental biologist. The exams are mostly fair and transparent, the TAs are invested and cool, and the professors are way on their game. If you're an MB&B major, get pumped. If you're MCDB\/other and you took MB&B 300, take 301. It would be such a shame to have learned about proteins\/lipids\/carbs and to not be enlightened on the beauty of nucleic acids. That being said, 301 is a lot of work. The slides cover a whole ton of material, and it can feel overwhelming at times. Be prepared to invest a lot to get a lot!",
    "Biochem II is as material intensive as it is made out to be. The most important thing is to review the lecture slides regularly, and to take good notes on the review questions on the slides during class. As long as you keep up with the material and go through the slides consistently, it is not hard to do well -- but beware the lectures are dense. The graders are quite lenient and do not nitpick. Prof Schlieker is great; Prof Neugebauer is fine but sometimes did not seem as well prepared as she could have been (and didn't finish a couple lectures on time).",
    "I would definitely recommend MB&B 301 to anyone who's interested in learning about genetics from a mechanistic point of view and the logic behind some of the most famous experiments in genetics. I really liked how this class emphasized our analytical skills rather than memorization. The material is challenging, but it is so rewarding once you understand it.",
    "Amazing course, you will learn so much. A lot of material to cover every lecture, but it is super interesting.",
    "Best class I've ever taken. Hardest class I've ever taken. This class is about nucleic acid biochemistry and the scientific discoveries leading us to what we currently know about each field. You'll learn a ton about biochemistry, and you'll learn a ton about your own ability to think about biochemistry. Thankfully, Prof Schlieker is a godsend and deserves every teaching award imaginable. Prof Neugebauer is also pretty good, but her lectures were a bit more difficult to follow and her exam threw some curveballs. Good luck!",
    "Tough course, but worth it.",
    "A very rewarding and challenge course.",
    "Take this course even if you are not an MB&B major. This is the first course I have taken at Yale that challenges you to think like a scientist. It is not interested in how much material you can cram into your head only to forget a few days after the exam. This course guides you through the pivotal experiments in the history of biochemistry research, challenging you to think like Nobel-winning biochemists and take your own shot at figuring out scientific problems that these biochemists solved. By the end of this course, you will have also learned a ton of techniques and will be seeing gels in your dreams. The course is very well-organized, and both Schlieker and Neugebauer are great professors. There's a lot of reading but most of it is non-essential. Otherwise, the workload is fairly manageable; the challenge comes in how well you can understand the material. A great course, and highly recommended even if you don't have to take this.",
    "This class is way harder than 300. The class shrunk to like 50 people and I'm pretty sure they're all in the major. It covers a lot of molecular biology concepts and you will come to understand RNA and DNA in extreme detail. It's a good class, but hard.",
    "MB&B 301 will definitely be one of the most challenging courses you take at Yale. There is just so much information to digest, and you really have to spend time to figure out the big picture.",
    "Honestly, I really like this course. If you're at all interested in a fundamental background about nucleic acids, take it. The work load is manageable. There is a lot of material but it's all important material!!! I took this as a non-MB&B major and loved how organized it was and the resources that were available to me. Also definitely ask for a tutor if you think you'll need help - I didn't, and I regret it.",
    "Super hard, super interesting, super worth it if you really care about biochem and are willing to pour your soul into it, because that is the baseline expectation.",
    "Solid course that presents very useful information about nucleic acid chemistry and that also emphasizes a strong understanding of experimental design. Can be challenging, but it definitely provides a rigorous for pursuing biochemistry in the future.",
    "take it if you have to; audit or credit\/d it if you're interested (too hard to take just for fun for a grade). very interesting material and experimentally based testing approach. difficult--you have to know things really well to be able to interpret experiments about them!",
    "This is an extremely difficult course, but the material and skill set you gain is invaluable. I would not recommend this course for someone who is not an MB&B major or did not want to go into the biochemistry field later on because of the difficulty. It would be an incredible course load to take on without it benefiting you in the future. However it does get you to think critically which can be lost in the sciences at times when in a classroom we are just memorizing material rather than in labs when we get to apply it so I like how this course tried to do a little bit of both.",
    "Really good class - I highly recommend it. There is a lot of material, and you have to make sure to stay on top of it. Go to class (you actually lose points if you don't attend lecture), participate, read the textbook (I didn't always, but should have) and put real effort into the problem sets. If you do that, you won't fall behind and the workload will be manageable.",
    "This class will require a lot of studying, but it's worth it to have a great foundation in biochemistry. Both teachers are great lecturers, and problem sets are not stressful for the most part. Tests are fair.",
    "Amazing class! I learned so much from 301! It is definitely not as bad as everyone says it is. The curve is a bit harsh with all of those crazy pre-meds in here, but getting a decent grade is totally do-able. I enjoyed it very much. Top 3 courses I have taken at Yale, and the top science one BY FAR. Much better than 300, and something to look forward to and not dread! :) Study for exams ahead of time though, so you can get all of the material down pat."
