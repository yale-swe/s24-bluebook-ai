   "comments": [
    "A wonderful course taught by a wonderful professor. A lot of the course was spent workshopping everyone's projects, so be prepared to talk about your own thesis work a lot. But in general, a great class with great people!",
    "The senior colloquium for the major provides senior the opportunity to improve their understanding of of e field and, more importantly, support each other through the process of writing final works (that vary in form). Of the many reasons to be an ER&M major, Prof. Camacho is a very important one and getting to work with her is a great opportunity.",
    "This course was great in terms of spending time with other ER&M majors (enjoyed the readings as well). However, I felt like the final objective was unclear. I only realized about a month before the semester ended that I could have been doing background work for my spring thesis the whole time, instead of trying to write a paper which was completely unrelated (albeit very interesting to research). It was not made clear at the beginning of the semester that this was an option.",
    "ER&M 491 is a workshop and theory based class for ER&M seniors. It's helpful to know what other seniors are writing about and interested in, and to bounce ideas off each other and collaborate.",
    "A senior seminar in research methods, and largely in techniques for approaching and writing the senior thesis and, more generally, scholarly work. Must take to complete the ERM major."
