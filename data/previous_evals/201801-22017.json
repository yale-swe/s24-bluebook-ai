   "comments": [
    "I had never taken a statistics course before this, so it was a good intro to the field. It is theory based, so there isn't a lot of math\/coding involved.",
    "I gained basic abilities on analyzing data and applying statistical knowledge.",
    "I took AP Statistics in high school, but when I shopped this class Professor Emerson said it would be more conceptual and less calculator-based, and I liked that idea. But after taking it, I don't think I learned much more than what I learned in AP Stats. I still enjoyed the course, and if Im being honest it was really nice taking an easier class. I learned about the different tools and tests used in statistical analysis.",
    "You learn basic stats. Good walkthrough of the DVB book. Little R, but Prof. Emerson makes that very clear throughout the course and at the beginning.",
    "Course mainly focuses on Z-tests, T-tests (for means and proportions), confidence intervals, and a bit of regression thrown in at the end.",
    "I learned the basics of statistics. Professor Emerson focused on providing us with a conceptual grounding for statistics. He emphasized that we shouldn't just memorize formulas and put everything into provided statistical models. This was a good, very conceptual introduction to a useful field.",
    "I learned about the basic concepts of Statistics (although not much of regression) and how to reason through statistical analysis.",
    "I learned how to ask for help.",
    "I learned the basic concepts of statistics and how to apply them to evaluate data. I feel that I have a firm grasp of the basics of distribution of data to enter a higher level class, as i probably will do.",
    "I learned basic statistics concepts.",
    "I learned the fundamental aspects of statistics including how to calculate confidence intervals and test if data is statistically significant.",
    "Conceptual understanding of major concepts in statistics (e.g. P-values)",
    "I'd never taken a statistics class before, so I suppose the knowledge I developed by taking this course is essentially a comprehensive introduction to what the study of statistics entails. It helped me understand statistical tests and results that came up in readings for other classes.",
    "not many",
    "I learned the basic skills needed for statistics and a way to deeply analyze everyday events.",
    "Fundamentals for statistics (p-values, Normal model, T-Model, etc)",
    "I developed increased undestanding if staustics, how to analyze data, and why this is relevant for the world.",
    "I thought this was a great introduction to statistics.",
    "Good foundation in statistics, but very little programming or real world application. I feel like I have conceptual skills but few practical ones.",
    "This class taught many of the basics and concepts of statistics, while also delving into the specifics of the math. It encourages you to quick quantitatively throughout, which was difficult but rewarding for me as someone majoring in a humanities department.",
    "I got a good review of basic statistics: sampling distributions, probability calculations, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and a little bit of linear regression. It made me more familiar with the way data are collected and inference is conducted.",
    "I understand how to better decide which type of test to use for each situation.",
    "I learned to think more seriously about statistics I see in the world every day",
    "I learned basic statistics, revolving around the Normal model, confidence intervals (1\/2 proportions, 1\/2 sample for means), hypothesis testing, and linear regression. This helped me learn more about how statistics connects to real world problems.",
    "I gaines a basic understanding of statistical analysis.",
    "I learned the basics of statistics and how to combine multiple concepts to analyze data",
    "Basic stats",
    "This was my first stats class, and it definitely got me interested in the topic.",
    "I learned how to use the normal model, sampling distribution models, linear regression analysis, and other statistical techniques. I realized that statistics is not so much the kind of math that I have done before, but more of a way of making conjectures about the world. I realized that when you hear a statistic in the news or elsewhere, you need to have a healthy level of skepticism because a lot can go wrong on the way there!",
    "I learned a lot about how to analyze data and how to interpret statistical values.",
    "I learned a great deal about confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, the assumptions needed to use each test, and a bit about linear regression.",
    "Basic statistical methods of analysis and inference. Z-Tests, T-tests, confidence intervals, what significance really means.",
    "Intro stats taught me how to analyze data and what to infer from given data and graphs.",
    "this class was a great intro stats class! i have never had stats before and the pace and scope of this class were ideal",
    "Comprehensive introduction to basic concepts of statistics and data science, including probability, regression, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. Developed strong quantitative reasoning skills and introduction to data collection methodology.",
    "Gained a good intro to statistical analysis.",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of statistics.",
    "Basic statistics, and how it can be applied in the real world.",
    "I have gained a true intuition in statistics. I understand all the applications statistics has and how statistics need to be used carefully (and should not be automatically taken as an accurate representation for a phenomenon)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A little more concrete connection between textbook topics and problem done in class",
    "The course is great but sometimes there can feel like a small disconnect between the lectures and the psets\/readings.",
    "The lectures were not very engaging and didn't help with the material much. It was hard to stay focused in them, and most students would give into their distractions and scroll through facebook the entire time. Most of the learning was out of the book, which is ok for some students, but I would have liked a little more in-class guidance.",
    "Course overall was taught pretty well. Office hours every night of the week helps a ton.",
    "Strengths: The TAs were helpful and informative during office hours, the textbook was also well chosen and easy to learn from. Reading quizzes and psets were generally well structured and conductive to learning and review. Due to the difficult nature of the midterms, they were graded on a fair curve and with lenient partial credit. Weaknesses: I attended every lecture for this class and got nothing out of any of them. Professor Emerson spent most of class time doing unhelpful (and often nonfunctional) polls and doing the same overly elaborate examples over the entire semester. Since he didn't spend any class time actually teaching the concepts (which I guess is to be expected out of a Yale math class), doing helpful and relevant examples, or actually answering questions (most questions were redirected to \"that's a great question for piazza\", \"that's a good question for TA lab hours\", \"let's do a poll on that\", or \"that's beyond the scope of this class\"), there was truly no reason to go to lecture. Furthermore the examples that he did do in class\/from psets were never the types of questions that showed up in quizzes. Midterms and the final were almost impossible to study for since Professor Emerson would never directly tell us what would be on them and would instead sort of indicate what might be \"fair game\". Many of the things that he said were probably fair game but unlikely to show up would often show up on midterms in ways we'd never seen before, which was a problem since they were only 4 questions long and each one question a large percentage of the overall grade. Thankfully we were allowed a self-made \"cheat sheet\" for each exam, which just turned the exams into guessing games to see whether you happened to write down the formula you needed for any given problem.",
    "A strength of this course is that it does not require any background in math. It will help you understand research in any fields you are interested in without burdening you with mathematical concepts you can't wrap your head around. That being said, it is sometimes frustrating for mathematically inclined students not to be provided with the math behind what is taught.",
    "This course is as good as a large easy intro-level lecture could probably be. A lot of self-teaching, which is probably better for some students than others. The format is the same throughout (psets and occasional assessment) which is nice.",
    "The course is structured to be almost entirely self-taught. You are expected to read chapters off of a book written like it has a target audience is fourth graders in mind, and coming into lecture he spends most of the time talking about nothing and going over maybe one basic example. Going to lecture might help you further your understanding of certain topics, but you certainly wouldn't learn most of what is covered in the course.",
    "It is a very conceptual look at Statistics. Professor Emerson works hard to ensure students are always understanding and connecting things to the bigger picture. My only problem with the course was that there was not much review material for the midterm and final exam.",
    "Strengths: the amount of support available to students (office hours mon-thurs nights), the difficulty level of the p-sets Weaknesses: lectures were not always very engaging",
    "A strength is the availablity of the Professor and office hours. A weakness is how quickly the course moves. At some points the lectures felt disconnected from the chapters we read.",
    "I honestly did not find the lectures as helpful as they could be. The examples were rather unhelpful... This class kind of was caught between being a flipped classroom and not a flipped classroom which made for a weird set of lectures... Even the lectures themselves spent a little too long talking about the 'updates' of course logistics...' I would honestly prefer 2 lectures 75 minutes a week because that might allow for a better covering of course material",
    "I think there could be greater connections made between textbook content and class material. It felt like some of class time was spent on activities that did not further the goal of the course.",
    "The strengths are that Jay really makes sure that the class does not go to quickly and that it is accesible for people with no background in statistics (like me). He does some example problems in class that are helpful and assigns a very reasonable amount of homework. I also feel that overall the tests and grading were pretty fair, even if they were a little challenging at times. The main weakness was that the pacing of the class was a little off so that we had to learn like 4 chapters in the last week and weren't sure what portion of the new content would be on the test.",
    "Extra help was ALWAYS available for this class. Plus it focused on conceptual understanding instead of memorization, which made it infinitely more interesting and worthwhile.",
    "Could move more quickly, spend less time on confidence intervals and more time on other skills entirely Psets were on the whole very instructive The tests were a good measure of our knowledge, though they needed more points. Because the major assessments weren't \"point-dense\" enough, committing small errors (such as missing a sign or making a math error) could lower the test score by 5%",
    "its boring and dry and borders on confusing strengths - you learn basic statistics",
    "Strengths = the professor. Emerson is very interested in making sure all students understand what they do conceptually.",
    "I appreciated the generous amount of office hours that were provided. I took advantage of them because sometimes reading the textbook was not enough for me to understand.",
    "Strengths: - Engaged and enthusiastic professor -Office hours with TFs and ULAs Weaknesses: - Teaching of regression. The last section in the course was too rushed and not thoroughly explained like the rest of the materials.",
    "The strength of this course was definitely the material and its insights.",
    "All of the office hours and extra help was immensely helpful. The instruction was clear in class. The lecture was always straight forward and clear. The material is interesting.",
    "I hope that in the future the course isn't so textbook heavy. Also, the daily office hours were great, but they should also vary in times they are held.",
    "I think the lectures were a weakness of this course. While Prof. Emerson was an engaging speaker, his lectures often had little to do with the material we were expected to know for the problem sets and often relied on extended examples that required a lot of set up for very little pedagogical value. I often left lecture confused as to what I had just learned, if anything at all. On the other hand, Prof. Emerson and the TFs made themselves hugely available, with somewhere in the range of 20 combined office hours every week. I wish I had taken better advantage of them, but even knowing that they were there made me feel supported.",
    "The strengths of the class were certainly the overall material. Personally, I found it very engaging and I appreciated the cumulative nature of the work. I believe some weaknesses include feedback on Problem Sets. As well, textbook reading assignments were occasionally unclear, especially when it came to regression at the end of the course.",
    "The course is both a good introduction for those with no background in statistics and a good review with some thought-provoking questions for people who do have some background. A primary weakness is that the lecture material is neither correlated with the book readings nor crystallized into any kind of coherent takeaway. Sometimes a complicated example or computing problem was carried out with little relevance to the primary material that we were responsible for.",
    "I believe the problem sets were helpful. However, because the class was lecture style, I didn't feel as engaged as I could have been.",
    "Strengths are that jay is a great teacher and so engaging! Weaknesses is there needs to be more emphasis on the textbook in lectures.",
    "The class was textbook heavy which could be a good thing or a bad thing. I felt that the lecture, while interesting real world problems, did not always relate to what was in the book or on the tests.",
    "There were a lot of TF help hours which were really beneficial, although some of the TFs and ULAs also didn't really know how to solve some of the problems or didn't have a great grasp of the concepts. The homeworks were really helpful for getting us to understand the mechanics of statistical inference, but didn't teach us much of the theory, and the tests were very heavily theory-based, which made the tests much harder. I felt that there could have been better preparation for the exams if we had focused less on just mechanics on the homeworks.",
    "The resources available throughout this course were really great.",
    "The strengths are that the homework is very intuitive. A weakness is that the exam questions seem very different from the homework and in-class practice.",
    "Strengths: you learn a lot, great foundation for data analysis in other disciplines Weaknesses: the testing material was unusual and discouraging",
    "This course could be improved in at least two ways. The first is that I wish we had spent a little bit more time going over how the probability rules translated to the later concepts. The second is that during lectures we didn't review a lot of the material that we had assigned for reading. I wish the lectures were slightly more focused and connected with the readings more. The strength of the course were definitely the fact that it sought to give us an understanding of statistics as a whole, not just specific tests and formulas. The course also had lots of help and opportunities to seek assistance, which was amazing.",
    "One of the strengths is certainly the book and the professor. The book is really good is the professor is a great lecturer. However, I think it could be improved without the midterm right after spring break.",
    "The course was well taught and staffed, but it could be improved with more small group settings for students to learn in and earlier office hours (not 8-10pm).",
    "Strengths: The TAs were great and office hours were very helpful. Though answers were not provided directly, we were expected to think through problems with instructors and they always tried to provide us with useful insights and information. Jay always made lectures fun and engaging. I believe that Jay could have done a better job of teaching us the material during lecture. During the first half of the semester, we would always start learning new material after almost half the class was over. The lecture runs for a short time but to get a better grasp of what is going on, lecture should run for a longer time.",
    "this class was a great intro stats class! i have never had stats before and the pace and scope of this class were ideal I wish we had covered just a bit more, as content felt repetitive some times",
    "Strengths: accessible teaching style and engaging lectures, clear textbook explanations, fair exams, extensive office hours by both professor and TAs. Weaknesses: slightly uneven pacing with a disproportionate amount of new material at the end. However, final exam was fair and dealt well with addition of new materials.",
    "The course does a great job at slowly building up difficulty and actually building on what we've learned over time, rather than throwing us into the fire as some other STEM courses are apt to do. I found the tests to sometimes be a bit surprising considering the types of homework questions we did, but otherwise thought the course was well taught.",
    "The course provided a multitude of help for struggling students. However, I wish we would have covered a few more topics in the course.",
    "I was great in putting statistics in a real world context. It wasn't so great (and this in part cannot be helped) because as an introductory course, there were people of vastly different backgrounds and so the pace at which material was covered was occasionally too fast\/slow.",
    "Strengths: the teaching style of the professor, the fairness of the grading, the pace of the class (not too fast), the TA's dedication"

   "comments": [
    "For sure, especially if unsure about the statistics or their computer science\/coding skills. No coding\/comp sci in this course. Great intro to the field. I plan to take Stats230 in the fall and see how I like a more \"real\" stats class (with coding and such), not one focused about stats theory.",
    "If you are like me and waited until the spring to satisfy a statistics requirement, this is a fine course. If you can, wait until fall semester and take one of the discipline-specific courses.",
    "Yes, this class is very beneficial for almost any person, regardless of what field they enter.",
    "If you are looking for a relatively-easy class that is still enjoyable, this is a good class. Don't take it if you've already had AP Stats.",
    "If you want some intro stats, go ahead and take it. Prof. Emerson makes this very clear in the beginning, but let me reiterate it: YOU NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THE WEEK TO WEEK. I cannot stress this enough. This will sound harsh, but you will likely fail if you try and cram the night before.",
    "I highly recommend you skip this course and take s&ds 220 or 230, or psych 200 instead, even if you have no prior experience with statistics. You'll cover more material, learn it better, and learn more practical applications of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who doesn't want a burdensome workload, but does want an introduction to statistics. The course moves slow and is not challenging for most students. However, it does provide a good foundation of useful skills.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I will admit it's low workload and relatively easy, but there are plenty of other Intro Statistics courses that I would recommend over this one. It's almost entirely structured for self-learning, lectures are useless, the professor is condescending and at times mean, and I don't feel that the course is ideal if you want to learn more about practical applications for Statistics. I'm assuming math buffs aren't going to be interested in this course, but the course doesn't feel very relevant to someone who isn't interested in the formal aspects of statistics and maybe wants to learn more about statistics for research methods, etc.",
    "Yes, it is a basic approach to Statistics that provides students with a foundation to go on and take other S&DS courses if they choose.",
    "Take it if you need a QR! I think for most people, it is easy to do well in this course if you put in the time. You should go to lecture, but lecture mostly reinforces what's in the textbook (and is dependent on you having read it). I would really stress the importance of keeping up with textbook reading.",
    "I would. I think its difficult but its a good introductory course and the concepts are important to know.",
    "Yes! A good and useful basic QR.",
    "It's kind of a basic class that you can easily do well in by just reading the textbook which is a little disappointing. I guess with an intro stats class it is hard to bring things to life but I personally didn't feel I would have benefitted from attending lecture. Overall it's a good overview, but it's not exactly 'easy' when it come to grades. Many students have stats experience and it makes doing well kind of hard...",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning the basic principals of statistics, but I do not know how useful or applicable they would be.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants an intro stats class and who has never taken statistics before. This class is a good introduction to stats and students can go on to major in S&DS even if they start with S&DS 100. If a student knows for sure they want to major in S&DS or has taken AP Stats I might recommend S&DS 220 or 230 for them instead.",
    "An excellent course of youre interested in statistics and want to gain a meaningful, conceptual understanding. If youre a memorization\/plug-and-chug person, this course may be out of your comfort zone (but still totally worth it).",
    "absolutely",
    "if you need to take stats",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend it but only if the student is willing to go to office hours.",
    "Yes! Statistics is useful for many fields, and professor Emerson does an exceptional job teaching the material.",
    "Yes, it is very important for world understanding.",
    "Yes, it was an excellent introduction to stats.",
    "I think this is a great introduction to the major and to statistics. Be prepared to rely on the textbook and to take advantage of office hours.",
    "This course provides a good foundation. I think it moved a little slowly, but that was in large part because it was designed to be accessible to everyone regardless of statistics experience, which is a strength. I didn't love going to it because I rarely found lecture to be valuable, but I would recommend it because I feel like I've come out of the semester with a good conceptual basis for many further problems in statistics. If you're taking this course because you want to actually do statistics in some sort of practical application, this course is not nearly enough.",
    "I would recommend this course as a QR requirement. I feel I definitely got something substantive from it, in terms of skills and concepts. It can be challenging, but it ultimately is rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who have no background in statistics; it seemed to be slightly more engaging\/challenging than other intro stats courses (ie psych 200), only based on comparing experiences with some people in both classes. I would caution people who took AP Stat that they might find 100 a bit boring\/redundant - although there is something to be gained if you commit to attending lecture regularly.",
    "If a student is interested in stats, I would recommend the class. But, I would only recommend it if it is relevant to what they would like to do in the future.",
    "Yes!",
    "A solid fifth credit for someone looking to fulfill QR requirement",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to those who struggle with abstract thinking. The mechanical side of statistics weren't difficult, but the underlying concepts and their logic were kind of hard to grasp.",
    "I recommend this to a student that might want to major is data science. Had I taken this class as a freshman, I may have chosen a different major.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course",
    "Yes, especially if you have never taken stats before.",
    "This is a good course if you have no background in statistics. If you do have any background in statistics, you should probably take a more advanced course. That being said, if you have never taken statistics before, this class gives you a good foundation of the concepts, is not super concerned with the specifics of each formula or test, rather the whole picture, and gives you lots opportunities to get help outside of class. If those are things you are interested in, definitely take the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested into developing a basic understand of the mindset of statistics. I learned the tools of statistics I needed to understand scientific papers in my other classes, and I plan on taking more stats classes.",
    "Yes, great introductory course for stats.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I think that it would be a very useful course to those who require a QR credit or who want to receive a basic understanding of statistics and data analysis.",
    "I would not recommend this course--it is deeply flawed, to the point where my friends and I were consistently confused. It was deeply frustrating to put forth so much studying and feel like the exams did not reflect that knowledge. I studied 15+ hours for the final and for other exams and found them to be difficult. The lectures did not do a good job of covering material and often a lot of people were confused. Even though the class was supposed to be screened to ensure that there was no one in the class that had a leg up on everyone else in terms of knowledge of statistics, there were so many students in the class that were over prepared and would browse the web, code for their harder STEM classes, and make students like myself feel extremely stupid for struggling through the material and feeling like our efforts were not recognized. While Professor Emerson was cognizant of this, and applied a curve on an individual rather than class-based level, I still feel like it wasn't right for an intro class to have so many people that obviously didn't belong there and should have taken STAT 230. It was deeply disheartening and honestly this class turned me off of intro STEM classes forever. We also spent a handful of lectures working in R and then barely had to use R in p-sets or exams, which is a complete waste of time. The course felt like a waste of time.",
    "Yes! This class is so well organized and Prof Emerson is so extremely caring and gives amazing lectures and goes out of his way to make sure that everyone is on the same page!!! I've never taken stats before, and the class was the perfect introduction. It might be too slow\/ boring for someone with exposure take this over the fall stats sequence!",
    "Yes, would strongly recommend this class to students looking for an interesting, challenging, but reasonable QR credit or those interested in gaining a clear and comprehensive introduction to statistics concepts. Class was well-structured, well-taught, and provided ample opportunity for getting help about particularly difficult concepts. Though the class is not explicitly applied (as opposed to the fall iteration), the textbook and class repeatedly reference practical applications of course like property taxes and sports judging.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any non-STEM person looking for a manageable QR credit. Having taken a very overwhelming QR course in the past, I really appreciated the pace at which this class moved and the fact that it is truly designed to accommodate non-STEM students. Very manageable class if you put in even the minimal effort required.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. A knowledge of statistics is valuable no matter what career path one decides to pursue.",
    "Yes, especially for someone looking for an inroad into statistics and data science. Definitely pushes one to consider statistics and its real-world relevance, beyond just rote memorisation of formulae.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to take a challenging but totally doable class that will change the way you think about pretty much everything, take intro stats w\/ Jay Emerson"
