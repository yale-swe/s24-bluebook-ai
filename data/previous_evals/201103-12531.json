   "comments": [
    "This class is a opportunity that I would not trade in. It is a great way for part-time speakers of Hindi to become more comfortable with their knowledge and to really learn the language formally for the first time. This class also encourages strong bonds between students and teachers, and I think it is just a great environment in general.",
    "The class is not tightly structured so you will have to work on your own to get where you want to be by the end. This is definitely my funnest course and I look forward to it every week.",
    "I strongly encourage taking this class for people who are comfortable with basic speaking skills (it really helps to have some conversational ability as it can be a major hurdle for the rest of the semester, it does not automatically develop just by being in the class) and no writing ability, as the majority of the class is focused on building writing and reading skills. By the end, you will develop a good sense of writing and reading, and will be able to read articles, poems, and small books, and writing small-scale essays, and even make your own hindi magazine (final project).",
    "I HIGHLY recommend hindi with Swapnaji.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are able to understand hindi. I came into the course with only a knowledge of Nepali and I was able to pull through although I was probably worst in the class. The teacher is really helpful and if you need more help she will give extra one on one lessons.",
    "Hindi 132 was my favorite class at Yale. Absolutely take it if you are looking for a language credit or are interested in learning how to read and write in Hindi."
