    "Strengths: The knowledge of accounting and valuation I learned from this class is really helpful, since accounting is the basic knowledge in business world, and design of the class is problems oriented, before the class, the students were required to reading the textbooks about the chapter the class would talk about, and also finish the homework in advance, which helped students to find out their difficulties of understanding some specific points, and took the questions to enter into the class. This way strongly consolidate the efficiency of learning. Weakness: Homework was a little bit heavy.",
    "Good course, but very difficult. The class is definitely geared toward students who have a background in accounting, and should probably not be labeled as an intro class. Alternatively, students who have a strong background in accounting should not be allowed to take this class. Class sessions are highly dominated by the students who already know what they are doing, and the class is driven very fast because of that. There are not really any class-provided mechanisms to help the slower students keep up, which would not normally be a problem except this class is supposedly designed for students who have no background in finance: as stated on the syllabus, this class \"helps you acquire basic accounting and finance knowledge\" and \"has been specifically designed to provide the requisite fundamentals of accounting and valuation.\" I took this class having never taken a single finance-related class in my undergrad and was sorely disappointed that I was miles behind other students, with no option for an easier class. I struggled to stay afloat during this class and did not feel comfortable asking the basic questions I had.",
    "The course is useful but presumes knowledge of some business, finance, and accounting principles, which most students in the class lack. It could be improved with some pre-course or extra materials to help students new to the field catch up. The book is horrendous and outdated.",
    "Helped me address weakness in business accounting, very useful",
    "-Strengths: Valuable information, quick feedback from the TAs. -Weaknesses: Ineffective\/too many powerpoint slides, lack of group work during class time (which would help students to check their comprehension), format of homeworks.",
    "Although the material was difficult, I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course because of the content and the way it was presenting. It was a challenging and rewarding experience.",
    "I loved the teaching style of Dr. Garstka and learned a great deal from this course."

    "Instructor: Stanley Garstka \u00a0Professor Stanley is whom I admire most, I really enjoyed his class since his lecture made the difficulties of accounting much more readable, and easy to accept.",
    "Instructor: Stanley Garstka \u00a0While Professor Garstka is clearly an excellent professor (engaging, knowledgable, personable), his teaching style (probably common to other professors in SOM) is somewhat intimidating and I did not feel comfortable asking the questions I had in class. To be fair, I did not really feel comfortable asking the TAs or other students either. However, he was very committed to having every student pass the course, which I really appreciated. I took the midterm twice in order to get a higher grade, and it also helped me understand the material better.",
    "Instructor: Stanley Garstka \u00a0Very knowledgeable, helpful to students",
    "Instructor: Stanley Garstka \u00a0A master in the field and a trove of knowledge. It seemed so easy to him it was sometime hard to grab concrete things\/ideas\/concepts from lectures especially during the latter half of the class.",
    "Instructor: Stanley Garstka \u00a0Strengths: Clearly cares about his students, available by email Recommendations: -Offer scheduled office hours -Check comprehension of key concepts during class time (thumbs up, thumbs down, etc.) -Create learning groups (groups of 3-4 students that are expected to meet once a week outside of class and reinforce concepts) -Reduce the number of powerpoint slides in each presentation",
    "Instructor: Stanley Garstka \u00a0Professor Garstka was a fantastic instructor - wry, witty, and knowledgeable. He presented the course material in a (fairly) accessible way and did a great job of providing contextual information and analyses that clarified the material.",
    "Instructor: Stanley Garstka \u00a0Dr. Garstka was consistently willing to meet with me outside of normal class time to review difficult concepts and offer guidance in the course."

    "In this class you will learn the basic knowledge on accounting and valuation, which is the basic language of business. If you want to step into the business world after graduation, I strongly recommend you participate in Professor Stanley's class, to follow him and finish the homework every time intelligently. I can guarantee that you will have a big harvest from Stanley's class.",
    "It is a good course, although you definitely need some background in finance or accounting in order to succeed.",
    "Make sure you spend a lot of time understanding the homework and youll ace this class",
    "Yes, would recommend. Challenging and need to put in a lot of time, but also learned a lot.",
    "Good course to take",
    "I would recommend this course to those who are willing to put in a lot of work and change their understanding of financing.",
    "I would summarize this course as an fast-paced introduction to accounting and finance for non-SOM students. While participation in this course requires a fair amount of time and effort, you will be rewarded with an increased understanding of fundamental accounting and finance concepts."
