   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about various aspects of the Voynich Manuscript and learned a little bit about linguistics on the way.",
    "A thorough investigation into the Voynich Manuscript, and more generally, how we look at evidence and draw conclusions. Most of your academic career you have taken classes where you are trying to get the correct answer. Here, no one knows the answer.",
    "Broad introduction to historical linguistics, how to analyze material critically and rigorously, how to poke holes, how to deal with ultimate uncertainty.",
    "Definitely learned about how not to do research, and the ways that peoples arguments can fail. I learned about where to draw the line between creative and crazy approaches to a problem.",
    "This class was a great resource for learning about the mysterious voynich manuscript--which happens to be located close by, in the beinecke library. It was a great intro to the manuscript and its historical and linguistic contexts. We also learned about constructed languages, writing gibberish, enciphering text, and we covered the many theories out there that attempt to make sense of the manuscript's unknown script.",
    "ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO KNOW, I LEARNED IN THIS CLASS - how to get along with friends (need this. survival skills) - how to write secret messages (very necessary. in fact, everyone did it. Romans, fake Frenchies, Americans, Navajo codetalkers. EVERYONE. Which is why you need to know how they work) - how hoax theories work - how Austronesian languages work (in case I needi to go to Australia someday) - how to make your own IRON GALL INK (gotta write, amirite?) - how to cast ancient spells on your enemies (ie, astrology) I learned the art of the manuscript. - go to beinecke (check). see the book (check). touch the book? (check). - ... lick the book? (no check) On a serious note, we DEBUNKED some SERIOUS CONSPIRACY and hoax theory in the class. +1 for critical thinking",
    "I learned about a LOT of different things, including linguistics, medieval history, alchemy, medicine, astrology, and a wide range of other subjects and their history. More importantly, I learned that solving problems as complex as the Voynich requires knowledge and collaboration from experts in a wide variety of fields.",
    "crash course in manuscript studies, code-studies, paleography, etc. deep familiarity with this one particular mystery",
    "A lot of interdisciplinary exposure to various fields connected to the manuscript. Interesting insights about problem solving and analyzing flaws and human error in research.",
    "I learned a lot about codes, medieval knowledge, constructed languages, language frequencies and computation, as well as how to format a non-science semi-scientific paper.",
    "I learned whatever could be known about the Voynich manuscript, and a lot about medieval practices (e.g. the making of iron gall ink and medieval manuscripts, alchemy, etc.). I also learned bits of linguistic vocabulary and basics, along with many, many tidbits of information along the way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: just a super cool class. Not a ton of work and a ton of fun, because we just spent time learning and thinking, experimenting. Only weakness I would say is that we spent a lot of time looking at macro questions and not as much time as I would have liked actually spending time with the manuscript. Maybe it would have been to spend a class or two going through each page, highlighting some things people have discovered or questioned, etc.",
    "Strengths: fantastic lecture slides, very broad perspectives, lots of first hand expertise. Weaknesses: smaller assignments seemed rather disparate, by nature of the course.",
    "It was inconclusive, and sometimes I felt like we were wandering, but I think given the nature and subject matter of the class that was a feature as well as a bug.",
    "Very well taught and Prof. Bowern was genuinely excited about the material she taught. Very interesting course material as well. The course may have been too lecture-heavy and not enough seminar-based for its size (25 people).",
    "Strengths: instructor was very engaged. we covered a lot of topics, ranging from herbals to medieval scribal traditions, to languages from Hebrew to Nahuatl. Weaknesses: felt like it was very lecture-centric?? I would've preferred a more \"here's some reading, let's discuss it\" approach. Then again, that's me.",
    "It was extremely engaging and very, very open ended. We had no clue where this adventure was going, and it was fun to go to class each day for a new and wonderful surprise. There really were no weaknesses.",
    "The course doesn't quite know what it is yet. There needed to be more defined readings and a clearer trajectory of the course. It seemed to be occupying a bit of an unhappy medium between a class and a research group since it didn't feel like we really had time to do justice to all of the previous work done on the manuscript but also not enough time to get very far in our independent research. You really only got out of it as much as you put in, and that's not necessarily a weakness but I don't think the course was particularly well designed to spark interest in a student who didn't have it already",
    "The course was very engaging. Class was always fun and it was interactive.",
    "I enjoyed the variety of topics we discussed. Nice balance of linguistics, statistics, history, etc.",
    "Given the nature of the subject matter, it was to be expected that there were no breakthroughs or concrete evidence of things. There maybe could have been more assignments but as it was there was still a good mix of responses and homework.",
    "The strengths were that the class was incredibly thorough and critical - it pointed not only that most Voynich decoding theories are wrong, but how and why they are wrong. The weaknesses were that some basic linguistic and computational vocabulary and concepts were never taught or explained (e.g. the international phonetic alphabet, Markov chains, or many other things that came up sporadically in class)"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, if you have any interest in manuscripts or history or linguistics or crypto.",
    "Would recommend as a fun elective which probably doesn't count towards your major.",
    "Absolutely!! This class let's you explore your own interests with respect to one of the biggest mysteries of history.",
    "Absolutely--it's fascinating with some work. Maybe take it credit\/d\/fail? A good fifth class.",
    "you must take this course. If you enjoy learning about a strange book written in a script that no one understands, and moreover, approaching it from a scholarly perspective, talking to people who also enjoy such things... well, you know what you must do. Cons: it's not latin. Pros: it's not latin.",
    "Yes! Anyone who loves a little mystery and wonder should take it.",
    "Yes. I would take any course taught by Professor Bowern. She is amazing.",
    "Yes, I think this is a very cool course. Getting to study the manuscript in this way really is an opportunity unique to Yale.",
    "If this is taught again, I say take it. Its a quintessential Yale course. Where else would you take an entire class on an unknown manuscript that we have sitting in the Beinecke library? It was really a fascinating class.",
    "Yes, as long as they are interested with the subject matter and aren't bothered if they don't learn the \"truth\" about the Voynich manuscript."
