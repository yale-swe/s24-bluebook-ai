   "comments": [
    "JBS is literally the greatest and his retirment will be a huge loss to the Yale community.",
    "I would absolutely, but JBS is retiring :(",
    "This is easily the most well taught class at Yale. I did not have a strong interest in education before taking this course and yet I have emerged with a profoundly different worldview. If you ever get the chance, absolutely take this course, over anything else.",
    "JBS is retiring, so you'll never be able to take this course. That's a shame, because JBS is, without a doubt, the best professor at Yale, and you won't find the community he engenders anywhere else.",
    "The most intellectually and personally rewarding class I've taken at Yale. By now you've doubtlessly heard this class is AMAZING - it is. A ton of work, seriously impressive and dedicated classmates, wonderful material each week, and the crowning jewel is the man, the myth, the legend, JBS himself. LOVED IT",
    "For the sake of the juniors I know, I wish he wasn't retiring.",
    "Sorry guys, JBS retired. I've said everything I could possibly say about this class. It was one of the best experiences I've had as a student in my life.",
    "Doesn't really matter, because it will no longer be offered! But with Starr, this was easily top 3 best classes I've taken at Yale. Amazing students, amazing community, and amazing amount learned. Very, very sad to see the end of this era.",
    "Well, apparently this class won't be offered again. Even if it were offered again in some other version, it certainly wouldn't be the same, since JBS is what makes this class so special. I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student! The workload is actually completely manageable if you get in a good routine. The readings are interesting. The protocol in class is unlike anything else you've done in college--very activity-based, fun, and stimulating. The class becomes a community of bright, enthusiastic students. You have the opportunity to rewrite assignments, which is so great for learning purposes, and reduces stress. I've never met a professor so concerned about making sure each student has a good experience and always seeking to improve. This class was offered for decades, and up until the class day, JBS was seeking was to make it better. This class is a total gem! (One note, that's especially relevant since anyone reading these reviews may be bummed thinking they'll never get to take the class. While I stand by my rave review, this class is not life-changing. It's simply a really well-designed class with a great professor. There are other great classes at Yale and other great ways to learn about public schools. Dare I say the class is a smidge overhyped? This exact class will never be replaced, but I'm sure other good ones will follow, and there are plenty of other great courses at Yale.)",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It shows you what incredible teaching and an important subject can do.",
    "YES. One of Yale's must-take classes. I don't know what will happen to the class after JBS leaves, but if it's being taught, take it. If you want to be well informed about public education in the US, this is the course to take. It operates off of a casebook model, so you get an in depth understanding of each policy issue being considered. Be willing to put in the work if the course stays similar to what it was before, it's roughly 200 pages of reading per week. But well worth it.",
    "Take it. You will learn a lot and you will have a lot of fun in the process."
