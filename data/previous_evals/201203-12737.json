   "comments": [
    "Nothing mind-blowing, but a good solid seminar. You don't really learn any theories about public opinion, and all the classes are somewhat unrelated. Pretty straightforward seminar.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to another student. The course material is engaging and you will get a good grasp of what American politics research is all about. Prof. Bullock is a great instructor who cares a lot about Yale undergrads.",
    "A solid, interesting course that takes one through large concepts and empirical trends in U.S. politics. Accessible topic, but the highlight is Professor Bullock, who is an incredibly clear presenter of information, and also a very, very nice person who engages with students.",
    "Read the syllabus, see if you like the topics covered. Then, I recommend you do that following if you decide to take his class: 1. Do reading responses early. Not only is it overwhelming to do them near the end of the semester, but you also get feedback which can be useful in knowing how to improve upon them 2. Prepare for your in-class presentation, and visit Professor Bullock's office hours beforehand on what you plan to do 3. Visit Professor Bullock's office hours frequently, at least a month and a half in advance, to discuss your final project.",
    "Absolutely, one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "The class was really interesting and the material was relevant. We skipped around a lot in the subject but if you are like American politics you will like the discussion. The only thing was I constantly worked very hard because I didn't really know what Professor Bullock wanted when it came to reading responses and the presentation. He doesn't give many guidelines, which makes it confusing. But if you go to office hours and talk to him about your ideas and concerns he is really helpful. He's so intelligent and great to talk to!",
    "In this class, you learn about polling, public opinion, and its interactions with things like the actual political system, education levels, tolerance, etc. It's a paper-reading class where you just look at lots and lots of papers and discuss them in-class. While the structure of the seminar is fairly ordinary, Professor Bullock is one of the clearest and most organized professors I've ever had in class. He can direct loose conversations effortlessly. In addition, the workload of 3 response papers and 1 final paper is pretty reasonable. Onehighlight of the class is that it gives you an introduction to quantitative statistical analysis using R, which is a nice introduction to have!"
