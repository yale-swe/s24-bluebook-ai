    "Professor Mayhew takes his students through a collection of extremely interesting topics on United States elections as well as the Presidency and Congress. He introduces his incredible breadth and depth of knowledge to provide an extremely enlightening seminar featuring one of the better and more comprehensive collections of readings I have ever encountered in a seminar. Overall this class was nothing short of incredible. Professor Mayhew really loves what he teaches and makes every student feel welcome to engage the material with him. The only assignment is a 25-page paper due at the end of the semester. While this might be nerve-wrecking for some, what it seems to do is allow you to relax with the material throughout the semester, really taking it in without having to worry about tests or papers, and then forces you to really get to understand a particular topic which you cover in your paper. Mayhew is great about helping you along the way.",
    "I would recommend this class, but know that you should have a working knowledge of current events and American elections before going in. A bit more direction on the final essay would have been helpful, as would breakdowns in the syllabus for how your grade would be calculated. Overall, a very good class that I would highly recommend.",
    "U.S. National Elections is just what it purports to be: a seminar looking at empirical studies on presidential, senatorial, and congressional elections. There was only a paper a week to read, which meant that therewas only 20-30 pages of reading a week, but then we had to write a 20-30 page research paper at the end of the class. Overall, it was definitely less work than other political science seminars because of the light reading load. What that meant, though, was that we didn't get to look at as many topics as I would have liked. In class, we would normally spend the first half of class just talking about current events and how they might affect elections, and then Professor Mayhew would use a table of random numbers to pick someone to recount the reading in detail. Professor Mayhew and the other students would interject during the recap of the reading with whatever comments we had, and usually we ended up digressing a bit. But the digressions we had were usually fairly interesting, and Professor Mayhew has an encyclopedic knowledge of elections, as well as seemingly every member of Congress who ever existed. One day he spent half the class quizzing us about which two contiguous states voted together in every presidential election since Reconstruction (hint: the answer is none of them), telling us the elections in which each pair of states we mentioned voted for the opposite parties, just to prove a point. As long as you know that what I've just described is what you're getting with this class, then I would recommend that you take it if it sounds interesting to you. I'd say it's worth it.",
    "This would be a great course to take during and election year or if you have a really specific topic that you would like to write a research paper on. Otherwise it is a waste of time. Though it's not that much work week-to-week which can be a plus in a busy schedule.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. If you haven't taken a class with Prof. Mayhew, you need to. The sheer amount of information he knows is amazing.",
    "Great opportunity to write a paper under the direction of Prof Mayhew. I'd recommend a solid background in statistics or econometrics, as this will allow you to get much more out of the class."
