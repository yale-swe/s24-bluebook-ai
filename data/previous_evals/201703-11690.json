In my second rotation I learned how to use NMR techniques for protein studies. I learned how a lab functions in both cases and how the interactions between the people in a lab work at a professional level.",
    "I gained a great deal of hands-on experience and have a better understanding of the direction that my graduate career will take.",
    "I developed foundational skills in several areas of biology, including working with nucleic acids, cloning, running gels, etc. I did not have these skills before rotations because my background was not in biology. I also learned the logic and limitations behind each of these techniques.",
