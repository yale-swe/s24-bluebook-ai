    "ENGL135 will expose you to a lot of poetry and really help you develop your own style. The drafts and revision process aid a lot in crafting your poems. Take this if you have any interest in poetry, even if it doesn't fulfill any requirements.",
    "A WONDERFUL COURSE! Take it and take it with Professor Chapman. She is wonderful, the readings and assignments are wonderful (for our last poem, Professor Chapman crafted an individualized assignment for each student in the class!), and I feel as though I've grown a great deal as a poet and as a reader of poetry in taking this course. My only complaint is that the class didn't meet more\/for longer each week!",
    "It's a fine class, a great introduction to creative writing at Yale, but I don't think it was the most challenging or rewarding class I've ever taken.",
    "In depth poetry readings and discussion. Yes I recommend.",
    "Definitely take it if you even think you might like poetry! I hope they don't make this a class you have to apply for--it was great with all ability levels.",
    "A challenging introduction both to the critical reading of and writing of poetry, but which is a safe enough place to experiment. Recommended, absolutely!",
    "Pleasurable bootcamp for intermediate poets who are serious about growing in their craft. Capable and knowledgeable professor bringing a personal craft and industry cred which is invaluable."
