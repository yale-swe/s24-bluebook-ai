    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, both to fulfill a QR requirement and also because it's a wonderful way to improve your critical thinking skills. I have no regrets about taking this course, and feel that I learned so much and got a lot out for what I put in.",
    "This class was difficult for me(I am a first semester freshman). However, I know that most of my classmates enjoyed and excelled at the class. This class is a hit or miss in my opinion. You either get it or you don't. Doing problem sets were at times really frustrating, but overall, I don't regret taking it. The class gets more interesting as the semester goes on, and Professor Winkler is great. I would recommend taking it with friends.",
    "take this class.",
    "I would not recommend this class AT ALL. I really really regret taking this class. If you're looking for an alternative QR, find something else. It's a ridiculous amount of work (2 problem sets a week, 4 exams) and gets exponentially harder with each session. It starts off nicely and then gets awful. Don't do it!",
    "Definitely do not take if just looking for an easy QR, as logic isnt always intuitive. Work is on the lighter side compared to other QR's, but difficult if it doesn't click for you.",
    "Logic is essentially breaking down English sentences into a different type of symbolic language and then apply a methodology to test whether an argument or serious of arguments is valid or sound. It was some very interesting linguistic implications and philosophical applications. It didn't blow my mind, but it's better than any other QR I've found.",
    "Professor Winkler is very engaged and interesting. I enjoyed how he brought in classical philosophical arguments in to the material. The class is extremely easy and actually very fun! A nice way to break up work from other classes.",
    "Boring lecture, but the material is fun, easy, and generally good to know.",
    "It is harder than I expected, especially towards the end. If you take the course, take it with friends, you need them to get through it. But I enjoyed the first half of the course and the professor is a nice guy.",
    "If you're looking for a not-too-mathy QR that's not a joke and also isn't based in physics\/econ, look no further. Professor Winkler is an absolutely wonderful lecturer--he explains most everything thoroughly, shares some really funny anecdotes, and overall just makes going to class (even on Friday!) a whole lot of fun. That said, this class is not easy. There are 16 problem sets, but you can skip three without your grade being affected, which is nice. Derivations and translations require a lot of practice (there are tricks and patterns, but they're sometimes hard to spot or impossible to do if you don't quite get all the rules), but are extremely rewarding once you get the hang of them--it's suprisingly fun to definitively prove an argument invalid, or to translate some complicated Lewis Carroll quotation into symbolism that does, in fact, capture its meaning. Even if you don't do all that well on the first two exams (which happened to me), don't fear: you have 2 hours (twice as long as the other exam times) to complete a take-home and the usual 3 hours for the final exam (both of which are just a bit longer than the first 2 exams), and the extra time makes a world of difference. The material also doesn't drastically change from the first exam on--you learn most of the basic things before that, and then add on other things here and there while keeping the same basic framework. This class, although challenging and frustrating at times, was definitely worthwhile, and will help you look at arguments and phrasing in a newlight (while also counting as a QR!)",
    "An introduction to formal symbolic logic. Take it! I'm a Slavic major, and still found the course fascinating.",
    "It's a lot of fun. Derivations are...fun! The workload is fine and the material isn't particularly challenging.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "All I can say is: Kenneth Winkler is one of the most engaging, enthusiastic professors at Yale. Period. His enthusiasm during lectures, paired with his sharpness in wit and intellect, made every one of his lectures a joy to attend.The material of the class totally depends on your personality: you're either a logical person, or you're not. If you fall in the former category, you're going to love this class. If you're in the latter, well... you might want to look elsewhere.Fortunately, this class matched my interests and I had a thoroughly enjoyable class experience.Highly recommended.",
    "This course is a rigorous examination not only of how arguments are put together, but how the English language works. We question how we think of language and how to most properly capture the meaning of a phrase. I thought is was an excellent course in critical thinking and it forces you to pay attention to the minute details of language that we often skip over.",
    "pretty easy class, pretty light workload, but the material is pretty interesting. i just took this class for fun, not for my major or requirements or anything, and it was a cool class. i recommend it if you want to know the basic language of logical arguments.",
    "If you're thinking of taking this course as a pre-requisite for Mathematical Logic, and you have any background in real math, SKIP IT. Do not take it. You'll be bored and you won't learn much. See about taking 267 straight off.If, on the other hand, you are a non-math (or hard science) major, and you need a QR credit, it's a respectable course, it's taught well, and the difficulty level (judging by the reactions of my non-math-major peers) is not too high. There's a non-trivial amount of twice-weekly homework but it isn't terribly hard.Advice for everyone: do the readings. Seriously. A lot of what Prof. Winkler says in class is just re-explaining the stuff in the textbook.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for other students. It was fun and engaging, and I feel like it taught me a lot about ways of thinking and reasoning.",
    "I would recommend this class if you get the hang of derivations in the first few weeks. If you find that you don't have a knack for seeing how the problems work out, this course would become extremely frustrating. The midterms were not that difficult.",
    "So, I liked this class a lot. I don't think I did phenomenally in it, but I kept it after getting some low grades, while a lot of other people dropped it. I really enjoyed doing logic problems. Professor Winkler is good, but his style can be a little trying sometimes, but that is something that different people react differently to.",
    "Take it! I'm so happy that this is my QR credit because logic is so much more manageable and fun than math. Learning about the philosophical contexts of particular arguments makes it doubly relevant.",
    "Yes, especially if Prof Winkler is teaching.",
    "Absolutely essential if you are interested in philosophy: take it as early as possible!In general, a really interesting and fun course, not to difficult. The homeworks are usually a lot of fun. Only the metatheory stuff might get a bit tricky, if you aren't really interested in philosophy.Prof. Winkler is fantastic; all in all I can only recommend this course!",
    "Yes. I would go further than merely recommending it and suggest that everyone SHOULD take it, and should be excited to do so.",
    "Great great great course! I really loved this class! It was probably my favorite class this semester. Take it!",
    "It's a decent course, but be prepared for it to lose steam toward the end. That being said, it's a useful skill to know, especially if you're interested in philosophy.",
    "Great class. Helpful for philosophy in general. Winkler is a wonderful man.",
    "If winkler is teaching, take it!",
    "This class is a great QR credit for non-math majors. Being \"First-Order Logic\" it is unsurprisingly logical. If you learn how to apply the rules appropriately, it just makes sense. Professor Winkler is also a great lecturer. If you take the class, be sure to take it with him.",
    "I think everyone should take this take this class at some point. There are extremely interesting things for both the practical and the abstract minded.",
    "First-Order Logic is a wonderful introduction to formal logic for any student. It's taught me how to examine arguments in a methodological manner. Though it's a fantastic QR course for humanities majors, it is by no means an easy one.",
    "This class can be difficult at times but is different from other QRs because a lot of the grading is based on your ideas and approach to problems, as opposed to coming to an exact number for an answer.",
    "YES",
    "Absolutely recommend! Don't take it as a \"gut QR,\" but take it because it offers a different style of thinking, and a great intro to proofs for those who aren't math types (and at least with Winkler, an awesome Prof!). It's challenging but not designed to be difficult, and the topic itself was surprisingly interesting. I ended loving up logic, and gaining valuable skills. I'd recommend this without reservation.",
    "Yes, if you're a philosophy student looking for a QR. The class is challenging and interesting, but not easy. This makes it less attractive for a student of humanities in a different department. There is not necessarily a close correlation between effort and results, as there is in other QR\/Sc courses. Some students grasp it easily (or have had previews in High School) while others struggle to keep on top.The class was also very valuable in bringing together a lot of intelligent people from departments I hadn't met before -- challenging intro QRs are valuable in that sense of bringing bright humanities students together.",
    "If you like puzzle-solving and would enjoy doing proofs for the pleasure of completing them, then this is for you. If you're looking for something that actually teaches you to think in common English logic, maybe try game theory or something?",
    "A great way for humanities-types to fulfill your QR. Not very difficult, but not a waste of a class at all. Winkler is a great lecturer and does his best to make everyone succeed. I actually feel like I think more \"logically\" now as silly as that sounds and I would feel more confident analyzing philosophical arguments. If you like learning languages or solving puzzles, this is a good class for you.",
    "It is a class I recommend for everyone to take. Students learn to question lines of logic and to not take validity or soundness for granted.",
    "I've been anxiously waiting to write this evaluation because I absolutely loved this class! As a hard science major, I've always been slightly intimidated by philosophy classes, however, this was my absolute favorite class of the semester. You learn everything you need to know in class and, if you put in some time at the beginning of the semester, the rest of the course is relatively straight-forward since everything builds off the earlier material. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Understanding the ground of argument: how does a mathematical argument mean ? How is language build to create arguments ?What is Logic ? Was it established or discovered ? Are there different Logics ?Few writting, lots of problem solving: good gymnastic for the mind.",
    "This class is pretty easy and fun. I always enjoyed doing the problem sets. It's a good QR.",
    "Pretty fun QR course if you're so inclined. More work than you might think (About 2 hrs HW for every class), but it's usually kind of fun and not that hard. Winkler is a good prof, although I've heard the other prof gives less work.",
    "Awesome intro to logic, not too difficult, Kenneth Winkler is the best. Take it! The homework is basically like doing puzzles; best qr possible.",
    "Logic is a great class! I took it hoping to get a QR out of the way in a painless, humanities major-friendly way, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that not only did I do that, I actually enjoyed the class and the material. Work is totally manageable, and if you keep up with the problem sets the tests don't require a ton of studying.",
    "This course was very good. Once you understand how to do the proofs, the class work is fun, and there isn't too much new information once you reach the half-way point in the class.",
    "I liked this class. Proofs are fun, there is always a right answer. It's when you get to the philosophy part that might drive you a little crazy.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Professor Winkler was a great professor and it was clear that he wanted everyone to do their best in the course and learn as much as possible.",
    "This was a worthwhile class. Interesting material, especially compared to other qrs, bc it almost entirely centers on real philosophical arguments--no numbers, rarely a variable without real meaning. A solid intellectual workout.",
    "I would recommend it. I am a Humanities person who took it largely for the QR. I was not very good at it and I probably didn't do very well. But it was really interesting! I wish I had put more effort into it but I was pretty focused on classes for my major. Definitely more engaging than Microecon etc.",
    "Logic is a good QR. Though it's annoying that there are two P-sets a week, they aren't graded. The tests are fair (for the most part), and there are a lot of them, so you don't have to worry if you bomb one. Prof. Winkler is such a treat, and works hard to make sure the course is interesting and enjoyable. He also makes a point of finding really great TFs. My TF was super helpful and friendly.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking to get a QR credit. It's not a gut class--you will have to put in work to get a decent grade, but it's well worth it. This course is a great way to get an introduction to an interesting and fun discipline without putting in too much work. It's much more rewarding than the boring gut classes that humanities people sometimes take to satisfy the QR requirement.",
    "Yes, but only if you are good at taking tests! I'm not, personally, so I found the class really stressful - but this would probably be true of any QR.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! First-Order Logic is a very interesting, often enjoyable course. It's also a great way to get a QR credit if you don't want any actual math, and if your brain works that way, it's not that hard. Winkler is great, and the workload is pretty manageable (around 15 problem sets, many of them ungraded, and you can skip 3). Just don't be afraid to meet with Winkler or your TF if you're having trouble understanding the concepts.",
    "PHIL 115 was an introduction to Logic and the questions it raised. I'd recommend it to another student if they were interested in diagramming philosophical arguments, the concepts of validity, soundness, derivability\/provability, and logical truths\u0097or if they just wanted to fulfill a QR requirement without taking something listed under MATH.I'd tell them that Prof. Winkler is excellent and that the class is a lot of work but fulfilling.I wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't truly interested in the concepts: they might find themselves losing interest in the class after mid-terms, when the learning curve levels out a bit and the new material isn't quite as mesmerizing.",
    "Good qr.",
    "It is an introduction to predicate logic. The whole class builds up to it, and then we explore proofs and whatnot when we learn it.",
    "Logic is really great if you're into that kind of thing. It would be a little bit overwhelming if you're not dedicated to learning logic. There is a lot of homework, especially for the first half of the course. You'll basically get out of it what you put into it.",
    "I recommend it highly. It helps you think more logically and is a fun course in general. It is not difficult and is also fun.",
    "You are learning a language in which we can determine whether an argument is valid, sound etc. Terms you will use in any kind of paper about an argument and very useful to know how you can actually determine whether this is so. Also it teaches you a systematic way of thinking. You mainly do translations and derrivations in homeworks and exams. The work is quite a bit, but not unreasonable. As long as you can keep up, its not even that hard, you just need to practice. Winkler makeslectures fun to go to and exams not too hard. I would very much recommend this as a QR as it is kind of fun and very practical as well.",
    "First-order logic is interesting, but it can be difficult and it is a lot of work (2 problem sets a week plus reading if you do it), so if you're just looking for an easy QR this might not be it. However, if you're good at it or you work hard it can be more fun than taking another kind of QR.",
    "A fun, clear introduction to basic concepts in logic and proofs. I would recommend it. MY only warning is: it's very easy to screw up the exams!!!! So don't get over confident, and pay attention to timing. Always do the proofs at the end of the exam first. They are an overwhelming large amount of the exam grade.",
    "\"First-Order Logic\" is a good course for students who are mathematically-inclined but not necessarily passionate about working with numerical figures or equations. It is, however, often tedious work, especially in the p-sets, the solutions to which are more likely found in the textbook than in lecture. I would recommend the course, but only as QR-satisfying: there are more exciting math courses for math enthusiasts, and more exciting philosophy courses for philosophy majors.",
    "Yes--I believe I think more clearly now.",
    "Psets assigned to almost every class -- something to consider.",
    "First-order Logic was a fun and relatively easy introduction to formal logic. Professor Winkler makes lecture engaging, but sometimes he doesn't explain concepts as well as he could. However, with the right TA the class is very doable (If Jonathan Vertanen is a TA try to get him!). Problems sets can be a little long and tedious sometimes, but if you like puzzles they can be pretty fun. Also, with three midterms and a final there's a lot of room to improve your grade if you don't do too well in the beginning. Even if you're not taking this for a QR, I'd definitely recommend the class.",
    "Great class! Maybe not as easy as it seems, but really interesting. Professor Winkler is superb.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Phil 115 is a fun class - especially if you're good at math. Problem sets are kind of like sets of puzzles. I would recommend this class if you're interested in Logic or if you like math and want an fun class.",
    "Yes I would ! Take it if you are interested in argumentation and proofs in general !! It's easy to improve yourself and has many applications in your daily lives.",
    "First Order Logic is a fun way to get a QR. The course material is interesting, but can be challenging. The drawback is that the course requires more work than others, as it requires two problem sets a week. Winkler is a good professor on a one-to-one basis, but can ramble and be unclear at times in lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in philosophy or in gaining a new perspective on thinking\/reasoning in general. This course definitely changed the way I think (in all of my areas of study) in a positive way.",
    "This is a fairly straightforward class that, in the end, provided insight into logical structure. Sometimes it was hard to see the connection between the equations we were playing with and the \"real world\" analogues to which they referred.",
    "Excellent course. I highly recommend it for any student.",
    "Interesting overview of logic (semantic and predicate logic). Good way to get a QR without having to do math. Enjoyed the course greatly, and it's one of those courses where you actually feel like you've learned something afterwards. There is homework due at nearly every class, so you have to stay on top of your work in this class.",
    "Yes!",
    "great class, interesting and not super hard",
    "It's a great course to take for QR and for philosophy. Logic is not always intuitive, and a disciplined study of it using the tools of logic is not only fun, but also an important skill.",
    "Definitely! It is fun and interesting if you put in the effort",
    "Definitely. It stretches your thinking about argument, builds in philosophy... and is a QR. Also, Winkler is the man!",
    "Good QR if you don't want something overwhelming but you don't want to take a gut. I felt like I learned something somewhat valuable, though towards the end of the course it gets pretty repetitive. Take this with Professor Winkler, he's an interesting lecturer and he makes the material incredibly accessible. He goes above and beyond with extra stuff (handouts, worksheets, reminders, optional readings)...you will never want for practice problems or alternate explanations.",
    "Professor Winkler is an excellent professor who speaks with great clarity and is deft at bringing historical figures and questions into the study of logic. The course is interesting material and involves fun problem sets. Thinking through proofs is good practice and a nice mental workout. Keep in mind that it is a course where you learn a language and prove things in it\u0097as a result while the information is instantly applicable within the course it may not provide the insights to other fields\/your life that you may find in other courses. One thing you may find is that the type of proof\/quantitative thinking you will indulge in within class and during problem sets may continue for a while after\u0097thus you may find yourself nerdily fixating on the logic behind something. This can be both interesting and occasionally annoying. Any discipline you engage in will rub off on your thinking (namely, the type of thinking you engage in) and I find this particularly true with logic.Advice: Don\u0092t fall behind. The material is not hard once you have a threshold of practice and understanding, but it is very, very easy to simply not stay on top of your work and find yourself utterly confused. This happened to me on the second midterm and I had a couple of weeks of confused classes and a low test grade as a result. Stay on top of the work and it is easy and fun."
