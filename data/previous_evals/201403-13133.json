   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're in for a close reading and rigorous journey from Chaucer to Donne.",
    "Lots of people had told me that this course is a necessary evil of the English major and a litmus test of whether or not you really want to be an English major, but I think whether or not you enjoy the course really depends on your instructor. The works themselves aren't something I'd usually enjoy (I don't like poetry), but a good professor can make you see why these poems are such an important part of the English canon and why they've lasted so long. Basically, if you go in with the right attitude and a willingness to learn, you can definitely get a lot out of this course -- even if you're not an prospective English major.",
    "Professor Nicholson is incredible in class--she made this somewhat dense material interesting for everyone in the section. She's a hard grader, but she's always willing to talk about papers.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student! It was pretty much all I talked about this semester! The reading was inspiring, as it was the perfect cohesive journey through poetry, and the professor was equally inspiring, allowing free rein in class discussion to explore different ideas while directing the flow of the conversation with key words and phrases that would get everyone excited. Everything was made extremely clear, and I am more confident as a reader and writer as a result of this course.",
    "English 125 is a great course- really teaches you to read closely. If you love reading English lit and coming up with your own spin on it (and learning how to really support it), definitely take. It's an engaging discussion seminar, and the essays develop both analytic techniques and creative thinking. Great academic writing course in general.",
    "The workload is not overly taxing because it is essentially poetry. Even the longer poems were broken up into manageable chunks. There is a weekly reading response, but these are informal and not daunting. The class material is interesting, but you definitely have to be committed to reading poetry because that's what you get all semester. Professor Nicholson makes super enlightening points about the poems and definitely knows what she's talking about. She is a harsh grader, but is approachable and very willing to help students improve.",
    "It's a wonderful class. Don't let people tell you these poets are boring dead white guys. They are obviously dead white guys, but they're not boring at all. Prof. Nicholson is one of the best teachers I've ever had at yale, she is incredibly dedicated and controls a section at exactly the perfect level of interference\/letting people speak. She has a vision for every class and knows exactly where it is going, but she makes you feel like you're getting there on your own. I could imagine the possibility that I wouldn't have said the first part of this comment without the second. She really cares about the material, you should really try to get into her section, not other people's. There is a lot of writing and Prof. Nicholson doesn't let you get away with doing a bad job on it.",
    "It's a very tough course, and one that requires a ton of thinking. If you love reading, however, this is the class for you.",
    "If you have any interest in ENGL 125, take it with Professor Nicholson. Her section was well-organized, the workload was reasonable, and discussion was lively and engaging.",
    "Engl 125 sometimes gets a bad rep as one of the English prerequisites, but I really enjoyed this class. The material can definitely be dense and difficult, but TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR NICHOLSON!!! She's an incredibly invested teacher, and manages to make class discussions interesting every single class. She's not an easy grader, but if you're willing to put the work in she will push your writing to get so much better over the term. One of my favorite classes this semester- if you can take a seminar with NIcholson, even if the material doesn't seem like your thing, do it.",
    "This course is a fantastic insight into early English poetry, as well as a good choice if you are working on your literary analysis. Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne are all unique and fascinating to study, but have very different writing styles and tie together in very interesting ways. Professor Nicholson worked very hard to make us enjoy Spenser, the poet that people often think of as the most difficult to understand, or the most annoying to read, and brought wonderful insight into every conversation of ours. Despite the stylistic differences between the poets, she spends a great deal of time tying them together and demonstrating the evolution of English poetry across the works.",
    "Major English Poets provides an immersive introduction to a few exemplary English poets. The class spends about three weeks on each poet, and provides a solid introduction to the type and quality of close reading and essay-writing expected of an English major. Professor Nicholson is an absolutely amazing professor--she is both brilliant and incredibly kind--and it's thanks to her that I walked away with a pretty profound appreciation for Spencer and Shakespeare's sonnets. We had consistently high-quality discussions, and it's worth trying to get into Professor Nicholson's section, if you can! Professor Nicholson offers detailed and helpful feedback on papers--I think the best feedback of any professor that I've had so far. I'm not sure Major English Poets is worth taking if you're not interested in becoming an English major, because there are other courses that provide a broader (and perhaps more interesting) selection of thinkers and texts. But this class, and this section in particular, made these texts seem extremely rich and valuable, and was successful in illustrating what \"the English canon\" might look like. So: the class is great if you're considering the English major, and Professor Nicholson is a wonderful, wonderful professor.",
    "I think this class really depends on the instructor you end up with, and the students in your particular class. I had an EXCELLENT experience, with a wonderful professor (Nicholson) and a really engaged group of students that made class a pleasure. The readings are surprisingly easy to complete. I never felt overworked. You write an essay for each poet, which isn't too bad, either. If you enjoy reading and talking about poetry, this class has a lot to offer. If not, I wouldn't take it.",
    "English 125 is a pretty good course, though I don't know that I would recommend it if you don't have to take it for the major. As someone who likes poetry but tends to prefer more modern works, I did enjoy the material more than I anticipated. Professor Nicholson is wonderful. Her passion for the material is inspiring, and she is an excellent person with whom to discuss writing."
