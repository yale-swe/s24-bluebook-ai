   "comments": [
    "Excellent examination of the concept of empire alongside a survey of American foreign policy.",
    "Take it.",
    "An overview of American foreign policy through the lens of empire. Each class discusses whether another episode of American foreign policy was empire, and how that can help us understand it better. I would highly recommend this class. As someone interested in American history and foreign policy, it is extremely interesting and useful.",
    "Pretty good readings although gets repetitive to talk about definitions of 'empire.' Kate is very nice and helpful in the paper process. This is definitely irrelevant because she is moving on to bigger things next year.",
    "Great class, interesting subject, good teacher.",
    "High work load, but definitely interesting and worth the time.",
    "The course is well organized and the discussions went well. I also think the readings were selected with care and made sense together- there was a good balance of primary readings and writings by historians.Kate was great- she was one of the most approachable teachers I've encountered here. She did an excellent job leading this seminar and steering discussion, and she always provided really useful feedback on our papers."
