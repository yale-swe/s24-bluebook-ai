    "Take it! Top 5 classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Professor Hayes is quite literally a genius. It is a privilege to sit in a room with her and hear her talk about what she so clearly knows best. The only downside is that there are both online lectures and in-class lectures, but it makes it better that every online lecture is mindblowing (since Professor Hayes is SO smart); in-class lectures can be hit or miss, since she likest to call on people for ideas and sometimes not everyone is on point. But overall a very cool course on a very interesting and relevant subject.",
    "This is a great class. More than most other professors I've had, Professor Hayes is incredibly engaging in the classroom, and she's constantly working to make the material fascinating and relevant. She learns everyone's names in lectures, and lecture is sometimes like a very large section, which is fun. There is some overlap between the material online and the material in class, which means you don't really have to do all the reading\/watching in order to get a lot out of class. I would definitely recommend this to another student.",
    "GREATEST COURSE OFFERED AT YALE. Will inform your approach to every other topic - not only from a biblical standpoint, but in the ways the course teaches you to question and assess texts from many points of view.",
    "TAKE IT. TAKE IT. TAKE IT. I hadn't read any of the Bible before taking this class, and I feel like I learned a ridiculous amount. There are references to the Bible EVERYWHERE. Professor Hayes is also one of the best professors I've had at Yale - she's very organized, eloquent, and accessible. It can sometimes seem like a lot of work, but it's well worth it. TAKE IT. You won't regret it.",
    "This class is not a class on the sacred. It is aclass that sees the Bible as another piece of literature with incredible importance due to its belief to be sacred. That being said, it will teach you a lot about the Bible, ancient Israel, and the science of interpretation. You have to be careful with what is being presented, however. The phrase, \"the Bible contradicts itself\" will be pushed in every class period without any effort to balance out this statement. I would recommend it to a friend if I knew they could handle this one-sided approach.",
    "It's a good class and worth taking, but I don't think it is necessarily a good *introduction* to the Bible. As evenhanded as Professor Hayes is, I think that being introduced to the Bible through the lens provided in this class prevents students from reading the Bible as it has been read for centuries, and the meaning of the book is largely lost. I think it's a great course to hear new perspectives once you have already engaged in a certain level of Biblical study.",
    "I would hesitantly recommend this course to another student. The online lectures are great, specifically the first half of them. The class time itself however was incredibly boring and pretty useless. Probably better to just watch the lectures online. It's a great class to credit-D.",
    "Take it if you want to learn the historical aspects of the Bible. If you want more of the \"Famous Bible Stories\" course, take a different course.",
    "A lot of this course is learning different interpretations of the Bible. I would recommend this course if you want to learn a lot about biblical interpretation. Don't be fooled when she says she is not biased, because she definitely is and brings her own beliefs into discussionsometimes, which can be frustrating. She teaches by the JEPD theory, which is not held by many modern biblical scholars anymore. If you are looking for a solid Bible study, I would not recommend this class and would instead recommend a Bible study on campus. As a Christian going into the class, having a minister as a resource was immeasurable. If you are a Christian considering this class, I would highly recommend finding a campus ministry fellow (YFA, YSC, YCF, AIA, UCW) to walk through the material and her lectures every week.",
    "SO GOOD. A lot of work, but take it if you're interested and are willing to put yourself into it. I learned so much, and can already see how helpful it will be to understand the Bible when studying anything else in the humanities. Really one of the best classes I've ever taken.",
    "YES! TAKE THIS COURSE! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I shopped the course sophomore year and did not take it, but then I shopped it again senior year and I am so glad that I decided to take it. This class is incredible. Not only does it change all of your previous ideas about the bible but it will also teach you how to think critically and analyze the biblical text. Professor Hayes is an amazing lecturer and human being and will make all of the classes worth it. Also do not be put off by the seemingly large amounts of reading on the syllabus. It is actually totally manageable. I have taken 3 other classes at yale that have changed my life and this was a fourth one.",
    "If any aspect of the Hebrew Bible interests you, absolutely take this class. I took it because I wanted to learn more about the Old Testament, but my expectations were totally surpassed. Christine Hayes is PHENOMENAL. She is easily the best professor I've had at Yale. She is an extremely engaging lecturer, absolutely brilliant, and very approachable. She made a text that I previously thought was simplistic come to life in a way I could have never expected. Not onlywill you learn about the content of the Hebrew Bible and its history, you will learn how to actually read it in the context in which it was written and assembled. We also spent a significant amount of time looking at Jewish and Christian interpretations. There is quite a bit of reading and online lectures to go along with every in-class lecture, but it is definitely worth it. The midterm and final are pretty straight forward if you keep up with the readings and online lectures, and I actually enjoyed writing the final paper. My favorite class at Yale thus far.",
    "This is a great class! I knew almost nothing about the Bible and learned a lot. The lectures online are really good (watch them with the subtitles on!) and \"section\" (aka regular class) is really helpful. Exams are very doable and I felt well prepared for the paper. Hayes actually learned all of our names!",
    "This was an absolutely terrific class. The lectures were engaging and sometimes inspiring. The Bible is one of the foundations of Western culture, and this class helps students learn to think about it critically rather than just memorizing the stories. Maybe my favorite Yale class!",
    "A comprehensive study of the first 24 books of the Bible (all those shared in Christian and Jewish faiths). For someone who didn't know anything about the Bible going in, this was an amazing class that taught me more than I expected!",
    "The Bible is an amazing course and I highly recommend it. Not only do you learn about the Hebrew Bible, which is such an important text in our culture, but you also learn about the assumptions that different readers (including yourself!) have brought to the text throughout history. Not only did it change my understanding of a particular text, it changed my understanding of all texts that I approach. Professor Hayes is an amazing teacher. For the class, you listen to the online lectures on Yale Open Courses and then have the opportunity to discuss the material during class time, which is treated like a seminar. The Bible is a really incredible course and I believe that anyone who is interested in religion, history, or philosophy should take it!",
    "YES YES YES. THIS CLASS CHANGED MY LIFE. As a Christian who felt lost reading the Old Testament, I can't stress enough how much clarity this class has given me. It's also made me question my own beliefs in very productive ways. Prof. Hayes is incredible. She remembered EVERY student's name. She's a fantastic lecturer and a great person--I want to BE her. I really appreciated that the course didn't assume any familiarity with the Bible, and Prof. Hayes was very unbiased (I'm not even sure if she's religious). You'll have to work a little harder to remember things if the Bible is ENTIRELY new to you, so some familiarity is helpful, though certainly not required for this class. 10\/10 would recommend. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Don't take this class if you have a superficial interest in the Bible or if you want to learn about religion. This is not a course about Judaism or Christianity (or even biblical religion, really), and it's not a survey course on biblical concepts and figures. It's an in depth class -- you could even say it's a literature course. You do close readings of the Bible and learn a very thorough background context for what is written. History, form, redaction, revision, and scholarly interpretations are all important in the biblical analysis. To find out if you'll like this class, watch the lectures on Yale Open Courses and see what you think. Midterm is relatively easy, paper is pretty in-depth but there is plenty of guidance, and final exam is more difficult.",
    "Don't take it if you're credit\/d-ing it. It's too much work to get stuff out of this class.",
    "Yeah! It's definitely a great \"elective\" type class for any major. I took it as a 5th class credit D and although I didn't get as much out of it as others did, I definitely enjoyed it and am so glad I took it.",
    "Definitely take this course. As a person of faith, it was challenging (in a good way) for me to really look at the Old Testament as a book of writings, and not as a religious book. You will get a decent amount of historical background, and Professor Hayes really leaves it up to you to determine how to interpret biblical passages. I actually really enjoyed writing the final paper (10 pages of interpretation about a specific passage), and the midterm and the final are very straightforward - you know exactly what you need to study.",
    "It is a great course given some interest in the material. There is a fair amount of preparation expected before each lecture (readings and online lectures), but it is certainly rewarding.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Lots of reading but you'l want to do all of it. I'm an English major, and I wish I had taken this as a sophomore so that I could understand everything.",
    "THIS CLASS IS INCREDIBLE. Christine Hayes is an absolute goddess -- she is brilliant, hilarious, engaging, and learns the names of every single person in the lecture. You will look at the Bible in such a different light by the end of the semester, with deep insights into all of the classic Sunday school stories as well as fascinating paradoxes you've never heard of before. The class is a ton of work, since you have to watch a 50-minute lecture and do a lot of reading before every class, but the online lectures are the best part (and are what the midterm and final test, so take good notes). My only frustration is that the in-class lectures can get pretty redundant with the online ones, or they'll discuss things that you know won't be on the final. Generally Monday lectures are entirely Professor Hayes talking, and Wednesday lectures divide the time between Prof. Hayes and splitting off into sections for discussions (the discussions are great!). I skipped some Monday lectures and it didn't matter at all. So basically: watch every single online lecture, do most of the reading, and you'll be set. Fantastic, fantastic class.",
    "This course is an overview of key passages and themes of the Hebrew Bible as a historical record or anthology. The course offers historical background on Ancient Near East and Israelite society as well as an overview of biblical scholarship to date. The focus is often on \"how to read the Bible.\"",
    "Take it! Even if you've never read the bible, you won't feel lost in this course. If you have read it, then it's interesting to see how the way you've normally understood a passage was understood at the time it was written or responding to. And professor Hayes is simply wonderful. She gets to know everyone's name! Not an easy feat.",
    "Maybe slightly overrated but good and worth taking to gain knowledge of the Bible and of different interpretations of the Bible. As a warning, the final is about 100x harder than the midterm (there are so many prophets!)",
    "YES, definitely, if you want to learn about the Bible (and everyone should)."
