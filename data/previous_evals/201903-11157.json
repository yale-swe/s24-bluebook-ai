   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes the vocabulary felt a little excessive, and I think a more limited volume would make it easier to retain.",
    "The strengths of this course was that the class was very organized and you knew exactly which material you needed to know prior to the class meeting. The main weakness that I found with this class was having to constantly study for it, as it meets every day, towards the end of the semester. That is definitely a more personal issue. Otherwise, the only other thing I would say is I would have liked to see my grade updated in canvas but to a certain extent that made the class less stressful so it isn't a huge concern.",
    "The daily quizzes really help you maintain vocab and knowledge in the long term by forcing you to study more than the night before the exam. The class is super fun and engaging and definitely the class I most looked forward to (even though it was a 9:25am) There is not a lot of consistent feedback about grades\/assignments (we didn't have a canvas page until 3 months in).",
    "One strength was that the class was engaging and fun. One weakness is that we had to learned the material on our own and then we were quizzed on it before learning about it in class which was sometimes difficult. Also sometimes I didn't understand the directions to an assignment because it was never given in English which was hard for L1.",
    "I was not a fan of learning the content on our own and then being asked to know it for daily quizzes.",
    "Meeting every day made it very challenging to manage time and appropriately practice the language.",
    "The pace and workload are very immersive which is great for learning but is difficult for students who are not part of Yale College. As a graduate student in a conservatory program, I work professionally as part of my program approximately 14 hours\/day including nights and weekends in addition to taking a minimum 4 course workload. While I learned a lot, keeping up with the vocabulary and increasing pace of new grammar was extremely difficult. Another problem was no clarity about the final exam. Because I am not a Yale College student, I was never notified of the location of the final exam or if I needed to take it as a graduate student taking the course pass\/fail. As a result, I almost missed the exam and felt completely unprepared.",
    "This class was certifiably terrible - while I was initially very excited and eager to learn Italian, I came to class every morning at 9am only to constantly struggle with the language. Instruction for this L1 class was almost entirely given in Italian, making the lessons confusing and inaccessible. My performance in the class relied heavily on how much time I took to teach myself Italian every night - and eventually every morning as I started having to wake up early and study so I'd have a decent enough grip on the material. We received poor feedback. Our teaching was inconsistent with that of other L1 Italian sections - for instance we learned on the day of the final that other sections had received not one, but two study guides to help them study for the exam - we did not receive these study guides. I was constantly embarrassed in the class, and while I acknowledge that embarrassment is natural while learning a language, I felt as though it only served to reinforce persistent anxiety about the class. While it was challenging, and in that respect structured to create strong incentives to learn the language, these incentives persisted throughout the course as a constant fear of letting your head sink below water."

    "Yes. Michael is an excellent professor and he makes the natural difficulty of learning a language something to be appreciated and, in a way, enjoyed.",
    "Yes. Especially with this professor. The class was very engaging and it was very clear how to do better if that was something you wanted. Also, there are multiple chances to show that you improved your performance if that was something you wanted.",
    "Yes, this course was really fun. The language is beautiful and everyone who is interested in Italian should take Michael Farinas section because he is the best.",
    "YES! Take this section if you can get in. It is not only fun but I learned so much along the way.",
    "yes if they like languages.",
    "if you're interested in italian i guess, but I'd say if you're just trying to get the lang. requirement out of the way take a language you're more comfortable with",
    "No. Perhaps with a more structured lesson plan in the future - I loved the language and the study of the language, but the class spurred so much anxiety that I didn't enjoy it despite this."
