    "Great course. Moves at a fair pace, workload is reasonable. Professor Liu is an excellent teacher, and she makes the class very entertaining as well!",
    "you're wrong if you think this is the 'class for kids who can speak and understand but are illiterate' because we learned so much, not just hundreds of new characters but also how to speak correctly, such as grammar and pronunciation, which even though we grew up bilingual we weren't necessarily proficient by any means in Chinese. and even if you're a Chinese or Taiwanese American and you've never written or spoken Chinese in your life, it doesn't matter as long as you can understand Chinese at a basic conversational level and are willing to learn, because you will improve by incredible amounts by the time the semester is over.",
    "I definitely recommend Chinese 132 for any heritage speakers. Depending on your level entering the class, you may have a hard time at first but it is definitely worth the time you put in. I learned more Chinese from this semester than I've ever learned in my life.",
    "If you are one of those kids who maybe went to Chinese school or was taught Chinese by an elder family member but then proceeded to forget everything that you learned, take this class! You will actually see your Chinese improve within the first few weeks and you will be able to more effectively use the language.",
    "This is a great class for people who grew up speaking chinese but need to learn proper grammar, as well and reading and writing. Take it. It's worth it. Be alsoBe prepared to study hard for it.",
    "Excellent introduction to Chinese for heritage speakers. As a Chinese-American who had never gone to Chinese school growing up and knew only three characters (my name) before taking this course, I felt that the workload was definitely manageable, and at the conclusion of the course I'd say I know 500-600 characters and have a much better understanding of Chinese grammar. There is a lot of memorization involved (especially with daily homework and quizzes), but those who put in the work are generally rewarded with high grades. Additionally, Liu Laoshi is an incredible teacher. If you're thinking about improving your Chinese skills and you're a heritage speaker, definitely take this course.",
    "If you are a native speaker and would like to improve Chinese, definitely take this class. Since it meets everyday, it may seem like there is a quite a bit of work at times, but the class is also worth 1.5 credits. If you pay attention in class and attentively do the work, you will see significant improvement in your Chinese.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student because it does exactly what I had hoped it would, re-inspire me to study the language and to give me more pride for my culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 132 because it improved my Chinese more than I thought possible. I came home for winter break and was able to read most of a Chinese 5th grade textbook. Though there's a lot of work, it's manageable because it's very clear cut and you know exactly what you need to do to succeed. Liu Laoshi is fantastic and always happy, which eases the pain of having a 9:25 class every morning.",
    "132 is the perfect course for people who have grown up listening to and speaking Chinese but haven't learned characters. It is a lot of work, but very rewarding when you can read Chinese newspapers by the end of the course.",
    "Put in the time and effort and you'll do fine. Don't take this class unless you understand most spoken Chinese.",
    "Coming from a background of speaking a dialect at home and not being able to read or write Mandarin, I thought this course was very challenging, but completely doable if I gave the effort. Granted, for me effort meant hours of studying per day in addition to the daily classes, but it was a challenge I was willing to take and the payoff is definitely obvious. It was my most fulfilling class, as my improvements were reflective of the effort I put in. Liu Laoshi is an amazing instructor, conscientious of students' levels and needs. From her sense of humor (generally poking fun at her semi-traditional Chinese perspective as opposed to her Americanized daughter's perspective) to the powerpoints and discussion\/seminar format, Liu Laoshi's method of teaching resulted in a surprising amount of retention. I would highly recommend this course because it is exactly what I expected a university language course to be like - intensive, small sized, but rewarding in the amount that I've learned in the class."
