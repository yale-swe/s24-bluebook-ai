   "comments": [
    "In this course, we read a very wide variety of seminal French texts. In addition to learning a great deal about the background of each of the authors, I learned about french pedagogy as Madame Girard approaches each class in a traditional french fashion.",
    "I learned about French literature and gained an excellent cursory knowledge of its trends and notable authors.",
    "I gained a thorough knowledge of French literature, with emphasis on the texts, authors, history and art history.",
    "As someone who did not have an extensive background in the area of French literature, I gained a wealth of knowledge about novels, plays, and poems written during the length of time spanning from France's medieval ages to the present. I appreciated that we also learned about the personal histories of the authors of each of these works of literature. This course also helped me develop my French writing and speaking skills since we had to compose several essays, give a presentation on a topic of our choice, and participate in class discussions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the reading list could be condensed. I never really felt like I was fully grasping the full range of themes and issues in any given text. Had we spent two class periods instead of just one on the longer readings, I imagine I would have felt more fit to write about the texts in our essays.",
    "The course is a great survey of French literature. I think it could probably go more in-depth into certain authors; sometimes it felt we were reading works just for the sake of reading something by a particular author when I would have been willing to put in more work to read more enjoyable texts. Also, there are multiple sections and since my class was very small it would have been better to combine both into one.",
    "The course is well organized and the texts are well selected to be interesting and diverse. And the class size is small so that everyone can be very engaged.",
    "Strengths: I really appreciated the small class size, the depth of knowledge Professeur Girard poured into each of her lectures, the freedom of choice we had when picking essay and final presentation topics, the very useful comments Professeur Girard gave when editing the first drafts of our essays, the field trip we took to the Yale Art Gallery at the end of the semester to explore the French art there, and finally how kind Professeur Girard is! Weaknesses: The only weakness I would mention is that sometimes the students in the class didn't have very much time to interact and discuss the readings with each other since Professeur Girard lectures for most of the class period."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "It depends. If you are taking this course with Madame Girard, you must know that a large portion of class is dedicated to lecture (about 45-50 min). If you're looking to improve your spoken French, you have to make the absolute most of those last 25-30 min of class time. Sometimes, however, this can be difficult to do because there is so much reading that is covered for each class that you don't know what to even begin talking about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in literature. It's in French, which would be a barrier to entry for many literature majors, but if you know French this is a course I would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course! The readings are overall very interesting, and the workload is reasonable. We also have a lot of creative freedom when crafting our essays and final project. Additionally, Professeur Girard is a very understanding and kind person!"
