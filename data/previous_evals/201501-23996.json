   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the Spanish language and how it's evolved and been influenced by historical\/political\/religious factors, then definitely take this course. If you want to read poetry for its artistry, then this probably isn't the best course for that. It's a lot of old, old spanish ballads that kind of recount history and epics of the time. There's only one main final paper, one presentation, and one midterm, and the readings are totally doable. It wasn't a hard class, and I enjoyed it, but I think I would've felt more passionate about something with more contemporary poetry.",
    "Took this course for the language credit. I would recommend it as a relatively easy and stress-free way to fulfill your distribution requirements and learn something about the history of Spanish literature. The material is pretty difficult and I found it hard to really immerse myself in it, but it's OK because you're not really expected to have a perfect understanding of each poem, just do the reading and be prepared to participate in class.",
    "The class is an in-depth assessment of the semi-historical poems of the \"Romancero.\" I would recommend the class to another student because I feel it was entertaining and informative, though I would caution them that the reading is difficult. Luckily, the professor worked hard in class to make sure we could actually make sense of what we'd read.",
    "Romancero is a Spanish L5 class that works well for students who want to learn more about Medieval Spanish poetry or maintain contact with the Spanish language."
