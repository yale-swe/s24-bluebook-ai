    "This class worked really well for students in similar social sciences field. It was a valuable opportunity to learn from other students' fields and writing styles as well as provide additional incentives to finish the thesis on time. The only drawback was taking the class with fewer students in my own discipline. While the instructor and TA's feedback was very helpful, comments from students were less so. The class also counted as 4 credits with an outside writing group. My group could never organize to meet, despite my best efforts, and I feel that we still put a lot of work into the class, even without the meetings."

    "The course provided a structure and deadlines to help me get my writing done. Having the opportunity to critique other students' work was helpful in seeing the strengths and areas for improvement in my own work. Workshopping the presentations was particularly useful to me and a good opportunity to work on my presentation skills and figure out how to communicate my research succinctly.",
    "Generally the course forces the student to really immerse him-\/herself in the writing process although the amount of output may have been heavier compared to my other courses.",
    "Course is incredibly helpful in writing up master's research and pushing to publish or present work to external audiences. I benefited a lot from track-change comments on abstract\/paper sections from people outside my group. Professor comments were also detailed and incredibly helpful. Even more mandated switching with classmates would be beneficial.",

   "comments": [
    "Some of the readings were probably not necessary",
    "I think there really is a need for students to be heavily invested in writing and I would be bias in saying that it would been preferable if this specifically tailored to MESc students.",
    "I might structure the course assignments differently with much of the prep work in the first 2 weeks and then mandatory weekly 500 word submissions thereafter. Or perhaps the prep-work could be a 1 credit reading group in the fall, so that the spring would be all writing\/revising. It would be great to have a partner fall course on data analysis and visualizations.Also, I am a hands-on learner, so more discussion of actual articles\/presentations would be more helpful than discussing these in generalities. It was a lot to have to review two papers each week and contribute to your own writing -- at times this was too much. Perhaps a smaller class size and more thoughtful assembly of writing groups would be beneficial.",
    "Student feedback not always the most relevant; dedicating a whole class to 3 people's work seemed a bit long at times, but dinner breaks definitely helped.",
    "The writing groups fell apart after spring break. I don't think the final draft deadline should have been removed but maybe adjusted.",
    "Sometimes I felt like the in-class workshops were not extremely helpful for the writes. Perhaps the workshop portion could be divided into two groups based on focus(?) so that people can really dive deeply into each others work (though this is also the purpose of the outside group)."

I strongly recommend that the TA in future classes be really broadly exposed to different researches to provide sufficiently in-depth perspectives on how students can better come up with great writing.",

    "Writing group was helpful but not as disciplined as it should have been. I wish more structure or diversity was built into the groups instead of self-selection. Weekly 500 word assignments might have helped this out.",
    "I think other writing groups worked well. Mine involved students outside of the class and it was very difficult to convince everyone to organize and meet for the writing group.",
