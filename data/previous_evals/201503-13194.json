   "comments": [
    "Strengths: both theoretical and computational knowledge",
    "Strength: Go through the toolbox of learning statistic models Weakness: A bit too quick in second half semester",
    "The materials are interesting and Prof. Crawford did an awesome job making it understandable. This is the course that benefits me the most for the first semester here.",
    "Overall, this class is excellent. This course covers important topics in computational statistics and is taught in a very clear and concise manner. The homeworks and exams are still challenging despite the straightforward teaching, but for the most part, the assignments\/questions are reasonable.",
    "Overall a very useful course. The instructor is excellent. The lecture is clear and makes sense. The workload is heavy, but it's worth it. In conclusion, an excellent course!",
    "very helpful and useful",
    "The assessments are useful",
    "Prof Crawford's lectures are very clear and easy to understand. The lectures covers many interesting topics in computational methods. It can be better if the professor can provide more examples or even extra notes regarding each of the lecture topics.",
    "clear logic; theory-practice combined",
    "Competent very useful, but also hard because there isn't enough time to digest each part of the content",
    "I like it that the professor uses the blackboard instead of the slides. It would be better if the professor can give us a little general idea before each class and give us a conclusion after each class.",
    "Homework problems are well designed.",
    "This is a great course, which teaches really practical things. The course is hard, but is definitely worth the time and effort.",
    "It was often frustrating that the topics introduced in lectures were quite simple and easy to understand, but the homeworks seemed to be in a completely different dimension in terms of difficulty. I understand that you'll never learn anything if you aren't challenged, and I agree with this, but I feel that you also don't learn anything if what you're doing is over your head. I could go through the motions all day and still not understand what I was doing, and maybe this is my own fault, but I think lessening the jump between a simple lecture and a seemingly impossible homework would have improved my understanding of the material. Most of the problem for me was not that the concepts were difficult, but that I was unable to work through the logic to set the problem up before I could even get to the computational part. Again, this is probably just a deficit on my part, and of course real life problems are never this simple, but I always felt there was a barrier between me and the material because I could never work through the probabilistic logic."

    "This is a very great course. I recommend it to other students. Thanks Professor Crawford teaching us so much.",
    "Highly recommend if you want to learn algorithm, combine theory with practice.",
    "Recommended for upperclassmen for its difficulty, but content is useful. Great professor and TA.",
    "Good course. Help you to better understand the underlying mechanisms of some statistical problems",
    "Yes. This course is very useful in practice.",
    "Would highly recommend, but be prepared to work a lot.",
    "Concepts are simple and easy to understand but homeworks are convoluted and difficult applications of the material. I would *only* recommend to students with incredibly strong math backgrounds in probability and mathematical statistics. Basic coding skills in R are not enough and you need to be prepared to write more advanced scripts to keep up in the course."
