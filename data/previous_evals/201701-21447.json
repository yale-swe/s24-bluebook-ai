    "French speaking and writing skills. Better understood teaching methods.",
    "Basic french, as well as increased comfort starting to engage in real conversation in the language.",
    "French 120 was an extension of French 110. I found that my speaking and comprehension skills increased greatly. The foundation of French 110 was helpful and French 120 convinced me that the work and tedious rules were relevant!",
    "Further study of grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I feel like Fren120 focused more on vocabulary than Fren110 but had some new topics in grammar as well. And so during this course I had improved and solidified the grammar basis that I acquired in Fren110 and learned new material. This course has definitely helped me with my conversational French and enriched my vocabulary.",
    "Definitely have a good knowledge of how to speak french after the second semester. Can use different tenses and have a decent conversation in french. Now I know many more fixed expressions and do not have to rely as much on translating things from english to french in my head."

   "comments": [
    "Well organized. Great instructors. Very engaging. Some of the homework assignments felt like busy work (less useful), but I think it is hard to streamline language learning since any practice is helpful.",
    "The flipped classroom design makes learning new material frustrating as you're learning it on your own from a book. The idea is this gets corrected in class the next day with the practice, but I don't see why you can just get it taught right the first time. My guess is this design makes you struggle more, ending in you learning the material deeper.",
    "The course sometimes does not explain the linguistic mechanics of phrases the video pedagogy presents. It can be difficult to accept that \"this is just how a phrase works\" without knowing the exact rules behind it.",
    "This is a great course. It is a lot of work but you can finish the year fluent in French!",
    "You definitely learn a lot in such a short space of time but the workload for French is far greater than any other language at Yale.",
    "I had already mentioned this in my evaluation of the first semester and nothing has changed and I do not think anything will change with this one. But I will briefly mention them again. I do not like how the oral part in the tests is structured; I do not think that it reflects the students' speaking skills and capabilities. I would have wanted to have longer oral parts and in less exams. And the fact that we sometimes had three lessons to study in one week was too much. And again, the fact that we can not receive our tests back simply annoys me. I would want to keep my test and be able to refer to it anytime I want to look at my mistakes or examples of sentences and not only before the final test. I still think that this is really important. This course has a lot of strengths however, in only a couple of months it covered a lot of material. It covered varied and different fields of vocabulary and some of the most common tenses in French language. It has also put an emphasis on some essential topics that are useful and practical, which was really nice. I really enjoyed this course. Also, the atmosphere in the class was always fun and casual. I really like the conversations that we had in class.",
    "Learned so much french in this class and can have a pretty good conversation as long as crazy vocab is not used. Some explanations in english would have been helpful for clarification purposes, but english was not really allowed since the whole class is conducted in french. Sometimes it is hard to explain a question you have in french if you do not have the proper words to say what you want to say."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended. I learned a lot and enjoyed the class very much.",
    "It's a lot of work if you do all the work but if you have a language requirement or want to learn french why not right?",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who would like to effectively learn French quickly. It hasn't been easy, but it has been worth it.",
    "Yes take this if you want to learn French.",
    "Yes I highly recommend it, French is simply a beautiful language and this course is very well structured that it will allow you to fall in love with the language. Take it! You will not understand how rewarding it is until you speak to real French people IN FRENCH.",
    "I loved this class. It is pretty much the same workload and routine as the first semester, but a little better since you have more knowledge of the language and can say more things. Stick with french, it's a good time if you don't let all the homework get you down."
