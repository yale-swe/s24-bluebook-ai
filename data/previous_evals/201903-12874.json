    "A very comprehensive (and hands-on!) introduction to the world of zines, artists books, and different sectors within the self-publishing field. Alex is so knowledgeable and passionate -a pleasure to learn from.",
    "I learned various techniques in printmaking such as screenprinting and risograph printing. Niche, but useful and cool skills. I also gained insights into the world of self-publishing, and the amount of work that goes into making books for art fairs.",
    "Book binding, risograph printing, general book making techniques, screen printing and screen exposure\/color separation.",
    "I learned so much content relating to self-publishing, and how to create very dynamic pieces.",
    "I learned a lot about self-publishing and the various methods to self-publish.",
    "I learned how to use a risograph printer! I didn't know about the whole small publishing scene before I took this class, so that was exciting."

   "comments": [
    "The trips to HAAS, YUAG and Beinecke were so informative! Although I do wish that we had more in-class workshops (bookbinding, paper-making, ect.) and less work days for our projects.",
    "Strengths: Alex is a fantastic professor who will not hesitate to help you outside of class, and is extremely good at what he does. The class has a loose structure that allows students to pursue projects that they are passionate about. Weaknesses: sometimes the lack of structure made it hard to keep track of what was due\/what is going on. Also, it's difficult for undergrad students to access the art school's print shop outside of monitor hours and class time.",
    "Great room to do your own projects.",
    "strengths: self-run and super exciting! weakness: monitor hours can sometimes be inconvenient",
    "The course was a great introduction to self-publishing. There was an appropriate amount of exposure to historically important publications fueled by trips to archives at both the YUAG and the Hass Library. There was a great introduction to various methods of printing and binding and a number of digital tutorials for certain helpful programs. I think a series of smaller projects leading up to the larger ones with more structure related to the method would be helpful. For example: a week long assignment to create a layered image on the risograph, similar to the screenprinting project. I also think more assignments in general can be packed into this class. It was exciting to learn riso and screenprinting but it was easy for this course to be low priority. It was also easy to get caught up in the design of a project early on when we needed to be focused more on the method of creating. I think with more small assignments and stricter due dates this course would improve. I also think more physical tutorials like the bookbox we made would be helpful. Perhaps more exposure to materials, etc.",
    "I think the biggest challenge was to learn multiple printing processes over the semester, while also wanting to spend time generating the content."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you want to start making books yourself, and learn easy techniques to mass produce your work. It's also a really fun class, taught by a professor who is passionate about what he does. Definitely take it if you're not afraid to spend considerable amounts of time in the print shop (which I would say is not a downside as it is a friendly and relaxing place). Someone looking to continue their personal practice of art, or start one, will find the right guidance in this class.",
    "Yes! This course is an amazing introduction to the independent book making world. Really interesting reading, critique and the opportunity to make books, which is pretty unique.",
    "YES",
    "Yes! I loved this course! There was great exposure to printing techniques and self-publishing as a practice.",
    "Yes, get ready to make some stuff!"
