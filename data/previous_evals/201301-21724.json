    "This course finishes off the required 3-term history sequence and wow is it an incredible journey. Music majors have to take each course eventually but may choose the order; I took the courses in order in consecutive semesters and felt this was very effective. The class is very work-intensive (although you can be smart about how much reading you do), the lectures are outstanding, and if you apply yourself, you will leave knowing so much more about the Western art music tradition and how we have reached our present situation. Non-music majors without a strong theory background may struggle.",
    "Amazing course overall, but the listening quizzes are a bear. You have to listen to 6-10 hours of music for a 5-minute quiz! I am a non-music major who Cr\/Ded this class, but I still had to study quite a bit to get a decent grade--definitely not a course you should take if you want to slack off a lot. Professor Hepokoski's lectures are some of the best at Yale, though: he's hyper-articulate, and his lecture style is very engaging and reminded me of Nemerov's. Even if you aren't taking the class you should shop it just to hear him speak! He won't win an award for most accessible professor to undergrads, but he is brilliant, and his speaking style is so moving that people cried during the last lecture. Section is optional, but it's pretty interesting and the TFs are knowledgable, so you should try to go. The written tests aren't too difficult (use Hepokoski's study guides to study! They're such a help), and the readings are very interesting. I don't know if I'd recommend this as a fifth class if you're a non-music major, because it ended up eating up a significant amount of time I could have spent studying for other courses, but it really gives you a solid background in classical music if you have a little familiarity with the subject matter already but want to gain more knowledge. If you have the time, it's very worthwhile. Probably best if you have some musical background, because he expects you to have basic knowledge of music theory and the ability to read music.",
    "Huge time commitment, but ultimately extremely rewarding. This class, in conjunction with Hepokoski's Music 351, has significantly shaped how I hear and talk about Western music. Be prepared to cry at the end of the last lecture.",
    "Take this class! It's a lot of work, but 100% worth it. If you choose to really engage with the material the way Hepokoski presents it, you will find yourself listening to and thinking about music in a completely changed way. You will never, ever be bored in this class. And even if you're not a music major, I'd recommend taking it (maybe Credit\/D), just for the experience of one of Yale's best course opportunities!",
    "Music 352 attempts to cover everything that happened in Western Art Music from around 1800 to around 1950. This is an absurd amount of material, but the course makes a valiant attempt at doing it justice. If you do all the reading and listening and go to all the sections (NB this is quite a bit of work), you'll get a LOT out of it, but the less you put in, the more frustrating the experience will be. If you're a music major, you don't have a choice, but if you're not, you might still find it valuable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but consider taking it Credit\/D.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class--one of the best I've taken in four years. The lectures are smart and interesting and beautiful. At least two of them had me near tears. If you like music at all and know even a small amount of theory, you should definitely take this class. Hepokoski does a great job making every lecture exciting, but the narrative of the whole semester is also expertly woven, and the last lecture was just stunning. The first few weeks, which were all about Beethoven, were among the highlights of the class. A full lecture on the first movement of Beethoven's fifth symphony changed the way I'll listen to that symphony forever. There's lots of great music on the syllabus, but it ends up being a class about intellectual history as well. I might recommend doing it credit\/D; the written tests are quite easy, but the listening tests are tough and it's nice not to have to worry about them too much. But it's worth doing as much of the reading as you can even if you do it credit\/D, because the textbook is great. All in all, I can't recommend this class highly enough. Hepokoski is also a fantastic person, and I very much recommend going to talk to him.",
    "A good amount of work, but the lectures are so worth it. Take this class!",
    "Starts with Beethoven, ends with Chuck Berry's \"Roll Over Beethoven\". Traces the rise and fall of the institution of Art Music starting with its founder in Beethoven, through the lively debates about what Art music should be in the 19th century, into early and high modernism and the post war fragmentation of musical styles.",
    "TAKE IT. This is the reason why you are paying 50k a year to go to this school.This course takes a lot of work, but it is worth it. Made me love music all over again.",
    "You need to take this course. Easily one of the top 3 best courses I've ever taken. (I'm a science major). Every lecture blew my mind. The course is not super difficult, but also would be great as a Cr\/D if you're worried about it being too hard. Don't be intimidated if you're not a music major; it's a very accessible course for non-majors. Lectures were so enjoyable, and preparing for the listening quizzes was really fun! I've been a classical music lover for several years, but the chance to learn about the history behind music that I love so much was great. Summary: take it.",
    "Good prof, good course. Section is sometimes helpful, listening quizzes and factual exams take a long time to study for, long (and boring) final paper. Hepokoski is an amazing lecturer, though.",
    "An excellent, excellent class. So much great music, and Hepokoski is one of the top two best lecturers I have ever had at Yale. A lot of work, but if you take it Cr\/D\/F, it's thoroughly manageable and still a very rewarding experience.",
    "Amazing class! I'm not a music major, but as a musician I learned so much from this class and had an incredible experience. While it is a lot of work (study guides for the factual exams can be frustrating because of the amount of material, including some material that we have to look for on our own because it's not covered in class), it was an extremely rewarding experience. Professor Hepokoski's lectures are always informative, insightful, and entertaining because of his analysis and narration of the music we hear in class. Take it!",
    "Music 352 is not an ordinary music history course. It may completely change the way you think about music. The professor was also an outstanding lecturer. Definitely take this course if you are interested in music and can dedicate many hours to the reading assignments.",
    "This is truly a rare gem. If you are a music major, you should thoroughly enjoy this experience \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more than a requirement, it is an opportunity to live with some amazing music and to follow a brilliantly woven historical narrative. If you aren't a music major, I would still HIGHLY recommend the course \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you have no musical experience, you will want to take it CR\/D, but if you have even some musical intuition, it will prove to be a thoroughly rich and rewarding time.Amazing.",
    "Work intensive, but one of the most interesting classes you can take at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any interested music scholar. I think you will be absolutely thrilled to have the chance to take this course.",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale, mainly for Hepokoski's lectures (and facial expressions.) There is way too little time to cover a satisfying amount of material over the semester, but Hepokoski plans it out so well that you feel like you have a good grasp on the progression of 19th\/ 20th century western music. The 3 listening quizzes and 3 factual exams and a final paper add up to a lot of work, but it is worth it.",
    "It is a fantastic course. I learned so much, and it lives up to all the hype. You simply have to take it.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is quite a bit of work, with 6 exams--3 factual essay-based and 3 listening identification + 3500 word final paper. However, Prof. Hepokoski is a fantastic lecturer and makes it worth all the work!",
    "MUSI 352 is by far the most intense course I have taken at Yale. Each listening quiz is 9+ hours of music to be able to identify by name and composer and year, and on two of these quizzes the professor included movements that were not listed in the syllabus. The amount of material we are expected to know for each factual exam extends far beyond what the already-packed lectures provide, and the review guides were full of typos and not updated for the current year. In the end the TAs graded the exam essays on writing style more than factual accuracy. The selling point for the course is Professor Hepokoski's superb lectures, which on their own are a fantastic, entertaining, informative walk-through of music from 1800-1950. However, he gives the impression of a professor who wishes to do little more than come give a lecture, leaving behind a grueling amount of research and studying for students to do. It is a model that could work well in a music grad school, and I am happy now to have learned so much, but it makes no sense as a 1-credit undergraduate course. Only take if you have the time to live and breathe music history as your lifestyle.",
    "Music 352 is a phenomenal class; Hepokoski is among Yale's best lecturers and really takes you on a musical journey through the most fascinating period of music history. Although it is a ton of work with all the listening quizzes, exams and final paper, this is almost a must-take class at Yale for anyone who is musically-inclined. One emerges with a much deeper understanding of music history, and the listening exams often force you to discover pieces from composers you might never have encountered. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Love the material, but hate the class assessments, which are either contrived historiographical essays asking you to BS or rote memorization on the factual exams that asked you to regurgitate as much material as possible on the exam. Be nice to your TA.",
    "great class, i would not recommend it to nonmusic majors although it is incredible the volume of material and music is huge",
    "No. I would not recommend this class to anyone who didn't have to take it. The work volume and input of time does not match what you receive. The listening quizzes are insane. The factual exams are fine. The final paper is an enormous waste of your time. This is a requirement for music majors, so take it if you want to pursue the major. But understand, you are signing up to be talked at for five hours a week with little opportunity to discuss the material to better your understanding.",
    "Great class. Lectures are uniformly superb, and I felt that I learned an incredible amount about music in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, even having been exposed to it already for much of my life. If you're a non-musician, I'd still recommend it, since it doesn't presuppose too much prior knowledge, and since you can get all the information you need from the lectures and readings. Also, don't listen to everyone who says it's a lot of work; if you keep up with the readings (which I found really fun and interesting), you'll be fine on the written exams. The listening exams are admittedly stressful, and prior familiarity with the repertoire certainly helps. If you start listening early, though (especially if you actually listen to the repertoire when we're studying it), and understand and can recognize key structural features and melodies, you'll be fine."
