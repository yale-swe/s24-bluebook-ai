    "Take it. It's hard, time-consuming, and don't expect to get an A. But it is one of the best classes at Yale, and definitely one of the best (if not THE best) classes in the English department. It will improve your writing by leaps and bounds, and you will get a chance to read some very interesting essays, pieces that most English classes would never look at. Take it.",
    "Take this class! English 120 with Dr. Hopper was incredibly rewarding. I learned a lot about writing essays and produced work that I felt really proud of. There's a lot of emphasis placed on writing technique as opposed to analysis of literary aspects and content. I took the class because I like writing but I'm not a huge literature person. Workload is non-trivial but enjoyable. I worked hard but never found myself stressing out over the class.",
    "Awesome class! A lot of work, but I feel like it was work well spent. I enjoyed 99% of the reading for this class. Definitely take if you want to write non-academic things",
    "I would recommend it to a student looking for an easy way to skate through a Writing credit -- you won't learn anything, but it won't take up a ton of time.",
    "A class on learning to write creative non-fiction, such as personal narratives. A fantastic class, one you won't regret, even if you are STEM.",
    "I would recommend this as a course to take if you want to enhance your own writing abilities. It also provides a creative outlet to write about yourself and create narratives. The workload towards the beginning of the semester sometimes felt a little bit much because essays or revisions were due every week, so I would say the student should really have an interest in writing.",
    "120 is an incredible intro english class. Take it. If you can, take it with Professor Hopper!",
    "Definitely take it! It's so relevant and improving your writing will only help you in all aspects of your future. I really enjoyed this course! I love the workshops for essay drafts and the discussion centered class style of each class. It made it feel like it wasn't work, but a very organized and intellectual hangout. Plus Dr. Hopper was great. She was very helpful in her comments and in her in-class recommendations for different styles of writing. She ran class well, where discussion seemed free but didn't get off track. I felt very comfortable writing for her class. I do wish we received our graded papers back earlier (often i got them the night before the next final draft was due, which didn't leave much time for incorporating comments).",
    "Yes! The class itself is a must-take at Yale. It's great for writers of all experience levels because you can really write at your own level and make of the assignments what you want. Dr. Hopper will be there to support and encourage you no matter what stage you're at. She herself is a treasure to Yale, so smart, so in-tune with the modern nonfiction scene (she writes prolifically!). Don't be put off by the pacethe deadlines will get you into a routine and then you'll forget what it was like NOT to have an essay due every week. Plus, the work really slows down by the end of the term when it's picking up in most other classes. Great course!",
    "English 120 teaches you how to model modern essays and incorporate techniques of effective writers into your own writing. The writing style is very different from academic writing, which can be uncomfortable at first but is fun and liberating after the first paper. I would definitely recommend this course to any student regardless of their major because it gives the opportunity for self-reflection while teaching you how to write effectively. Also, the workload is heavier towards the beginning of the course, so towards the end there is less work when other classes are preparing for final exams and increasing the workload.",
    "A good introductory course for non academic writing"
