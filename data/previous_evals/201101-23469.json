   "comments": [
    "It's strengths are the breadth of material covered as well as the interesting guest lecturers.I think it might be improved by requiring some type of textbook to have more cohesion in the class. The final exam was especially difficult for the reason that some questions are very specific and clearly came from one specific source.",
    "I really liked learning about process and outcome measures. That was the best part and it changed how I look at problems in health care.",
    "Assignments were relevant. Lectures were usually great. There were 1 or 2 topics that were a bit dry. Guest lecturers were generally pretty good. Overall the class was great - there is a lot of insight into hospital administration and policy and also governmental policy issues that were addressed. The class is very practical.",
    "I think this course is fabulous!",
    "Course should not be called \"Hospital Epidemiology\" but rather \"How to be a Hospital Infection Preventionist\". I would recommend this course to people who are perusing an MD or intend to work in a hospital.",
    "The course format was excellent, and an extensive number of topics were covered. The selection of guest speakers, homework assignments, and the group project were all designed to give students a thorough learning experience. The group debate was an especially effective way to discuss and present issues related to hospital epidemiology.",
    "I liked the design of the class. The cases studies were the most informative and interesting. Guest speakers were good.",
    "Overall, the course was very good. The course presented important information as to infection prevention in health care settings, mainly from the perspective of the hospital epidemiologist. This included all of the departments the infection preventionist works with such as microbiology lab, engineering, and environmental services, as well as following the rules, regulations, and guidelines from organizations such as The Joint Commission, OSHA, CDC, etc. The hospital tour was definitely helpful for students who are unfamiliar with a hospital setting and especially viewing it from an infection preventionists' standpoint. One of the weaknesses is that the material wasn't reinforced very well such that questions on the final were not clear. Even working in groups was not particularly helpful for some questions.",
    "Very good practical course in understanding the challenges faced by hospitals in understanding nosocomial infections, very well structured and understandable. Assignments were modest and practical, giving real life experiences in case studies. If you want to know about hospital epi, this is a well designed class to do so!",
    "Fantastic course.",
    "This was an excellent course. No major weaknesses - but could maybe be improved by splitting it up into two classes per week instead of one.",
    "Incredible class. Organized quite thoroughly. I think the class needs a textbook, rather than handouts.",
    "This was a great course that gave a lot of very practical information. I feel like I have enough information to be able to communicate with someone in the field of hospital epi.",
    "I really liked the hospital tour! That truly was a great way to learn about issues in the hospital. Perhaps the leaders could be better informed on what we are supposed to see. I felt that they could not adequately answer our questions.I also really liked the guest speakers.A suggestion would be to have a small break in the middle of class.",
    "It has a wide variety of students; EMD, HPA, HM, CDE. Therefore, it is not as EMD focused as other classes, there is a lot of policy involved.-Still a very good class",
    "I thought the real world perspective was excellent- it wasn't just theory. The final project was also really informative. The pro-con format wasn't good, since we are master manipulators of facts and were misleading at times. Having a single team do both the pro and cons would be better, especially if they had to choose a side after the policy analysis. Some of the guest lectures, particularly the one on laboratory testing, was a bit too technical. I'm not going to remember 90% of those drug names.",
    "The combination of guest lecturers, hospital tour, slides, readings, and assignments created a robust and enjoyable class. This was an introductory class, but I think all of the assignments were relevant and useful.Strengths: guest lecturers, and perfect amount, type, and schedule of assignments - really well done this way.Weaknesses: We ran out of time on group presentationsSuggestions: In addition to the hospital tour, it would have been really amazing to sit in on a hospital meeting about nosocomial infections, how they are handled, what new regulations need to be accomdated for, how they will be dealt with and who will be responsible for them. Department managers seem to be a critical component of a successful infection prevention strategy therefore it would have been valuable to hear from one of them as well as the laboratory specialist.",
    "I thought that the homework and group assignments were very useful for real world hospital infection control practice. Each lecture had a concrete concept which was being explored however some of the guest lecturer\u0092s topics were not as in depth."

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Doctor Dembry is undoubtedly very knowledge in her field as a hospital epidemiologist. She presents material based on her knowledge and experience and invites professionals from other areas to speak on other topics, which provides a good balance for presenting the material. Although it is an advantageous for students to learn from Doctor Dembry's personal experiences from working at Yale New Haven Hospital, I feel that the class may benefit from learning beyond these experiences.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Very amazing, relaxed, and understandable. Her excellent personality was mirrored by her intelligence, and she was able to convey complex topics in an easily understandable fashion.",

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0This professor did a stellar job at addressing all of the unique interests of policy, epi, bio and other students. A represenative of each division mentioned they would have liked to hear more about the areas within their interest (e.g. I would have liked to learn more about policy) but these same students felt she addressed every topic adequately and as best as possible. Given some very tough critics at YSPH, this speaks VERY highly of the course.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Louise Dembry is a great instructor which good at making sure students question infection control practices and ideas. She is very knowledgeable in the field. She interacts with the students in a cordial way in class. She is very good at getting graded assignments with comments back in a timely fashion."
