   "comments": [
    "YES!! TAKE THIS CLASS!! It was a wonderfully taught class, that brought together a really diverse and rich body of peers--I learned so much from my classmates as well as from the professor. This class will give you a new perspective on literature and identity.",
    "I would recommend JDST 313 for anyone looking for a small, open-ended seminar that will require and allow for personal exploration and constant reading and participation in discussions. To take this class but not participate fully in it is to waste a wonderful opportunity.",
    "This is an interesting class on a rarely studied topic. The reading list was centered on the theme of personal identity, which helped students connect to the readings, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. I would recommend this course.",
    "Loved it. Chill easy seminar-style class. Do it",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It is VERY unique in its nature and it gives you a very good sample of a literature that is rarely studied as a whole. The discussions are lively and explore cultural idendtity issues while leaving the floor open to explore your own.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone -- especially those who don't know much about Latin American Jewish Literature. You learn a lot about identity and touch on subjects that relate to all of humanity.",
    "The course is an introduction to the genre of Jewish Latin American literature, with a variety of authors from countries such as Argentina and Brazil. While the course is framed by certain questions and issues, it is very flexible to address whatever students may be particularly compelled by. The authors are eclectic and fascinating, and the course includes literature that students may not read otherwise. It is a fabulous set of writers that I am glad to have been exposed to. I would recommend this course to any student interested in questions\/issues of hybrid identities, whether they are Jewish or Latin American or not. It was helpful to have students who were not Jewish or Latin American in the course, since it expanded the available perspectives in a neat way. This body of literature is an interesting case study for questions relevant to many different groups of people. For that reason, it is a valuable one for consideration."
