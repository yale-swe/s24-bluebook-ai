   "comments": [
    "This class mixes up your stereotypical class schedule. If you're afraid of horror movies you don't have to be afraid of this class. It's a fun but sophisticated take on an overlooked, underdog genre of film and literature.",
    "If you're interested in the genre of Horror and the uncanny, sure. I really enjoyed the readings and the films, though the class itself felt a bit long.",
    "This class has a wonderful thesis\/goal and a reading list that seems to engage the idea of the uncanny that is presented. You read some great books and watch some great movies. However, Lisa Beskin is by far the worst professor I have ever had. The class was horribly taught, was almost insulting to some of the books we read, and made me feel as if I was wasting 2 hours of my time each week. This class is almost worth it for the syllabus, but not quite due tothe disorganization and ineffective instruction of the professor.",
    "I think I would recommend this class to another student: it's interesting\/fun. I would just be aware that sometimes the two hour seminar tends to drag a little bit.",
    "CSBR 270 was a great course that covered some interesting ( and terrifying!) material. If you like the subject matter, you'll love the course. Professor Beskin isn't the most engaging of professors, but she's nice and very helpful. The class isn't very hard (two papers and two presentations) so you don't have to worry about the course load. If you like the material, take it - this is the only chances you'll get to study horror films by themselves, although I don't know if it will be offered again."
