   "comments": [
    "British Art & Landscape was a introduction to British landscape, with a focus on the British greats, such as Gainsborough, Turner, Wilson, and Constable. Going to the galleries was wonderful, since Martin could talk for hours on end about just about any picture in the museums we visited. I wasnt interested in British landscape (or art in general) before this class, but Ive found a new appreciation for it by taking this class. The field trips for the class are reason enough to do the Yale-in-London program. Youll walk in the footsteps of storied painters and at times line up their paintings with the modern landscape. By far, my favorite part of the semester was the field trip to Wales, where we walked in the footsteps of Wilson and Turner, climbed a mountain, and saw some of the most beautiful scenes in the country. Trust me, when you climb to the top of Cader Idris through the rain and the wind to see the most spectacular views in the UK, youll appreciate the importance of British landscape art in an incredible new light.",
    "BRST 177 is an immersive and stimulating class that will teach you how to analyze, discuss, and appreciate British art. I highly recommend it."
