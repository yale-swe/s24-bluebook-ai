    "We learned about how to measure, track, map, & evaluate source emissions for indoor & outdoor air pollution. We learned about the biological effects & negative environmental consequences of air pollution & strategies to reduce source emissions & human exposure. Throughout the course we wrote-up five separate lab reports & in-doing-so we learned to analyze & manipulate a multitude of data from PM-air monitor sensors. We got familiar using excel for data manipulation & got to use a bit ArcGIS for spatial mapping of the data.",
    "I gained fundamental knowledge about air pollution sources, rates of emissions, human and environmental effects, etc. This course also teaches one the skills to be able to conduct air pollution based field work and research semi-independantly.",
    "Gained a thorough understanding of air pollution and how it relates to public health",
    "I gained a great understanding of how air pollution is viewed and tackled by members of the public health community.",
    "Working knowledge of air pollution & exposure, ability to think spatially about airborne pollution and how to make this science and solutions accessible to the public",
    "I learned how to deploy a low cost sensor, and i now know a lot more about air pollution"

    "I learned more than I expected in this class!",

    "I absolutely loved this class! I found the lectures engaging, the lab reports difficult but educational, & the professor amazing!nMost definitely one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. My only complaint is that there were so many assigned readings which ended up not being necessary to do. I found the papers that I did read very interesting, so I wish there would have been less readings assigned, but possibly more necessary to actually read.",
    "The hands-on experience was great! Perhaps an improvement could lie in learning a bit more about ArcGIS and each function we would be using before jumping into the GIS labs, however.",
    "Really great and engaging labs! Sometimes the instructions can be unclear but Dr. Pollitt is very responsive and helpful",
    "The lab work was a fantastic way to apply what we were learning in class and I liked being able to use the PA monitors. Prof. Pollitt is also a fantastic lecturer and so each class was engaging.",
    "Strengths: flow of the course, depth of analysis, engagement in labs Weaknesses: Did not feel like most of the class readings were immediately relevant to class discussion",
    "strength: a lot of hands on labs and students were really engaged weakness: maybe add some discussion to the lectures"

    "Great course!",
    "If you are interested in air pollution and public health take this class!! The prof. gives enough background on each subject that it should be accessible to most students.",
    "Be able to synthesize scientific knowledge from multiple angles",
    "try to start your lab earlier, because it may take longer than a day to finish"
