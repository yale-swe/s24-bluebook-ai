   "comments": [
    "A little slow and may not cover as much material as other similar classes, but professor is genuinely one of the nicest people ever. All work is very reasonable.",
    "Interesting material. Not organized in a particularly digestible manner though. Stat 110 online from Harvard has a better organizational structure. Harry is very engaging and is phenomenal in office hours. Seriously, go to office hours and you will learn the material very well (in addition to receiving answers to hw questions if you can't figure them out).",
    "A solid course. Definitely work, but the textbook is good. Professor Zhou is enthusiastic. Take it with a friend.",
    "I'd recommend it to someone who has some experience in math and is interested in learning about the basis for a lot of what is done in other stats classes.",
    "STAT 241 is a pretty cool intro course on probability theory. Some of the material can be daunting, and probability was never my favorite, but Harry teaches it well and is very willing to help explain any concept or problem. You will want to have taken some calculus (understand integrals and derivatives) and, at the very end, basic understanding of matrix multiplication.",
    "A necessary evil if you're a stats or applied math major. The concepts are interesting, but you'd never know that just by going to lecture. Most of the time is spent on algebra and calculus-intensive proofs, and there is no continuity between topics so it is difficult to see how material relates. Try to work on problem sets before office hours. Exams were difficult and had nothing to do with the homework. Make sure to study whatever you learn the week\/lecture directly before the exam.",
    "This class wasnt terrible, but it wasnt amazing either. The material is interesting stuff, but the professor was really disorganized in class, which was hard to follow, especially when he skipped through slide really fast at the end of lecture. I wish I had shopped STAT 238 in addition to this class before committing to it, because the students in that class seemed to grasp the material much better than those who took 241.",
    "I would recommend MATH 241 if you need it for other courses in stats. It's a good foundation. Not saying that it will be the most spectacular course--it just gets the job done.",
    "It's a good class.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. The stuff is wayy to theoretical to be useful.",
    "I would highly recommend STAT 241, especially with Professor Zhou. I am not a person who has an intuitive sense of probability, so I knew going into the class that I would find it difficult; however, it was also exceptionally well-taught and one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I left the class feeling like I had actually learned material that I would find useful for the rest of my life. Professor Zhou is a funny and engaging lecturer, and he is really good at explaining the complicated concepts. He is also willing to answer questions during lectures and slow down his pace if we are doing a complicated proof. The problem sets were very doable, especially with all of the available help, and the exams were tough but manageable. Overall, this class was challenging, but I really glad I took it.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. It's not easy, and you don't learn much. Take STAT 238 with Joe Chang instead.",
    "This class was not as good as I had hoped it would be. Maybe I just didn't connect well to the material, but as someone who is hoping to major in statistics, I had really hoped to enjoy\/learn from this course. I didn't see how a lot of the material would be applicable. I also really struggled with the concepts because I did not feel like they went in a logical order and were not taught clearly. It was assumed that we knew what things were before they were introduced. The tests were difficult to prepare for because there was so much material and I had no clue what could be covered. The midterm distribution was 35% of the class above 95% and 30% below 65%, which was made it clear that a lot of the class was not understanding the material the way it was being taught. The pace of the class was also very fast when we went over the big, important concepts, and then we went thoroughly through the proofs, which I didn't feel was helpful because I didn't know what the proofs were for. I would suggest other students take STAT 238 because I heard that it was more thorough. I also had to watch lectures from the Harvard professor of the equivalent course to better grasp the material, which was sad because I expected to have an equal standard of education at Yale. He better explained the concepts and taught them in a more logical order.",
    "Not a bad class but not the best i've ever taken. It's very easy for a maths major. the textbook is awful.",
    "Course structure is very clear. Prof Zhou puts lots of effort into the slides. If you struggle through the homework, office hours is very helpful. For a Math major, this is a gut, so you might as well take STAT238 and learn a little bit more computing. Lectures aren't very engaging either. If you took Math230-231, you might be better off reading the textbook on your own.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in statistics.",
    "I would recommend it if one is pursuing more advanced classes in statistics or applied math. If one solely needs a QR credit, maybe it would be good to take an intro course instead. Regardless, this is a good class.",
    "Overall this course was pretty mediocre. I would not recommend it to someone who does not have to take it for their major. The lectures were difficult to understand, and the psets were not particularly interesting.",
    "Exactly how it sounds-- very theoretical",
    "I'd recommend this class -- as someone coming from a quantitative social science background, I found this class to be an engaging and helpful introduction to probability theory. It can be a little dry at times (especially at 9:25am on a Friday), but Harry does a good job of matching his lecturing to the energy in the room. As a bonus: this course begins to show some of the interconnections between probability and statistics that makes it a really beautiful branch of mathematics!",
    "Definitely recommend if you are interested in the subject",
    "I took it for my major. Very dry, proof-based course that made no effort to discuss real-world applications. Homeworks only covered a small part of lecture and the final being worth 50% of the grade was sort of stressful. Overall, decent.",
    "Basically a good probability course. No applications and nothing exciting, but it'll get you through various properties of various distributions. I've heard 238 is more fun. 241 is not hard if you know what you are doing but everyone gets a perfect score on the exams.",
    "Overall this class was a bit disappointing. Professor Zhou is an amazing person who really does care about his students and who really makes an effort to make his lectures interesting and to learn his students names. However, the lectures are very disorganized and it often feels as if youre jumping from one topic to the next. This lack of clear organization and the fact that important points were often omitted made it difficult to understand the connections between various lectures and gain a deeper knowledge of probability. That being said, the material is very interesting and applicable to a wide range of fields.",
    "Take the course with Prof. Zhou. It's really good. It provided an intuitive understanding of statistics that was much easier to swallow than a more engineering-bent course I had taken a semester before.",
    "No one is taking this class if they don't have to; get through it.",
    "This is a great course, and is not particularly difficult. Definitely take if interested in having a strong mathematical background in probability.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in probability or statistics. It is a basic and theoretical class that anyone interested in statistics should take.",
    "This class is more proof-based than I expected and teaches the methods behind probability-solving techniques. It's difficult, but rewarding and enlightening.",
    "An interesting but difficult survey course. The lectures have a lot of proofs, but the problem sets and tests are more on the applications side."
