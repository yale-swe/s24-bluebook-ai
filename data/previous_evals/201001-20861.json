    "In Ethics and Human Nature, you will explore the Augustinian ideas of the Fall and sin, how this legacy has evolved and its ramifications on how we pursue ethics and theology today. A few dissenting voices will be considered. Whether or not you agree with the Augustinian legacy, it is a major part of how Christian ethics are framed and taught at YDS and important to consider and understand how it is at play in questions today. I would recommend it, with the warning that it will have a mostly traditional approach, and favor a particular kind of scholarship.",
    "Yes, both of the professor are proficient, engaged and amiable. It is a pleasure to learn with them.",
    "Definitely a superb course for anyone interested in the topic. I would recommend it to anyone interested in theology, ethics, or phenomenology.",
    "Not if it is structured in exactly the same way. See above",
    "Yes, if they are interested in reading seminal texts in Christian ethics. If not, I would not recommend it.",
    "I feel like I did not get as much out of the course as I hoped to. The professors are both great, as is the reading, but class discussion did not come together, and it was difficult to engage the course. I would be reluctant to recomend it to another student for these reasons.",
    "Yes",
    "Reading a lot of texts that were influenced by the Augustinian tradition. I would not recommend this course, unless it is directly relevant for the area of focus within their degree.",
    "Ethics isn't my field so I don't know. But the class seemed too elementary for an advanced seminar (McFague, Cavanaugh, etc) and too sprawling for anyone without a comprehensive knowledge of Augustine to track with. There is a certain kind of student that I would probably recommend it too.",
    "I would explain that it is a course in Protestant theologies of ethics and human nature. If they were interested in what Protestant theology had to say about the implications of human nature for ethics, I would strongly recommend the course.",
    "Yes definitely",
    "Yes, given that certain changes were made regarding class size and structure of classtime. Otherwise, I would say that the readings are good, but discussion could be hit or miss."

   "comments": [
    "The class helped me to see more clearly how a dominant strand in Western Christian thought continues to play a role in theology and ethics today. I am interested in ethical frameworks that encompass more than just the Christian view, especially a traditional one, and this class helped me to understand better some of the challenges in that, and to really examine the relationship between my theology and ethics. I think this will continue to be foundational.",
    "It helped me to better know what I was getting into as I continue to pursue ethics.",
    "I greatly enjoyed reading City of God and Niebuhr.",
    "By being exposed to a variety of texts from various viewpoints and time periods.",
    "It was worth while to see two excellent professors like Outka and Simmons in action. But the course itself did not contribute very much to my future research. Some of the readings did, but not all.",
    "it was very relevant to my field",
    "Spending a semester on Augustine and interpretations of him is very important training for both ethics and theology. As an MAR in historical theology, this was excellent for helping to establish that necessary foundational familiarity."
