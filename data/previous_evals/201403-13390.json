   "comments": [
    "I'm not a super \"mathy\" person, but this class was wonderful. It's amazing how useful the knowledge you gain from this class is in many of the other courses you take here, as well as in life in general. A really good, and not too soul-crushingly difficult, way to get a QR credit.",
    "If one is considering statistics and is interested in Political Science applications, take this! Problem sets are easily done with help. JDRS's humor is touch-and-go, but ultimately, the decision to go to lectures is dependent on the students. I definitely believe that it helps.",
    "If you survive the first eight weeks, the next five will be worthwhile.",
    "Take it, should get a decent grade in it, worth your time.",
    "If you want to learn Stat for poly sci, take it. In general, it helps understand the basics for a number of poly sci papers and I would advise taking it just to save time on reading those papers. Not the best class ever, but good enough to survive and not super hard. Take it if you need to learn stat or need a QR, not really a class just for fun.JDRS is funny and Biggers was dry but adequate.",
    "Good class and good stuff to know. The poly sci section was good and can be applicable to the real world.",
    "Stats is a very useful class, and I definitely recommend it for most people. Stats for polisci was good but hard to compare to the other sections. Problem sets and exams are all reasonable amounts of work.",
    "I think statistics is the most useful math one can learn so I would always recommend the class. But I would explain that it is hard at first but once you get the hang of the technical things, it becomes easier to understand and apply.",
    "Good intro course for statistics. JRS is a boss and makes the first 8 weeks of the class enjoyable. For the 102 section, Professor Biggers' straight-foward style of teaching lends itself well to the material. You feel prepared for the final and finish the course feeling like you actually learned something.",
    "Stat 102 is a good intro stat course, especially for people interested in poly sci. Many of the reviews recommend staying in Stat 103 (social science) to stay with JRS but I found that the smaller class size of 102 and the more example-based curriculum made it much more pleasant than my time with the whole class",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. It was very interesting and gave me a deeper understanding of both statistics and political science.",
    "It's such a gut, but you learn a decent amount given how gutty it is. It's a fairly good introduction to statistics.",
    "I would recommend this class because it covers the basics very well and the second part of the course helps to reinforce these basics in a more interesting way.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, especially the political science section. It's not difficult, but it's also not for slackers. You need to study for the exams and pay attention to be able to do the problem sets. Overall, the exams are extremely fair if you are prepared."
