    "Never in a million years",
    "If you have to take it, then fine. Otherwise, don't torture yourself.",
    "Aaa. This will be the most honest review you will read. During the fall term, I took Orgo 220 with Ellman. The class was great. Spring term, I took Orgo 221 with Crawford. Crawford is a great teacher and a great guy. This course, Orgo 2, however, was Biochemistry disguised as Orgo 2. We used the textbook we used, \"Organic Chemistry of Biological Pathways\". I would have preferred to stick with the Loudon book that we used in Orgo 1 with Ellman. So this class really isn't Orgo 2, it's more Biochemistry. The topics we learned in Orgo 2 were really cool, however, and very interesting. But we learned every step of glycolysis, TCA Cycle, Urea cycle, Amino Acid catabolism, Fatty Acid synthesis, Nucelotide Biosynthesis, etc. Yes, there were broader concepts within the context of these very specific topics, but a lot of the time students found themselves memorizing specific mechanisms for the midterms, which wasn't always fun. At least I feel extremely prepared for Biochem now.",
    "You'll like it if you put in the work!",
    "if you take orgo 2, then you have to take it, so I'm not sure if this is a very helpful question in this case",
    "It's painful, but chances are you have to take it. When you get the mechanisms, you'll feel really proud of yourself that you've actually learned something, but there is a lot that you'll probably have to teach yourself. I honestly hope Corey is still TF'ing this class, otherwise, well, you'll probably be in trouble.",
    "It was a hard class, not as straightforward as Chem 220. If you don't need to take it, I honestly wouldn't recommend it. It is possible to do well with sufficient practice of the material.",
    "Take it if you need to, but otherwise avoid it. You learn a lot but it is a good amount of work. The TA is a game changer, so try to find one that will be committed to helping you and is engaged with the course.",
    "I would only take this class of you absolutely must. It was horribly taught and organized and extremely frustrating.",
    "Fine class.",
    "I liked Orgo 1, I did not love this course. But you probably have to take it, and you'll be fine.",
    "It was fine, you are going to have some work to do, but it is manageable and not as bad you would think.",
    "CHEM 221 feels similar to biochemistry. There isn't really an option when it comes to taking orgo for a lot of STEM majors. The class teaches a lot of interesting material, and it actually left me wanting more to be taught. The class is not as bad as some people may say it is, and if you put the work in, you will definitely get what you want out of the course.",
    "I actually really liked the subject matter better than Orgo I, and it all pulls together by the middle of the semester. However, read the evals for the prof you take it with carefully, bc this semester, the course felt really unstructured. I was disappointed and felt like I could have learned more otherwise.",
    "This is a very challenging course -- the material is completely applied, making it both difficult and engaging.",
    "Second semester Orgo, take it if you like it\/have to!",
    "Chem 221 is a decent standard orgo 2 class. Crawford does a good job of being clear about the mechanisms but additional practice is key to doing well. The exams were very challenging at first but the later ones were more reasonable.",
    "This class is really more biochem. Beware of the disorganized nature and the midterms! One is dropped, so they shouldn't stress you out, but the averages were often sadly low and time will be your enemy. Ask your TA's for extra problems, and be sure to go to the reviews to receive a coherently organized list of the material. Crawford is alright at explaining the chemistry but you need organized supplementals with names, vocab, and comparisons to stay on track., It's not uninteresting, just at times disheartening.",
    "CHEM 221 was a course that studied the organic chemistry mechanisms behind basic metabolic pathways such as glycolysis. I would recommend CHEM 221 with hesitation because it was very confusing and not very well organized. It turned out to be very memorization heavy in terms of the mechanisms, which is something I wish I had known earlier about the course.",
    "i mean you probs just have to take it this was more interesting than a typical orgo 2 class but you'll definitely learn material that is not quite classic orgo 2 and more biochem",
    "its orgo II, youll hate it or like it, but you gotta take it",
    "Tough class, not one I would take unless I absolutely had to. The material is difficult but definitely interesting as well.",
    "Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this class. It's biased towards more biochemistry than orgo II and this class is really not structured that well and the tests aren't indicative of the material you learn. This class was really stressful and overall not a pleasant experience. If another teacher is teaching it, give it a shot, but I wouldn't recommend taking this class.",
    "It was a good course to understand the building blocking of biological processes and is probably very helpful to take before Biochemistry. I would recommend students be wary of its difficulty beforehand and make sure that they put time in the course.",
    "You must go to class. You must do practice problems outside of what is provided. You must work with others to learn the material. If you can do this, you will learn a lot from this class.",
    "CHEM 221 provides a great overview of organic chemistry with a biological emphasis.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. It's a difficult class that requires a lot of memorizing until you learn it well.",
    "Take if needed"
