   "comments": [
    "Yes, do it. Interesting, informative though not necessarily the best thing for an experienced musician.",
    "Professor Tomlinson is the best. Take a class from him. The class was fantastic music history course. The reading was totally manageable, the essays were fun, and the listening\/watching outside of class was not too much. He was the best lecturer\/speaker I've ever had at Yale. Totally fascinating.",
    "Opera was a great overview of the history of opera that introduced me to a variety of operatic styles. The course improved my writing while at the same time introducing me to concepts that are valuable for understanding how to best perform and understand opera. At the same time, the class had a very manageable workload. I would recommend the course to any student interested in improving their writing or in learning more about opera.",
    "This is one of the jewels of Yale College, and one of the best courses I've ever experienced. If one only has a modicum interest in music, or believes one only appreciated classical and not opera, I would strongly recommend taking Prof. Tomlinson's course. He has a masterful way of communicating and infecting his own enthusiasm for the subject. It is hard not to get hooked on the genre.",
    "Yes! Take this class if you're at all interested in opera and haven't studied it before. Professor Tomlinson is one of the premiere musicologists in the country (which I didn't realize until the end of the semester) but doesn't take himself too seriously at all. He makes the material extremely interesting and accessible, particularly with the clips of operas he shows in class. He also occassionally sings soprano parts, which is fun for all. The paper topics are a tiny bit vague at first, but if you go to office hours and discuss them for a few minutes he's usually very good at pointing you in the right direction.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class as a great way to learn a lot about opera. Professor Tomlinson is wonderful and it was great to have listening to a beautiful opera as homework.",
    "This was a great course. I took it mainly because it is both a music department elective and a writing credit rather than because I had much interest in opera, but I found the coursework and material fascinating. The professor was excellent, and I wish I could take another semester of opera with him.",
    "This is a wonderful course, and you should definitely take it if you are interested in opera, not matter how casual your interest. Prof. Tomlinson is highly engaging and has a great gift for making the material accessible to the musically inexperienced without shortchanging the music majors, a balance that is very hard to strike.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in learning about opera! You won't regret it.",
    "This course would make a good fifth class. The workload consisted of watching opera excerpts and writing three extremely short papers. If you take it, do actually complete the listening assignments (in advance of the classes)-- doing so was extremely helpful and the best way to get the most out of the class."
