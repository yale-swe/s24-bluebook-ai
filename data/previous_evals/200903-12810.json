   "comments": [
    "I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested to brush up on their French. Who wouldn't?",
    "French 140 provides a helpful continuation of 130. I enjoyed the texts that we read; the workload never seemed excessive (given that the class is 1.5 credits) or unnecessary to my study of French; and Mme. Koundi is friendly and accessible. My French is much better after this past semester.",
    "It's a mid-level French class...if you're studying French, you have to take it. However, it's a solid class, covering pretty much everything you'd need to learn at that point, and greatly helping with reading comprehension.",
    "A good test to decide how seriously you want to take French at Yale. The course gets progressively more difficult as the semester carries on. I would recommend it for students in L3.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a studnt who has been place into this course. It is really not that bad and can be one of your most enjoyable classes at Yale.",
    "Much less devoir than L3... the redactions are longer but much more interesting! Every morning gets a little old though.",
    "Though most people would be taking this class because of a language credit, I would probably recommend this class to others just trying to improve their french language skills.",
    "It's a pretty normal french class. Probably a bit better than average, but the decision to take it is fairly easy. If you want to learn french, it's a good class and decently interesting. If this is not an aspiration of yours, probably not such a good idea.",
    "If you like french I don't think you will be disappointed with the course.",
    "French 140 was the perfect class for solidification of more advanced grammar before moving in L5 classes. Madame Koundi is wonderful, friendly and accessible, and very clear in grammar. Although most of the readings were not very cheerful, they were all very good and overall the class was wonderful, a very good dynamic in the room. I feel prepared to move to higher levels of french fluency, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants grammar solidification as well as enjoyable cultural and textual exposure.",
    "Unless you have to take it or you plan on continuing French through level 5, don't take it-- you'll learn just enough to kind of have a conversation, but you couldn't actually be very functional in a French speaking country."
