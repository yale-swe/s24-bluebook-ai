    "Architecture 260 is a history course focusing on one work or sometimes one architect per lecture. There are weekly one-page reading responses, a midterm paper, and a final paper that can be an expansion upon the midterm paper. I would definitely recommend the course if you're interested, whether or not you're an architecture major. I also think it complements junior studio well.",
    "only if you are an arch major, pretty boring otherwise",
    "Meh. If you have the right TA, section can be pretty awesome. If you're an architecture major, you have to take it. Be warned: lecture will be a drag.",
    "It is a good complement to introduction to architecture.",
    "Great class, of you are remotely interested in the subject take it without a doubt. However, this is a class that will give back as much as you put in, but if you put in the appropriate time and effort the results are highly satisfying.",
    "Only if they are majoring in Architecture. It's open to anyone, but I don't think it's interesting. It wasn't a class that I thought changed me at all, or made me think about anything in a new way, and you're able to get through it doing minimal readings and lecture isn't related to the assignments (2 papers on a topic of your choice)",
    "A necessary evil.",
    "This is a pretty good course; history's generally not my thing but Professor Sherer makes it very entertaining - he focuses on a lot of the personalities of the architects and artists. The only grades are two pretty open papers, and reading responses and section participation. The amount of reading is totally reasonable (<40 pgs a week generally) and generally pretty interesting (Giorgio Vasari<3). I wish we had had a real rubric of what Prof. Sherer wanted from the papers at midterm, but by the final paper you pretty much figure it out (go to his office hours! He will recommend so many helpful books to you!) If you're an arch major, you have to take this class, but it'll be one of the more relaxing required courses you have.",
    "Not bad, workload is not bad either, reading responses each week and two papers. It's a narrow but nice survey of architecture history.",
    "A general survey of architecture pre-1700. Perhaps not appropriate for graduate students.",
    "Although the periods covered are well worth knowing about, the lectures are not very fact based. Only take it if you need to for the major.",
    "I kind of regret taking this class. Sure, the material is interesting, but by the end of the semester, most of the students had stopped attending class. The class wasn't very intellectually stimulating.",
    "Not unless you're an architecture major.",
    "I think it depends on whether you are interested in the subject or not. The lectures were chock full of interesting facts and gushing praises for each piece of architecture. Really makes you appreciate every building. Prof Sherer is extremely knowledgeable about the subject, and many things in general. The lectures though were quite dramatic and sometimes overly so. What made the course for me was my TA, Russell, who was super awesome. Make sure you talk to Professor Sherer about your paper though, because he is very particular about what sources you use and what you write about and how you write, even if he says you can do whatever you want with the paper.",
    "The course is interesting only for someone very interested in the subject from an academic point of view. Professor Sherer knows everything about everything architectural history related. He is a very animated lecturer, often over the top. Be sure to meet with him before writing any paper because he has very specific standards! This is very important, because if you are too speculative in your paper you will not get a good grade!",
    "If you're an architecture major, you have to take this course. And I'm convinced you'll learn something if you really want to, because a lot of important information is covered in lectures and through readings. The problem was I felt the lectures were erratic and dispersed. I could never really grasp anything, I felt, and it's easy to zone out as Sherer goes on and on. Maybe more background information would have been necessary. Since I had never taken an art history course before, I felt like a lot of the information and details didn't stick because I didn't have a solid base of knowledge in the first place. Reading responses were kind of a headache to do, because the readings also felt all over the place (like, meaningful, but like, how do I file this information away and remember it somehow? How is it relevant?). You write a midterm paper on any topic (which could be fun, and I learned a lot just writing it) which can then be extended for your final paper, so not that much work at all, though quite a few people had problems with his grading. Strange class."
