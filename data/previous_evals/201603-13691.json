   "comments": [
    "I learned about approaches for designing and diagnosing control systems (mostly PID in feedback and feedforward control loops) using dynamic and steady-state models of the system. It was a nice combination and application of previous classes like differential equations, transport phenomenon, fluid mechanics, and chemical kinetics and reactors. The insight left by this course is a better conceptual understanding of how mathematical properties can be leveraged to predict and interfere with physical systems (e.g. analyzing the response to different kinds of disturbances) and where these mathematical models might break down. I especially appreciated the exposure to Simulink in this course."

   "comments": [
    "Solid course, very little room for improvement",
    "I kind of talked about the strengths of this course in the question about the knowledge and skills it develops so I will focus on where it might be improved. Although this course worked toward bridging the conceptual gap between math\/equations as abstract constructs and math as a tool for engineers to use in analysis an design, the psets and exams sometimes got too buried in the mechanics of problem solving. There were very interesting pset questions, but unless you followed up with questions during office hours, it wasn't always clear what the interesting takeaway was. The course was quite challenging, but I think one could do well through rote memorization and plugging and chugging. The mechanics of solving a problem, going through the math etc. are important too, but it would be nice if some more time was spent developing skills for approaching an unfamiliar problem i.e. here's a system that we've never seen before, but it's kind of similar to this multiple tank problem that we did before. How can we represent it with equations? What kind of behavior do we want from the equations? Finally, I think an application-focused project would have been fun. Maybe we could design an inverted pendulum control system from scratch, tune it using simulink, and then even build a first prototype. (or something with tanks like in a redox flow batery setup or something). The workload for this course is on the heavy-side, (but very fair) so I don't know how to squeeze such a project into the semester. I just wish that the senior year chemE courses would give us more exposure to real problem solving and start to move away from the traditional pset question and answer structure."

    "You will only take this class if you are ABET ChemE. Make sure you have Loewenberg!",
    "This course is probably required for you, lol. But if you like math-based engineering and running simulations then it's a really fun class! A good introduction to control systems and modeling physical systems in general (though controlling the fluid height and flow through various tanks seems to be the favorite example b\/c that's traditional ChemE)"
