    "Not too bad . . . the exams were all open notes and the material wasn't too difficult.",
    "If you need to take it, take it. If you're just curious (like I was) and you've already taken AP Physics C, then you won't learn too much more in this class.",
    "The decision to take 180 should be based on the professor teaching it. I had to take the class for my major, but if this is not the case, make sure that you take a physics class that has an engaging professor.",
    "This class is kind of like AP Physics C at a very fast pace. The beginning of the semester was really easy, but the class quickly picked up the pace to the point where later chapters were sometimes confusing. Homework is a pain mostly because there are typos, but the tests are surprisingly short. Professor Easter is an eccentric and energetic guy, but he spends half the class deriving formulas instead of going over how to use them properly.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a not particularly difficult introductory physics course. If you want to be a physics major this course is not for you. Otherwise this is probably a good choice. There is not too much work. Look at who the professor is and shop the other sections.",
    "Honestly, lectures weren't that helpful and toward the end there weren't many people going, but the clicker questions at the end of lecture were kind of cool.",
    "Ugh. Take it if you have to. Easier than 200 and probably more interesting than 150.There wasn't as much calculus with Easther as I hoped there would be. Clickers needed to be more prominently featured. Material is really boring. I had trouble motivating myself.",
    "Take it if you are not a slacker (150) but don't want to major in physics (200).",
    "Clicker questions are fun, but the professor did NOT give clear lectures. He was a jolly man, but he would just pass over the parts where he wasn't sure instead of acknowledging his mistakes. Students could rarely follow the lecture by the end. He often made things more complicated than they needed to be. I learned mostly through the problem sets and consulting with friends.",
    "Do not take it, take 160 or 200 instead",
    "I would tell any student to shop Physics 200 and 150. Don't assume it's best to take the middle ground with 180. It's a pain in the butt. I don't recommend intro physics courses in general because they are annoying, sometimes difficult, and encompassing too much information.",
    "PHYS 180 was decent with Professor Easther, though I feel that I did not really learn a lot in the course. Everything is covered on a very superficial level. The workload was very reasonable though as there was only six problems assigned each week. Take this class if you need it for your major, but otherwise I would not consider it. Tests are more of a time crunch than anything else. Professor Easther is an okay professor, but makes mistakes all the time. Furthermore, he is not very good at explaining concepts, but tries.",
    "I wouldn't take it with this guy...",
    "if you need a year of intro physics and have only taken 1 year of physics in high school, it's definitely doable. i wouldn't voluntarily take it though.",
    "PHYS 180 is a pretty good introductory physics class, which I expect to get better as Prof. Easther has more experience. Unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing because, after the first few days, I thought it was going to be a great class, but it didn't quite live up to that. It really is mostly \"chalk and talk\" and the new teaching methods (clickers) are only marginally integrated into the course. Overall though, I would recommend it for someone who already has some physics experience.",
    "Phys 180 was a good intermediate physics course. Yes, I would recommend Phys 180 to a premed student because it was a challenging physics course.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless someone had to take it for major requirements.",
    "Actually, no, not really, at least not for a grade. I figure if you are reallyinto physics, you need to prioritize it and take PHYS200. Otherwise, this course was frustrating. It's faster to learn the material other sources that more fully explicate the concepts before being forced to apply them shot-in-the-dark. The exams were timed problem sets (applications). There were confusing typos or ambiguous wordings in everything.",
    "Avoid this class if possible when Easther teaches it.",
    "Your Physics 180 experience will vary widely depending on who's teaching it. If Richard Easther ever teaches it again, I would strongly recommend doing either 150, if your major allows it, or 200, if you have the math background. Easther is not a bad person, but his lectures are nearly impossible to follow, and will probably bore you to death. And you can't stay home either, because the clicker questions force you to go to at least 90% of them. But the workload wasn't that bad--psets, especially the online ones, were really short-- and the tests were open-note, so if these are your priorities, consider taking 180.",
    "I would recommend this course if you feel as though you are prepared for it. It is not a class to joke with.",
    "Basic Intro Physics, right about on the level of difficulty of AB Physics in high school but more intense. Not really much calculus at all, just for derivations that the prof did. Not terribly exciting. Easther is great though- if you're going to take it with anyone he's the guy, really cares about his students a lot.",
    "If you've never really had physics before, this class can be trying.",
    "NO! DO NOT TAKE 180! (at least not with Professor Easther; I've heard it's okay with other professors)--if Easther ever teaches it again, don't take it! Not learning physics with calculus is a small price to pay for avoiding Easther; he makes errors constantly and gives completely unreasonable tests (in a class which is \"not curved\").",
    "Standard physics course. If you feel like you should be in 150, go with your gut. Weekly problem sets, 2 midterms, and a final.",
    "Physics 180 is a pretty advanced physics course, so if you only did a little bit of physics in school (back in sophomore year or something) then I'd recommend either brushing up really well on your math\/physics or just taking the regular level Physics course. With its advanced pace, though, students definitely had an opportunity to learn about a lot of topics and do some solid calculus (instead of just the tedious high school algebra) to arrive at solutions more efficiently. Overall a pretty rewarding experience if you're willing to put in the time and effort to making sure you read the textbook and do the problems.",
    "Do not take this course with Easther. You will be confused on EVERY pset and EVERY test, not because the physics is difficult, but rather because he words problems very poorly. Moreover, going to lecture is a waste because Easther spends the majority of his time on incomprehensible proofs that are not required for psets\/tests, but you still have to go to every class because of \"clicker questions\" that count toward your grade. Take a higher level course if you have a familiarity with math at all; you won't regret it.",
    "I'd recommend the class if you don't want to take 200 for whatever reason, and 150 is too easy for you. However, Professor Easther does not curve the class, and while his exams are fair (except for the disturbingly difficult final), it can be bad for you if you slip up more than once. All in all, the workload is certainly manageable, and the class was taught pretty well.",
    "It's an intro course, and a good one if you like solving problems and puzzles. It was cool to see the applications of multivariable calc, although that wasn't really a big part of the course. There was a lot of group work on problem sets and studying, which worked out really well for the most part. It's amazing how much you can accomplish just by talking to other students.",
    "Yes, but only if their major or pre-program requires it.",
    "I would take this course even if just because you are interested in Physics. Professor Easther made the lectures usually somewhat interesting and interactive.",
    "Easy. I think a lot of people felt this way.",
    "This class is very doable even if you aren't counting physics towards your major. I recommend taking this class even to just improve your basic science foundation.",
    "Only take this class if you have to for a requirement. Otherwise, it is kind of disengaging, and the lectures are nothing special.",
    "It's a not incredibly difficult physics class. Problem sets can be tricky sometimes, but tests are pretty fair. Richard Easther makes the class unnecessarily complicated sometimes, and you may feel like you knew some topics more intimately after high school physics than after this course.",
    "Again, a basic course in which you will learn everything required on the AP Physics B exam in high school. If you need to take physics here, take this course. And take it from Easther.",
    "It was a decent course but do not expect much outside help.",
    "If it is required, yes.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student who hasn't taken any physics before.",
    "Physics 180 is a very standard intro physics course. I found it very easy having had one year of physics B and 1 year of calc bc in high school. People who had less background in physics struggled a bit. Be prepared to work hard if you don't already know physics.Overall a solid class. Probably the one you want to take unless you want to be a physics major.",
    "Yes, if you need to take Physics, I would recommend this class. It's hard to compare levels during shopping period, since they all happen at the same time, but I would definitely take this over 200.",
    "If you've never taken physics, it moves pretty quickly. This is definitely a good course if you want to get on the fast track to a really solid foundation in physics.",
    "A good, painless immersion in the subject. Easther is a good professor and I felt like I learned the material pretty well. Problem sets aren't bad and tests are easy. That said, I wouldn't have taken it if I weren't premed.",
    "This course isn't a very heavy workload, and the lecture is often frivolous to attend. The material was interesting, to me at least, but it's not fantastically exciting unless you're looking at a major in the area or an easy science credit.",
    "Yep. However, be forewarned that the midterm tests are written for longer than a 50 minute test block, and was often frustrated at not being able to fully demonstrate my ability due to the lack of time.",
    "For students who have taken calculus and are non physics majors who need it as a pre-req this may be your best choice. Not frustratingly dumb or overly hard.",
    "Overall, this is a pretty straight forward course that will give you a good, basic understanding of physics. I definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys physics.",
    "This class is horrible. You should probably try to take 200 instead. Or maybe even drop down to 150. You don't learn much and you are constantly frustrated. Professor Easther can't write a problem set without making errors in it, and he never checks them before sending them out. You get emails at 11 pm the night before it's due with the corrections and then you have to redo problems. I hope he isn't allowed to teach this class again. The pre-class quizzes are frustrating and a waste of time. You should study a lot on your own if you want to learn anything. I recommend you watch these http:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/OcwWeb\/Physics\/8-01Physics-IFall1999\/CourseHome\/index.htm lectures because they are much better than the ones offered here and you will actually learn from and enjoy them. Good luck.",
    "If you took AP Physics and are interested in doing some calculus (but not much) in physics, this course will be good to satisfy prerequisites for science majors.",
    "Overall, this course was a half-decent introduction to many topics in physics. Richard Easther is very responsive and seems to help, but at other times just didn't present the material clearly enough in the first place. I know it is hard with a large class, but I really feel like he sometimes had no respect for the individual student.Strengths: The thrice-weekly quizzes did make me keep on top on the material more, and I appreciated that while the clicker questions made you go to class you could still miss one if you were sick.Weaknesses: The lectures were often loosely presented and hard to follow. It would help if there were additional demonstrations of nonintuitive concepts in class. Richard Easther did not check to see if there were flaws with the quizzes and problem sets before sending them out - there was unclear wording in problems and sometimes the math came out just plain wrong. The last-minute changes were terribly inconvenient when you have other work to do and when you already spent enough time on a problem set. I also didn't like how we were never introduced to the TAs except if you went to study hall - I would've liked an additional discussion section devoted to learning problem-solving techniquesrather than just answer-swapping sessions.I think it is good that this class is not curved - but at the same time it was hard to do well when many others in the class had already taken AP Physics BC - which is unfair for students who had not taken it in high school.",
    "Kind of fast paced review of introductory level physics. Students taking it have varying backgrounds in physics so it can be very easy or really challenging. Prof Easther is great though so if he's teaching it, I would at least shop this class before deciding between 150\/180\/200.",
    "Physics 180a is a good class for someone with some previous experience with physics. The workload is average. Clicker questions make the class more interactive than most lectures. Professor Easther was a high energy lecturer. He moved at a good pace and covered the material very well.He offered lots of opportunities for smaller group review and was clearly committed to helping each student do well.",
    "Umm...its physics 1.",
    "It depends on the instructor.",
    "Physics 180 is a basic introductory physics class. If professor Easther is teaching it again I would not recommend it. If you need to take an intro physics class and professor Easther is teaching 180 then I would say try another level. Once we got passed stuff I remembered from high school, I hardly ever understood what he was talking about. On the bright side, he's got a pretty cool New Zealand accent, but the novelty wears off and you realize that he is quite boring. If you do take the class I definitely recommend going to the study halls monday or tuesday nights for the problem sets.",
    "I would only take this class if it is necessary for a major. If you are a humanities major looking for a QR credit, I would consider other classes. There are many sophomores in this class that understand the material well, and should probably be in a higher level physics, while some of the freshmen are left behind. Professor Easther is not a very good lecturer, mainly because he doesn't show examples of problem solving methods or concepts, and only does derivations in class. If you can take this class with another professor, that may be ideal. The workload isn't so bad, just a problem set a week and two midterms. However, be prepared to read your physics textbook cover to cover to try to understand the concepts not covered well in lecture.",
    "This is a great introduction to classical physics that uses calculus. I would highly recommend it for any major!",
    "This course was awful. Not innately awful, it could have been made perfectly bearable with just a little more care from the TAs and the professor in making sure there werent mistakes everywhere.Other than that, the clickers were quite fun (you can always give them to a friend if you want to skip class) and it is supposed to be easier than 200. Professor goes through lots of derivations in class which are pointless to concentrate on because they are far too hard and not going to be on any of the tests. Pretty much stopped going to lecture by the end and taught myself out of the book.With intro physics I think its just a matter of picking your poison.",
    "I think that Physics 180, if it could be better organized, is a good course in that it goes at a pace which is not too strenuous.",
    "If you need it, do it. Isn't too bad, but you need to learn a lot on your own.",
    "Good Course!",
    "Only do this class if you have to. Consider taking Physics 150 or 200, as I am sure they are better taught that 180. The workload is manageable and the material is not difficult at all. You must expect, however, to rely on your own abilities as the professor does not really do an effective job of teaching the material.",
    "If you haven't taken much physics, expect to learn a lot on your own. The lectures weren't especially helpful. Even after the course, I don't feel I understand a great deal more about physics. If you have a strong physics background, this course probably won't be too difficult.",
    "simply put, if you took honors physics or AP Physics B, take this class. I took AP-B and I found 200 slightly too difficult even though i got a 5 on the B exam. If you took AP Physics C, 200 is probably perfect for you. I took ENAS 151 along with this class, and it was great as I will have the same professor (grober) for PHYS 181, the electricity second semester part of this physics class. the professor is a bad lecturer and we rush through material so you never really understand any of it but judge for yourself during shopping period... not necessarily a bad class, im taking it since i need it for my major. 200 and 260 will encourage more understanding, 180 more plug n chug.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you have taken physics already. The material in the course covers beyond AP physics so for people who haven't taken physics ever, this class goes a bit quickly.",
    "If you're up for it take 200. This wasn't a stellar class; it was ok, but nothing special.",
    "This is a good class. It makes more sense than 150, because the calculus adds a great extra dimension. Also, the clickers were a good incentive to come to class, and were some nice free marks.",
    "I would not recommend this unless you have a very very strong physics background it not easy to catch onto every concept and not much time is spent in order to foster that type of thought.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was not too difficult and the teacher was eager to help.",
    "I think Physics 180 is a good course. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to learn more about Physics and already have some background in calculus.",
    "It's a good course if you need Physics with calculus. However, be prepared to learn a lot of the concepts on your own, as well as how to apply them in problems.",
    "This class offered a pretty good survey of physics. Even if you have taken the AP Physics C class in high school, you will still learn quite a bit in this course, though it makes things easier in the beginning of the semester. Professor Easther is pretty understanding and the workload is manageable. PHYS 200 is much faster than this course so if you are choosing between the two (like I did), choose PHYS 180 if you are not amazingly comfortable with the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is willing to work hard to learn the course material. There is alot of information covered in the course, and alot of outside review is needed.",
    "This course is a good overview of mechanics and is not too difficult -- very similar to AP Physics. You don't have to know calculus at all, really, and the workload is average. Professor Easther is a very good professor -- dynamic and interesting, which is not always found in science lectures -- but can be a little hasty when it comes to constructing problem sets. If you think you've found an error in the warmups or problem sets, don't hesitate to e-mail him -- there were somewhat frequent mistakes in the ways the problems were written that led to confusion until someone brought them to his attention. Overall, though, I would take this course again, even if it were not required for my major.",
    "Definitely recommend. I dropped from 200 to 180 and it was a great decision. I feel like 180 is mostly for pre-meds or people with an interest in physics but are not deciding to major in it - most majors tend to take 200 or 260.",
    "Physics 180 with Professor Easther was somewhat difficult, but doable. The weekly problem sets were very useful, and the study halls helped a lot. The course was primarily based on derivations, which were not very useful. The clicker questions made the course more engaging and interesting, and they were easy ten percent of the grade if you show up to class. There were online warm - up quiz questions before each class, which were tricky and sometimes really annoying, but they helped me keep up with the class and at least look at the chapter and read some parts ahead of time, as opposed to none. The first midterm was very fair, the second was much harder, but the final was doable. Since there is no curve, there is much less competition and thus the atmosphere is more friendly and collaborative. Overall, the course was not as bad as I expected it to be from previous years evaluations. However, the professors change almost every year, so it's hard to predict what the upcoming years will be like.",
    "For those for whom this class is a prerequisite, take it with Prof Easther. 180 is not calculus intensive, as compared to 200 which would bog you down or 150 which is too light.",
    "I reccomend this class because the material is interesting and the overall grade breakdown (should) be fair.",
    "Standard physics class. Take if you want a good grasp on mechanics. Don't let the \"with calculus\" deter you; calculus is minimal, and one can get away with not doing much of it.",
    "A good basic intro physics class. Math based. the description in the blue book is pretty accurate. I found it quite challenging as someone who did not take high school physics, but doable.",
    "It's a calculus-based Physics course, and calculus is used in the proofs in class and in the book, and some in the homework, but I don't think it ever came up on the tests. So if you're taking it with Professor Easther, don't worry about it being super calculus-heavy. It's not a particularly hard class if you know some physics (which I think it assumes), but Easther does not do a very good job teaching a lot of the material. A nice guy, very smart, and great when he's talking about the importance of these physics topics on a philosophical level, but he's not at all clear when going through proofs and explaining the fundamentals. Grading is pretty nice. You get extra credit for using your clicker in class to answer questions, which also makes the class go by quicker. Homeworks are only a couple hours a week and count for something like 30%. Two tests and a final. Basically if you have a physics background I wouldn't shy away from this course, but it's nothing to rave about.",
    "To take this class you'll want to know Calculus 1 (how to find derivatives and antiderivatives) and it will have helped to have had some physics in high school.You can basically learn everything you need from the textbook, so check out the text to make sure you can study from it.Prof. Easther does a lot of complicated derivations and proofs on the board, so don't expect class to clear up any basic questions you have.",
    "This class is interesting, but to enjoy it you have to make sure you stay on top of your work and do all of the readings before lectures. If\/when you fall behind, it becomes a rather stressful class period as you struggle to understand what the symbols on the board may or may not stand for and how they relate to circular motion.",
    "A challenging class, but the concepts are simple enough that if lectures don't suffice, the text will provide you with an adequate guide. Working in groups to check problem sets is a must, and the problem sets usually end up being harder than the tests.",
    "Physics 180 01 is a great class where you learn and get to know some of your classmates very well. To some people this material may be easy; then they should be in 200, however the problem sets and pre-class assignments get tough especially towards the end of the term."
