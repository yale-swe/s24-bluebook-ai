   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about Mexican-US relations, and developments in Mexican politics since the 20th century. In particular, I learned a lot about trade, migration, and border security.",
    "I learned about the history of Mexico and major policy developments between the US and Mexico.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge of Mexico's history that I should have (but didn't) know before taking this class. I gained a deeper understanding of very topical issues (immigration, the war on drugs, trade deals, environmental issues on the border), enough to actually engage in a well-informed discussion of these issues.",
    "This class gave me a great perspective on the bilateral relationship between the two countries.",
    "I learned about the history of Mexico and the relationship between the US and Mexico when it comes to various geopolitical and geoeconomic topics.",
    "I was able to think more critically about the bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico and I learned more about Mexican history.",
    "A great overview of mexican politics in the 20th century and assessment and knowledge about current political issues between the U.S. and Mexico",
    "Mostly Mexican history at first which was very interesting and very helpful for the second part of the course which was about more contemporary issues (USMCA, immigration, narcotics).",
    "I learned so much about Mexican history and its complicated relationship with the US. The first half of the course was very history based since it is important to learn about Mexican history to understand the US-Mexican relationship. The second half of the course got more interesting and we started learning about different issues that affect the relationship, like immigration, NAFTA, etc"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: readings were very good. I really appreciated the historical background we studied in the first half of the semester. I also really enjoyed the presentations and the final research project. Weaknesses: Discussions were sometimes slow and got sidetracked. Each topic could cover an entire course.",
    "I really liked the seminar structure of the course and the conversations that arose in class. Sometimes we had a lot of readings assigned, but for the most part, it was manageable. One thing I was not too fond of was the group policy memo, but it wasn't that big a deal.",
    "I enjoyed the way the course was organized to provide students some historical context and the last half of the course was dedicated to discussing more contemporary issues.",
    "Strengths: Professor Sellars is super nice and the subject matter is generally very interesting. The workload was not too heavy and I felt well-prepared for the midterm exam. Weaknesses: The readings could be very long and very dense, and having to do a weekly memo every single week could be a lot. The course focused heavily on political-economics, which is important, and Professor Sellars' area of expertise, but it would have been valuable to get more time looking through other lenses. It could have been cool to have guest lectures or something like that. Class discussions could become stagnant regularly, which I think was in part due to the density of readings and in part due to the 9:25 time slot.",
    "Great class, the readings were very informational.",
    "A lot of time was spent learning the history of Mexico and not the various current topics. I wish more time was spent on the topics but the lack of is due to time restraints not professor preferences.",
    "Strengths: The material is very interesting and I learned important skills that will help me in future political science courses. Weaknesses: Sometimes class was very repetitive and there was no clear direction of where the conversation was going.",
    "Very interesting readings, especially during the second part of the course. Sometimes discussion was slow, but overall the two hours of class flew by.",
    "I wish we couldve had more discussions in class. it sometimes felt as if we were regurgitating all of the reading, but it was also understandable since our class was pretty quiet and Professor Sellars had to get us to talk. It might also be cool if the weekly memos were turned into weekly discussion questions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a very good way to approach Mexico-US relations for the first time as you get an overview of the most salient issues. I recommend really engaging with the readings, course material, and assignments as well because you will get out of it what you put into it.",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Sellars is a great professor, and you learn a lot about US-MX relations.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student interested in the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and Mexico because it is very relevant to current affairs.",
    "Yes, if you would like to gain a deeper understanding of U.S.-Mexico relations, especially Mexico's history.",
    "Yes! The professor is very kind, understanding and facilitates the seminar to best engage students and participation. It was one of my favorite classes and gave me great knowledge regarding Mexican history and the country's relationship with the U.S. from a Mexican perspective rather than from an American perspective.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Mexico or American relations with other countries.",
    "Yes I would. Mexico and the United States have a very important relationship that everyone should know about since each country greatly affects the other.",
    "Yes, the subject material is both pertinent and interesting. If you are a political science major and any of this material seems interesting this course comes highly recommended.",
    "Yes great course",
    "Yes, if you're interested at all in U.S.-Mexico relations and in Mexican history. Growing up in Mexico and being already familiar with Mexican history, this class really gave me another perspective about Mexico and how that shaped the US-Mex bilateral relationship. Great class!",
    "Yes!! This course has a lot of reading but its honestly super interesting! I think you definitely have to be interested in the topic if you wanted to take this course."
