    "If you're lucky enough to get Professor P North, you'll have an amazing time. This class was life-changing.",
    "This is an excellent course and I would recommend it.",
    "This section is very good. Professor North's class is very fun and you will learn a lot about the books we read as well as the wider world of philosophy. I highly recommend.",
    "Great class with noticeably more difficult texts as compared to first semester. Professor North makes the ideas presented accessible. You become most familiar with a text when you use it for a paper; it may be a good idea to pick thinkers you are not as comfortable with to explore more deeply.",
    "This class is a fast-paced look at some of the highlights of Western philosophy that requires a great deal of reading and writing. I would recommend this class to students who are looking for an introduction to philosophical thinking and traditions in general, not students who want to learn about any one author in particular depth.",
    "I would highly recommend continuing DS Philosophy into spring semester - we read and discuss works by some of the greatest thinkers and have the opportunity to work with some of the most knowledgeable experts in the field.",
    "Bounds and leaps better than Phil 126 (intro to Modern), because it includes Hegel and Nietzsche and 20th century philosophy. I would argue if you are a eh person who might like continental philosophy but not the analytic style that they teach in the Yale Department, to take this class over others, because it is better preparation for fields like WGSS or German."
