   "comments": [
    "This class is an easy science or writing credit",
    "If looking for a class that is not too much work and an easy Sc or WR, this is a good class. The material is interesting, but after a while it gets a little repetitive. The readings aren't too bad though.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. Yes, at first glance, the material seems very exciting. However, the class is structured in a way that to me seemed very inefficient and tedious. You will have problem sets or other assignments that seem to be irrelevant. I really disliked it. But really, do not take this class.",
    "Astronomy 030 is a relatively easy science class, so perhaps a good choice for non-science majors. I wouldn't recommend it, however, because it was disappointingly disinteresting.",
    "Astronomy 030 is basically an introductory course about the topic of astrobiology, which is a scientific, multidisciplinary attempt by humans to answer the question \"are we alone in the universe?\" At least this year, the course is both a writing credit and a science credit, which means that it can very nicely fill distribution requirements. I enjoyed the course and would recommend it, but unless you are genuinely interested in the concept of the universe, and specifically our place in it, then you might find this course boring.",
    "This class is great for anyone who is looking to get a science credit out of the way. It can be very interesting at times, but there is a fair amount of reading. You don't need to have any background in astronomy or science in general.",
    "I Really Regret taking this seminar\/class... If you know that science is NOT your thing, then don't expect for this class to change your mind. If anything , it will help prove that science is not for you and make you hate yourself for going through the torture.This is NOT a gut class. Many students, including myself, thought the class will be easy, but it is anything but easy. There are many readings to complete. And the readings are sometimes hard to understand, since you are reading about science, and science is more of a \"hands-on\" subject.I would have preferred to learn astrobiology on my own time than taking a course and being graded on it.",
    "ASTR 030 is an introduction to Astrobiology. It introduces concepts in astronomy, climate science, geology, biology and more, and applies them to the search for extraterrestial life. Speculation about what this life is like and where it might be found is not a focus until the second half of the course.Professor Arce was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. He brought in guest speakers and took us to the Peabody Museum and planetarium. I became a more critical reader of scientific news and more interested in astronomy because of this class.But the probem sets are tedious, there is a lot of reading and writing that I didn't find exciting. Some days I looked forward to going to class, some days I did not. The class didn't feel like a discussion, or a journey, that the students and teacher were all in together. In classes like these, the teacher can end up learning a lot from his students, and the students leave with more questions than answers (in a good way). The best classes I have taken have felt this way, and ASTR 030 did not, even though I think it could have.I would not recommend this course. There are so many small, fantastic courses at Yale, don't feel pressured to take a feshman seminar.",
    "Sounds interesting, but there's very little about actual aliens. It's more scientific. Probably not the best choice in classes. You could find far more interesting classes and hopefully get better grades your first semester at Yale.",
    "This class had postings every Tuesday and Thursday at 9 a.m., several essays and many problem sets. It is not by any means an easy class. It took a lot of time to keep up with everything. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are very very interested in the subject and are willing to put in a LOT of time.",
    "I would suggest this course if you have a previous interest in Astronomy. The course is much more science heavy than I had expected, discussing topics like star and planet formation, mineral evolution, and the basics of biology. Overall the class had relatively few assignments, but had frequent readings of scientific journals."
