    "This is a great seminar - by far the class I have learned the most in at Yale. It's a lot of work but it's definitely worth it. It's also a nice change of pace from the typical theoretical econ classes. There is theory, but it's coupled with practical cases that you have to solve. I would definitely recommend taking a finance class before taking it.",
    "PRIVATE EQUITY in one semester",
    "Only take this if you are going into investment banking, or if corporate finance genuinely interests you. Do not enter the class with no accounting\/finance background because you will be behind in the first day.",
    "If you want to learn about private equity, or get exposure to valuations and deals, it's a great class. Don't be too intimidated at first--everyone is. It gets better. Still, a lot of work; be prepared to work on assignments every day of the week sometimes.",
    "Excellent course with a heavy workload throughout the semester. Schmertzler's method is to give you a heavy case you won't really be able to do, have you struggle with it for hours, then reveal the key in the subsequent class. Consequently, this class will work you and frustrate you more than any other econ class (though not like a math class) but in the end is well worth it if you put in the time to struggle and learn. If you don't put in that time, I don't think it will effect your grade a lot, but the class becomes tedious and uninteresting. Only take this class if you care about the subject and have the time to struggle with it.",
    "If you want to go into business you should take this course. Extremely useful, and it helps you think about how deals are done and companies are valued."
