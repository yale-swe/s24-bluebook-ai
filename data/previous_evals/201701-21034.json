    "This class definitely taught me how to conduct a research study\/experiment; very useful! It also was great for developing my writing skills, particularly as a psych major.",
    "I learned so much about research from this course! Not only did Professor Ahn push me to think critically about my own experimental ideas and my own writing, but she also taught us to be skeptical of others' research.",
    "This was a tremendously helpful class for those who want to do research, or want to learn to think more critically about psychology research.",
    "I learned a lot about psychologists' research methods! From how to set up an experiment, to operationalize variables, to learn how to pose research questions... I also learned about hypothesis-formation, reasoning, how to run certain statistical analyses, and the skills of scientific writing. Overall very useful class!",
    "writing skills, research tools",
    "- critically analyze existing research and extend it into new research directions - design and develop Qualtrics surveys to collect data for research - critically analyze and interpret data in light of research question (using SPSS) - develop own individual project - write quality papers of research that are logical in theory, fit into previous research, critically analyze results, discuss the implications of such results, and adhere to APA standards",
    "Making surveys, conducting experiments, writing inscientific language, how to make tables and graphs, how to present to a group -- SO MUCH!!"

   "comments": [
    "This course was SO incredibly organized! Its structure made it impossible for students to procrastinate and facilitated a slow-and-steady learning pace. If you like to schedule your time a lot, you will love this course. That being said, we had more assignments than you would in the usual college course. I can see how it would be a hard course for someone who does not want to be evaluated regularly.",
    "Strengths: very well taught by Professor Ahn, lots of feedback, very clear set of expectations Weaknesses: there was sometimes a discrepancy between what Professor Ahn would tell us and what our TF would, and it caused me to lose points occasionally",
    "Strengths: Dr. Ahn! Weaknesses: The readings were ok, but we had weekly quizzes on them and sometimes it just felt like I was memorizing stuff the morning of, and not actually *learning* the material or applying it in useful ways.",
    "TAs give different feedback than professor, professor is a very harsh grader, but ultimately does help your writing abilities",
    "STRENGTHS: Professor Ahn and the TFs provide very detailed instructions on each assignment; they emphasize the purpose of each assignment in light of the larger course goals and also provide EXTENSIVE feedback on your work. Prof Ahn and the TFs are INCREDIBLY knowledgable about the entire research process. Not only that, they know how teach those skills to us. WEAKNESSES: The highly structured assignments can be a bit intense. Since there were so many details, I found myself highly dependent on what was outlined and always referring back to the assignment directions. In the long run, I'd like to be able to work more independently. In addition, the course at times felt too short? I don't know if Prof Ahn has ever considered having the course twice a week, but longer.",
    "Great class size"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they're interested in psych! It's a great writing credit regardless of major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only did I learn a lot about doing experiments, but I also felt proud of my work. Also, the small class size allowed students to establish close relationships with each other, the TFs and Professor Ahn.",
    "Well if you're a psyc major you have to take it... But even then, I think this course is really great if you're interested in research!",
    "If you are willing to spend a lot of time writing research papers then yes, but don't take for just writing credit",
    "This class is way better than it sounds. Plus Professor Ahn makes it as fun as possible and is GOAT.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this course. You will learn incredibly useful research skills and be able to analyze research more critically. Doing the group project first before the individual one is SUPER helpful. You will experience an extensive learning curve in this course. Professor Ahn absolutely knows what she is doing and has put so much time and effort into making this course the absolute best it can be. Be sure to reach out to her and your TF for any questions\/concerns. They really just want you to be able to learn a lot from this course and improve in your writing skills. Hands down my favorite course at Yale.",
    "Yes!! Must take class for people pursuing psych careers",
    "Yes-teaches very useful skills.",
    "Yes, great class!"
