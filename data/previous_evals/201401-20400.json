   "comments": [
    "Interesting class. You read through two large Tolstoy novels and then some short stories. Write two essays. Nothing too daunting. The professor makes this class worth it. He is super interesting and knows these MASSIVE novels so well, it's sometimes like doing a 'close reading' despite the fact you are covering literally thousands of pages. In short, a good literature class.",
    "This is a phenomenal class if you know you love Tolstoy and are prepared to spend a lot of time reading his work this semester. I had already read War and Peace and knew I wanted to dedicate myself to understanding it more deeply and in the context of his other works. That said, his tone can be overwhelming for an entire semester if you aren't confident you like it. Regardless, Alexandrov will make it worth your while. He's the most incredible lecturer I've had in the humanities, probably at Yale generally, and makes connections within these giant novels that always make you understand them more deeply or from a different angle while never being a stretch. Take it take it take it!!",
    "This is absolutely one of the finest courses offered at Yale. From my freshman year (I'm now a senior) I've been looking for a humanities class that examines the \"labyrinths of connections\" in some artistic medium, be that a novel or a film. Far too many courses at Yale in the field are concerned more with imposing readings on these works rather than authorial intention, and I found myself consistently and tremendously dissatisfied with them. Not so in Professor Alexandrov's course: he refused to submit to these unfortunate trends and always focused his lectures on decoding the hidden links between different parts of Tolstoy's novels. This sort of analysis I found incredibly satisfying and enriching.",
    "Tolstoy is a survey in Tolstoy's works and historical background. You read War and Peace, Anna Karenina, and many short stories (including \"The Kreutzer Sonata\" and \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\"). It's a ton of reading, but it gives you an in-depth sense of Tolstoy. I loved it. I tend to like classes that go in-depth into one subject, and this class does exactly that. Professor Alexandrov's lectures are astoundingly clear, given how sprawling Tolstoy's scope can be. The class is worth taking just to hear the way Alexandrov weaves through ideas and contradictions in Tolstoy's world. I rarely have lectures so organized and on point. The only way I could imagine someone not liking this course is if they don't like Tolstoy's style. Tolstoy is kaleidoscopic and all-encompassing... his literature speaks to every feeling, every experience, every type of person. He can also be didactic and moralistic. Whether you enjoy him probably boils down to a matter of personal taste. Even if Tolstoy's not your *favorite* (as is the case with me), if you have an open mind you will come to appreciate him on his own terms, especially the forcefulness and ambition with which he tackles the big questions. Finally, the midterm and final papers are very manageable, as is the final exam. Take it!",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who is hungry for some good literature and a great commentary to go along with it. This was the first time I read Tolstoy's works in my life and I took this course precisely because I felt that I would never ever read the books on my own. (They seem even thicker than the Bible. Seriously.) It was a great decision. Tolstoy is an amazing writer and Professor Alexandrov does him mighty fine justice, giving us great insight into Tolstoy's works and also the personal and historical context behind these great works of literature. The class made me realize how long I had been deprived of good books and left me hungry for more. Definitely recommended. It is a lot of work because there's a lot of reading, but it's really worth it. Do check it out.",
    "Take it if you want to read the books, which you should because they are amazing. But you have to keep up or plot lines will be ruined for you. The two papers are 7-8 pages, which isn't bad. The final is just 20 IDs - a lot of writing but not difficult if you've done the reading and go to section. Alexandrov is great also, but really this class is all about having the chance to read War and Peace and Anna Karenina. It's a lot of reading but a great way to spend \"work\" time!",
    "Yes, but it's a lot of reading.",
    "If you love to read, and truly want to learn how to become good at it, you should take this class as soon as possible. If you struggle with long reading assignments and have trouble keeping up with them, this might not be the class for you. Alexandrov undoubtedly is a genius, and listening to him lecture will really make you adore both War and Peace and Anna Karenina. I am so happy I took this class and would really recommend it to all who want to become smarter, and better people.",
    "Truly incredibly course, one of the best I've taken at Yale. Of course, War and Peace and Anna Karenina are stunningly written, and the translation, we're assured by Professor Alexandrov, comes close to doing them justice. But the ideas that Tolstoy expresses in the books are, at least for me, true, and greatly influenced how I think about the world, in almost every conceivable way. It's somewhat uncommon for me now to not look at a situation through the Tolstoyan lens, especially War and Peace and Anna Karenina. Take this course, if you can. You'll be doing yourself a serious disservice if you don't.",
    "Very good course if you want all of Tolstoy in one semester. I definitely recommend taking it C\/R\/d though, because the grading can be harsh and it's so much work.",
    "YES TAKE IT. One of my favorite classes at Yale. Just make sure you have the time to invest, so that you are able to fully immerse yourself in the material.",
    "This is an excellent course, in which you are introduced to the breadth of Tolstoy's work. I loved the class and definitely recommend it!",
    "Amazing class. Everyone should take this!",
    "This was a great course! The passion that Professor Alexandrov had for Tolstoy was infectious and the great depth of analysis he provided made reading Tolstoy's novels a much more enriching and meaningful experience. It allowed me to become much more aware of the intentionality and design in works of literature. I feel that I have come to think about my own writing in Tolstoyian terms, and even see the world and my experiences through a heightened dramatic Tolstoyian perspective. If you like to read, this class will transform your reading experience in many ways.",
    "Absolutely!! I can't recommend this class highly enough.",
    "This class is a wonderful literature course, even if you've never taken a literature course before. If you go to lecture and section, you will do fine.",
    "LITR 206 is a great course that focuses on the major works of Tolstoy. Prof. Alexandrov is an expert on Tolstoy and his lectures are very informative. I really enjoyed this class!",
    "I loved this class. It is a wonderful way to read two of the greatest novels ever written, and the class is worth it just for the experience of reading moving, powerful literature. Luckily, Professor Alexandrov is an amazing instructor, who enhances our understanding of the text. I would highly recommend this course. If you have reservations, I definitely would recommend taking it cr\/d\/fail, so that you can focus on purely enjoying the text without stressing out too much when the papers are due.",
    "Definitely take this class! Even if you're not into Tolstoy or literature in general, this class provides a firm structure to begin to analyze life and ask those big questions. There are high expectations for your work, but it is enjoyable to do. Take this class!!!!",
    "You want take this class because you want to read Tolstoy, right? Wrong. You don't. Tolstoy is excruciating. Here's a summary of War and Peace: fate, meaningful facial expression, idealized peasants, no one can control anything, history is like calculus. Alexandrov endlessly repeats himself, but it's not his fault--it's Tolstoy's."
