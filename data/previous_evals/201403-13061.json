   "comments": [
    "Great teacher, difficult proofs in class but no proofs on tests\/HW. Problem sets are out of a textbook, very doable. Bewley is very smart and a great teacher.",
    "AAA GO TO OFFICE HOURS AND YOU WILL ACE THIS. Great because we actually look at economic models.. Prof Bewley is a sweetheart, and I was at his office at least a hundred times. Exams were fair, and the practice material really helped.",
    "This class is basically intermediate microeconomics on steroids. It's difficult, but manageable if you put the work in. Do not be afraid of this class; the fact that it is very theoretical and is a requirement for math-econ majors usually tends to intimidate people. Again, it is manageable if you dedicate enough time to it, and the professor is very accessible (he lets his students call his cell!) and very willing to answer your questions. I'd highly recommend this course to a fellow student if you a.) enjoyed intermediate micro\/micro theory or b.) are considering getting a PhD in economics. tl;dr is that I do not regret taking this class. It's awesome. I love Professor Bewley. I learned a lot (I sometimes used to dream about edgeworth boxes).",
    "I would only take it if you enjoy math or need it for your major.",
    "If you'd like a systematic way to summarize all your economic knowledge from micro and macro before, then definitely take the course. Very solid, rigorous course to apply all the theories you have learnt in the past.",
    "I highly recommend this class for anyone interested in economic models.",
    "A requirement. Not the tastiest class you'll take, but important in retrospect",
    "Take it."
