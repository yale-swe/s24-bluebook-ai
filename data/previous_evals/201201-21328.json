    "The Actor and the Text: Othello is essentially like getting credit for being in an amazing production. The only work involved two papers and the performance itself, which was awesome and very refreshing. I would definitely recommend this class, but really any Actor and the Text class (this was my 2nd) is amazing.",
    "Murray Biggs is a fantastic director, even though sometimes his specificity in direction could be a bit cumbersome. The product was stunning though, as a result, and the play was one of the best productions this year. You learn a lot about acting, and not much about anything else. It is truly an ACTOR and the TEXT course, which was what I signed up for.",
    "I think these sorts of classes vary wildly depending on the teacher\/play but this was great it was basically getting credit for doing a show",
    "Great experience to work with a professional director outside of the Dramat.",
    "\"Actor and the Text\" class is worthwhile for any serious undergrad actor. Professor Biggs knows his stuff on shakespeare language and text."
