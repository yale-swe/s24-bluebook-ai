    "This course exposed me to musics and cultures that I had not yet encountered, while also broadening the ways that I thought about my own material. Because Professor Engelhardt was so open to students' ideas, my project allowed me to test out a lot of the issues I was having in my own work and see how class discussions might reshape my own thought processes. This course will, and has already, deeply contributed to my dissertation and research, and for that I am incredibly grateful. Professor Engelhardt allowed me to think in ways that I had not yet before, both more creatively and more openly, and this has had direct and immediate effects on my work. Thank you so very much."
