    "We had a pretty fun group and the reading list was fun, but I don't know if I'm that interested in the material, which I didn't realize until about half-way through the course, so if you aren't really interested in Reagan-era thinking I would be cautious with this course. The books are deceptively difficult. He makes you write 3 3-4 page papers which were annoying. Otherwise I think the approach of the course is interesting. You already know that James is a fun professor, fair grader, and an overall good discussion leader.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend Professor Berger to teach this course again. I think more cross-disciplinary study of historical fiction would be a wonderful addition to both the English and History departments.",
    "This class has an amazing reading list. That being said, it is a LOT of reading, especially on weeks that both a novel and some theory are assigned. However, if you are interested in the interplay of fact and fiction in the genre of historical fiction, it is so worth all of the work you have to put in.",
    "Take it if you can! Only thing negative is the class is chock-full of English majors so you have to be able to keep up",
    "I loved the reading and Professor Berger is really nice.",
    "The class consistently holds your interest--I would absolutely recommend it. I would caution that the reading is quite hefty and oftentimes difficult to read closely and keep up with it 100%. Also, as class discussions make up a large part of the course, you want to take it with other people that find the materials fascinating as well!"
