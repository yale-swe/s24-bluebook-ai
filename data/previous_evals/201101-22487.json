    "Introduction to electromagnetics and a little bit of discussion of antennas, waveguides, transmission lines, etc. I would recommend to students who need it for their major.",

    "You are probably shopping this course because it is required for your major, but I would suggest to try whatever you can to get your DUS to substitute this course (perhaps with something in the PHYS department)",
    "This is a hybrid course combining electromagnetic theory with engineering applications. It is very fast-moving. Be advised that it uses an absolutely horrible textbook, though the professor is excellent and definitely makes up for it. I would recommend this course to the student interested in E&M and\/or transmission lines.",
    "It was not a very interesting course. The equivalent one in the physics department might be better."
