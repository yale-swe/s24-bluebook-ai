    "It was great to have an analysis segment to the course.I think it helped push for better end-results.I think that this elective was geared more towards third-years.",
    "This course was very well-structured. First, we learned Kent's theory on ornament. Then we analyized famous ornamenters to test his position and begin to broaden our own vocabulary in the topic. And finally, we designed our own system of ornament.",
    "The materials presented in class were clear and concise and covered the general ideas regarding ornament."

    "This course was what I expected. Analyzing precedents provided a good conceptual framework to create our own design.",
    "I had no specific thoughts on ornament--only a curiosity in how it is rarely taught in architecture schools. Kent really opened the door to how rich and meaningful the theory of ornament can be.",
    "The course met my expectations of learning about the basics of ornament through precedent analysis and design exercises."

It's a unique opportunity to be able to study such material and I think that I will definitely be taking on some of the discussions and comments given to me at the critiques.",
    "This course was very valuable as an elective. I appreciate that this course is offered.",
    "It has changed the way I think about architecture and the way I intend to design it."

   "comments": [
    "Kent Bloomer was very helpful when it came to providing material and explaining the different concepts that have been around in a topic thats long-been forgotten and has only recently resurfaced in the field of architecture - that of ornament.Joel was always emailing out information and readings and trying to keep us on topic and aware of what was to be expected - which was very helpful as this topic was very new to some of us. Also both he and Kent made themselves available for one-on-one discussions.",
    "Kent is an excellent professor with a vast breadth of knowledge on the subject.",
    "Kent was very effective as a teacher. His main strength is his encyclopedic knowledge and his good nature. Sometimes he rambles or misunderstands students, but he is always lucid and willing to help.",
    "The teaching was clear and effective and encouraged student exploration."

    "Change of Time - the fact that this class was right before studio for many in the class - caused it to suffer throughout the semester.",
    "The final presentation of the designs was quite good, but I think the quality of the work suffered because, to be honest, many students did the work in a single night or two after turning in their studio projects. The work might have been better if we had to submit an earlier draft of our work before the final week of studio, so that we had something we could sleep on for a few days."
