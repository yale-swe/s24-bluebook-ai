    "I would recommend this course to self-directed students who want the time to develop their own thinking about a text or movie, or to ambitious students who have less experience with literary analysis but would like to begin thinking more seriously about it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in digging deeply into the form and substance of a text. The reading\/viewing list is engaging and the discussion is generally high level."
