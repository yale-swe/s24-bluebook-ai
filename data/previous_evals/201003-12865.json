   "comments": [
    "If you want to get your hands dirty and take a class that's super chill and work with your hands and have very little homework and be in a really fun and relaxed environment and learn something new and potentially useful in life, then you should take this class!",
    "Amazing. You get to learn a skill and work with your hands. Sometimes if you get into the process (kneading clay, making forms, mixing plaster) it can be a good form of relieving stress. Also not much outside-class work.",
    "Yes!!! Jon Conner is a pretty awesome guy and he certainly knows a lot about mold-making. I found the class to be a stress-reliever rather than a stress-creator because of the nature of the work and Jon Conner's laid-back approach. I had a great time getting my hands and clothes dirty with plaster and clay and learning the process of mold-making.",
    "This course is exactly as advertised. Straightforward and technical. Also fun and interesting. Jon Conner is wise and hilarious. No work at all outside of class if you use the 4 hours efficiently each week. Take it.NB: It can be hard to get in if you're not an art major, or an intended art major. If you even want a chance at getting in, you have to show up on the first day of class.",
    "I recommend it if you're looking for a chill class and willing to do outside work.It's really interesting to learn that it's not so easy to make what we consider simple objects and understand there are limitations to what you can do through casting. And it is a great feeling when you make something that comes out really well.At the end of the class, I don't think I 100% understood how to make my own molds and troubleshoot effectively because Jon was always there to help out when problems occurred, but it definitely helped me learn the basics to experiment on my own.",
    "Fantastic course in which you get an introduction to mold making and casting techniques. Not as \"expressive\" as other art classes, which I thought was a good thing -- you learn practical skills which are integral to any serious artistic practice, and which you won't have unless you take a class like this.",
    "I woud definitely recommend this course to any student looking to expand their sculptural craft. If you want to learn how to cast things this is where to do it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Yes",
    "This class was really interesting and good if you like working with your hands. The teacher would first do a demo of the type of project we'd be doing, and then we would have work sessions. We would bring in our own objects to use for projects, but the art supplies were provided. I did have to come in on my own time to finish some of the projects if I didn't finish during class. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student but they should not get flustered if things go wrong with some of their projects."
