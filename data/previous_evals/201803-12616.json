    "I got lots of great practice writing musical theater songs, and took some time to think a little bit more about form and structure.",
    "Leaving this class, I feel strongly that I am now equipped with a solid toolkit to approach songwriting. Josh does a great job at introducing you to a large and diverse array of musical theater repertoire, and breaking down some of the most popular songs to show us the artful design of the composition. We reviewed the various ways we could choose to approach form, instrumentation, character, arch, along with motifs, coloring, hooks, etc",
    "The course is fantastic for songwriters; you get a lot of practice writing songs of different styles, presenting your pieces to a group, reviewing your work and the work of your peers and edit our own songs."

   "comments": [
    "I thought that the class always had a friendly atmosphere and I always felt comfortable sharing my work. Occasionally, I wished that the feedback I received was a little more in-depth and tackled deeper, more structural and overall issues in my songs versus talking about minutia.",
    "This course definitely does what it sets out to do! If anything, it would be great to have more time out of it! Maybe accompanying weekly composition lessons? Meetings with Josh? Jam sessions? I think music (and most of the arts) should demand more time for their worth! STEM classes really be out here asking for 3-6 hours a week, not counting hours of study halls\/sections\/labs. In order for our music studies to compete, they have to be given the space to do so!",
    "While we were given a task and framework for each week's song, we had an incredible amount of creative freedom that I really enjoyed. I felt we had just enough guidance to be productive and ... and were able to engage with the class at our own level and pace.",
    "The presentation setup allowed us to get feedback from our peers, which I think was good. But I think it also ended up intimidating students in the end when a few of their classmates were consistently ahead of everyone else. I don't know how that can be fixed though, so I don't know how helpful this feedback is."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but know that depending on your skill level coming into the course, you will get drastically different amounts out of it.",
    "Absolutely to anyone who is interested in the art of bringing together words with music. I was a composer who \"couldn't write songs.\" I had a general apprehension of the english language, so I took this class in the hopes that it would help me get over that; and it did!",
    "Would highly recommend -- a fantastic class for anyone who wants to write songs for musical theater.",
    "I'd recommend it. You get clear feedback on your work and you're given some room to choose what you want to write, rather than being assigned to write about something you don't care about."
