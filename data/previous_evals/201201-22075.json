    "An underrated language, I took it simply because I wanted to learn another language that wasn't based in the same European system as English; it certainly does that. You learn clicks too, if that's something that appeals to you.The course does not go as fast as languages like Spanish or French (thankfully) and as such you will not be as proficient at the end of it.(I just realised noone is going to read this... who reads the description for L2 courses, you have to take them!)",
    "Zulu 120 is definitely a different experience, but it is a class I would recommend to everyone. It is fun and I think that in the end, you fall in love with this language and along the way you learn a lot about the history of the area. It is great and I would recommend taking this course to fulfill your language requirement.",
    "Definitely. Easily one of my favorite classes."
