   "comments": [
    "I genuinely enjoyed Spanish 2, and in retrospect I would have taken that course even without the language requirement. Spanish 3 was not nearly the same fulfilling class and became only about the language requirement for me.",
    "LOTS of HW, lots of work in general, but if you need to fulfill your requirement, or are passionate about learning the language, do what you have to do.",
    "If that's where you are placed, I think it's good to take a language until you are fluent in it.",
    "A good Spanish course. Not the most exciting thing in the world, perhaps, but my Spanish (and my confidence in my Spanish) improved dramatically during the course. Small, constant workload for a constant (but eventually big) improvement.",
    "yes",
    "I would to get the credit out of the way.",
    "It was fine. It was doable, not too much work, not too much fun, but not bad. I would recommend it if you have to take it or just love Spanish.",
    "I felt that the stories and videos we read were interesting and worth while, but on the whole, I feel that taking L3 Spanish is more of a way for me to fulfill my language requirement and less because I am interested in the Spanish language. However, if becoming fluent in Spanish is something important to you, then L3 is definitely a crucial class to take.",
    "You are most likely going to take this class because of language requirement. But whether this is the case or if you really love the Spanish language the Spanish department at Yale is fairly strong. You can't go wrong with whatever teacher you get. But do try to get one who is a native speaker. Professor Tortora was amazing and taught the class in an engaging manner. I loved the songs and movies that she showed the class.",
    "By the end of the semester, you're learning many different verb tenses very quickly, so things tend to get jumbled up if you don't increase the amount of time you spend studying. Margherita Tortora is a very nice lady. I can't say she's the best language teacher I've had, but she is super passionate about Latin American film and will tell you about all the extracurricular things going on in the Spanish department. Might be a good connection to make if you're considering the major.",
    "It was a fine intermediate language class, and it may be a necessary stepping stone to get to higher level classes."
