   "comments": [
    "This course has made me a much closer reader of the Bible. I no longer see the Bible as one seamless creation but as a collection of sources and narratives that come together into a multivocal whole. The class is rather large, but Professor Brisman alleviated this by splitting the class each Wednesday. For the pre-1800 requirement there are several additional assignments, but each of them is only one page. I never found them a burden.",
    "Even if you're not THAT interested in the Bible, this class is worth taking simply because Leslie Brisman teaches it. He is one of the best teachers at Yale: other professors who are as accomplished as Brisman might just sort of phone in their teaching time, but Brisman genuinely loves teaching undergraduates, and he's fantastic at it. This is also a good way to fulfill a pre-1800 requirement, if you're an English major.",
    "Amazing class. Don't be intimidated by Professor Brisman's syllabus. You read the Bible--but what really happens is that you learn how to read the Bible--and if you think you don't like the Bible you're looking at the wrong way. This class taught me that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you want to learn about the Bible, approach the text from a new angle or delve deeper into the themes this is the class for you. Seminars are great and Professor Brisman manages to encourage lively discussion without dominating too much. He's very approachable, yet exceptionally knowledgeable (he's been teaching the class for 25 years) and I almost felt as though I was learning by osmosis just by being in the same room with him. The reading load is not especially difficult and covers the breadth of the Bible. There are also three relatively short papers (only two of which count towards your grade) and some even shorter introductory assignments. Each class discusses a theme pertaining to the reading which I always found illuminating. If you're interested in the Bible, this is a fabulous class.",
    "Worth it.",
    "Very interesting class. It was good to read through much of the Bible but I can't say that I took away much from the class other than enjoyment and a greater familiarity with scripture. Overall, very interesting, but maybe not as useful as some other classes.",
    "You read substantial selections of texts from both the Old and New Testament and discuss themas literature. Personally, I found it difficult to analyze a text written by multiple writers at various different times with various different intentions. Sometimes class discussions felt like guessing games. As an English (as opposed to Literature) major, I also struggled with the fact that we were reading from a translated text; it seemed like a lot of what we gleaned from the passages we read was based on the particulars of translation, which vary considerably, as we saw from reading multiple versions of the Bible. Nonetheless, Professor Brisman offers very intelligent insight. I would recommend this class more for Literature than English majors, or for people with particular interest in the Bible as a text.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. The best, most enjoyable, and intellectually rigorous class I have taken at Yale. You have to know the Bible to read any other literary work, so it relates no matter what you are studying in the long-term. But it is just a fabulous course - not for the faint of heart, because it's hard. Not a terrible workload, but the papers are demanding. I was challenged, and I loved it.",
    "good course. focus mostly on differences in translation between different bibles and he reads greek and hebrew, so he is very helpful on the subject. not too much on theology, but on the reasons for the changes made amongst editions, gospels, etc. focus on all the different authors. prof brisman is so smart and incredibly sweet.",
    "A literary survey of the Bible, not as the word of God, but as a collection of literary works that, when read together, creates one of the most moving written accounts imaginable, for the faithful and nonbeliever alike. Taught me where the West came from.",
    "This class allows you to read much of the Bible which gives you a good background especially as an English Major. It focused much less on the literary than I had expected and more on historical or authorial issues. I think whether or not you like Professor Brisman's teaching style can make or break the class for you, though.",
    "reading the bible as a literary work, which requires a more detailed reading than its normal context.",
    "This course offers a good background into the theorized origins of the books of the Bible. This course would work well for a student who wanted to know more about the Bible in particular, or the history behind its origins.",
    "If you're taking this class because you're interested in \"knowing the bible\", I would take a religious studies class, rather than \"Bible as Literature\". The course title says it all--you're reading the Bible as a work of literature, with different authors, styles, and contexts. That being said, it definitely teaches you a new way to look at the Bible, rather than a general introduction to the different stories in Old Testament and New Testament. Professor Brisman might be intimidating at first, but I highly recommend taking advantage of office hours, as they are the best way for him to get a sense of how you're feeling in the class and vice versa.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was always fun, informative, thought-provoking, and challenging. Leslie Brisman was great! He really focused each class on a specific theme, so that the class discussion had and direction. He's very knowledgeable, and very helpful with papers. A few notes of warning, however. If you take this class, I would highly recommend you ask what makes a good Biblical studies paper, perhaps by asking the prof to point you to sample papers. Many peoplein the class had a hard time figuring out what made a good Biblical studies paper. DEFINITELY turn in drafts! I also thought the final \"quiz\" was also impossible! I wish the professor would have stuck to the New Jerusalem Bible translation (the required text for the class, which everyone read), but he pulled quotes from all different translations, which many students did not read. They were also impossibly detailed, and I don't think he can expect anyone to have read THAT closely. I think the final clearly presents an unfair advantage to those who are already familiar with the Bible. He told us that the final only counted if you were between grades (b\/b+, a\/a-, etc), but that was no comfort because he doesn't give grades on the papers, so you have no idea what your grades are! Also, his comments on papers are not always that helpful or reflective of your grade, so definitely go to talk to him about the papers.",
    "This is an in depth reading of selected passages of the bible, though you read through most of the text. Brisman knows a ton and leads an interesting discussion, but he definitely has his favorites and he isn't great at not making people feel stupid (there's this dreaded insincere smile he has...). He's a nice man, though, and he makes the most of each comment, bs and all. Going to his office hours was a good experience--you should do that if you take the course. The workload was manageable, and papers were a lot of fun, actually, but grading is pretty intense and a little unpredictable, so this is a good one to take cr\/d. It's a Yale classic, though, and for a pretty good reason. Shop it, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what it's like.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless you already have experience with this professor and know that you like his teaching style. He is exacting to the point of being unforgiving. While I learned a lot, I was often uncomfortable with the way he led discussion, and a few of his comments were just mean. For example \"If any of you are about to catch the swine flu, or have parents who are ill and may die, or have roommates who won't wake up tell them to hold off for the next two weeks so you can learn the difference between the gospels.\" That said, the material is interesting, and the questions he asks are good questions. Also, be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, regardless of their interest in biblical literature.",
    "A great introduction to Biblical verse, the reward is the reading.",
    "I loved this course! Not only is Brisman one of the best professors I've had at Yale, he facilitated discussion and presented the material very well. I got to learn the Bible really well, in the literary and historical sense, not the theological sense, which I really liked."
