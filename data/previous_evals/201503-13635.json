   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class. It's the perfect balance of theory and practical application, and it's an interesting, pertinent Econ seminar.",
    "Great intro class to Environmental Economics. You will learn many things and will understand the concepts. You will also create a model that predicts economic growth and emissions, and maximizes mitigation rates based on your stated parameters. Great class.",
    "This is a really interesting course, but it's very hard. You really need to be ready to understand some fairly complicated economics (as long as you have Intermediate Micro and Macro you should be fine) and do a lot of work. There's a lot of problem sets, most of which use Excel, and a pretty hefty (15 page) final paper, as well as a final. But Nordhaus is a great teacher and the material is interesting.",
    "Nordhaus is a great professor who is highly personable, likable, and clear to understand. He is also one of the leading environmental economists in the world, and you will find (or may have already found) that many important studies reference his work. That being said, the fundamental conflict of this course is that we are learning (as solid fact) the very economic mindset and blind faith in capitalist markets that put us in the place of environmental catastrophe we are in today, a conflict which is not really addressed in this course. I would describe this course as using standard neoliberal economics to describe situations relating to the environment. Which is important to learn about, sure, especially if you're interested in creating environmental policy. Just don't come to this class expecting to learn anything radical or new about the deeply problematic relationship between the environment and our current financial system."
