    "If you have some background in Hindi definitely take this class. Before taking this class I could only understand Hindi and speak a little, so there's no need to know how to read or write Hindi before taking this class. The class is a little disorganized, but you will definitely learn a lot and it's an enjoyable class!",
    "It's important to put a lot of effort into this course. Great course!",
    "Take it! This is a great class! Swapnaji is great. She even invited us to her house for dinner at the end of the semester. The workload is pretty chill, and you get to sing Hindi songs in class. The small class size is also great. Everyone becomes good friends by the end.",
    "Not a lot of work at all. Swapna ji is really nice (and an excellent cook). Midterm and final assignments are fun and a departure from the drudgery of papers and exams. Class was small which is essential for proper language learning. Talk to Swapna ji before starting the class, just so you can be sure that you can handle it since it is designed for heritage speakers with some level of previous knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend it but remember that most of what you learn will be what you put into the class. If you want, you could easily go through the class and not take away too much, so there's a lot of self-initiative involved. It was very relaxed class, however, and the assignments were moderately difficult, definitely doable, mostly in the form of writing paragraphs and journal entries in hindi and practicing grammar."
