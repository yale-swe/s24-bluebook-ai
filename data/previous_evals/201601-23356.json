    "I would recommend adjusting the format of the class to rely less on powerpoint slides or, at the very least, to trim the amount of information contained on each slide.",
    "Professor is a wonderful guy and very smart, but the class totally ran out of gas. We spent a total of 4 hours over the last two classes watching videos in class.",
    "This class is full of information, but somehow it is less than the sum of its parts. Larry is a very nice guy and was receptive to any student question. However, his style is excessively dry and the whole class feels like a guy reading you a textbook. There was lots of talk about the detailed work of a utility (like different types of meters) that was just not applicable to 99% of what we will work on or what students are interested in. The general focus of the class would have fit better in mid 1990s. Not nearly enough time talking about new utility models, climate policy, utility politics or the structure and function of markets in the US and abroad. The discussions on rate design were helpful, as were some of the IRP stuff, but generally the information was plentiful but unhelpful. The sections on EVs and developing countries was particularly weak (watching a movie in class!? What?!). In general, this class did not provide very much value, and it didn't require that much work. It's crazy to have this class being taught with almost no mention of the NYREV, or other utility reform efforts happening right next door in NY!",
    "Make it a faster crisper half semester course, and this will be perfect. It is not worth a whole semester's time and course material gets very repetitive.",
    "The professor could be more engaging, but in some ways any professor would have a hard time keeping students engaged on a fairly dry subject matter for 3 hours in the late afternoon \/ evening. Students are often not paying attention in class. Ideally this would be a twice a week, daytime class. Three hours of lecture on utilities is a lot. The professor is extremely knowledgable about the issues being taught and seems to care a lot about the students.",
    "The TA often made students feel uncomfortable and was unprofessional. This is particularly applicable to female students."

    "Interesting subject matter, and good opportunity to learn directly from a practitioner.",
    "The course focuses on an industry that is grappling with a lot of change. It was helpful to gain a solid understanding of the relevant issues.",
    "Readings are well thought through and useful.",
    "Field trip to ISO-NE was fun. Some of the discussion of rate design were interesting and illuminating. It wasn't very hard.",
    "Direct applicability to subjects that interest me. It's very difficult to learn about the complex world of utilities and this course is a fantastic opportunity to do so!",
    "Professor is knowledgable about core material and willing to share experience. Assignments forced me to think critically about issues utilities deal with.",
    "Learning about where the electric industry is headed. To me, the utility case study was the best, because that is where I really learned about the programs that electric utilities are operating, how they are regulated and how they are responding to current circumstances like growing distributed generation. One suggestion I would give is to expand the utility case study and make students work on it during the semester. This is because it was until I was preparing my case study, when I could see how many of the topics taught in the course, work in the real world.",
    "Learn about current state and history of electric utilities.",
    "The course offered an excellent overview of electric utilities, and I particularly appreciate the attention to utility revenue streams, rate base, and rate cases. Prof. Reilly is excellent in presenting the material, balancing differing perspectives, and respecting student interests. He is truly a wonderful person and an excellent part of F&ES.",
    "The professor's knowledge of utilities industry's business is incredibly helpful.",
    "The broad spectrum of the class is helpful for person willing to understand the American utility market.",
    "The professor was extremely knowledgeable on key utility issues such as revenue decoupling, regulation, and rate cases. It was great to hear about his first-hand experiences on these topics."

   "comments": [
    "Spending long periods of time watching videos in class is frankly unacceptable and unproductive. Lectures tended to be one sided, which makes the long form (3 hrs) difficult. Particularly in a small class that tends to attract people with a wide range of expertise in the issues at hand, it would be great to build in more meaningful interaction.",
    "The three hour lecture format is tough.",
    "In-class experience",
    "Needs to reflect the fact that US utilities are in a time of great tumult and reform and those big trends, tensions and possible solutions (business, policy, regulatory, etc) are MUCH more useful and interesting than what type of smart metering system a company uses.",
    "Classroom time was kind of boring (sorry) and largely unnecessary, as it kind of was just the prof narrating what was written on power point slides.",
    "The class focused too much on the present and not on the future. Utilities are facing interesting challenges, but discussions around these challenges were superficial. I would have like to spend more time learning about how leaders in the utilities industry are dealing with these issues.",
    "I think that the content of the lectures can be too abstract and general. Some practical cases or specific examples about what is going on in each of the topics presented in the course, can be really helpful.",
    "Ideas utilities are considering as they try to adapt to changing landscape.",
    "The course could be improved during the final few weeks. Specifically, the course meetings for electric vehicles\/storage\/microgrids, utility options, and emerging economies were light on substance. The videos were best watched as assigned items. I recommend Prof. Reilly combine classes 10 and 11 and consider adding material related to the regulatory process, regulatory interventions (e.g. consumer groups), energy industry corporate structure (combining distribution and transmission, e.g. AGL or Spectra), RGGI and the Clean Power Plan, as well as a course on natural gas utilities.",
    "Some classes are too theoretical, and they could be improved by adding more hands-on experience.",
    "Unfortunately, areas where the professor has not had direct experiences were neglected. For example, the class on developing countries consisted of a video only.",
    "The pedagogy is scattershot and non-linear. The lectures are disjointed."

For that reason, I think that this course is basic for anyone thinking about working in something related to electricity.

    "Advantages - you can accomplish more and learn from your teammates. Disadvantage - there is more coordination involved which can be challenging.",

    "Interesting to dive deeper on a topic and discuss issues with classmates, despite laggard students.",
    "The group assignment was valuable, and I appreciated the discretion left to teams. I found it difficult to start the team work because two team members were less-than-committed. The professors and TF's prompts were helpful (such as the one-page outline due in early April).",
