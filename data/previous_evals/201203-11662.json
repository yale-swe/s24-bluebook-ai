   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a fairly easy science credit. I think I could have done fairly well in the course without going to lectureeither.",
    "Easy? Yes. There is your science credit.",
    "Interesting topics, not very difficult at all. I really did feel as though I learned some interesting things--and, of course, got a Sc credit without much work.",
    "This class is easy if you've taken basic biology before, not a lot of work. I would definitely recommend if you're a science person looking for an easy credit.",
    "Take it, if you need a SC credit but if you want to have an enjoyable science course you might want to consider something else.",
    "Do not take this class.",
    "You really get an important scientifc base in understanding certain ideas, and your opinions on a multitude of things can certainly change once you get a good scientific explanation for it. I would recommend it, you have to do a good amount of studying, but really it was an average workload overall, and as long as you try and put some effort int (not a TON) you'll end up doing fine.",
    "This is a great class. It's not hard. It is interesting and assessable. I thought the reviews from previous semesters were more negative than my experience. The lectures could be less reading off a powerpoint, but I thought they were relevant. Studying for tests was sometimes tricky, but if you touch base with your TF ahead of time they will direct you.",
    "Good science credit.",
    "Yes. It is a great way to learn about things you should really know about, as they affect our lives and our health everyday. Relatively relaxed environment to get the SC credit, however the exams are much harder than expected.",
    "I think this was a pretty good course. I enjoyed the topics that were covered and I felt like I was given sufficient insight into them. The exams were very fair and section was agood supplement. A good science credit, interesting and gives you enough knowledge to know what's going on.",
    "It sucks, but it gets the job done.",
    "it's ok for a science credit. not too much work but you'll often make mistakes on the midterms even if you know the material. ok workload",
    "I would only recommend it if you absolutely need a science credit and can't bear the thought of being in a standard science class.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you need an easy science credit. Otherwise, I wouldn't take it. It's just not that stimulating. There are so many other better classes you can take at Yale.",
    "It's not going to be as easy as you think, given that it's a 'gut.' Remember to put the time into studying for the exams in a way that you do not study for other exams. It's not about theories or understanding general concepts. Gotta know the nitty gritty.",
    "It's a good science credit, but if you do not go to the lectures it is very difficult to understand the powerpoint slides.",
    "Take it only if you have too. Shop others.",
    "Depends",
    "As a science credit, probably worth taking. Would highly recommend not slacking on going to lectures before the test.",
    "Don't take if you need an SC. The tests are really hard.",
    "Great science credit. This is as real-life applicable as a science credit gets, with practically no work. There are three tests which are worth studying a lot for, and a very short final essay. Basically a course that surveys many many topics without much depth, but you will feel like you understand\/be able to interpret everything in a certain sectors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 news and also tell when rumors about nutrition are false",
    "The biggest problem with this class is that it is unclear exactly how much detail you're supposed to know. I suspect the problem stems from the fact that the professors are really good in their respective fields, so they're not sure what is obvious and what isn't. The lectures go into super, super detail about all these scientific concepts, and then the tests are either just as detailed or designed for idiots (there are three tests). For example, for the first test, barely anyone got above a 90, and then for the second test, most of the class got above a 90. There's just no way to tell, and it makes the course really difficult and annoying.This class is not a gut. Do not let people lie to you and tell you that. It is a gut in the sense that you can skip lecture all the time without any repercussion, and there is absolutely no day-to-day or week-to-week work. Although section is mandatory, you rarely do anything in section that actually requires preparation.",
    "Do not take this class if you're a non-Science major that doesn't have a decent scientific background from high school. If you do have a decent scientific background, you should be fine in this class if you need a science credit.",
    "This class is very much a broad overview of certain issues of biology. It does not present information about specific topics. Rather, it presents information about certain topics such as genetics, nutrition and agriculture. I think that it does not manage the introductory course idea well because it presents so much information without really going into detail about any of it. In addition, the professors don't make it clear which aspects of this information students have to know for the exams. I would not recommend it to another student unless they need it a science credit.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN YOUR GPA.",
    "Decent gut science. Not the most interesting material but it'll get you an easy A if you pay attention and study.",
    "Broad overview of science. It is not easy, but is still probably a good science to take for non-science majors as what you learn is very applicable to your life.",
    "Lectures can often be dry, but the discussion sections are interesting and totally painless. Breaker was a great lecturer but Nelson and Summers were a little dry. The tests are a little disconcerting because you are not assigned any \"grades\" until the end of the year, but it's not bad as science credits go! You will feel more educated about some important issues, and like you have a little more to add to conversations about them down the line.",
    "Take it, you will definitely learn something and might even walk out genuinely interested in some of the topics",
    "Do not take this class. I would not recommend it because there is NO clarity or communication between the TFs and the professors. When it comes time to study for the three exams, you simply do not know what is going to be on them-- but neither do your TFs. This class is harder than it lets on, and its lecturers are DRY. I would not take this class for an easy science credit, because it's not easy, interesting, or enjoyable.",
    "Not a difficult science credit, but to be painfully frank, the class was an absolute nightmare. The professors were often condescending, and never seemed to know exactly what they wanted us to learn. On days they would flood us with scientific detail as if we were Biology majors; on others they would dumb it down so much and discuss the issues on such a superficial level that I felt I was back in freshman year of high school. Believe it or not, when the TAs (who were amazing, and the saving grace of this class, really) asked one of the professors the depth of knowledge he expected us to demonstrate on the exam, said professor said he had no clue.When the professors themselves seem to have no passion for teaching the class, it just becomes a drag. And that's what I had to do. Drag myself to every lecture. Of course, \"Issues Approach\" is really a lie too. The social science aspect was almost completely drowned out, and the class became \"Biology\", period.Call me crazy, but I'm dead sure there are better science credits out there.",
    "Do not take this course. It is unorganized. Also, we only discussed the issues related to the scientific topics in section, which was not enough for it to be in the title of the course.",
    "I would recommend it for non-science majors looking for a way to fulfill their distributional reqs. It's a good, straightforward, pretty interesting way to consider biology, without all the boring (to a non-science person like me, anyway) nitty-gritty details.",
    "I am not sure I would recommend this class to another student looking to get that science credit out of the way. The tests are graded shockingly hard and it is difficult to tell if they are graded or not. If you want to do well in an easy science credit, I would maybe recommend taking a different class. It did serve its purpose though if you can't find anything else. It was also a little frustrating to have SUCH hard grading on the tests because science is already not my best subject and it maybe scared me away a little bit more.",
    "I took this class to fulfill the science distributional requirement. I didn't find any of it particularly interesting, but some of it wasn't too hard. Section is extremely easy, and the TA was nice. The lectures are quite good, but there is in fact quite a bit of technical information and diagrams to learn. As a very non-science person, it was kind of over my head.",
    "Just like the title, it's a biology course based around contemporary issues. It covered much of the contemporary topics, but Breaker is definitely the weakest lecturer out of the three. BEWARE: THIS IS NOT A GUT.",
    "Pretty easy science credit. Tests are harder than you think. Prof. Breaker is great, but Profs. Nelson and Summers are less than stellar.",
    "If you're just looking for a science credit, go ahead and take this class. It's very little work (3 tests over the course of the semester, one 5-page essay at the end, and the reading assignments are just news articles pertaining to this week's lectures.) You might not retain a lot, but you'll fulfill a distribution requirement without having to bust your brains.",
    "Don't take it if you can help it. You won't learn much, and although it is not difficult in content, it is weirdly graded and so you will not get an easy science credit out of this course either.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a science credit and are good at 'studying', if you know what I mean. This course requires a decent amount of memorization, but the effort put forth will be worth it if you are interested in the topics presented.",
    "This is an interesting course with real-world relevance, though the basics of what is taught could be learned by reading a publication like The New York Times regularly. Nevertheless, the course is an great way to fulfill the science requirement: not too much work, and tests that aren't overly difficult."
