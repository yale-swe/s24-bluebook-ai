   "comments": [
    "Good course to take if you are an applied math major, or have a strong interest in statistics, probability, etc.",
    "I would recommend this class because Information Theory is one of those topics that can actually blow your mind and slightly change the way you view the world. there are ups and downs in the given weeks but as a whole this class was very interesting and I am glad I took it. Work wise, the HW takes time but is definitely not one of those unreasonably hard problem set classes and although sometimes lecture is hard to follow the tests were not very difficult. The textbook was not written very well but it was usually understandable and I think it is the textbook that almost every information theory class uses at any college.",
    "Hmm. Not sure what to say about this one. It has its moments, and you come out of it definitely knowing something interesting that you didn't before. But lectures are dull and at times hard to follow if you're not one of the grad students or a stats major. It's the sort of class you don't particularly want to go to at 9am, and many people don't. The textbook is great, though. The problem sets are also pretty reasonable and the professor is a really sweet guy. Be warned: the midterm is ridiculously easy, but the final has several harder parts to separate out the class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. If you like math and are interested seeing it applied in interesting ways, this class is for you.",
    "Great class if you are interested in applied math or statistics. First half of the class (though first midterm is more or less easy), the topics become harder after the midterm when you get into communications part. Overall great class, and Professor Barron is a great teacher. Homework load is reasonable (not easy but reasonable)",
    "You should take this class if you are interested in information theory.",
    "This class was pretty average as far as statistics courses go. Decent material but nothing I was able to get super excited about. The work load was reasonable, although increased a bit by the end of the semester. Problem sets were helpful in learning the material and the exams were very fair. Professor Barron's really nice and helpful with questions and he's also very interested in the course topic, which is always a plus. However, I just didn't come away feeling like I had learned anything particularly interesting or applicable."
