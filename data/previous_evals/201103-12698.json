   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in music. Class material starts out simple and gets considerably more complicated as the semester progresses, but you'll be ready to handle it. Exercises include sight singing, chord recognition, rhythmic dictation, melodic dictation, two-part dictation, error detection and more! A really enjoyable class. Not too much work outside of class other than piano lab. Quizzes are manageable.",
    "Music 218 is an extremely relaxing 50 minute addition to your day\u0097it has no homework and I found the dictation's and ear training exercises to be oddly therapeutic.",
    "This is an amazing class for any student that is looking to improve his\/her ear. Perfect for a cappella singers who would like to become better sight readers and musicians in general. Sarita is one of the best teachers I've ever had! Oh yeah, there is no mandatory homework!",
    "Definitely take it! the class is really fun, and not very much work. despite that, it has a huge effect on your musicianship. my sight reading and ability to follow and understand music improved so noticeably over the course of this semester. If you take it, try to be in Sarita's class because she is the absolute best. The keyboard lab is interesting and pretty chill, although it was less relevant and interesting than the rest of the class (for me anyway). Absolutely recommend it though.",
    "Definitely! A wonderful class, especially with Sarita, you'll learn so much, and it feels really good to actually be developing skills over the course of a semester.",
    "If you want to improve your musicianship, take 218. Sarita is great. This class pushes your skills to the next level. If you're bad at musicianship but want to get better, take it credit\/d. You will improve if you put in the time.",
    "Take it. Take it with Sarita. It's lots of fun.",
    "Take this!!! Put in the effort to practice and its well worth it.",
    "Fun class! (By the way, you definitely need to be able to read and write music.) I had a really good time with this class. It can be tough at times, but it really just depends on your natural ear and how well you can improve on it. We did sight singing, chord progression recognition, melodic dictations, two-part dictations. The class can be nerve-wracking at times when you have to sing on your own in front of everybody, but everyone's in the same boat so it can still be fun and it doesn't have to be embarrassing. A bunch of quizzes, a sight singing assessment and a midterm and final. But they play the dictations a lot of times and it's all just the stuff that you do in class every day. Sarita is great, really fun and lively, very confident, which is nice compared to some of the TAs who teach it, and also very approachable. You have to take a 1\/2hr Keyboard lab with it, which can be hard (learning to play piano with figured base.) I had Jordan who is super chill, which is nice, although not always the best at piano--he's definitely good for beginners. I really loved the class!",
    "Do this! I found, personally, that it was not that much work and it was easy to pick up. You'll be surprised how quickly you improve and Sarita is the greatest. It also helped me in 205, as I learned a lot about chord structure, progressions, and function before they were discussed in that class."
