   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in French! You learn so much in such a little time, and yet you will not be overwhelmed but will be ready to converse in French with anyone.",
    "The exact same format as French 110. M. Ngame is a great teacher. He really cares about all his students and encourages everyone to participate in discussion, which helped everyone (at least me) a lot with improving upon their speaking skills. Overall, a great teacher!",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely. You will learn a lot of material quickly so be prepared, but definitely a great course.",
    "Yes definitely. It's a great language class and you get a very solid start into the language.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student learning French, but I would say that you have to be prepared to work harder than in the first semester.",
    "If you took French 110 and enjoyed it, then take PART 2!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. it directly follows L1 French and the transition is very smooth.",
    "An excellent class for beginning French at Yale: very interesting and engaging textbook (if you ask anyone who has taken beginning French here, you would hear that the stories of Robert and Mireille are one of their best memories), very well-structured, a lot of supportive materials and numerous practice possibilities. And if you want to take the course, you MUST go to take Prof. Ngame\u0092s section. He is very knowledgeable, informative and supportive of the students, and the classes are always fun, thought-provoking yet never too stressful. He is THE BEST teacher of all sections. Overall, I must say that taking L1-2 French with Ngame is one of my BEST experiences and memories ever.",
    "If you didn't take French with Ngame for L1, you missed out! Luckily you get the chance to do it for L2- Professor Ngame is hilarious, super chill, and an excellent teacher. Plus, as the department head, he knows everything before everyone else. Double plus, don't underestimate the importance of taking French with a native speaker, if only for the conversations that ensue when comparing English and French terms of endearment- did you know that the French call their lovers \"my cabbage\"?Bonne chance!",
    "As it is, if you are taking it after L1 you must do so to earn credit for the first semester, but in any case, I do recommend this class. I just went to France after taking it and I was able to use a ton of the things you learn in this class when I went there. You learn culture and the language. Take it with Ngame or Burton"
