    "Great course to learn modern Macroeconomics. Professor Moscarini is a leading researcher, and it is great to learn from him.",

    "Highly recommended.",
    "Good introduction to macroeconomics, recommended if you're interested in the topic",

    "Pretty standard 2nd quarter macro course.",
