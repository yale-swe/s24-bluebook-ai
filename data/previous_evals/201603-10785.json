   "comments": [
    "I really grew as a writer and learned to critically examine my own work in addition to the work of my peers. I learned to examine fiction for different structural systems and a natural development of character.",
    "I became a much better critical reader of other people's work, which in turn helped my own writing. Gained a lot of confidence in myself as a writer and a reader.",
    "I became a better writer with a better sense of how the writing, publishing and editing worlds function.",
    "This course really emphasizes peer-review, so I learned how to read other people's work critically and how to incorporate suggestions into my revision.",
    "Workshopping is the best possible way to improve your writing, save maybe some sort of experimental brain surgery. It forces you to think critically about the unconscious ways we create stories and to be conscious of these thinngs in your own writing. And Caz lead the workshop brilliantly."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I would say a strength of this course is how blunt Professor Phillips is when delivering criticism. It sets a high bar for the tone of the workshop, and allows for real work to occur, rather than sentimental ego-stroking that often happens in writing workshops. I think that one of the weaknesses of the course is the idea that everyone has to say something in the course about a piece, even if they don't have strong feelings or any interesting insight. Thats not unique to this course though, its a normal problem in seminars when balancing participation.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. It's a workshop, so it definitely was determined a lot by the other students, but overall things went well. I do wish that we had a bit more time to read the drafts of the stories (we would get them at midnight on Sunday and then have class on Tuesday afternoon, and I would have liked to have more than ~36 hours.) Also, in many ways, getting into this course is harder than the course itself. I'd like to see either larger workshops (by one or two people), or more sections of Advanced Fiction, because there's definitely a demand for it.",
    "Strengths are the workshop setting, the pacing, and the way Caz is so accessible to the class. Weaknesses are that, though our class was really great, obviously workshops depend on who's in them, and that can be hit or miss. Also the people who get stuck writing the first story are at a disadvantage-- it's also really intimidating at first.",
    "This course is very workshop-heavy, which was refreshing because you got to read what other people had written every week and develop your critiquing skills as well as your own skills as a writer. I wish we had done more writing in the course, but I understand that the point of the course is to come out with two very strong short stories at the end and that might not be possible if there were a lot of other assignments as well. I really liked how the students in the course did not hold back in their comments, and many of their comments were astute and insightful. I feel like every student came out of the course not just a better writer (as in actual writing) but also a better writer in the sense of being able to take criticism and incorporate suggestions into their revisions."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course, but only to people who are serious about their writing. It is a very intensive course, and I would suggest taking it only if you are prepared to read extensively outside of class, work on materials outside of what is assigned and meet with Professor Phillips to really grasp what your weaknesses are as a writer and how they should be improved.",
    "Yes. Caz is awesome, and if you have a chance to take the course, you should.",
    "Absolutely. Take this class if you get in! Caz is incredible-- insightful and to-the-point about your work, always willing to help you out or point you in the right direction. I was intimidated by course reviews from past years, but he's absolutely lovely and the most insightful professor I've ever had. The class isn't too much work-- just two short stories and comments on everyone else's-- but that just means you get a lot of individual attention for each story and a lot of great feedback. Also incredible to read the stories of so many talented writers. Anyway, I could gush for days about this one. Take it. Best class I've ever taken at Yale. Gave me a new purpose. Do yourself a favor.",
    "Yes; if you want to learn about fiction in a way you haven't before, take it!",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend ENGL 465 to another student. The professor and students in the class don't sugarcoat anything, and that's really refreshing. Definitely a good way to become a better reader and writer.",
    "If you want to become a better writer, this is for you. No matter how good you are now, you will get better."
