   "comments": [
    "It's basically story time with grandpa! A wonderful way to learn a ton\/just talk about the African American community! Not a bad way to spend a Monday afternoon and get a credit for it!",
    "I enjoyed the class sometimes for this reason- but a huge drawback was that he basically gave us the same lesson (with the same framework, the same examples from his life experience, etc) every week. Except for the first two and last classes, when for whatever reason he mixed it up, this seminar was like going to the same lecture once a week. This was exacerbated by the fact Prof Anderson very rarely invited the class to join in dialogue\/conversation (even though this class attracted who had really great things to say!)",
    "Not very hard. The papers are randomly dispersed and unclearly graded on a pass fail scale so I have no idea what my grade in this class will be after a whole semester, which is a bit unfair. Besides that, the class is interesting even if you come from a Black community because truly I didn't know half the stuff we were talking about. Interesting pieces aside, if you are antsy this class isn't for you. It's a solid block of one man talking and that could be mind-numbing at some point. Like painful. Some days were great while others I looked at the clock every 5 mins. So if you are super interested in the subject take it and if your not, and just looking for the SO distrib, then maybe think twice. I can't tell you if it was worth it for me yet cause I don't have my grade...",
    "I loved this class, but it's not for everybody. Professor Anderson talks for most of the class and students contribute throughout\/at the end. He is a genius and it's amazing to listen to him, but some people clearly thought what they had to say was more important than him. Smh.",
    "Ethnography of the African American Community is a pretty straightforward gut. Professor Anderson doesn't really teach any of the books, rather he cycles through variants on the same lecture in every class. Many of the books themselves, though, are worth reading. Frankly, this isn't a very good class, but if you're interested in the subject matter and looking for a gut, you could do worse.",
    "Take this class to learn more about the African American community than is apparent on the surface.",
    "I would recommend for someone who is willing to listen.",
    "If you have an interest in the condition of black people in America, both past and present, take it",
    "An amazing class that helps to explain a lot racial inequality that is excluded from textbooks and mainstream media. A must take class for anyone who wants to begin to understand the black experience.",
    "Take it!! Informative, enlightening, and a great space to be able to talk openly about and learn the history of race relations in the U.S."
