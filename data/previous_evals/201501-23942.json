    "Where to begin...this class was probably the most amazing opportunity I have had at Yale. Jake Halpern is a hotshot journalist who takes you under your wing and allows you to soar. He helps you realize how difficult narrative journalism is, but also helps you improve. He keeps pushing you so that you'll feel good when you earn his respect. Even though his stories are far better than anything you're writing, he treats you like a colleague in terms of how he gives you feedback. If you are an aspiring journalist, take this course!",
    "DEFINITELY take the class. The small size of the class and evaluating the other students' writing was really fun, Professor Halpern picked a lot of really relevant magazine articles and brought in really cool guests to classes, and had the best feedback on our writing of any teacher I've ever had. He also brought us coffee for every early morning class and people rotated bringing in breakfast foods! Definitely made me a better writer and Professor Halpern definitely knows his stuff.",
    "Having absolutely no experience in journalism whatsoever, I think this was a beautiful introduction into this very specific type of writing. Professor Halpern did a great job of making the class terribly interactive, and the readings are not only doable, but enjoyable. Moreover, the assignments were quite straightforward and a great opportunity to venture out of the New Haven bubble. All together, I really enjoyed this course. I felt like I learned a lot and would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "Amazing course! If you get in, take it. Halpern not only an excellent writer, but a great teacher and editor of student work. I've learned more about journalism in this one semester about journalism than I've learned in all four years. If you aren't passionate about journalism, this isn't the class for you; the workload is heavy and Halpern is exacting.",
    "I would recommend this class! This is a really good opportunity to get more journalistic experience and do some cool reporting around New Haven. You will also read and discuss a great collection of articles.",
    "A very practical seminar in journalism- you'll discuss ethics, potential mistakes in interviewing, how to avoid these mistakes, how to source early and well- definitely very, very helpful to those interested in a career in journalism. A fun seminar as well- the readings were great, and the professor is excellent. Funny, and clear."
