   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal in terms of literary analysis and themes in French literature. It was a thoroughly enjoyable course.",
    "I certainly learned how to read more effectively in French. I think since the course exposed us to many types of books and poetry, I learned what to look for according to what kind of text I read. I feel I have a lot more confidence in my capacity to critically analyse a series of different French texts and a way to express my analysis with new vocabulary.",
    "I improved a great amount in my ability to read and listen in French. I was pleasantly surprised to notice this. The class was 100% in French with no exceptions really, which was unique for me and incredibly helpful.",
    "I got a small taste of many works in different time periods in France. It was a bit of a chocolate sampler of a class, but overall my reading speed, analytical skills, and writing ability definitely improved a lot!",
    "This course was a great introduction to French literature and improved my French reading and writing.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of French literature and the lives of French writers. I refined my writing skills in French, expanded my vocabulary, and improved my ability to analyze works of literature."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure if this class has any weaknesses. Professor Pinzka was a marvelous teacher who made it clear that she was thoroughly invested in the material. She gave great feedback for student presentations and essays and was eager to answer student questions outside of class.",
    "Strengths are certainly Professor Pinzka. She came to every class excited and with a series of questions and ways to galvanize exciting discussion. Even if the material seemed empty, she inspired us to pull out every piece of information and significance we could. In terms of places of improvement, I think at the beginning of the semester the amount of reading proved to be a lot more palatable and manageable than the amount by the end of the semester. I felt a bit overwhelmed with having to read an entire book in just a few days, and I often found myself falling behind. I think if the curriculum cut perhaps 2 or 3 books so the end of the semester did not feel so hurried, it would serve the class well.",
    "A great course, but due to the introductory nature of it, perhaps don't expect to go super in-depth in a lot of topics. Otherwise great class! Madame Pinzka is very helpful.",
    "I thought that this course had a great mix of French literature, but could be improved with a wider range of mediums, such as movies.",
    "This course had a demanding, but not outlandish workload. The work was fulfilling. I loved the discussions, though a little variety would do the course some good; it was kind of easy to tune out while classmates were talking. The selected works were very interesting as well. I tended to like them more as the semester went on."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is as passionate about learning French as I am. It is an amazing introduction to French literature.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in improving analytical skills for many types of French text, take this course. If you can, take it with Mme Pinzka - she is exceptional. It also is an excellent gateway into the French major.",
    "If you are a more Humanities focused person, this class could be good for you. As a literature class, you read through a number of plays, poems, and short stories and discuss and analyze them in pretty great detail, extracting major themes.",
    "I would recommend this class, don't be intimidated! You really do end up improving a lot and getting a lot more comfortable with French and Literature.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their French reading and writing,",
    "Yes, I would! It's a very effective introduction to French literature. The works are interesting, the discussions are in-depth and insightful, and it's really nice to learn about essential non-English canon. You have to keep up with the reading and the responses, but staying on top of the workload isn't difficult if you budget your time."
