   "comments": [
    "AMAZING lectures, AMAZING books.",
    "Take it! Lots of reading, but great books and great format for reading and learning new things about them.",
    "Lots of reading but it's books you won't bother with without the class. Worth it, but probably a smart credit\/d (i am)",
    "I absolutely would - specifically, to any English majors who are serious about laying a expansive foundation for themselves. I haven't encountered any seminars that balance historical context and close-reading so consistently and thoroughly. It's AMAZING - this course is what lectures are for. Yeazell's readings are fascinating, too. They interlock and augment each other, inter-textually. And she has an interesting concentration of psychoanalytic readings, which I wasn't expecting and learned a lot from.",
    "If one is interested in gaining exposure to some of the best and most readable English literature, I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "I'd recommend English 265. Professor Yeazell is an amazing lecturer: she's so enthusiastic about the material, and the critical sources she incorporates into lectures are interesting and relevant. She refers to the text a lot, reading from passages many times: it's a pleasure to hear her read aloud. The books are great, and really made me more interested in Victorian literature. That being said, they are obviously VERY LONG. Don't take this class if you have a very reading-intensive semester: I couldn't devote enough time to the books, and was really disappointed that I didn't. I also found the exams rather purposeless: the midterm especially felt like regurgitation, and a like a race simply to get everything written out. Overall, though, it was a great class, and you should take it!",
    "Take this class if you love to read these kinds of books -- the reading load is HEAVY but they are all great novels.",
    "If you've an affinity for the Victorians, take this class. Even if you've read them already. The texts are delightful portraits of human nature and quotidian meaning--lengthy, certainly, but reading them hardly feels like work. And Professor Yeazell is wonderful, witty, clear-spoken, insightful. She deftly takes the form of the novel in all its sprawling glory and finds the spiderwebs of interlaced motifs and meaning that are hardly noticeable on one's first read-through. It was well worth the while to learn from her.",
    "I don't know -- I wanted to love The Victorian Novel more than I did. Yeazell is great, sure, engaging and funny and articulate, but a lot of the lectures were about \"themes in the novel\" or \"historical context.\" If you're looking for cool, unexpected close readings and various lit theory - type things, this class might feel a little stale. Middlemarch is perfect, however. Read Middlemarch.",
    "Victorian novel is a good course. If you have the opportunity to get ahead on the reading, do it - otherwise it gets very relentless and you get behind. The books were all excellent (except maybe Middlemarch but I know I'm in the minority on that). Grading is a little harsh - CR\/D could be a good option.",
    "I definitely recommend this course! You couldn't ask for a better lecturer than Professor Yeazell, and the syllabus is truly excellent. If you're looking to read wonderful prose, and think deeply about it after every lecture, you should sign up now.",
    "I'd recommend this class. Professor Yeazell is fantastic and lectures are very interesting. Be warned that there is a deceptively large amount of reading. Make sure you stay on top of it (use spring break to catch up).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! You will read fantastic books, listen to great lectures, and emerge a more well-rounded student. A must for any English major or general lover of fine literature.",
    "This is a must-take class for any English major. It gives a comprehensive understanding of the Victorian period while also accounting for shifts from Romanticism to Realism and from Realism to Modernism. The syllabus is wonderful and Professor Yeazell is a brilliant lecturer. I would recommend this class to anyone who likes good books or wants a better understanding of them. However, there is a LOT of reading and you will be tested on it, so buy the books in advance if possible.",
    "Heavy reading load (we went through the books pretty quickly), but a lot of fun! Really interesting lectures and books, not too much work (2 papers, 1 midterm, 1 final).",
    "Great teachers, but lots of reading that can sometimes be dry. If you're not extremely interested in English novels, this course isn't for you. You must read all the books to get anything from this class.",
    "A good course, interesting readings if you're engaged with the time period and like long novels.",
    "Very interesting course on Victorian novels, but because of how much reading there is I strongly recommend Credit\/D\/Failing. It is just IMPOSSIBLE to read every single page especially on the weeks with papers. The midterm and final is also very difficult if you haven't done the reading, because there are passage identifications from a tiny snippet of the book. Yeazell gives great lectures, she has a good representative set of books (after this course you will know for sure if you love or hate Victorian novels). Angus was a decent TF - he really knows his stuff and is very reasonable in his expectations. However, I've heard from other students that they go over major theme \/ plot points, while Angus gets pretty stuck on little passages and analysis. That's his style, take it as you will - I know some people who love it, and some people who hate that.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! the books are wonderful - some romantic, some funny, some tragic, some relentlessly illuminating... some have changed the way I see my own life and others around me! (read Middlemarch!) To be able to read these books with Prof Yeazell is a real privilege.",
    "Secrets, double lives Yeazell rocks her leather pants Books you'll read again",
    "This class can be a lot of fun, but you have to be willing to put in the reading time. If dense novels are not your thing, or you are taking a lot of reading-heavy classes, don't take this on as well. If, on the other hand, you enjoy the material and can devote the proper time and energy to reading a 500-page novel in two weeks, you should absolutely take it. Professor Yeazell is a lot of fun and it's a good chance to cover some classics that can be hard to take on on your own.",
    "Great survey course of all the novels you say you're going to read but never actually will if not forced to by a syllabus. Yeazell is a phenomenal lecturer who never fails to keep a cogent argument going for the full 50 minutes. Recommend if you're willing to put in the time to do all the reading (often ~100 pages a day towards the second half of the course).",
    "Victorian Novels is an awesome course! Professor Yeazell is wonderful and the coolest! Every lecture was insightful, interesting, and delivered beautifully. The reading load is heavy, but manageable! Definitely take it!",
    "If you're interested in the novels the course is great but it's a lot of reading if you don't like the books.",
    "Take it for fun! It provides a little bit of structure to reading books you may have already read or hope to read someday outside of a class.",
    "This is a great way to read six excellent books. I took it CR\/D at it was so worth it-- as a good friend once told me: you'll never regret reading these books. And being able to enjoy the books without the pressure of grades was awesome. That being said, it is still a great class. Yeazell is an amazing lecturer and you will get so much more out of these books by taking a class with her!!",
    "Yes of course!",
    "Victorian novel is a terrific survey course for anyone interested in the novel and specifically the development of the British novel in the 19th century. Professor Yeazell is a terrific and fascinating lecturer\u2014her lectures focus on close readings of passages, which she seamlessly ties into larger themes of the work and the course. The course is a lot of reading, but it is enjoyable reading for anyone who loves novels!"
