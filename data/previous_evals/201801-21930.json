    "I learned lots about the Russian language. It helped me gain more confidence speaking Russian and we learned a lot about 19th century Russia from the course packet readings.",
    "Russian language, especially vocabulary about political endeavors, news, and war.",
    "Russian language, mostly about wars, news, and political events.",
    "I greatly improved my Russian reading, writing, and speaking skills. I also gained a greater appreciation for 18th-century Russian history and, more generally, Russian culture.",
    "Advanced Russian grammar concepts, along with improved speaking, reading, and listening skills. We also learned about Russian imperial history from 1801 to 1881."

   "comments": [
    "This course is fantastic, like nut. Very small section, only about 7 people. Individualized attention and fast-paced curriculum allows you to learn a lot. After this course, much of what you need to become fluent is more practice and learning more vocabulary, particularly verbs.",
    "it's a good course - enough said",
    "Very organized course. Would have liked more conversation-oriented class as opposed to grammar-centric lectures. Overall, fantastic course.",
    "strengths: small class size forces students to be engaged throughout class, informal environment with rich connection to the professor was effective motivation to do well, intensive nature of grammatical study forces students to think critically about the grammar weaknesses: grammar was very complex, so historical and colloquial additional focuses of the class felt like distractions from the central material of the grammar, resulting in rushed understandings of history and grammar suggestions for improvement: cut one of the additional focuses, or limit focus to only one of the two grammar units of the semester",
    "I thought that overall this was a really good class; my Russian definitely improved dramatically, and we learned a lot every day in class. I will say that I think we tried to fit too much into the end of the semester (the last week was really jam-packed), and in general there tended to be periods when we had just a massive amount of work compared with the rest of the semester (unit tests and oral tests and home-reading assignments tended to all coincide), which was a bit overwhelming. I think if the work load was spread out a little more evenly the course (and the students!) would really benefit a lot. I also felt like my speaking skills did deteriorate a little; we did spend some class time speaking and having normal conversations, but I think devoting more time to just talking to each other every day would've been really helpful for developing better speech fluency."

    "TAKE IT",
    "Yes I would recommend 10x, no 100x. This course is the bomb and everyone should take Russian.",
    "Yes, the work can be difficult and long if you do it right, but the vocabulary is super helpful for keeping up with current events.",
    "The work can be difficult in long if done right, but it is also rewarding if you do. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Absolutely, this course is thoughtfully designed to facilitate student learning.",
    "Yes. This is a very good course for students looking to improve their Russian reading and writing skills.",
    "yes if the student was interested in challenging themselves in their study of Russian grammar",
    "Yes; your Russian really does improve an amazing amount, and Professor Muravnik is such a kind, helpful teacher. The workload does go from 0 to 60 really fast so be aware of that, but overall I'd say this was a really good language class."
