    "Short discussions of grammar at the beginning of the class could be expanded, with deconstructions of example sentences, as well as more directed acquisition of relevant vocabulary.",
    "Class is very much a \"practical\" crash course in reading Old French. If you would struggle to read a manuscript, and have limited modern French skills, it might be a little overwhelming. That being said, I found it very enjoyable, and after the first few weeks, I didn't feel that I needed to stress very much in preparing for the class. Grammatical instruction was a little strange, generally just reading out loud of grammatical charts, so can't say I really grasped much of that beyond what I inferred from class and my knowledge of normal French.",
    "strengths: manuscript choice (language, story, drawings), fabliaux weaknesses: discussions on medieval literature and culture during the last class were great, I wish there had been more of them before!"
