    "if you're interested in rivers and deep ecology, it's a cool class. not the most structured, though.",
    "I don't know if I can categorize this class - there wasn't a lot of anthropology in it, there was some history and some political science and I guess some \"environmental studies,\" but overall it was an incredible intellectual experience. The wide range of people in the seminar (undergraduates from at least six different majors, grad\/professional students from three different schools, people from four different countries) meant that we discussed all sorts of things from all sorts of angles at once, which I realized is really rare.This class has no assignments other than the final paper, but there is a lot of reading every week, and Professor Scott calls on people at random to lead discussion, so you have to have done the reading and prepared to lead discussion.I wouldn't say I got a comprehensive education about rivers, but I would say that my ideas about something as seemingly simple and fundamental as what a river is changed completely.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Absolutely -- I looked forward to seminar discussions. Readings were interesting, and the material has actually shaped my thinking about nature and politics (and of course the interaction between the two)."
