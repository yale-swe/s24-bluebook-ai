    "If you actually want to learn biology, do not take the class. Many times students complain that the lectures area waste of time and that they never have to do the reading for the take home exams.If you can find self-motivation to learn something from some of the best scientific minds in the world, then invest in the class and ignore the people falling asleep around you. You will be rewarded with good grades and the privilege to listen to these smart people.",
    "becareful of the takehomes. they can be an absolute curse. thought it would be an easy A, but im just hoping for a b now. very tough. but a learning experience, and a unique way to go about the material",
    "I would recommend it as a relatively easy biology class. Not the most interesting, but fine overall.",
    "Eh, you should probably take Cell Bio. It's more structured and will count for more for MCDB major\/pre med\/whatever. This is one of those classes where you don't realize how terrible it is until after reading period. The tests are unfairly graded, the lectures are unorganized, and section is always random.",
    "This class is pretty interesting and the workload is very minimal (3 take home essays, mandatory section participation, no final exam). However, this course is not very useful in a big picture evaluation of it. It basically only counts as an elective for any science major. Further, the way that tests are graded is entirely comparative. Don't take this course if you can't write eloquently because a lot of the time it's simply a writing competition on the tests. Take this course if you are interested in whats being taught and want a chill class though!",
    "Review of central dogma. Recommended if you are really interested in molecular biology.",
    "I would recommend Mol Bio if you want to take a bio class, but don't want to jump right into cell bio. I took AP bio, so most of it was a review, but with more detail thrown in. The class is relaxed and the teachers are nice, so I definitely suggest it.",
    "No, unless needed as a prereq. Very basic info taught in an uninteresting way.",
    "Disorganized! Last time I took mol. bio before this was ninth grade honors bio. This class was not necessarily a mistake for me, but aside from the biology content itself, it really was quite disastrous.",
    "Whether or not to take this course entirely depends on what you want to get out of it. It is not an intro bio course. Keep in mind that this course is completely about DNA, RNA and protein. We went into a lot a detail about topics such as RNA splicing and the machinery of DNA replication. If you aren't interested in these subjects, this course will probably be very dry for you. I would not recommend this class to someone who is trying to fulfill a science requirement. However, if you need this class for premed or other requirements, this class has several benefits. First of all, there are three take-home tests and no final. The tests take about 10 hours and it helps to have done the reading in advance. Also, the professor announced in class that his final grade distribution will bring the average to somewhere between an A- and a B+. It is entirely possible to do well in this course, if you go to section, participate, do the reading and spend time on the tests. Section is interesting if you have a good TA (Justin is the best, if he's still around) and may help you figure out if you're interested in this type of research.",
    "The class was okay. The discussion papers for section each week can be annoying, but if you take enough time on them and come prepared for section it pays off. The workload is manageable due to the take-home tests. However, they are essay based and while open-note can be difficult if you're feeling lost in the course already. Take it if you must, but for the MCDB major I would maybe suggest just moving on to genetics or cell bio.",
    "There are 3 take home tests, which are pretty hard, but no final or problem sets. Each test is a quarter of your grade, with section comprising the last 25%. Every week, you are assigned a different scientific paper to review in section. If anything, I really improved in my ability in reading the primary literature through this course.",
    "A good introductory bio class - it does get detailed at points, so keep up with the reading.",
    "I am an econ major and I took this class for some reason. It's not exciting but I hear the course is valuable if you are a premed. You spend most of the year going into depth about systems from ap bio.",
    "I would recommend taking this class. The way the class is structured with three take home exams and a section grade makes it relatively low stress for a science class that covers difficult material. The curve is huge with the average being at the split between A- and B+. The class itself covers very interesting material and brings in different professors to cover the material from their respective fields. Even if you're not pre-med or a biology major, it would recommend taking this class.",
    "I came into this course excited because I loved AP Bio so much and left disillusioned with myself and with the intent to change my major from MCDB to something else. I take full responsibility for my problem with the class, because try as I might to pay attention in lecture, I simply could not get myself to focus and follow along with the professor. I came to each lecture and tried to pay attention but inevitably my attention waned in the span of 15 minutes. The 3 take home exams were awful - I dreaded them more than any paper, test, or final in any of my other classes. And discussion section was boring, as much as the TAs tried to make them engaging\/interesting. Unless you have a burning passion for the tiny minutiae involved in molecular biology, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Only take it if you need it to fulfil some requirement, otherwise I am sure there are better classes you can take, However, it is relatively easy to get a decent grade due to the take-home nature of the three midterms, where usage of the textbook is permitted.",
    "I would say this is like any other bio lecture you're going to have--it's not the most fun in the world, but it's better than some. The teachers of this class--Dellaporta, Rodeheffer, Breaker and Pollard--are all pretty good and keep the class interesting. If you listen in lecture and take notes, taking the take home exams isn't too bad. (Although Pollard's exam was the most difficult and conceptual one of them.) In that sense, this class isn't too difficult--it's good to keep up with the readings to understand what's going on and it's good to take notes, but otherwise, the only work is the take home exams and the papers for section. The papers for section can be dense but you should definitely read them for participation credit in section. I wouldn't say this was the best bio class I've taken, but I found the lectures interesting and learned a lot. I think you get as much out of this class as you put in. If you don't pay attention in lecture or do the reading, you won't enjoy the class and it will feel like a waste and the tests will be really hard. But if you pay attention, the lectures can be fun and interesting, and the tests aren't too bad. And the professors for this course were all good interesting professors, which is sometimes hard to find.",
    "ehhhh. It is not too bad, it is not a lot of work besides for three take home exams, but its also not that interesting and kind of frustrating in its structure. You do not always know what the reading is and the classes can be pretty boring. In retrospect it was not that bad, but for awhile it was the class I dreaded to going the most.",
    "It's a good class to take if you have taken the AP Bio test in high school and gotten a 5. It gives you more in-depth knowledge of the subjects learned in AP Bio. I would recommend it as a good post-intro bio class, and good for bio majors or biomedical engineering requirements.",
    "There is a common theme through this course, and it's not molecular biology - it's that professors, TAs and students alike treat it either consciously or unconsciously as a joke. \"This is not a hard course\" said Professor Dellaporta the first day - and it certainly wasn't. Throughout the first month, I wondered if I had learned anything at all - what engaged me was material I already knew, and what put me to sleep was material that was unimportant and trivial. The TAs (or at least mine) don't appear to take Dellaporta seriously, which is something that translates to their discussion sections. It was only when lecturers changed that the course began to improve, and I began to feel like I was actually learning something. This began with Ron Breaker, who spoke about riboswitches. His lectures, though brief, were among the highlights of this course. Continuing to Rodeheffer (who was the first to distribute meaningful and helpful handouts) and concluding with Pollard, who I have the utmost respect and admiration for (he's such a charming guy, a great lecturer if you sit near the front and 'talk' with him, and absolutely brilliant) the course continued to improve, as did the bizarre take-home testing format. Take-home test answers are ranked and then assigned grades - and the grading process is entirely devoid of transparency. The test grades felt more like a game of blackjack than a science exam, though the tests themselves did get better towards the end of the year. Thank goodness for Pollard, Rodeheffer and Breaker, for doing an excellent job on their relevant sections of the course - without them, I would have considered this course a joke. Unless BIG changes are made to this course, I would not recommend it.",
    "No. Three take homes and no final, but still no. I never went to lecture after the 3rd week. I still managed to do pretty well (I think). Lectures were not useful to the take home exams, so there was really no point. Plus it was so far away. The sections at first were tedious and boring, but I started to enjoy them. You have to read one research paper a week and discuss it in section. Usually the research paper is over your head, but you work through it together. The take homes are long and annoying, and you basically spend the entire weekend working on it, but I guess the time pay off is worth it since I never went to lecture. I just overall did not enjoy the course very much. I feel like molecular biology could be better taught in other ways.",
    "It's a good overview for biology if you took AP in high school but don't feel ready for genetics or cell biology. The take-home format seemed appealing when I chose to take the class, but now that I'm done I wish it had normal tests. The take-homes were always stressful, and I feel like I put just as much work into them as I would a regular test. The downside is that I came away feeling like I didn't know as much as I would if I had simply studied all of the material for a test, because instead I focused exclusively on a few questions. I would still recommend the course, though, for anyone interested in majoring in biology, or trying to figure out if biology is right for them.",
    "Do it if you want a mostly low stress intro bio class. The take-homes are very annoying though sometimes and can be tedious. Also, reading the book does not always help.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want an easy bio. credit. Otherwise, it wasn't that inspiring. However, the textbook will probably be useful in other higher level classes that skim through this material very quickly (e.g. cell biology).",
    "Not even worth it. You wont learn anything, and probably wont get a great grade in the process.",
    "Yes - great course!",
    "I would only recommend this class if you like molecular biology. The lecturers are GREAT in this class, but because of the posted powerpoints and 3 take home tests, many students lost the urge to take notes, which definitely hindered learning.While there are take home tests (which may change next year), I would not say this class is an easy A. Because everyone has the same resources at their disposal, you are expected to write above and beyond the average answer. However, with the take home tests, I do feel like I learned more than I would have cramming the extremely vast and detailed information in my head right before the test. The class basically has no work throughout the semester except for three tests that absorb your life for 3-4 days and the weekly section readings.",
    "It's ok. Take it if you need a bio course.",
    "It's a class that isn't that much work, but the take-home tests can be very high-pressure and very time-consuming (if you want to get a good score).",
    "The fact that the exams are take home does not mean that they are easy. In fact, they are graded pretty harshly.",
    "Many premeds take this course and are very concerned about their grade, even though the grading seemed pretty easy. This year (and other previous years) all the exams were take-home. When you take it, try to find out first (if it matters to you), since Prof. Dellaporta discovered that students were cheating and might change the exams to in-class, which would change the course dynamic and make it less relaxed.",
    "No. Don't take. Horrible. Badly graded. Badly taught. Don't learn anything.",
    "Interesting content but the lectures started to be boring towards the end. The format of the class was not conducive to retaining the information so I would take cell bio instead.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student as you will learn very little. However, it is a pretty simple course and not too difficult. If you want to learn a lot (and work a lot too), skip to cell bio.",
    "Highly recommended. Low stress and interesting material.",
    "If you're interested in bio and are looking for an intro bio class that is not too basic then this is a good course for you.",
    "Great bio class for those who aren't into a lot of memorization, though there were problems with cheating this go around, and the class may not be based on take-home exams next time.",
    "It's a really chill class.",
    "Molecular Biology is a decent review and elaboration on the concepts of the central dogma, especially for those who want to wait before taking Cell Biology, but I felt that the class was poorly organized this semester. The first 8 weeks, taught by Professor Dellaporta, were interesting and informative, but the rest of the course seemed haphazardly put together. Spending one week on riboswitches (though very interesting, Professor Breaker was excellent) followed by three lectures on proteins and then ending with basic biophysics and research, each with different professors, was confusing and distracting. Outside of the opening weeks, I never felt like we learned more than some basic review concepts. This course could be much better without as much team-teaching and more organization\u0097most students in this class have a 5 on AP Biology (or equivalent), and I think they\u0092re sufficiently prepared to handle some more difficult, interesting material. The take-home tests could be a worthwhile assessment, but they cause students to lack motivation and not get much out of the class. Exam grading also seemed to be without explanation\u0097I never knew why I got 3\/5 on one essay question but 5\/5 on another\u0097it seemed to be arbitrary. Submitting this evaluation, I still don\u0092t have a great idea of what my grade will be (though it\u0092s roughly a split between As and Bs for the class, so don\u0092t be too worried). The mandatory section, however, was very helpful and probably my favorite part of the class, though I know that others didn\u0092t like it. Shannon was an engaging section leader, and I found the papers (especially in the later weeks) to be a great exercise in learning how to read research. Overall, MCDB200 could be a great class with some improvements.",
    "I would recommend this course for people interested in biology who haven't been trained thoroughly in the subject, otherwise I would recommend taking cell biology instead.",
    "This class is not a lot of wok at all but once the exams come around prepare for a not so fun weekend.",
    "Not the most interesting class, but it depends on your individual investment in the class. If you want, you don't ever have to show up to lecture or read the book (until it's time to look up the answers for the 3 take home exams). I'd advise going to class though - the professors are pretty good lecturers (especially Dellaporta). Sections are mandatory, however, and the exams are time consuming (4 essay questions). There was a problem with cheating though, so the exams may no longer be take home next year. No final though!!",
    "I'm torn on whether to recommend this course. To be honest, if you're really into bio, I would recommend taking the plunge and trying Cell bio even if you're a freshman, especially if you did well in AP bio. The only reason I didn't take Cell bio was because of a schedule conflict, which I slightly regret. This course was very little work, but I correspondingly feel like I learned very little. However, if you're extremely self-motivated, you can potentially get a lot out of this course; you get out what you put in. If you want a nice, easy introduction to the bio department to get a feel for whether you're interested in molecular biology topics, then this is a pretty good course to take. The discussion sections (in which we discussed seminal molecular biology papers) were very useful and interesting. The take-home tests (a format which may or may not change in the future) sometimes had trickily-worded questions and took a long time to complete, but having to craft essay answers definitely helped cement my understanding of some of the concepts.",
    "I don't feel like I learned anything from this class. The PowerPoint lectures were so hard to focus on, and the only time I did anything for the class was for take-home tests. The questions on the take-home tests were almost never in the textbook or in the powerpoints, so I could not learn much there. Also, we never got any feedback on the tests, and the grading felt completely arbitrary. Even though I never took AP Biology or an intro bio course at Yale, I wished that I had taken MCDB 120 or cell biology instead.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who wants a review of AP Bio before taking Cell Bio.",
    "This biology class is all about writing. 75% of your grade are essay-question tests. (Open booked essay questions, so really everyone knows the same information its just about how well you can convey your ideas effectively in 600 or so words).",
    "A mid-range course in Biology which is divided equally between DNA, RNA, and Proteins. Sometimes the lectures are a littletedious, but a lot of interesting material is covered. I would recommend this course to another student so long as he or she understands that the take home exams will take all weekend.",
    "Course needs some restructuring in terms of reviewing the value of having take-home exams.",
    "A WASTE OF A CLASS. I'm very serious about this, and it's not because I'm bitter about grades (I'm almost certain that I got an A). The structure of the class is such that you will learn laughably little about biology over the course of the semester. Take-home tests mean that you will not keep up with the reading. Lectures are not always terrible, but they are far from inspiring and almost always boring (I frequently just got up and left early). And because you haven't done any of the reading before lecture you get nothing out of them. Then every month comes a take-home test, and you will spend hours looking back in the book and through the lecture slides to figure out what has been going on for the past 4 weeks. You'll learn four topics decently well (you answer 4 of 5 questions), then you rinse and repeat. This is completely stupid. You're at YALE for pete's sake, is this really the best you can do? Now, let's say you're in the vanishingly small minority of people that will actually keep up with the reading. Should you take this class? Maybe, but if you're going to do work in a biology class then just man up and take cell bio! The ONLY person I would recommend this class to is a pre-med looking for a completely bullshit and worthless biology credit (and MAYBE to a freshman that wants to take the corresponding lab to get ready to do research). Bio majors are just wasting their time, and you're a fool if you take this class because you think it will be interesting. In summary: please, please do not take this class.",
    "THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD EVER RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. I wish I hadn't taken this class. I wish I hadn't taken this class. I wish I hadn't taken this class. I felt like I wasted my time, was still graded subjectively (I don't know how I did), and didn't learn. Seriously, don't take this class!!! If you're taking it just as a 'light class' instead of cell bio, just don't take it at all. Save your breath. Also, save your grade. Save your time. Save your soul. I can't believe MCDB200 happened to me.",
    "Good into bio class. Depending on the professor teaching each class, lectures could be boring or super interesting. I liked the take home tests although I would have liked to see more feedback from the TAs. Not much work at all, just textbook reading (if you want) and take homes.",
    "Molecular Biology grades are determined by three take home exams and section attendance\/participation. In the take home exams the graders expect you to be VERY thorough. I didn't like the take home format at all, but considering the wide scope of the course, that method is probably for the best. Don't waste your time doing all the readings, just wait until the exam is assigned then find what you need to answer the questions.Professor Dellaporta is a nice guy, but I don't think I learned a whole lot from him. Professor Rodeheffer, however, was excellent. I definitely recommend him as an instructor. Professor Pollard is okay too. His powerpoint slides were detailed enough to study from and he always wanted to answer questions and clarify things in class.",
    "Don't take it. Not as interesting or easy as it sounds.",
    "This class is not particularly useful. Due to the reliance on take-home exams as the primary method of evaluation, there is not much incentive to do the reading for the sake of learning. I only cracked open the textbook during the take-home exam period. Be warned, though, the class may seem easy going because there are no homework assignments given out, but take-home weekend is ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL. Expect all-nighters. The professors are all okay, however, lectures help you learn more but many opt to skip lecture all-together..If youwant a quick science credit, take it. If you are premed, cell bio might actually teach you more than this class would."
