   "comments": [
    "I loved this course with Vysosias! As long as she can see that you truly are working very hard in her class, she'll be understanding and sweet while still teaching you French as much as possible.",
    "I would summarize it as a fun, discussion based class. You do have to do most written work outside of class in order to get in oral practice during class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A standard french class for students coming out of taking French in high school. No surprises, no new grammar. Interesting books - Monsieur Ibrahim, L'Etranger. Interesting films: L'argent de poche, Jules et Jimes. But there was a repeated book for me: Le Petit Nicolas. If you're placed into L3, don't be worried. It's not bad, and doesn't mean you're bad.",
    "French 130 is a straight-forward intermediate French course. Be prepared to meet everyday including during Reading Week. It is well taught and if you pay attention during class, almost no studying is required to ace the tests.",
    "This course is a good review of basic grammar, but very little speaking which is a shame. I feel like my speaking skills got worse. If you can, take it with Mme Vysosias - she's a great teacher and not too strict. Also, if you actually do all of the work, this class has a lot of it.",
    "French 130 will give you the opportunity to learn French at an intermediate level in a very structured way. It's quite a bit of work, but the pace is manageable. The books are fun to read and the professors are good. Frequent tests means frequent study."
