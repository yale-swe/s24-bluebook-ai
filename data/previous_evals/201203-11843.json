    "Voice lessons for credit. Simple as that. Workload is what you make it and how much you want to get out of lessons.",
    "It's voice lessons for credit. YMMV depending on who you are assigned as your teacher.",
    "There isn't too much to say about this, if you took voice lessons before Yale, this is very similar.",
    "Definitely take it if you have the music theory credits. It's basically free credit, and a great GPA boost if you need it.",
    "Voice lessons for students are a great opportunity. There is not much work involved besides practicing, and it's a nice break from the rest of your schedule if you've got an academic-heavy schedule. I don't really sing classical, so it was nice to be put in a situation where I had to learn to sing classically. I felt like I definitely improved significantly, which is the real takeaway. I'm not sure why it's a full credit when science labs are only a half credit, though o_o",
    "No reason not to take advantage of the lessons program at Yale. Both my teachers (Jorge Prego and Kyle Stegall) have been extraordinarily talented singers and very pleasant teachers.",
    "The voice lesson program has been the highlight of my Yale academic career. Never before has a class impacted (to such an extent) not only my mind, but also my body. Scott Mello is the best teacher I've had at Yale. He gives a detailed explanation of the anatomical systems involved in my singing so that I may better understand what is happening when I sing, rather than filling my head with useless metaphors. He regularly asks if I have any auditions coming up in case I want to meet outside our regular meeting times to go over some audition songs. If you qualify to take the class, definitely take it!",
    "If you are at all interested in singing, take this! You improve your singing and for credit at that!"
