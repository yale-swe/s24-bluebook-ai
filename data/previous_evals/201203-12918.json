    "ABSOLUTELY! There is VERY little (written) work for this class, so you get to spend the majority of class time actually dancing. It's so nice to get credit for working a different part of your brain, and you really do learn a lot.",
    "Take it! There is no other class like this at Yale! The out-of-class work is minimal and being in class the time goes so quickly.",
    "Yes take it! Not much work. Majority is the dance portion. There is discussion every week but you can get by with skimming. End of term was a reflection on dance. You will learn lots of cool dance movements and choreographic techniques! Also may learn a thing or two about African music!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Happiest decision of my life. You dance twice a week. You learn the difference between traditional and contemporary West African Dance, and get to practice the movement. At the end, you use all the techniques you've learned to improvise. You are assigned reading once a week, and a paper at the end. But it's all VERY manageable. Take it!",
    "Yes. Lasso is an awesome instructor. He is so encouraging and helpful for ALL levels of dance experience. The course is not a lot of book work, just a lot of dance time, which is such a nice break from the usual Yale schedule.",
    "If you want to learn West African dance, yes, but you may not know what West African dance is, as I did not. I'm extremely passionate about dance, so that's why I took it, but my dance styles range from jazz to ballet to hip hop. I discovered that West African dance is not my style, and as a result, I did not enjoy it as much.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS FOR AN EASY\/CHILL HU CREDIT",
    "Take this class. As a senior, it is one of the best experiences I've had at Yale. There is no way you will regret dancing 4 hours every week in a studio with an amazing professor and amazing music.",
    "A really fun class! 3-4 hours of dancing a week and sometimes 1 hour of discussion (but we often danced instead). A great break from the Yale grind. You will have no idea what grade you are going to receive. Yale needs more dance classes like this!",
    "i would definitely recommend it. just get ready to put your dancing shoes on. lol.",
    "It's a unique experience and you learn really cool dance moves, so why not? It may be challenging, so go for it! And it's not a that much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I had no dance experience and still had a great time and felt that I could pick up the steps. It is a humanities requirement as well so if you are looking to fulfill a humanities requirement definitely take this class!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student. You go to class and dance. Enough said.",
    "Yes. You dont really learn about the names and history of the dances but it's fun dancing different styles. It's low key and enjoyable.",
    "The class is fun and you don't have to be a great dancer to enjoy it. I would recommend taking the class if you need a break from challenging courses with lots of homework and papers.",
    "This is a great class that I would recommend for everyone who has a chance to take it, regardless of your dance ability (I had none). It is definitely worth it to have something in your schedule that is so different from your other classes that it allows you to relax and enjoy yourself for a while each week. You certainly won't regret it."
