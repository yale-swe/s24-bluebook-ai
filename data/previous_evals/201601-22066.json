    "HIST431 is the epitome of the Yale College seminar. Dr. Stephens marshaled the discussion effectively, allowing students to take the lead but interjecting with useful comments at apposite moments. The reading list was strong, and there was substantive engagement with methods and themes in history (as a departmental seminar should accomplish). All in all, a highly impressive class which I would strongly recommend -- definitely one of the best I have taken at Yale",
    "ABSOLUTLEY.",
    "Family and Empire is a class that focuses on the European and Asian Empires. Looking at the theme of family, we discussed issues of gender, race, power within colonial settings. As much as this class was about Family and Empire, it was also about micro history. Most of the books that we read were engaging, narrative-style histories that focus on a family or individual to understand broad historical trends. This class is a great way to deeply think about what historians do and the variety of ways to be a historian.",
    "If you like to read and like the history of people, take this class!!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Stephens is hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. The class is very broad and covers a large range of topics, but centers around the themes of microhistories and how to conceptualize writing history. It will change how you view your historical subjects and make you want to write better papers (I wanted to re-write all papers I had ever written with this class in mind). Professor Stephens is also very good at incorporating other disciplines into this history class. If you are good with statistical analysis and computer programming, this could be an interesting way to use that skill in a non-stem environment. I easily rank this into the top classes I have ever taken.",
    "Family and Empire examines the relationship between family and empire, the (often artificial) boundaries between public and private life and the role of subaltern subjects in history. Beyond that, Family and Empire gives you experience with a range of historical writing (journalistic accounts, microhistories, family histories, etc). This class also helped me understand how historians do archival research and let me begin to develop those skills through the final paper."
