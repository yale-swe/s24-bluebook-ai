    "It's an interesting course that I am glad I took. Pairs of students took turns presenting the material which got annoying after a while.Lots of reading.Professor Brotherton is great - he's very engaged with students, very informed in all aspects of medical anthropology and is very accessible to students. He offered great ideas on the final paper and helped direct students to relevant readings that aligned with their interests. He was also great at letting students express their ideas and bringing up both sides of each argument.",
    "Perhaps. I enjoyed some of the books, not all by any means. I think it is good to practice critical analysis though.",
    "Take it. Great readings, great professor, not hard. Medical anthropology comes into focus in this class.",
    "this is a seminar course on medical anthro, it involves a lot more reading and writing than the intro to med anthro lecture, and you definitely learn something new even if you have taken the lecture course. i would recommend it because it was an interesting course. i felt like i was intellectually challenged but at the same time the work load was not overwhelming",
    "warmly recommended, but is not a walk in the park.",
    "Definitely. If you are interested in Medical Anthropology in any way, you should take this class. Great class, great prof, great material.",
    "Take this class! It's a great overview of large issues in medical anthropology. While some of the readings can be a bit dry, most of them are interesting, and Professor Brotherton (if he's still teaching it) is awesome.",
    "I would recommend it only if you like medical anthropology from a theoretical standpoint. As someone who lives medical anthropology from an activist standpoint, it was a little frustrating.",
    "This is a great course. If you're interested in Medical Anthropology, and you want to go beyond some exposure to Paul Farmer, you'll find it in this class. Of course, there's quite a bit of reading each week (approximately 150 pages) and a reading response as well, but it's very doable. Most of the books had some great ethnographies, so they're quite easy to read. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Overall I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in either medicine or anthropology, it will provide an extremely useful perspective on either or both of these topics. The workload is typical of a seminar, about one book each week (although some of these are ethnographies so they read quickly) with a long reading response and a final paper. Especially for someone who has been exposed to medical anthropology in the past, this class is great because it goes into greater depth than any other at Yale. But even if one hasn't yet been exposed to this material I think he\/she would get a lot out of this course.",
    "yes. read some very interesting things. some texts could be eliminated but overall was great.",
    "Topics in Medical Anthropology is a must-take course for anyone interested in medicine and\/or anthropology. Professor Brotherton is a great professor who really challenges the views of his students. The course isn't too demanding (a typical seminar). Professor Brotherton also holds a mini in-class conference at the end of the semester showcasing students' final projects."
