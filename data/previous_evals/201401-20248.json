    "MATH 120 focuses on problems with geometric interpretations. You will learn how to evaluate integrals over areas and volumes of various forms. You will also be introduced to vector calculus (fundamental theorem of gradients, stoke's theorem, divergence theorem), which has the potential to convert complex (or even impossible) calculations into trivial ones (which is probably the most interesting part of the course). Midterms are very ace-able, but only if you know what you're doing. That is, you will need to use some tricks to get through the exams (but you ARE introduced to all of them). Wouldn't recommend you take this if you're just thinking you want to take the 'next math' class. You might find this a waste. Would recommend if you're interested in math or the sciences. Teaches you how to use multi-variable and vector calculus in 3D dimensions. Invaluable for physics students, as understanding the material in this class is instrumental to understanding Maxwell's equations.",
    "Take it if you have to, no one wants to be there",
    "Don't take it if you're just looking for a QR credit. If you're interested in math, then yes, by all means--and try to take it with Kyle. Guy's a bro and a very solid teacher who wants you to succeed. Course moves pretty fast but if you keep up with the problem sets and show up to class you'll be fine. Tests are reasonable.",
    "Pretty much no choice for most people. If really interested in math, don't take it.",
    "math 120 is a exactly what it sounds like-multivariable calc. i would recommend this for those interested in math. even with my love for math, it was a challenging at times so don't take it unless you really want to dig in.",
    "I would, especially if someone were looking to explore further into the field of mathematics.",
    "Straightforward progression of multivariable calculus. Take it if you need it, not for fun.",
    "plicable to the real world, and it's nice to take after having learned calculus because it allowed me to take everything one step further. I would recommend this class to students who enjoyed calculus.",
    "It's math, if you like math, then you'lll like this course if it's not, then probs not. I mean if it's spring and your need it take it.",
    "Some of the concepts were SO cool. I would recommend this I guess as a pre-req for future classes but in and of itself I dont know if I would recommend it since we never really get a conceptual undertstanding of anything. Its more just mass produced calculus .",
    "Every time someone chooses a gut science over 120, god poisons a kitten. The material in this class can be beautiful, it's well taught (take it with Miki or Kyle), and it's very doable.",
    "I would summarize MATH 120 as a very intense, fast-paced introduction to high level that will require a lot of time and energy to keep up with, but can be very rewarding. I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested or particularly good at math, and if neither of those are true I would still recommend it, just with a strong warning of the courses' difficulty."
