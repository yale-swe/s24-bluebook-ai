    "If you are serious about journalism, and ready to throw lots of time into your reporting and writing, take this class. You will put in lots of time and get LOTS of improvement out of it.",
    "I mean if you get in you literally have to taken this class.",
    "This is a great writing class. Everyone who applies to a writing class knows that already. What else can I say?",
    "A dive into long-form magazine reporting for aspiring journalists. The two long-form projects you'll tackle for this course can be daunting when you consider that they will overlap and (hello) you're a full-time student. Professor Strebeigh will encourage you to zip off to the ends of New England in your reporting and you should! It makes the class amillion times more interesting for you and your classmates, who will intensively workshop both of your pieces.For our group, it was a rapid-fire, often zany, always enjoyable experience. Strebeigh liked to say that you'll never have as many smart readers and editors in a room as you have in this course. He's right.If you take advantage of the two-draft rule to write adventurously and write thoughtful comments for your classmates, you will be rewarded.",
    "Wonderful class-- take it if you have the opportunity to. One of the few classes I've taken at Yale in which I genuinely felt that I learned more about how to write.",
    "Definitely take it if you have any serious interest in journalism\/writing. You will love it. But if you're not going to put in the work -- and it's a lot -- don't subject yourself to the stress of the class, and don't waste your classmates' time in workshop.",
    "Take it. Your sense of how to structure a story will improve. Keep in mind that it is a lot though.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you get in. It has been the best writing course I've taken at Yale.",
    "You'll probably only get in if you're an editor or if you've written something amazing for a publication already. Take this if you're interested in the parts of writing the course's title focuses on: voice and structure. There's a lot of revision involved, which I dreaded beforehand but got good at by the end of the class. I loved reading my peers' works as well as getting to hear writers like Ian Frazier and getting critiqued by editor Henry Finder. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who gets in and has the time to spend for it."
