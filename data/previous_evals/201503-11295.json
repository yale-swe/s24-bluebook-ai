   "comments": [
    "I think the course is a very good preparation for me, because I want to pursue a economic related career in the future. I would definitely recommend this course to other students. In fact, I have already done that.",
    "Doable. I would recommend spending as much time with the TF\/instructors as needed. I went in for office hours at least once a week and section at least once a week. It took a ton of my time this semester but I actually feel like I understand micro now and would be comfortable (I think) taking additional economics classes (as much as I don't want to admit that.",
    "I'd really suggest this class to everyone who wants to understand microeconomics in a nutshell and with close links to actual problems and policies that we read in the newspaper every day. Especially, a student with a policy focus would definitely take help from the approach of this class. I had taken microeconomics before with a great focus on theory. But this class captured more of the topics in the field by providing also a lot of real life policies to tackle the main problems in the field. I suggest a person who is willing to take this class has some prior math and econ background to benefit it from the most.",
    "GLBL 801 is quite strange in that some people in the class have a strong background in economics, while others are complete novices. You learn quite a bit, but it can be frustrating. I would recommend it for people looking for an intro course, but feel that many students who took it could have tested out.",
    "GLBL 801 is a crash course in micro ecnomics. If you are unfamiliar with algebra\/calculus based economics, this course will challenge you. On the other hand, the efficiency of this course is the ability to cover a broad range of topics in a single semester. I recommend anyone with public policy interest and limited time in their curriculum to take this course to learn the important concepts driving economics. The course will be difficult for underprepared students because of its tempo. Yet, the advantage of covering such a diverse range of topics in one semester is quite compelling.",
    "Absolutely recommend for anyone looking for a great overview of microeconomics. Its a tough course with a lot of information but very well taught.",
    "I would say that without a background in microeconomics it could be very informative. But with a background in microeconomics, it is not worth the risk of a poor grade.",
    "Intense course that covers a lot in short time--important concepts and skills nonetheless. I wish the focus of the course had",
    "GLBL 801 01 is a fast-paced introduction to Microeconomics, which will build on the knowledge you gained in undergrad (or elsewhere) and bring it to the next level. The course is challenging and requires significant time commitment outside of the classroom, but the collegial atmosphere of all Jackson students taking the course together makes it actually enjoyable.",
    "GLBL 801 provides the student with an economic framework with which to think about a range of policy interventions. It does this without oversimplifying, and includes a discussion of the shortcomings of all the models presented and methods of addressing these shortcomings.",
    "Great intro class that will give you enough of an econ background to get by. I would recommend it to other students as a basic econ class -- if you want to learn anything more in depth that has actual usefulness in the real world you'll need to take more econ. That's just the nature of an intro econ class and not meant as a slight against the professors."

   "comments": [
    "I think that this will help me (especially if I ever have to teach micro!) and I think having a solid understanding of economics is really important.",
    "encouraged me to take more Econ classes",
    "For a policy focused Master's Program, this course was a great resource since it provided a lot of materials in the policy field, and gave us some analytical tools to understand the issues. I'd like to continue taking new courses in the economics department like the econometrics to further deepen my knowledge. But I think it provided a basis for any further interest in the field.",
    "It helped give me a foundation in economics, which will definitely be helpful in my profession. It would have been nice to focus more on the public side of economics (although I recognize that you have to learn the basics before you can move onto more advanced concepts).",
    "Although I had a strong quantitative background, I had lost some of my more basic intuition for explaining economics. This course helped me recalibrate my ability to explain economics in ways relevant to generalists and policymakers.",
    "Very good overview of microeconomics. I would like to have seen some macroeconomics as well, as I think that's what global affairs practitioners are more likely to see.",
    "Real life knowledge that is necessary to know in terms of intuition and background; but I also found the course too math heavy for those who haven't done much calculus before.",
    "This course provided a well-rounded understanding of microeconomic theory. Coupled with coursework in quantitative research methods, I now feel more prepared to not only review, but also produce technical policy documents based on a basic to intermediate level of economics and statistics.",
    "Addressed above",
    "The course helped reiterate material I had already learned in previous econ classes. Also taught new material or re-learned material using more in-depth math, which I really appreciated. I think it's a great starting point for anyone who wants to delve more into the kind of economics that policymakers will need to understand in their careers."
