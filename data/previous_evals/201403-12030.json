    "One of my favorite classes this semester. For an EPE major like myself with relatively fresh eyes to sociology, Prof. Wyrtzen made the material extremely approachable. The course was 50\/50 undergrad and grad students. The wide range of experience with the material made each discussion a really valuable learning experience. Nothing beats discussing a topic with someone who currently researches that topic for his\/her dissertation.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It was challenging and really interesting, and while there was definitely a lot of reading and writing, it was never dull or unnecessary. Professor Wyrtzen is the man, definitely take it! Also a great EP&E sociology credit, especially if you're interested in Islam or the study of religion more generally."
