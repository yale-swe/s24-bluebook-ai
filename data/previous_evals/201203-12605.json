    "If you want proof-based linear algebra, then go for it. However, if you are a physics major or don't need proofs, do 222. If you haven't done proof before, this class will be pretty hard for you. 222 should be significantly easier for you. Also, Garland leaves a lot out when he proves the theorems in class, so it's not too conducive to beginners.",
    "An overview of linear algebra and matrix theory from a proof-based perspective. The most useful piece of this course is learning how to structure a proof as well as learning how to think in terms of vector spaces, fields, and mappings.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this course unless you have to take it. Garland is confusing and overly abstruse, and his derivations are sometimes unusual, which can make it difficult if you like to use outside resources to follow along. At least the textbook (Serge Lang) is generally excellent, but even then, Garland's notation is frequently different, making things unnecessarily confusing.",
    "Math 225 might be one of the most poorly taught classes at Yale. DO NOT TAKE IT. Even if you need it for your major and you think you like math enough,take Math 222 instead. Or wait another semester! Please do not take this class!!! The textbook is awful. The lectures are dreadful and the professor does not care at all whether students understand it or not. For instance, he does not show up to office hours. If you don't understand a concept, he will simply repeat the same damn thing again. He is extremely disorganized and won't tell you when midterms are until one week before. The class does not have a syllabus or classes v2 course website. The professor does not provide an email account to students. He is highly inaccessible and I really do wonder why Yale wastes money with this type of person. RUN RUN RUN!",
    "No, I would absolutely not recommend this course and would in fact strongly advise any student against it. As a studentwho genuinely loves math, if I am to be honest I must say that this class was a terrible disappointment. First, I should say that I found the structure of the course to be very disorganized; we had no syllabus, no website, and midterm examinations announced with only one-week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice. But what I found more disappointing, unfortunately, was the presentation of the material. I entered the class with a desire to gain a deep understanding for linear algebra and matrix theory but unfortunately gained very little from the course. The limited amount that I did learn, unfortunately, was largely self-taught. I thought that by taking a proof-based class in linear algebra, I would gain as deep of an understanding of the subject as possible. Unfortunately, I was wrong, despite the fact that I did all of my work and did well on the exams. I found lecture to be increasingly difficult to follow, not because I have trouble following proofs but rather because the presentation of the material was very haphazard. There was little to no emphasis on the big picture understanding of linear algebra and how all of the disparate elements relate to one another; we did not even learn how to diagonalize a matrix and spent hardly any time at all on systems of equations, which were only mentioned in passing. We spent each class proving theorems, but I found that I could not truly appreciate the proofs because the theorems themselves were rarely presented in such a way that I understood their purpose or big picture relevance to the subject. Although many students gave up on coming to lecture (disregarding the disturbing number of students who dropped after the first midterm, whose median grade was in the 40s), I faithfully attended every class but more often than not with the disappointment of understanding little to nothing, finding myself unable to ask questions because the presentation was so difficult to follow, and then later finding myself unable to piece together the meaning of my notes, which were faithful copies of the symbols andvariables strewn across the boards but without any context about their meaning. The discussion section, which wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t set up until fairly late in the course, was furthermore little help, as the teaching assistant was neither present in lecture, nor our grader, and only seemed prepared to answer specific questions. He in fact shared with us the first week after he was assigned to us that he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have taken this class himself. Without the support of an effective lecture or discussion section, I had to teach myself the material by reading the textbook, and while the textbook did help me learn and understand concrete pieces of the material, it was unable to provide me with what I hoped to gain from the class itself, a fundamental understanding of how those pieces fit together.",
    "If Howard Garland is teaching this course, then unless you are able to teach yourself absolutely everything this course requires, do not take this course. Stick to 222 (which is easier to teach to yourself). The course is woeful in every manner. Howard Garland will baffle you (even in office hours). The homework is largely meaningless: it doesn't form part of your grade and it is tangential to what is required knowledge 99% of the time. The tests are hard and graded exceptionally unfairly (basically if you do anything other than what is expected of you, you will get 0\/25 for the question, and there are only 4 questions in the test). The in class experience is terrible: it is early in the morning, and Howard will fill out 3 blackboards full of illegible handwriting, explain what he's doing using terms you've never heard before, then stare at what he's written down for a few minutes, exclaim \"tilt!\" (he actually says that) and then erase a few things and replace them with what is \"correct\", without explaining what he's doing. The workload basically increases because of that: you essentially have to teach yourself the entire course, which is FAR more work than any other course at Yale will require you to do.",
    "The material is interesting, it would be a good class if it had even a slightly competent teacher.Howard Garland is, without a doubt, the worst teacher I have ever encountered in my life. No one in the class could make any sense of his ramblings. His handwriting is indecipherable, his words jumbled and nonsensical, his utter apathy towards students self evident. No student understand what he saying enough to ask a question about it, and if they did, he would bloviate a reply. Completely unprofessional, he failed to provide any kind of syllabus or schedule. He never replies to emails or checks his mailbox. He provides no feedback on grades or any information on the distribution of grades. Anything you learn in this class you will learn on your own with the textbook. However, he only tests you on what he teaches in class. He held only one hour of office hours before exams, and kicked out everyone who was waiting outside for their turn when the time was up.He made this class the worst",
    "I would not recommend Math 225 to another student. Between the inscrutability of the text, the poor lecture style of Professor Garland (he sometimes gets lost in the middle of proving something in class), and the professor's unwillingness to give adequate materials and notice for exam preparation to be anything but a shot in the dark, the class is wholly disagreeable, despite my belief in the importance and relevance of the material.",
    "Worst class I have ever taken. Howard Garland is fully incompetent. You will work extremely hard only to be mislead on exams, and you will get a C. Avoid this class at all costs. Take 222.",
    "Math 225 is Linear Algebra with some theory. It is a fascinating experience, taught in a small classroom on the fourth floor of Dunham Lab--where no one can hear you scream. The professor is awesome, but his proofs are often difficult to follow, and you'll spend a good chunk of this class, especially the last two weeks, wondering just what is going on, and freaking out that someone else in the class might understand the material. You'll spend a lot of time complaining about this class, but you'll probably be fine. Homework is worth zero percent of your grade, and the exams are not exceptionally difficult if you've been following the material. Although, since there are only four problems on each of the two midterms, it is possible to make a slight error, and then fail and have to drop the class along with 1\/3rd of the 25-person class. So, don't mess up. Good luck."
