   "comments": [
    "This was a fantastic course, full of engaging discussions and interesting lecture-segments from the professor. The book is quite lengthy and wordy, as many will attest to. Prepare to read some sentences twice or three times before you understand them. However, the fundamental teachings in the book are important for any student of evolutionary studies. for these reasons, I would suggest anyone interested in evolution and paleontology take this course if it is taught again.",
    "I would recommend it. The reading is a lot, but if you do a little bit each day it is very amangeable.",
    "It totally depends on the material chosen for the semester. However, regardless of the material, I trust that Prof. Vrba will serve as a good resource and an interesting person to talk to.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are interested in Macroevolutionary theory. They should know that the book is quite dense and there is a lot of reading, but not all of it has to be done because Prof. Vrba does walk through the chapters well.",
    "If you're interested in the history of evolutionary theory and recent advances in the field, this course is a great introduction to these subjects.",
    "This class was wonderful. It was a discussion of Steven Gould's last work, a huge tome on macroevolution. There is a lot of reading (80-200 pages per week or so) and the book is physically difficult to lug around, but it is completely worth it. Elisabeth Vrba is an absolute gem; she is one of the Three Musketeers of Evolutionary Theory (along with Gould and Niles Eldrige). Her knowledge of biology and macroevolution is unparalleled, and she did an amazing job of leading discussions each week (she prepared extensively and pointed us to specific pages and passages to discuss). She alsowas best friends with Gould and had a number of personal anecdotes to add to the course which ranged from hilarious to heartwarming to heartwrenching.Gould's book is wonderful, and I think all of us in the course learned a lot and felt great satisfaction to work through such a detailed, complex, comprehensive book. Vrba is an amazing person to know and learn from, and that is reason enough to take this course. I highly recommend it.",
    "I really enjoyed the reading and discussion for the course. Professor Vrba had a unique perspective on the text given her involvement in the field, and gave very insightful criticism of Gould's opinions. This was a wonderful class and I highly recommend it to graduate and undergraduate students alike.",
    "An excellent chance to read through a classic--but difficult--text with the help of a knowledgeable professor. Lots of reading, but a relaxed experience overall.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me understand macroevolution, which is relevant to my minor discourse.",
    "The course raised a lot of fundamental questions about what I am studying, although there wasn't much vertical addition to my body of knowledge.",
    "I now know how Macroevolutionary theory evolved over the years. Professor Vrba also supplemented the knowledge in the book with her own examples and handouts, which I found to be helpful. The course does not directly contribute to my dissertation because I do microevolutionary work, but I am glad to know a bit about paleontology and geology.",
    "I am an undergraduate; however, this course really broadened my horizons and gave me many ideas for further areas of study and research. I once commented that every time I talked with Elisabeth Vrba, I thought of at least one new research idea. This is completely true.",
    "Yes, it was very helpful to have a historical background on thinking about evolution.",
    "Taking this course in the same semester as my qualifying exams was enormously helpful in preparing me to think broadly about evolutionary theory. A knowledge of the history of science is incredibly useful to understanding why we (I) are on the path we are today -and I don't think I realized this fully before taking this course."
