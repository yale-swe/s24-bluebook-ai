   "comments": [
    "This course covers a wide range of theories, models and concepts that explain the process of how groups and individuals make decisions of national security. I would recommend this course to other students because it offers tremendous insight into what goes into the decision making process at the national security level and how varying conditions and both internal and external factors contribute to shaping the nature of the ultimate decision\/outcome.",
    "Absolutely. Students of many backgrounds could benefit from this course. If you are interested in decision-making, psychology, U.S. domestic politics, U.S. foreign policy, international relations, or organizational behavior, this class is for you. If you plan to work in the U.S. federal government, this class should be a requirement.",
    "I had some of my most valuable college experiences to date in this class, including one of our seminars being held over dinner at the Greenberg Center with 4-star Admiral Bill McGraven. Knew it was going to be a cool class, but I didn't know how cool.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is interested in national security issues--the topic may not interest everyone. Though, the decision theories are useful for a wide range of professions and interests.",
    "Yes. In fact, I would say it is a must-take course for anyone studing security.",
    "It's an examination into the history, theory, and practice of decision-making in regards to national security.I would recommend the course to anybody interested in a career in national or international security, anybody interested in studying either field, or anybody interested in decision-making in general.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in the material.",
    "National-Security Decision Making offers you insight into decision-making and all its factors: stress, crisis, risk, uncertainty, groupthink, etc. It is part psychology, part political science. Provides a useful perspective for all other IR material.",
    "An excellent primer to national-security decision-making and foreign policy decision-making in general. Extremely illuminating in understanding how foreign policy decisions are made, rather than relying on meta-international relations theory, which is not particularly explanatory.Also, a great opportunity to learn more about the National Security Council and other foreign policy-making elements of the U.S. government.",
    "National Security Decision Making is an overview of the National Security Council decision process, providing several different frameworks from which to view National Security Decisions.It's a fascinating course with a rock star professor. The readings can be difficult to wade through so only take it if you want to really dig deep for 200 pages a week.",
    "Without hesitation, I would recommend National Security Decision Making to a student with an interest in national security, or specifically, the National Security Council. I cannot evaluate well the value of the course for someone who is only interested in decision-making theory. But, someone who who is looking for historical vignettes to which they can apply decision making theory, may be served well by this course."

   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely beneficial to enhancing my knowledge of how decisions of national security are made by key individuals and groups each with salient equity in the outcome. The concepts and theories I learned from the course will be tremendously helpful for my research as I investigate the course of decisions key players from U.S., South Korea, Japan, China and Russia must make when dealing with security concerns for when the regime in North Korea collapses. Furthermore, Professor Malvesti's sharing of anecdotes and personal experiences from her line of work at the White House also gave me invaluable insight into the type of work I might be interested in pursuing in the future.",
    "The lessons I learned in this course will be more applicable to my future career than any other course I have taken at Yale.",
    "N.a",
    "I plan to continue on in a career in national security, so this course will greatly enhance my ability to succeed.",
    "* Much greater understanding of national security decision-making in the U.S.* Much greater knowledge of the constituent components of the U.S. foreign-policymaking apparatus.",
    "This course was absolutely critical to my understanding of decision making. As a Cognitive Science decision-making major, I have been studying biases, heuristics, and decision patterns for four years, but this was the first time I was really challenged to try to put all of the statistics I had learned into attempting to analyze real-world situations with serious implications. I learned much that has changed my viewpoint on NSC and the world, and was also forced to weigh the importance of principles I had learned a long time ago. My education was definitely enriched by the course and I am thankful I got to take it.",
    "Nationally speaking, I am not sure if anyone is addressing the National Security Council, in the classroom, with the depth that Professor Malvesti brings to this course. This course will have a lasting effect on my thinking about national security and its practitioners. This course will shape future national security practitioners and influence those who work with decision-making theory."
