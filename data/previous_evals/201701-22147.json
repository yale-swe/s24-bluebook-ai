    "This course was very useful in thinking about how environmentalism was imagined and constructed from the 18th century to contemporary debates. This course was great about keeping a balance between literary criticism\/close-reading and tracing the formation of thought through the lens of history\/science\/politics\/economy."

    "I wonder if the material from the beginning of the class, the Chakrabarty essays and the Kolbert, could be returned to more explicitly throughout the semester. It was clear what the relationship was, but at times it seemed like just a class about 19th c. American lit.",
    "The collection of texts that we read for this course was very relevant, and they all tied together nicely. I thought that this course was well-structured, in that it roughly followed a chronological timeline, (although we started contemporary, but I thought that this made sense since we started with what the anthropocene means for us now) but the texts were also organized around big themes that facilitated thinking about how environmentalism came to be imagined\/constructed."
