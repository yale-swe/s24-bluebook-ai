    "Public Health Ethics in Global History Since 1800 is a thorough survey of public health in history, beginning with the early sanitary movements in Great Britain and continuing to the dilemmas of care in the age of HIV\/AIDS. The historical elements of the course are accompanied by studies of ethical and philosophical texts, which provide an important understanding of the rationale behind many public health policies, and also provide students with a framework to analyze ongoing public health dilemmas today.",
    "Yes.",
    "It was okay, good but not great. Professor Mbali is really smart and really nice, but sometimes she starts to lecture in class, which is weird for a seminar -- it would be nicer to discuss things instead of just rehashing the readings. You also don't really have to do all the work, since there's little discussion; you really just have to do the essays. The last paper is of course huge and very time-consuming, but I actually found it to be by far the most rewarding part of the class. I suspect the class will be better next year though, so definitely worth looking into.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. It's not your typical history junior seminar course. The professor really makes an effort to introduce the material through different lenses and perspectives. You have debates in class, you go to the art gallery, discuss current events, all while you are reading interesting material from all around the world. The professor is very lively and has a British accent! She's great.",
    "Take this course. This is wonderful and gives a great balance on 19th century history with the effects that are still felt today in health ethics."
