    "I learned how to think critically about food systems through an interdisciplinary lens.",
    "I don't really know.",
    "I re-learned how to assess where my knowledge comes from and how my knowledge is structured. I also learned more about food systems than I could have imagined. Most significantly, I learned how to be critical enough to know when my opinion is incredibly flawed. I am so grateful for such insights.",
    "I realized that while all food is complicated, and there are problems with every food system, we still have to eat. This course really got me to recognize the assumptions I make about sustainable food, and I learned to think more complexly about agriculture.",
    "I learned so much about the complexities\/false dichotomies in our everyday lives, as well in the world of food. Discussion were conducted at a high level and time on the farm is invaluable.",
    "The course did a good job of teaching skills for evaluating claims about sustainability in food and agriculture. More generally, the seminar did a good job of helping to think about problems in an interdisciplinary way and how to design solutions.",
    "Technical aspects of farming, food system politics, farming land rights, food justice, environmental impacts of food production, plus a number of other ideas related to food systems (too many to mention all of them)"

   "comments": [
    "There's an incredible body of work and knowledge at the Yale Sustainable Food Program, and this course gave its students some access to this treasure trove. The readings were very carefully selected and explored food and agriculture through many different angles, from science to sociology to ethnic studies. There were many opportunities for engagement through the YSFP's events outside of class, and final project gave students a lot of freedom to choose any aspect of food\/agriculture that interested them, so it could be very creative and personal. My favorite part of the class was when we went to the Yale Farm for the last three classes and actually got to actively participate in the systems we were learning about. The one weakness of the class was that, although it was a seminar, it was run as a lecture. I didn't necessarily mind it, but it would be good if that were established up front.",
    "Good course!",
    "Really enjoyed this course! Structurally thought it was really well organized and allowed for a lot of specific and focused learning about different topics (facilitated through the required forum posts and presentation). Class discussions were always interesting, and there was a really great balance between listening to Prof. Bomford's insights and then being able to discuss as a group.",
    "There was a strong sense of community feeling in this course, which I loved. I like the combination of short lectures and student-led discussion, but I always wished there had been more time to discuss. I didn't wish there had been less lecture time, however, so I guess the class should just be longer.",
    "Sometimes the expectations for in-class discussions was unclear. Some people only had to do a 2-5 minute Q&A while others prepared 45 minute long discussions. This could be better standardized",
    "The lecture portions of classes were always super interesting and the discussions were generally good. The class overall was great, so not much to improve, but one thing could be the grading time for forum posts because I did not get back comments for first one before having to do my second one and sam with my third and fourth ones.",
    "Student presentations could have been organized in a better way that allowed for each group to have equal amounts of time to present; other than that the course material was extensive, rigorous and thought-provoking."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this class was a lot of fun. You get to rethink the way you've traditionally approached food and farming by learning a lot of different schools of thought from Mark Bomford, one of the smartest people I've ever heard speak. Most of the people who take the class are involved with the Yale Farm, but it would be great if people who don't typically engage with food\/agriculture took the course everyone has a lot to gain from it.",
    "This is a really cool class. Definitely take it if you have any interest in these issues, but don't expect it to be very systematic in its approach like a survey course.",
    "YES. Explanations are unnecessary for a course that has such immediate value and a sense of urgency like this one.",
    "Yes! If you have any interest in food and agriculture, this will give you a lot to think about and good practice thinking critically.",
    "Yes!! Really enjoyed this course, you learn a lot about incredibly relevant\/interesting topics, and the field trips to the Yale Farm and West Campus farm were really wonderful.",
    "This is really an outstanding course. Mark brings a wealth of knowledge from many disciplines into the course. His lectures are the best I've had in four years at Yale--basically TED talks. Mark is an incredible resource for anyone interested in food stuff and the course is a must-take.",
    "An amazing course that will leave you questioning your every food choice, as well as thinking complexly about where food comes from. This is a highly theoretical course, so be prepared for that, but Mark Bomford is a genius, and you will learn a little about a wide variety of things. Absolutely recommend if you're interested in thinking about food or agriculture or labor or human flourishing generally.",
    "If you are interested in food, you must take this course and as early as you can.",
    "Definitely would recommend this course to anybody interested in food or agriculture. Professor Bomford is super interesting so classes are fun and the readings he selects are great. There is a lot of flexibility with the final project that lets you pursue a topic you like in more depth.",
    "Yes because it provides a thorough look at many aspects of the food industry and challenges students' past ideas."
