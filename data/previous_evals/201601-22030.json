    "This class was an in depth survey on the Italian Renaissance with a teacher who not only masters her subject but also cares immensely about how we think about history on the whole. Also, themes are super applicable from this time period to more modern ones. Modern history has a lot of its roots here.",
    "This course is not a \"broad but shallow\" overview of the renaissance in Italy, but rather a broad and deep analysis of renaissance Italy. Students who take the course don't just get an overview of Michelangelo and Donatello...They learn about the complex social structures, the mechanisms that made different Italian cities\/duchies\/principalities\/republics run, and they come away with the ability to think critically about why the renaissance happened, and specifically why it happened in Italy.",
    "Very interesting overview of a fascinating time period.",
    "Overview of major themes during Renaissance Italy, with some emphasis on art history",
    "Yes, it's a great class that helps one understand the incredible nuances of the Renaissance period."
