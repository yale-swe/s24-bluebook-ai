   "comments": [
    "My preconceived notions about this studio were initially negative, and expectations for my personal engagement and creative production low. These notions were quickly reversed by a compelling conversation that engaged serious issues of history, theory, structure, and typology. I became less concerned about producing a final project and with \"personal expression\" than I was with understanding and learning a methodology -- the premise of which comes down to understanding history before one can innovate.This course presented clear methodologies for studying typological structure through the analytical exercise ofconstructing drawings. The travel week to Vienna and the UK was far and away the most memorable. Vienna was an especially interesting choice, because although it was not related to the site for the project, Demetri seemed more interested in sharing that city and its architecture with the studio.",
    "My expectations were exceeded from a personal growth standpoint. Most specifically with the historical typology exploration. I felt that this exercise could have been better scheduled so that it was more focused earlier in the semester. This let to a mid-term review that was too focused on the precedent and not enough the each project's development.This divide created a final review that was a complete disaster from a critical standpoint. The issue of typology, and our precedent studies, that was the core of thestudio were almost completely dismissed when discussed and ignored the rest of the time.",
    "I was happy to learn more than I had expected to in this studio and really enjoyed working with both Demetri and George.I was very disappointed in some of my classmates from however. Many of them were extremely upset to be in this studio, and the pervasive negative attitude made for a less than enjoyable semester together. For most students in the school, studios taught by architects with a bias towards traditional design are not desirable. I believe the opportunity to learn new and different ways of thinking is a real strength of the school though. Coming from a background in traditional design I came to Yale hoping to learn new and different ways of thinking about architecture. Whether or not I'm being naive, I would hope that my fellow students would be intelligent and open-minded enough to appreciate alternative methods of thinking, even if they do not agree with them. The reactionary stance that my fellow students (both those in and out of the studio this semester) take is disappointing to me and put a damper on my experience this spring.",
    "The studio met my expectations for the intensity and nature of the work. I did, however, enjoy the studio more than I thought I would."

    "It is an organizational nightmare when 9 students, plus those students in other studios, are expected to 3d plaster print models for midterms unless these are outsourced to an outside company. Either the capacity to produce these models needs to increase, or this needs to be dropped as an expectation. The expense for these models was truly burdensome, as were the accessories required for midterm (the printing of unusually large banners that require complicated frames retrofitted to the pin-up panels)...",
    "At the time, both the facilities were unable to handle the immense amount of 3d printing and the added cost of this required element along with the required large format printing made this studio financially unsustainable. The financial aid was insufficient and the studio was by far the most expensive of my time at Yale. This should be considered since students were required to open additional credit cards to cover these expenses and that should not be the policy at Yale.",
    "yes. everything was available to us.",
    "Yes.",
    "We had to outsource our 3d prints during midterms and finals because of the high demand on the 3d printers. In the end this worked to our advantage because the quality of the prints we received was significantly higher than what we can achieve in house. (Shipping was the only major increase in cost.) If I need to 3d-print in the future, I will outsource the printing again.All other resources were adequate."
