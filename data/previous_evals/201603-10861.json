   "comments": [
    "FREN 121 provided a thorough overview of the subjects covered in French L1. For L2 subjects, we covered almost all French conjugations, learned more French vocabulary and some idioms. French 121 was a fantastic way to practice speaking French.",
    "We learnt more about French culture and not just the language itself.",
    "I learned more French in this class than I had learned in my four prior years of taking the language. The class helped my language skills substantially.",
    "This course greatly improved my French speaking, listening, and writing abilities. I went from barely being able to put together a couple sentences in French to being able to write paragraphs in the language, speak for minutes, and be able to understand a good portion of what native speakers are saying.",
    "This is a very fast paced class with a lot of workload. However, by the end of the course, I am amazed at how much I have learned. The interactive learning and the small class sizes make it easy to absorb so much without even noticing it.",
    "This course helped me tremendously with catching up to the level of fluency that French 130 requires. I received constant feedback on my oral and written assignments. Each assignment served a clear purpose.",
    "I believe that my comprehension of the French language has increased dramatically throughout taking this course. The amount of speaking practice and well as grammatical studies really took my understanding of French to a new level."

   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't change a thing about FREN 121. I love the structure of it -- the course demands a lot of students, but is intensely rewarding. You get out of it what you put in.",
    "It is very time-intensive and quite rewarding, but can become a bother to students who are not that motivated to learn it.",
    "This course is A LOT of work. If you can commit to this course, it is very rewarding. I took 4 other classes (5.5 credits) so it was hard to stay up to date all the time. Would definitely recommend only taking 3 other classes because I would have enjoyed this class a lot more.",
    "This intermediate French course did a good job taking students with varying abilities in the language and catching them up to a common point in the Yale curriculum. Frequent class discussions and total immersion into the language helped students like me develop my language skills quickly. There is a lot of work, and students must make sure that they keep on track in completing assignments.",
    "I was very happy with the course and what it helped me learn. I do wish that there was a way to access our grades throughout the semester, however."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to all students. It is a lot of work, but there is so much support and guidance. I learned way more than I ever have in french and the professor was amazing about answering all my questions. The professor created a safe and encouraging learning environment and I looked forward to class every day.",
    "FREN 121 is an excellent course for any student wishing to improve their ability to listen, speak and write in French. I recommend it extremely highly.",
    "Yes. I think the French department is generally really good and this class will teach you a lot if you are hoping to improve your French and know grammar and common expressions.",
    "Yes! But make sure you can commit. If you truly commit your French will substantially improve.",
    "I would absolutely recommend French 121. French in Action is an amazing method (and a very entertaining one for that matter) and by the end of the course I really felt comfortable speaking French. A lot of work, though. If you miss a day of HW it's very easy to fall behind. Still, very helpful HW.",
    "Yes, if you took French in high school, this course serves as a great way to cover the basics of the first two normal French courses at Yale (110 and 120). It will catch you up and prepare you for 130.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to any student who wants to learn French and has had some previous experience with it. The workload might be heavy but it is extremely useful to do all the work that is given. It is easy to slack off but it is also easy to notice the difference this makes on your classroom participation and overall learning of the language.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as it was very well designed and executed.",
    "This course takes students with somewhat varying levels of understanding and allows them to all become quite proficient in French before the course ends. I really enjoyed the class and believe my French has become much better."
