   "comments": [
    "I would never recommend Ling 112 to another student unless they already have extensive experience with linguistics and enjoy trying to glean useless information on circumstantial evidence. The subject itself is pointless, Professor Bowern is not a particularly effective teacher, and it is a lot of work, with 6 essays and a final paper. I took this class because I wanted the WR credit and I didn't want to take English but in hindsight taking this was the biggest mistake I have made at Yale. It is advertised as an introductory class but do not be deceived, it is not taught as such.",
    "I'm a bit torn as to how to recommend it. I think that it was interesting course material, but it was not what I wanted it to be, so I was a little bit frustrated with it. Additionally, Prof. Bowern is not the most engaging lecturer, so if it's offered as a 9AM class again, know that it might be a struggle. The psets are long and tricky, but they aren't weekly, and you can skip the reading, unless you are in the grad\/major section.",
    "LING 112 is an introduction to historical linguistics, the study of how language changes over time. Claire Bowern is an emerging leader in historical and teaches this class extremely well.If you are a LING major or are interested at all in linguistics (especially in the humanistic side of the field - what language reveals about history and culture), you should absolutely take this class. If you are not a LING major and are not excited about studying language change in detail, you should not take it. Even though the class raises big questions about language, culture, and history, the day-to-day work is technical and sometimes quite difficult. You will not enjoy this class unless you enjoy this side of linguistics.Workload: This semester we had daily reading, 6 assignments, and a 15p final paper. The assignments consisted of 3 short papers and 3 problem sets. This came out to about one assignment per two weeks, plus the final. Thewritten assignments were relatively easy, the problem set-style assignments were not - they took me about 6 hours each (I am a ling major and had a significant amount of background in historical going in).",
    "Great, but a little difficult. Not taught as an intro course.",
    "The lectures are dry, make no mistake. The homework also didn't tie in that well with the lectures. I wouldn't recommend it, but it wasn't horrible.",
    "Not my favorite linguistics class. Informational, a good survey of the material, but not super engaging. Take it if you need to or if you're really into historical ling.",
    "Yes, it was great. Also, it is a writing credit.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in historical linguistics, linguistic reconstruction, and aboriginal Australian languages. Claire is very knowledgeable about those subjects and other linguistically relevant fields, and is quite funny if you listen carefully.",
    "Although this class was enjoyable (in retrospect), this class has a ways to go. It was often very stressful because the assignments could just be so difficult, but difficult in a way that it was just hard for everyone in the class (and sometimes you could never be sure about your answers). There were 6 total assignments (and a final paper, including an outline and first draft). Two or three of the assignments were more writing-based, and thus, were more straightforward. The other assignments were more like \"linguistics\" problems, but were very difficult because they were much \"bigger\" problems than anything we had done in class. This might change in coming semesters; hopefully, there will be smaller problem sets that focus on mastery of the most important skills. Nonetheless, it is possible to do well in the class (especially if you have a linguistics background). However, the class is probably most worth it (meaning you will learn a ton more) if you don't already have a linguistics background, despite the struggle. Of course, Claire is great and she is always willing to answer questions and even tailor the class to the interests of the students."
