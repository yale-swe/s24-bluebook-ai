    "While I would cautiously recommend it (though obviously it pales--as any music history course would--in comparison to Hepokoski's classes), it's a moot point since Craig Wright won't be teaching it anymore. Hopefully, whoever teaches it in spring of 2015 will make sure it's engaging and informative and provides in-depth study as well as a broad contextual view of music in the period.",
    "Very good.",
    "If you don't have to take this (for your major), I wouldn't. It's a survey course, so it's one of those drive-by, cover-everything-in-one-day type deals where you don't really get much out of the topics.",
    "If you want to be a music major, you have to take it. If you are not a music major, do not take this class.",
    "Craig Wright is an endearing and lovable gentleman, but that's the only good part of the course. Fromthe textbook \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is written at a high-school level and contains glaring factual inaccuracies (it claims men and women were equal in Ancient Athens when \/women were not allowed to leave the house\/, eg.) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the lectures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which ramble in a disorderly way through entirely decontextualized pieces of music with frequent digressions into the realm of visual art and education policy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there is pretty much nothing good about this course. If you are not a music major, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. If you are, I am truly sorry that it is a requirement. This course is an embarrassment to the department, and should be overhauled entirely.",
    "You are probably looking at this class because you are a music major. It is an AWESOME class. Don't let other music majors tell you otherwise. Have you ever wondered what music before \"modern music theory\" (with scales and V-I cadences etc) sounded like? How did our modern system notation actually came into existence? What sort of music formed the foundation for musical practices that Bach and Mozart later studied from? This is what you will learn in the course!I never thought music from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance could be so interesting...IT'S BEAUTIFUL! I listen to jazz and electronic music most of the time...but I cried at one of the concerts the class brought us to. The vocal music from this era is so beautiful. Period.Even if you are not a music major, but is someone interested in the \"roots\" of Western music then this is the class to take.Oh and I also took this class with Prof. Wright when our Final exam was the infamous \"lay down in a dark room and listen to beautiful music\" final *wink wink*.",
    "This is by far the worst course I have taken at Yale. (I am a senior). If you are not a music major you should stay far away.",
    "Yes!"
