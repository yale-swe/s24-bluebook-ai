    "PLSC 209 is a great introduction to the literature on Congress and representation.",
    "I'd recommend it. Good for understanding specifics of lawmaking, which is important for understanding current events.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot.",
    "If you are at all interested in Congress take this class! Even though it met at 9 AM in Fall 2012, I still loved lecture. You will learn a lot about how Congress works (and doesn't sometimes)as well as discuss institutional theories. You don't need to be an expert in politics or current events, but some background knowledge will help you. The midterm and final are very straight forward and fair. You can use a page of notes and your books, which means that you can spend more time on actually comprehending the material instead of memorizing everything. Also, Professor Powell is really great. If you take the class make sure to stop into her office hours at least once. She is very knowledgeable and approachable!",
    "Everything you wantedto know about congress. It covers the basics briefly and thengets into a lot of theories",
    "Take it! not too much work and yet you learn a lot. You will come out of that class a much more informed citizen.",
    "The US Congress is a good class to take if you want a rundown of elements affecting who gets elected and how things get done. It's generally considered a gut class because the exams are open book and you get to use a sheet of notes. Don't expect to be a complete expert on how Congress can be reformed by the end of the course, but you'll have a good idea of the factors at play.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I recommend this class if you're interested into looking at the theories behind how Congress works: how parties matter, what representatives want, etc. It was interesting and applicable to current events with a low work-load. Professor Powell is fun and very sweet."
