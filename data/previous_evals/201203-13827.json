    "A class that teaches you how to be a better teacher, in any field. This class helps you bridge the gap between language teaching and literature aspiration.",
    "This class is useful if you are intending to go for the CLS's SLA Teaching Certificate. I'm not sure that I would recommend it to anyone who is not looking to complete requirements for this certificate.A good aspect of the course is you meet and interact with language instructors from other departments and observe their classes.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student but I would recommend that they did it before teaching years. It is too much work to do it while teaching and writing a prospectus.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone teaching foreign languages because it made me so much more aware of the choices I make when I teach.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student who seeks to gain both theoretical and emprical knowledge in the field of language teaching.",
    "I felt this course was helpful in teaching the phrasing required to convincingly show some familiarity with SLA theories in a teaching portfolio.",
    "I would strongly recommend Ling 564 01 to every fellow student, especially those interested in second language teaching. This course offers the perfect preparation to be in the way of becoming the best teacher you can be. It is one of the most helpgul courses I have taken in graduate school."

   "comments": [
    "It certainly made me a better teacher.",
    "I became familiar with a lot of research on the field of Second LanguageAcquisition. The course definitely filled a gap in my second language teaching methodology training that was not addressed elsewhere in my departmental curriculum or training.",
    "This course was very useful for my knowledge of the profession. I feel more prepared to go in the job market now. It also helped me fulfill some of the Excellence in Teaching Certificate requirements.",
    "I am a much more aware teacher now than I was before I took the course.",
    "This course helped me to see how theories in the field can be applied in the classroom, so I believe I gained a solid background for my future studies.",
    "This course has contributed to my teaching and it has expanded the horizons of my research. The weekly assignments, observations, and the final action research paper has helped me better understand what I need to do or change to be a better language instructor. It has also deepened my theoretical background related to language acquisition and linguistics."
