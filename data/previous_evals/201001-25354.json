    "TAKE IT. Deb is amazing. No need to have written a play before. Deb creates the most comfortable classroom environment possible. A MUST TAKE, whether you are a theater person or not. TAKE IT! You have something to say and this class will help you say it!",
    "Take a class with Deb. Do it. It's a spiritual experience.",
    "Wow. A life-changing experience. It's really, at least the way the class was taught this semester, the same as Deb's intro class, because there were so many people in the class: you write, write, write. And then you write some more. And some more. Take it, whether you're an actor, director or playwright. You'll write a full-length play that you'll actually be proud of!",
    "I mean, it's amazing. Deb is amazing. Take this class before you graduate, seriously, seriously.If you're looking to write a really good play, though, be wary. There is a \"no criticism\" policy which started to annoy me. You literally get NO negative feedback so for me that was a problem in really trying to get the best result. But the actual class is AMAZING.This class___________. (You'll get it later.)",
    "You will write a play that is personal and wonderful, guided by one of the best teachers at Yale.",
    "Take this before you graduate. You really need to. I promise",
    "As a senior, I can confidently say this was the finest course I took in my entire time at Yale. Deborah Margolin is life-changing, and the best professor of play writing - or any form of creative writing, for that matter - I have ever had. If I had encountered her earlier in my studies, I would have probably attempted to be a theater studies major. To whoever is reading this: take this class no matter what it takes.",
    "Yes, but please not as your first playwriting course. Otherwise you're shooting yourself in the foot as it's incredibly difficult to start writing by aiming for a full-length play. Deb is wonderful though, and really helpful in an advanced setting to help you rediscover your passions and drastically improve your writing.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE ITIt could change your life. Think you can't do anything creative? LIES. Think you're not cut out for a writing class cause you've been rejected from them in the ENGL department? LIES. Take it!"
