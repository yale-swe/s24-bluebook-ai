   "comments": [
    "This is a perfect class for people who need to understand how medicine and health link to the society in which they operate. MPH students should look at it carefully - I found it really worked for me and cross-fertilized with other classes I was taking at the same time. The workload is solid but not onerous, and the instructors are sympathetic to the needs of graduate students.",
    "Media and Medicine in Modern America is a dynamic course which explores how the media has influenced medicine (and vice versa) throughout history and in contemporary society.I would highly recommend this course without reservation to students in all disciplines because the vast majority of topics covered are applicable to anyone who practice or have experienced medicine in America.",
    "I absolutely would urge and recommend students to take this course, especially in health related disciplines. The material is so interesting, relevant, and enlightening. I learned about policy-changing events I did not know about, and I learned fascinating alternative stories to what I thought I already knew."

   "comments": [
    "I had not given enough thought previously to the way that the doctor-patient relationship is shaped by the media (and to some extent the other way round too). I am much clearer now about some of the challenges which medicine (and the health world in general) have to overcome if patients are to be better engaged in health decisions and better informed about health policy and legislation.The historical perspective was extremely helpful for someone newly arrive in the U.S., and I would imagine it would be equally helpful for the younger students who simply weren't alive when key decisions that shaped U.S. health services were being made.",
    "This course fills a large gap in the public health curriculum of how to approach and mobilize media for beneficial health effects. Furthermore, we receive very little to no instruction on historical public health, which was very insightful to learn about. I have discussed and debated topics from this class in both professional and personal contexts, and I can see myself continuing to do so in the future.",
    "Yes, public health information was a consistent theme in the semester. The historical perspective as well as the implications in today's public health education were weekly discussion pieces."
