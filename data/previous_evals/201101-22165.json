    "We did most of the learning outside of class, and then class time was for reinforcing that knowledge. The professors are great\u0097a very good language to take. The grading system is not too strict and gives you room for improvement.",
    "Yes definitely! But take it with Alex!",
    "If you're taking German 120, you'd best be taking it with Alex. He makes the class really fun, even as we studied grammar that would otherwise be quite dull. It's not very much work either, and I don't think I deserve an extra half credit for taking it. But that's not to say my German hasn't improved dramatically; on the contrary, I took this class after three years of study in high school (I didn't study for the placement test and did poorly) and I still learned tons. Great class!",
    "This course was a nice continuation of German 110 -- while the structure was the same, this is the point when you finally feel like you are starting to know a little German. If you want to really learn a lot, though, you'll have to spend a lot of time doing independent work, not because the course isn't worthwhile, but because it's easy to get by doing the bare minimum. Take it if you're interested -- the workload is really reasonable and the class is enjoyable -- and take it with Professor Gardner if he's teaching it again. He's a great teacher and a delightful person to be around."
