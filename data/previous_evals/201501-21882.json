   "comments": [
    "Tough curve, but it's very reasonable material. The material is similar to the lecture (slightly harder), but the grading is a little problematic. Definitely needs to be reworked. You could do really well and your grade might not reflect it because the class is very competitive and everyone in the class will be a top Econ student.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants a general understanding of government policy and how the general economy works and impacts the world.",
    "With professor Simons, it's a waste of your time. You'd be better off watching vides on Khan Academy and reading the student materials that come with the book. If you haven't done math at Yale, definitely don't take it. If you are hoping to see the interesting elements of macroeconomic theory, don't take it. If you depend on good teachers, don't take it and if you want to walk away knowing more about macroeconomics, this isn't the class for you.",
    "Much harder curve than the lecture",
    "I think in a lot of ways this course is really great. Professor Simons is very knowledgeable and invested in her students, and tries to make material (that can sometimes be kind of dull) engaging. She is very accessible and invested in every student learning. Most of my criticisms of this course come in the form of the curve and the way the course was graded. There are not so many kids in the seminar, and having to get a 78 or above out of 80 on the first test (which was a pretty fair test I thought) to get an A and a 76 out of 80 to get a B+ was kind of ridiculous. I did well on that test so I am not complaining but the idea that I could have sneezed and done significantly worse is a little daunting. Then, the final was on a bunch of material we didn't discuss in so much detail in order to bring the curve down and didn't feel like an accurate assessment of what we learned. It is annoying to be concerned with grades given a course that did such a good job at teaching, but it is still a factor and something that I think should be remedied (given that better students often take the course there probably shouldn't be a strict curve like the lecture). Other than that the course was great and I learned a lot.",
    "Don't take this class. It covers the same material as the lecture, and the seminar form did not make the material any easier to understand. Also, the curve is absolutely ridiculous. The midterm median was a 78\/80. Because of this, the exams in this class do not really assess your understanding of Econ. You can easily make a small mistake and screw up.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student looking to understand basic economics or to see if economics is something they're interested in. The class is interesting, has a very manageable workload, and gives a good introduction to macroeconomics. The smaller class format also makes it much easier to ask questions or get help from the professor when you need it."
