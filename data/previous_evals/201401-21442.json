   "comments": [
    "Take this at any time during your 4 years.",
    "You're taking this for your major. Psets are only 2-4 questions, but they are pretty tough -- go to office hours. The midterm and final are open book\/note, so take advantage. Grading is very lenient.",
    "This class is essentially \"Graphing 101\". You learn a lot about how to solve for the concentration of elements in water and then you spend hours and hours graphing them. But it barely taught anything about the importance of what you're doing.",
    "I would summarize the class as at times interesting and most of the time very boring. It is hard to see the bigger picture, and ends up being a class of doing graphs and charts because you have to do graphs and charts. I would recommend an improved version of the class if the picture plays a stronger role in the class, but otherwise I am not sure I would recommend it. It is a pretty easy class, at least to do well in, so that is a plus. I also didnt understand the material in class at all, and only figured it out from doing the HW.",
    "If you're looking at this class, you probably have to take it for a major requirement. Good news though--this is a good class to take! Professor Benoit is a funny guy and you'll learn a lot about aquatic systems. I enjoyed it and hope you do too!",
    "Great class! I learned a lot and the workload wasn't too bad. Gabe is a great professor, take it with him if you can.",
    "Only if it's a requirement. The grading is easy and sometimes the psets are enjoyable but the real world application was hazy"
