    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0Studio has coincided very will with the urban issues that arose in Theory 2 with Ariane this semester. The presentation of the studio course lacked teeth, and I found the most inspiration from the theory readings. It would have been more helpful if these topics were covered a semester early, so the knowledge had a little time to marinate.There was surprisingly little crossover from Plattus' urbanism course, and I wish the urban issues addressed were not so novel. It was hard to tackle the plethora of issues that arose from urban schemes and I wish I was more accustomed to representing urban issues and research before entering the course, rather than learning it from my studio critic.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0I think that this semester studio crossed over very well with our architectural theory class. However, I wish I could have incorporated more theoretical ideas into the project during the second half of the semester, but I could never really have an in depth conversation about that with my professor.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0There was not much crossover between this course and others this semester.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0This studio class has been the one studio class that is most receptive and open to issues external to the discipline of architecture - including issues of economics, sociology, history, demographics, etc, and is true enough to investigating architecture's ability to engage bigger politico-socio-economic trends of the city.Despite this pre-disposition to other disciplines, more could have been done to focus the studio on investigating architecture's relation\/intersection with these issues that are seemingly extraneous to architecture.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Lots of crossover, perhaps too much. I understand this was an experimental studio, but it seemed like madness at times.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0The Urbanism studio should not be a requirement. It hindered my studio progress and I would have preferred to do something that I had an interest in. The only thing I learned from this course was that I do not want to be an Urban planner because their efforts are typically wasted.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0As the urbanism semester, this studio dealt less with overlapping themes from other courses than some of the previous studios, but still challenged the students to think about critiques of the city and about larger socio-political implications of urban design.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0not much crossover",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Fairly minimal.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0There was little or no crossover. Maybe it would be better to have a urban theory class running in conjunction with the studio. At the very least studio critics should lecture on various topics throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Disorganization is the biggest theme throughout all of the classes that I took this term. The workload was too high and the personal gain too low. What I learned through this experience (whether actually true or false) is that city planning is mostly about making places that you are used to.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0There was certainly a large degree of cross-over in the first half of the semester, as issues from the first year urban planning class and the second year intro to planning and development class became relevant. With the second half of the semester, I felt confused in general about the interests and motivation of the studio, and did not see as much crossover as a result.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0This semester I did choreograph my classes to revolve around urban design issues so there were not any structured overlaps but many crossovers because of what I chose. As the fourth semester studio I think that is the right way to progress with the curriculum, required classes in the second and third semesters well prepared the bulk of people for this studio.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0A few crossovers did take place, however very few relative to previous years."

    "Instructor: Alexander Felson \u00a0My studio critic is Bimal Mendis, not Alex Felson. I have selected Alex Felson in Question 2 because the option to select Bimal was not available. All of my comments here with regard to studio critics are directed at Bimal Mendis' tremendous leadership this Spring.group pin-ups were useful to keep abreast of other studio projects and to see the potentialities that may lie in our own projects. Bimal Mendis was especially good in critiquing during these sessions and was able to give good guidance for our projects, guiding each in its own area of focus.alex felson was invaluable as a stormwater specialist and was able to give us very quick but effective feedback on the most pertinent issues that each project addressed or was required to address. his speed and dexterity was much appreciated.the juries this year were very insightful, but one would hope for juries which had more to critique on the basis of the students' specific projects and explorations rather than just purely the individual jury members' own areas of expertise and opinion. comments which are aimed directly toward a project's area of focus are much more helpful than most general comments or voiced opinions which get at very little into pushing a project forward in a constructivedirection.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0Alex Felson at times was a very valuable critic to water management in our course at times to the course, and seemed to help enrich some projects with a more detailed sense of infrastructure.However, this interest was often at odds with the original intent of Ed Mitchell. Indeed, the interests of each critic frequently seemed TOO diverse, and the angle from which they tackle critiquing a project frequently missed the students' interests. With the diverse range of critics and areas of specialization, this studio seemed like it would be better run if students were exposed to a rotating panel of critics. For me at least, actual design critique was often lacking due to Andrea Kahn's bias towards communication.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0The water management exercise was a joke and poorly integrated with the sequence. The first investigative part was useful but, typical of yales core sequence, overly rigid and assuming that we had no previous urban interests. We should be able to explore what interests us and use that to create a body of resources for the studio that is not comprehensive but is indicative of our interests.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0I personally believe that a good desk crit can act as great motivation for the student, especially to start to develop a personal relationship with the professor. However, in always having desk crits with my partner, even during the second half of the semester, I felt I was never able to discuss things that were interesting to me and other ideas that I wanted to explore and wouldn't mind hearing my critic's opinion on them. We always spent the majority of the desk crits discussing my partner's project, rather than mine, because his was always in a more critical condition and needed more attention. Overall, this semester, I felt I had very little personal attention, and with the added fact that we had to work in pairs, I also had very little time for myself for personal development. Given the unbalanced nature of my partner situation, I often felt held back by my partner and really did not feel fully invested in the urban plan developed during the first half of the semester. I wish Andrea had been more attentive to this imbalance throughout the semester rather than mentioning it in a side note in my end-of-semester evaluation.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0I thought that the most valuable aspect of the studio was working in studio, with a partner; talking to our critic was certainly useful, but being critics to one another was really exciting, and I felt I learned a lot. The least valuable were the outside experts, who were often inhibiting, especially when their area of expertise was narrow.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0I am skeptical of the inclusion of a specific stormwater exercise, not because the exercise is not inherently invaluable, but because it could have been any other number of pertinent issues (landscape\/ carbon consumption\/ traffic planning \/ etc).The rigid focus of the stormwater consultant on the workability of these issues also can interfere with\/dilute the greater polemic concept of the question behind the studio project.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0This course was not valuable, I did not learn anything, and was not able to produce work that I am happy with because I had to do the work that was expected to be done by two people.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0The urban design component of the studio was the most valuable aspect of the studio. Our section also began with precedent studies of a wide variety of historic cities and the many idiosyncratic pressures facing each scheme, which was quite helpful in building an overall portfolio of urban solutions with which to approach the project. While many students found the building design aspect of the studio less beneficial, my partner and I used that opportunity to refine our overall scheme and to tackle some of the challenges we established for ourselves with our project.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Ed mitchell is the least valuable aspect of the studio - however the other critics were wonderful.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Desk-crits proved the most valuable, with pin-ups seemingly served evaluate us rather than to help us with our projects. There were no lecture other than water management, and this is a problem. The least valuable was the water management package, it wasn't well integrated to the studio.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Having Alex Felson as a water management critic and urban design critic was refreshing. He gave a different criticism and encouragemnet that studio critic did not.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Alex Felson might be the saving grace of this studio. The water management portion was where I learned the most, and that took place in the first week, with a very low workload!",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0I did not like the second portion of the semester in which we had to divide up into individual projects. Too much time was wasted tying to figure out the scope of that second project. I would have rather kept working on the larger urban scale and really understanding the economic\/ political factors which would have resulted.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0The most valuable parts of the studio, for me, were the regular day-to-day desk-crits. With a project as complex as urban design (esp. with an architectural project thrown in), it's hard to communicate in a single review the ideas and interests of your project. Peggy, understandably, was most aware of what I was interested in pursuing in my project, and as a result I was able to gain the most by speaking with her at desk-crits.I also appreciated many of the short exercises, such as the storm water project, at the beginning of the semester. While I learned a lot from these, they seemed to lose relevance as the semester progressed (I'm not sure whether this was a good thing or bad)",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0I believe the most valuable aspect of studio was the integration of water management issues into the course of the project. I think that Alex Felson did a commendable job being pulled in different directions, but similar to the third semester studio I think that there should be one or two more experts offering expertise in different directions. This would allow for a more refined and varied set of projects toward the final. Also pushing each past the simplistic interpretations would be helpful, with at least two desk crits early to develop ideas and follow up.The site tour was well organized but should include a greater focus on the site and time for personal non-group exploration. This was a critical aspect missing and it took another visit to know the site more personally.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0Least valuable aspect was the initial mapping exercises. It was a useful exercise in learning how to communicate and organize information, however it was way too long. The most valuable aspect dealt with real issues and forced us, the students to question our own motives. That aspect came int he form of juries and outside experts.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0The organized tour of Brown campus was extremely irrelevant - I would have preferred exploring Providence on our own. Also irrelevant was the initial water activity with Alex Felson. Alex's lectures were interesting (and his desk crits throughout the semester were helpful), but the water activity had nothing to do with our final designs. During the activity, critics kept threatening that in our final review, we could be asked precisely how much water our design could accomodate...That never happened.The most valuable part of the studio was the second trip to Providence that Peggy led us on. It was crucial to go back to the site after working on our ideas for a bit."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of the studio as a pedagogical tool",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Alexander Felson \u00a0the scope of the studio was very wide, maybe too wide. although it was a good test of ability and agility between scales, the fact that one was required to generate a masterplan and then zoom in to the architecture and a detail was very ambitious, and at times produced more work load than would be possible for the work to be presented in cogent and coherent fashion, given the short period of time left after the spring break, and the simultaneous enormous workload that our other classes require of us during the fourth semester. the demand of the systems integration class would play a huge part in this.one would be inclined to revise the list of deliverables which are demanded of each student; and instead allow each studio critic to assess the situation and subsequently approve methods of representation and presentation which are most suitable to each studio project. The fact that a lot of production work goes into material which may or may not be used during a presentation not only takes up valuable time within a student's schedule, but could possibly divert the focus and attention of a project and in effect dilute its message.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0There is never enough time to do individual research. The frequently half-baked, broad range of research materials that arose from our brief stints in \"group analyses\" resulted in projects that were not authentic to my interests. Indeed Andrea's obsession in communicative organization was frequently destructive to the organic development of a project and interest. Her need to communicate and develop 'clarity' often involved phasing out less developed ideas that were full of potential. By not giving students enough time to run through the initial water management system, the first phase of 'things that move' analysis, then forcing the second phase of 'things that don't move' analysis, there was frequently material that could have been more generative given more time.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0This studio is important and has a lot of educational value. Unfortunately its strengths were curtailed by the administrative directive for individual building development as a part of the portfolio review. What would be more helpful would be to explore some kind of detail, that could be a building or may not be. The final documentation may include plans or sections but also may not include them. The administration should have more faith in their critics ability to judge a students progress. By making us all have to produce the same documents and scales of design in order to ensure our abilities, you are actually undermining the final portion of our core studio experience.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0This studio had its fair share of problems. If this was really to be considered the \"urban studio\" then we should not have produced a building in the end. In my case, this division between pairs in the first half and individual projects in the second half, resulted in a rather schizophrenic product where each part, the urban plan, my proposal and my partner's proposal all seemed very different. I think in my case most of this results from the fact that I had an extremely difficult and imbalanced partner relationship, so our urban plan somehow became very removed from the ideas I would have really wished to explore in this course. I tried to bring those back in during the second half, but I was not able to do this entirely successfully as my priority was really to try to bring back ideas from the first half of the semester. I also think it would have been more productive to frame this second half of the semester, not as \"produce a building,\" but rather, \"choose multiple aspects of your produce that you would like to develop at a greater scale,\" such as looking at a drain, to a bench, to a facade, to a rooftop, etc.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0The schedule this semester did not seem especially well thought out; \"making a public\" was a bit of a joke, and after spring break, when things became really intense, the \"architecture\" component was not especially enriching.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Overall, I am pleased enough with the outcome, the processes and what I learnt throughout the studio. I think the individual part of the project in the second half of the semester was a success in allowing for individual authorship as well as allowing for more convincingly levels of resolution at a different scale, though it inevitably started with a halt in momentum.I believe that a bit more time should have been devoted to the run-up to mid-review (i.e. development of the masterplan) and slightly less time on the analyses - though I acknowledge that the analyses were a crucial pedagogical tool.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0The watershed and flooding assignments were out of place. The short required assignments were not helpful and would only have been so if students had developed personal interested in the subject matter. Although the analysis of Providence was helpful, looking at other city typologies didn\u0092t make much sense. I felt as if my professor would not let me deviate from the analysis of that city until it was too late. In addition, the switch from urban planning to building design after the two week spring break was problematic. I would have liked to develop the urban strategy further rather than try to make the building that was only diagrammatic.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Coming from an undergraduate program that infuses urban challenges into every studio project, I recognize the importance of urban design in the overall education of all architecture students. In that sense, the studio is an important and necessary part of the overall pedagogy of theschool. As a partnered project, the studio allows for the paired students to dig deeper into the issues at hand, often provoking in the end a greater final product than could have been achieved by any single student alone. The breakup of the partners in the second half, therefore, created in some cases, an uncomfortable and unproductive environment in which the two students began to compete against each other via their project in order to try to outshine the other for the benefit of the studio instructors. This ultimately led to an overall weaker final compilation of work, and also fostered a continued environment of competitiveness and distrust that has unfortunately become a reality amongst some within our class.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Because it was Ed Mitchell organizing the studio, there was absolutly no clear pedagogical directive.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0The decision to split the course into \"group\" and \"solo\" parts before\/after midreview was bizarre and seemingly not very thought out.If the solo portion--where we develop portions of the proposal at an \"architectural\" level--was instituted primarily for the purpose of making it easier to evaluate us on urban design, then that's the tail wagging the pedagogical dog. Should not the evaluation be the degree to which we, as partners, are able to successfully carry an urban proposal to final review? Instead, you're evaluating us individually at an architectural scale for what is ostensibly an urban design studio. Don't you guys get enough of that from the first three studios?(I've had a total of 11 architectural design studios but, until now, 0 urban design studios. Now I've had 11.5 architecture studios and 0.5 urban design studios. Nice.)",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0The scheduling for this class seemed ill conceived. There was to much analysis in the beginning leaving a unnecessary rush before midterm. The program coordinator needs to get all of the syllabus for all of the required classes for the whole semester and the compare the scheduling. The administrators need to put themselves in the students shoes and say is this an achievable amount of work. Because too often at this school the work load is ill conceived and if the scheduling was just better organized the work would be better.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0The studio required too much activities which result in superficial urbenism studio.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0as usual, too much packed into so little time, its hard to learn when you dont sleep.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0If this is to be an urbanism studio, then just let it be about urbanism. It is to the detriment of learning about urban issues to stop dealing with them halfway through, just to design a building.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0Taking an urban design studio is, in my mind, an essential component to a proper architectural education. With this said, I think the sequencing and goals of this studio were a bit ineffective and unrealistic, respectively. Rather than trying to tackle so many things (analysis, storm water, plan, building) in such a short amount of time, perhaps one or two things could be dropped or de-emphasized in order to focus more on some of the larger issues. With all of the things to think about and consider in an urban design project, I was a bit unsure, in the end, as to what the fundamental lessons and principles I drew from the studio were.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0I think the main strength was the choice of the project which offered a complex and large enough site to explore whatever set of ideas you were interested in. It was also big enough that it forced group collaboration. I think that there should have been more emphasis on a complete strategy for all of the land given as I believe the northeast bank was often ignored.I think that the main weakness was the structure of the assignments. The mapping exercises could have gone much quicker allowing for greater planning toward the midterm and possibly even preliminary ideas on the individual designs at that point. From that point I think it should be more free form depending on the pair, but still forcing collaboration so that both people don\u0092t lose sight of all scales. From there, the group should have to submit their own schedule and determine the best plan of action that is fit to their progression.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0The urban design aspect of the studio was incredibly helpful, but having an urban design\/building design hybrid was not. Both aspects ended up being half cooked. I think we should have stayed in partners all semester because by the half-way point, we had discovered a good rhythm...and then we had to cut ties.It was silly to create the building design assignment simply for portfolio. Portfolio ended up being a constant threat this semester that created an environment of fear at the school. I don't think this is the proper environment for students to learn.Also, I do not think Ed Mitchell is a good listener. He has a habit of interrupting people, talking over people, and not letting other people into the conversation. I was particularly offended when he cut off an important dialogue between the faculty and students at the end of the second day of reviews. I know he wanted to keep things timely, but just as the students started voicing their opinions, Ed said the conversation had to end."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Alexander Felson \u00a0the studio met my expectations in that it managed to address almost all aspects of design which an architect would be required to go through, at multiple scales and at a high point of resolution. these were met well, as mentioned above, albeit with some reservations about workload and scope of the studio.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0I expected to learn more broadly about juggling the contested zones in urban design and development. It was more of a lesson in rhetoric and visual communication. Andrea would have made a great 1st year professor in terms of learning how to make presentations. The design aspects were grossly overlooked.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0I knew from the beginning of the semester that, once the partners were decided, that I would have a very difficult partner situation and that I could potentially gain from this experience. Instead, I think it only led to frustration, especially as there was a general lack of personal, one-on-one attention from my instructor. I am surprised and disappointed that the course did not come paired with some sort of course reader or theoretical references. Since most of us have never dealt with an urban project, I felt the first half of the semester we were all really groping in the dark. I also found it ridiculous that we rushed through the large urban scale portion of the studio, producing a full urban scale in the span of two weeks, and then were left with the architectural development for an entire month. I also wish there had been a much greater focus on experimentation and conceptual projects, and that I think the studio really suffered from the practicalities of the water runoff, storm water, flooding issues... I think these issues were overemphasized and I am still unsure as to how much they really benefited the projects.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0My expectations for the studio were to learn a bit about design with regard to cities, and that expectation was met extremely well.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0My hopes for having a productive experience working in a partner situation were not met. My partner was lazy and irresponsible. The work my partner was assigned to do did not get finished, or was not correct, so I ended up making up for the large amount of shared work. Although many groups were productive, I feel that the random studio assignments hindered the pairing process. It would have been more productive for students to be paired up based on previous work samples. I didn\u0092t want to lead a group, I want to collaborate with someone with a similar work ethic to my own and that did not happen.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0The studio met my expectations in terms of challenging me to tackle the many issues presented by the city, and to work through a project that begins at the urban scale and transitions down to the scale of the human occupant of the spaces we create.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0My expectations was that Yale might be able to offer me a worth while studio, and although the history is not great seeing as how only one of my past three studios has been worth while, I would have expected to at least learn something. As usual, this was a complete waste of time and the only reason to come to this school is simply to have Yale on your resume, even though everyone knows its a worthless education.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0- I expected this to be a semester on urban design - it became incredibly disjointed due to the shift in focus to individual architectural propositions during the second half of the semester (we should know how to design a building by this point, and the school should trust us)- we were left with half-baked urban proposals and half-baked architectural proposals, instead of being able to develop anything- since this studio happened concurrent to portfolio development - no one felt they could take any risks in design, always feeling the need to fulfill the endless lists of requirements-if the school is encouraging groupwork, why the emphasis on individual production? breaks up group dynamics",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0It was poorly planned, and there was a lack of ideas imbedded in the class. There needs to be lectures by the critics in order to form a body of theory that students can react to.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0The expectation for the studio was to explore larger scale of architecture issues with a teamate which could enhance the project. However, the \"hands off\" on masterplan and jump on the individual project for three weeks weakend the not only the overall idea of urban design but also the stui curriculum.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0I expected something less awful than this. When I looked around at the projects presented last year by the now graduating class, I though that it was there fault, now I know that it's because of poor leadership and an overwhelming quantity of work.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0I did not expect to have buildings play such a role in a studio that is ostensibly an urbanism studio. Urban issues should have been the guiding force, not architectural ones.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0My expectations for the studio were to familiarize myself with the principles of urban design and to complete a project that allowed to me implement these lessons in the context of my own interests. I do not think that these expectations were quite met. In part this was because of my partner, who I had some difficulty working with at times, but also it was because there was simply too much on the plate, particularly at the end of the semester. When I would have liked to focus on really figuring out the specifics and details of the project (the larger urban project as opposed to the architectural project), we were suddenly thrust into a new project that led me to feel like I ended up with two half-baked projects.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0My expectations for this studio were very large as I am interested in urban design as a part of my future practice. This was very tough to fulfil largely because of a rough partner situation beyond the control of curriculum or critic. I think that the idea of a quicker first half and more freeform second would allow for greater development of the groups trajectory while still providing design opportunities at all scales. Because of the requirements I feel that I was consumed by the building scale without many opportunities to move up or down in scale because of the constraints of time and production focus.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0I expected more focus on defining and understanding public spaces. It was unclear how to approach the studio in the beginning and required some time to realize the perimeters in which to evaluate and design in an urban scale."

    "Instructor: Alexander Felson \u00a0Bimal Mendis carries the studio with tremendous confidence and sureness, instills his students with a great sense of purpose as to the direction of their studio projects, and is able to be flexible with the final deliverable set which he sees to be complimentary and not impeding of a project's objectives and desired message.He is very affable, and encourages as much inter-group communication as possible; he is available at most times and will not hesitate to spend extra time out of his usual schedule to aid students in work.He is able to offer great ideas and inspiration above what the students present to him, and his enthusiasm, frankness and great personality as a leader are what makes him to me the most successful and accomplished of critics in the Spring 2010 semester.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0Andrea is very good at expanding and clarifying ideas. She is able to pin point valuable information from a presentation and she likes to take notes for students. Her sketches and summaries of reviews from other critics frequently simplify and extract the essences of conveyed materials. This is due to a very literal reading of what she sees and this is a double edged blade.Her obsession with the visible frequently drives her to motivate students to concentrate on singular aspects of a project and the representation of that idea. This results in the overlooking of latent ideas that could use more time to develop and she is not so great at spotting the next conceptual move, and frequently relies on looking backwards and reviewing and clarifying what is already produced. As such, it was frequently hard to find valuable design advice to bring forward.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0Andrea is very well informed about the urban process of city making. However, she does not convey her knowledge well to students trained as architects rather than urbanists. She gives good criticism but seems to curtain investigations that could be promising but are not yet clear. She needs to have the patience for students schemes to achieve clarity through iterative investigations rather than clarity from the outright idea, especially when students do not have experience in urbanism.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0Again, I wish Andrea had given us greater personal attention during the desk crits. Even though we were doing group projects, I wish I could have met with her individually on a regular basis to discuss my project more in depth. It was frustrating how we spent most of the time on my partner's project and I was never really able to discuss more conceptual or theoretical ideas. I was also extremely frustrated by the fact that we spent more time discussing graphic legibility, especially because whatever I showed her was not indeed the final product, but a work in progress, so of course, color schemes, text, lineweights were not all perfect or even perfectly synchronized through all my drawings... I often spent a good 10-15 minutes trying to explain this simple fact to her, while she ranted on about how legibility is the most important thing. The result of course was that we spent less time actually discussing the conceptual ideas of the project, the real backbones of the thing. Who cares whether the colors all match up when there are greater issues to be discussed and problems to be ironed out? I wish we actually talked about the projects themselves.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Bimal was a very good critic, especially with regard to encouraging exploration. I felt that I learned as much from the other students as I did from him, which to me is one indication of a great professor. Ed Mitchell, on the other hand, was odious and difficult during reviews, often interrupting people just as things were becoming interesting. This was extremely frustrating.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Bimal exceeded all my expectations as a studio critic and I regard him as an educator unsurpassed. Not only does he take anactive interest in the project and its underlying questions, he also sees in the project its underlying potential (on polemic terms and in tangible terms of what the final outcome could be) - often before the student at hand has developed enough faith in the project.His enjoyment in the journey or the process makes him tolerant and understanding of the difficulties involved in producing a conceptually intriguing and convincing scheme - which makes him seemingly generous in overlooking production lapses during periods of intense design struggle and frustration. He nevertheless knows how to motivate and hold the students to a tight production leash. The result is a studio that produced material of extreme richness and diversity.Another aspect where I found Bimal very successful is in maintaining a dynamic dialogue and vibe between the different studio pairs so that our work mutually inform each other. There were times when he spoke too much and the students didn't speak as much. But the overall energy of the intra-studio conversation resulted in a strong dynamic. This led to, I believe, a uniformly high level of original investigations and outcomes across every studio pair in the studio.I especially appreciated Bimal's commitment to the underlying conceptual question driving each project, and his awareness of where the studio pedagogical structures could engender banal schemes, and his careful steering of each students to the path of originality. Most importantly, he enabled each of us to discover through our projects, an ability that I have found sorely lacking in many other Yale instructors who have over-indulged in intellectual-speak at desk-crits\/reviews at the expense of the learning journey and the process of investigation and discovery.I have found in Bimal utmost commitment, in time and availability that went over and above his contractual responsibilities. His enthusiasm and stake in seeing each of us perform and produce to our full potential sets a high standard for those of us who aspire to be teachers. Often, he would come in for an extra-desk crit on Tuesday evening to help us cope or gather ground with a conceptual stumble from the studio session the day before, which led to productive work for the Thursdays.Bimal can and should be tougher on us, and moderate his affirmation and motivations with tough criticism. It may well elicit even stronger work.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Ed Michell always references the same example projects and is disconnected from the work his students are doing. He did not listen to me during desk crits and would make suggestions for changes that were of his own aesthetic rather than in support of my ideas. He spent more time working with the students in my section who would \u0093chat\u0094 with him about private issues. Often my desk crits would be interrupted by students who would interject and Ed would continue a conversation with that student rather than finish a discussion with me. I do not know who the TA for this course was.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Ed Mitchell is a knowledgeable and passionate critic, and is a good coordinator for this studio. In our section, it was clear that he cared about each of the students' projects, and always came prepared to discuss the work presented to him. That said, he could spend a bit more time listening to the students before jumping in with his own take, however well informed it may be. Conversations at times tended to be dominated with personal experiences or repetitive precedent suggestions, which occasionally were less relevant to the direction of the projects. Still his overall approach to the studio, his passion for the subject, and his availability between studio days all contributed to a valuable and enjoyable studio experience, and is indicative of the overall performance of most students in our section.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Does anyone read these? If so how in gods name is ed mitchell still at Yale, much less up for a prestigous academic position at Pratt. He is an absolute joke as a professor, although a wonderful person and enjoyable to talk to too on anything but what he is supposed to know.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Ljiljana was receptive and helpful but became too concerned with the development of the architectural problems in the second half of the semester-the final review of course focused more on the urban design proposal, which we were unable to focus on after midreview-i wish we had been more critical together of the urban design proposal, instead of feeling the need to continuously jump up in scale and fulfill imposed requirements",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Ljiljana was, without a doubt, one of the best studio critics I have had at Yale, primarily because she was ableto foster an environment of positive encouragement that was, ultimately, enormously productive. She was able to deftly blend pragmatic concerns and conceptual exploration in her criticism without overemphasizing one or the other. That she is not returning next year is a tremendous loss to Yale.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Ljiljana was a great studio critic. She was supportive and let us develop our own ideas for the city without trying to push her own agenda. Her knowledge of the subject matter was second to none and was well expressed. She seemed to lose interested when we turn to our individual building design. Overall I enjoyed my time in her studio and fell that my design skills were taken to a new level.Thanks",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0The critic has a good sense in deisgn and encourages students to explore more ideas. on the other hand when there are list of requiremnets she tends to push students to meet the requirement rather than what the students are dealing with.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Ljiljiana was an excellent critic, she was both receptive to a diverse range of ideas, working methods and design sensibilities, as well as highly knowledgeable in both urbanism and architecture. The second half of the semester, in which students worked on an architecture project as part of a larger urban idea, was particularly productive because of Ljiljiana's expertise in both areas. I feel I had a very productive semester although the syllabus for the studio was not ideal.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Ljiljana is highly receptive, positive, encouraging. Perhaps she could have been more critical or discerning as a critic.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0Peggy was a very understanding critic but sometimes I felt she was a little light-handed in her evaluations which caused me to not be sure about the direction I should go in.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0Peggy was a terrific section critic. She is passionate about her students' work and makes fantastic efforts to guide us based on our interests without forcing us in directions we're uncomfortable with or unsure of. At the same time, she is constantly challenging us to move beyond our comfort zones and test new ideas, often leading us to discover new interests and always allowing us to learn from our successes and failures. In desk-crits and reviews, I believe Peggy offers some of the best advice I have received at this school, and I enthusiastically believe that she is one of the best critics at Yale.Coming into the semester I had heard of Peggy's reputation as great critic, but also as somebody who demanded the most (sometimes too much, it seemed) from her students. Having completed the semester, I could not agree more with the former, and while Peggy certainly pushed us to work our hardest, I never felt the overwhelming sense of pressure I was nervous about. Peggy understands our schedule as architecture students and constantly made herself available, and as a result the workload this semester with Peggy was (while intense as expected), quite manageable. This, I believe, is a testament to Peggy's ability to push, motivate, inspire, and relate to her students in ways that a great critic should.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0I thought that my section critic did an excellent job. She was very good at pushing for thoughtful work through the course of the semester even when it was tough to determine what the standard was. I think that there should be greater conversations and standards formed in advance of the studio session between the section critics so that the students can explore further off of that structure. Besides this larger issue, my section critic was understanding, always conscious of what is going on within the school and out, and understood what each one of us in the studio was interested in pursuing.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0Peggy's gut reaction to our work was incredibly valuable. It accelerated discussions, limited stalling and provided a productive and healthy work environment."

    "Instructor: Alexander Felson \u00a0if the scope from urban design to architecture to detail is to remain, there should be clear parameters as to the end products of these explorations; however the actual deliverables which are required of each student pairing should not be set in stone but remain flexible to the discretion of each studio critic.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0Rotate studio critics somehow so students have more exposure to the different issues that may arise in a design proposal. It helps to have an extra pair of eyes to spot further potential development in other aspects of an urban proposal to give a multi faceted project.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a01. Find critics that the administration trusts. Critics that love to TEACH, not critics looking to resume build. (ie get rid of Jennifer Leung, Joyce Hsiang and Ed Mitchell) Once the administration trusts their critics, get out of the design process. Allow the critics leeway. Trust them. Allow exploration in both ideas and modes of representation. Stop trying to save the sinking ship from the crows nest. Its ruining our school.2. Stop trying to compete with Princeton. Yale is different. Let it be that. Remember the roots of the school as the ART and ARCHITECTURE school. Dare to be different.3. The administration needs to act appropriately. It is no longer 1952. Gender should not be discussed. Make selections processes transparent. Work to eliminate political bullshit. Competition is best when merit based, not based on politics.",
    "Instructor: Andrea Kahn \u00a0As mentioned before, this should be a real urban studio, where the urban scheme is at the forefront, not an architectural project. The whole semester should be framed as the development of an urban scheme at multiple scales, rather than an urban scheme (that is rushed through the first half of the semester) and an architectural project to complement it.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0I had a very good experience with this studio, but it had very little to do with the structure of the course.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0The Urbanism studio should be removed from the school program. I think the group work is more problematic than not when students are paired inappropriately. Also, it would make more sense to have student collaboration on a studio that was more like an office condition. If group work were to happen on a building rather than city design there would be a higher degree of resolution.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Rather than being explicit about being required to design a building from the earlier urban scheme, perhaps the second half of the semester should be reconceptualized as an opportunity to explore and refine a component of the urban proposal, be that a building, a neighborhood, a system, etc. By demanding that the students work out a literal building, it inevitably leads the students to become consumed by the requirements of that specific task, and to resort to tendencies that we have developed over time that have nothing really to do with the overall urban scheme that we have worked on all semester. By instead encouraging the students to elucidate their intentions for a component of their urban scheme at a larger scale, the intentions of the second half of the semester can be met while simultaneously expanding on and working with the established framework of the urban proposals.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0If these were actually read, im sure improvements actually would occur...but as usualy these evaluations are worthless.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0-the school is OBSESSED with evaluating, judging, and comparing students at every possible juncture - this has created an atmosphere of fear and a stifling of creativity - useless competition- students always feel the need to try to complete the impossible list of drawing requirements, since we know we are being judged on achieving baselines of architectural competency- i don't know what i learned this semester",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0Ditch the solo portion. Finalize the course syllabus prior to the course beginning.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0There needs to be ideas introduced by the studio critics to which the students can react. This can be done by simply having a lecture series with one lecture per critic. Also there should be more meat in the project its self. The site just didn't bring up the kind of issues that are important in this class. The site and program seemed more suited to a development class at the business school rather than a design studio of this caliber. The choice of providence was not good, the density levels where to low to foster any kind of realistic design. Overall this studio was a disappointment, poorly scheduled, bad site, and lacking any salient ideas for the students to work with or against.",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0get rid of the urbanism course altogether or instead of designing buildings, public spaces and masterplans, do a masterplan and let the requirements evolve with projects on an individual basis.Also, perhaps no site visits on weekends, we have Revit sessions on weekends! you do know that we are people?",
    "Instructor: Ljiljana Blagojevic \u00a0An urbanism studio should be about design at an urban scale. Enough said.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0While I understand the reasons for dividing the semester into a two-part project, I believe that this is not an effective strategy for producing the strongest possible urban design project. From partnership issues to lack of time, there are many problems associated with this approach.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0As mentioned, I think that the idea of a quicker first half and more freeform second would allow for greater development of the groups trajectory while still providing design opportunities at all scales.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0Faculty members at Yale (and especially in this studio) need to respect each other more. This semester, there was so much back talk, questioning of other faculty member's authority, audible grunts and moans, and ugly face making. This was not hidden from the students at all."
