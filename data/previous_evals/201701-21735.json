   "comments": [
    "I became a much better writer and editor.",
    "I learned to write creatively and work on a creative writing project over a long period of time.",
    "This was one of the most fulfilling things I have done at Yale. I learned first and foremost to write a longform personal essay. I also learned a great deal about myself, the writing process, and editing. I hope to take all of this with me in the future.",
    "I learned how to independently structure and write an extended creative writing project, one of a particularly unconventional form. It was as much about the work as much as it was what it means to produce a work of creative nonfiction and the habits, routines and mindset that one must have to embark on something personal and creative.",
    "How to write on a schedule, how to take in feedback and improve my writing.",
    "This was my first chance to work on a collection of poetry AS a collection--to consider how poems work together to create a stronger overall arc. I am grateful to have had an introduction to this process or way of thinking, as well as to have continued my growth as a poet and editor of my own work.",
    "I learned a lot about how my writing process works, and I got more comfortable with writing fiction.",
    "ENGL 489 was an excellent test of my writing chops that really pushed me to develop a long piece over the course of a full semester."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength of the program by far is getting to work one-on-one with someone you trust and admire, and getting to build your own project and curriculum with them. I don't know how that could be improved upon. Maybe some more large-group discussions about next steps for writers just out of college?",
    "I think the concentration should be open to people beyond English majors",
    "The strengths of this are the simultaneous independence and the opportunity to develop a strong relationship with an advisor. Also the possibility of producing something long and meaningful after devoting a lot of time to creative writing at Yale. My only real suggestion would be to make it a two-semester project; I know that probably will never happen, but it was basically a sixth class for me in the fall as I produced work for the spring.",
    "The one on one pairing with a mentor was incredibly valuable. I think the lunches organized with other students were useful, and there could be more of these, to strengthen the community.",
    "I think it depends on the professor--I think everything went well for me though, no problems to note.",
    "The Writing Concentration could be better organized--in terms of clarity of communication and frequency of events for the concentrators.",
    "This course is excellent! I did a nonfiction project with Anne Fadiman and loved the rigorous, one-on-one editing process. I had a wonderful experience."

    "If you are passionate about creative writing, you have to do it.",

    "Yes, to any student who is deeply interested in creative writing and wants to take independent initiative. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's ambivalent about writing; it's a lot of work and really requires you to.",
    "Yes if you want to know what it means to embark on a largely self-directed work of creative writing.",
    "Definitely! It's a great way to delve deep into creative writing.",
    "Yes? If they want to\/are able to do the Concentration!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to any student who wants to challenge their writing skills! The Writing Concentration helped confirm my desire to write professionally (and helped me develop some of the tools to do so)."
