    "This was an excellent course. I improved my knowledge of Hebrew, especially grammar and improved my reading, writing, and speaking skills.",

   "comments": [
    "A lot of the weaknesses of this course had to do with the workload. I felt like often there was work that did not help me learn that took time from other classes and the things I enjoyed about Hebrew",
    "Strengths: Learn a lot of grammar. Reasonable workload. Definitely feel like my control of the language is now more malleable, and I could get around if need be. Weaknesses: Need more vocabulary! For a lot of students, our vocabulary was very limited.",
    "Strengths including interesting class activities and creative assignments. Weaknesses included a poorly designed final exam (it spent more time on things we had spent less time on in class, and less time on the things we had spent more time on in class), not enough emphasis on vocabulary, and an odd semester long progress that felt more like hoops to jump through than it did feel like a semester long project with true meaning. Of these problems, the semester long project certainly has potential, and the other two are easy fixes. There were also far to many \"little assignments\" for homework that were a time suck but did not help me practice the skills in a useful way.",
    "The course was well taught. However, there could be more vocabulary by topic in addition to the grammar.",
    "This course is very strong in that it covers a lot of material at a feasible pace. It would have been better to have more opportunities to practice speaking with my professor, but there were plenty of other resources that I was able to use to speak to people who were not my professor."

    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in L3 Hebrew. I enjoyed myself! I think they key is to know what you'll be getting into though. It is a lot of tedious work",
    "Take the class! You'll learn Hebrew and it's very reasonable in terms of workload. Also, Orit is great; the class feels like a family, and she really cares about her students.",
    "I would recommend this class, and interesting language to be sure.",
    "Absolutely. Hebrew is an excellent department and I've learned an incredible amount in this class. I would absolutely recommend taking Hebrew to any student that interested.",
    "Absolutely. The Hebrew department is phenomenal and I feel like Ive learned more in this class than I have in any of my other classes at Yale."
