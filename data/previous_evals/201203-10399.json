   "comments": [
    "HIST 758 is an excellent opportunity for students to develop a project of their own and marshal support and opportunities to conduct that research. I set out to complete a very large very ambitious project and because of the structure of the class and careful insight of its members, I completed a 69-page work of which I am very proud.",
    "I would describe the class as a hodgepodge of students with a wide array of research interests -- which usually made the class lively and interesting, but could also cause frustration when we were talking past one another -- that was generally anchored by a solid set of readings and deadlines for our research projects throughout the semester. I would say that the class discussions were great for helping me think through my own paper, but that I wished I could have gotten more out of Jenifer's comments and our interactions in office hours. Perhaps more structured time with the professor, one-on-one or in small groups (2-3 students each), would have helped to get better feedback on our individual papers. I really enjoyed the overall topic of the class and the balance between reading and research, as well as the people in the class itself.",
    "It was a very, very valuable class. Probably this was the most helpful class for me in terms of developing as a writer. I loved the workshop style. I also liked not being barraged with readings each week so that I could actually focus on what I wanted to accomplish.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is interested in international history. Of my classes this semester, I felt that this one was the most productive in terms of actually getting research and writing done.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to other students working in this area of history and American Studies to learn methods and hone one's skills working in the historical genre. Jenifer is a great instructor in this capacity and I would only recommend it with her as her expertise really makes this course what it is---an important survey and critical assessment of historical theories and methods---as well as an intensive writing practicum.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend the class to other students. The class is very helpful in introducing you to transnational history studies, to the questions and problems faced by the field, and to the appropriate methodologies of research, and also in generating a systematic process to create a good research paper.For anyone interested in global history research, this class is an excellent introduction."

   "comments": [
    "This course introduced me to more recent 'turns' in international and transnational history in a very helpful, if cursory way given the nature of the class which was a research seminar not a readings class.",
    "The course definitely deepened my knowledge of international and transnational history as a discrete field of history. I'm not sure if I will need this for orals or not, but it gave me the building blocks if I ever were to create a reading list in this area. The research paper helped me advance my thinking on my dissertation project -- which is wonderful!",
    "It helped me improve my writing skills, ie organization, structure, prose and level of detail. I learned a lot reading my other classmates' works as well, since I got to see how other people work and organize their thoughts. Some of the books we read in the beginning, especially about archives and methodology will follow me from here out. I learned a lot about the discussions happening in transnational history today, and the issues we all face with multi-archival research and language and culture barriers.",
    "I learned more about the way I will approach my dissertation, methodologically. I also learned how to marry theory with the writing of history to elucidate concepts that can help describe and characterize the period which I am writing. While it is one of the first courses I've taken at Yale, I already know that it is a very important course to my graduate career and I will constantly refer back to my work with Jenifer.",
    "The course did help me very much. As I am studying global history, this class really sets the groundwork for how I should conduct research and write papers in the future. The research I did during the class really helped me familiarize myself with primary research. More importantly, the writing process that was broken down into steps really changed how I plan to write my papers in the future."
