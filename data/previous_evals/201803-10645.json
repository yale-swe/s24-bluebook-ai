    "Developed a strong understanding of coordination chemistry- which I didnt even knew existed before this class. I learned to develop MO structures from group theory.",
    "Learned how to build MO pictures from a group theory approach.",
    "A thorough analysis of the history and methods used in modern coordination chemistry.",
    "I learned a lot about abstract concepts regarding metal complexes, such as symmetry, bonding, energy levels, spectroscopies... leading up to contruction of MO diagrams. In addition, pragmatic topics near the end such as special ligand properties and reactivity are covered.",
    "We learned a lot about MO theory and how to construct an MO diagram for coordination complexes. Many of the topics covered in inorganic chemistry are explored in greater depth and you begin to understand more of the \"why\" behind chemistry rather than memorizing various trends."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very well thought out and well taught. All the lectures and psets are very helpful.",
    "Overall a very well-designed course. Assignments are reasonable and teach you the material. Exams are also appropriately challenging.",
    "Prof. Hazari is a very good lecturer and is clear. He provides both handouts for further information and provides his notes on the topic to supplement yours. He's usually very easy to get a hold with and clearly explains himself if you are behind and have problems. I really enjoyed the content. He writes a lot of full sentences on the board (as opposed to bullets or images) . This makes it very easy to look back and know what he was trying to say. However, if you have trouble writing quickly and\/or neatly (especially since you can't type MO diagrams well) try to print stuff out to write on so you can focus on major things. Both the midterm and final are fair. He also allows people to start at any time throughout the day (8 am - 3 pm) to help accommodate different schedules. This almost guarantees you can get a good night's sleep (a big issue for many midterms, especially for 9am classes!) In general, this course starts out very abstract, based a lot around linear algebra (which you don't do exactly), reducible\/irreducible representations, SALCs, etc... and some of the talks about spectroscopy can be difficult to understand deeply without the PChem background. However, that issue is minimal. In general, most people taking this class are inorganic chemists and as such might expect examples and applications right away. Doesn't happen until the last 2-3 lectures."

    "Yes!! Fantastic class, and Nilay is so helpful.",
    "Yes! This is a great inorganic chem class!",
    "If you like chemistry (especially inorganic chemistry), take this class!! The material is difficult but you will learn a lot, and Nilay is a great professor who is very dedicated to teaching.",
    "Are you an inorganic or physical chemist? If so, absolutely 110%. Otherwise, be wary. This is entirely worth it, especially if you have never done more rigorous MO diagrams (if you have, most of this course is review and might be better applied in other classes). The PSETs weren't hard and were extremely useful but could be tedious.",
    "If you have any interest in inorganic chemistry, and especially if you are a chem major, I would recommend this course. It's very interesting, engaging and the amount of work is fair. You finish the problem sets and really feel like you have learned something. Plus, Nilay is a great professor and you want to take a class with him at some point."
