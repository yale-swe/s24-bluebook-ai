   "comments": [
    "yes i would recommend to people who want to understand more about the theories of thermodynamics",
    "You learn thermodynamics from an engineering perspective. I would recommend it as it is interesting and explains much in the world.",
    "This class was excellent as taught by Prof Dufresne. Dufresne is easily the best professor I've had at Yale. However, that's not to say Thermo suddenly becomes easy. The material is pretty difficult conceptually and it can be nonintuitive. Workload is what you expect from a problem setclass and the midterms are thorough and difficult. Dufresne is such a nice guy that it's worth it, though.",
    "Yes, but only if you are an engineering major. Only take this if Dufresne is teaching, he is the best.",
    "As a required course, there isn't a whole lot of choice for prospective MechEs. However, the class is good and it gives you a good foundation in thermo, which is imperative to any MechE.",
    "MECH211a is the best way to learn thermo if you are a MechE, EE, EvnE, ChemE, Geo, EVST, Physics or whatever major. The concepts are applicable to virtually all areas of science. Also, Professor Dufresne is excellent and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in taking it who has the prereqs.",
    "This is a great MechE class! I do think the professor definitely makes or breaks the material though, so try to get Dufresne!",
    "Take this class with Dufresne, he is probably the best mechanical engineering professor at Yale. Other than that, the class is a little too heavily math-based for an engineering class, but it's required.",
    "I would recommend this class whether you have to take it or not. Thermo allows you to view science through an entirely new lens, and Dufresne is a god.",
    "I would recommend it. This is no easy class, the test or the homework. However, when its all said and done, you will actually learn as opposed to memorization or just luckily passing by some class. The teacher is awesome and will actually make you want to come to lecture.",
    "I highly recommend this class. If you are in any major that this class could count towards, take it with Professor Dufresne. He is one of the best science teachers at Yale, because he actually cares about the subject and his students. His lectures are engaging, and he pauses frequently for questions. He also actually brings notes to go over during review sessions, which is reallyhelpful in terms of structuring studying. He also allows students to bring a half page or so of equations and such to each midterm, so you don't have to memorize lots of equations.The homeworks are not incredibly hard, but they are weird, so they can be difficult if you are used to textbook science problems. He is into applications, so he will ask something like, \"How much work is required to blow up a balloon?\" And that's actually the whole question: you have to come with estimates for the various quantities involved (after figuring out which quantities are needed).His exams are similar to the homeworks, and for the second midterm and the final he gave us practice problems that closely resembled the exams. However, there is a trickiness to the exams that will throw you off, and the class average is generally pretty low. However, he curves up.I would even recommend this class to people who can't use it for their major, provided they have the appropriate science background.",
    "The term is over. Last night I had a pleasant dream of Eric Dufresne standing at a chalk board in a lounge like area, calculating the velocity of the air on the bottom fringe of a mushroom cloud. Admittedly that is a heat transfer problem, but Eric Dufresne is the stuff of dreams.A professor who actually makes up his own problems....Holds meaningful office hours...And invests time and energy into the course.Two hands together Professor.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to another student. It's an important requirement for the mechanical engineering major, but there were also students from other majors in the class that found the course both interesting and applicable. First, we learn the very basic concepts of thermodynamics (first and second laws, entropy), and then learn how they apply to systems, such as power plants. We also took two field trips, one to the Yale power plant, and another to the grave of Josiah Willard Gibbs, the father of thermodynamics.",
    "GREAT CLASS. Take it with Dufresne, He is an amazing teacher who makes you really excited about the material and gets you to understand it on a really fundamental level. Class was a joy to go to, and the homework was hard, but really interesting. It is probably the best class I've taken at Yale, let alone in the Mechanical Engineering major.",
    "If Dufresne is teaching this class, there is absolutely no reason you should postpone taking it. He's wonderful and makes the class interesting, applicable, and approachable. The workload isn't anything to laugh at, and it will definitely take some teamwork and effort to get through the problem sets, but everything comes together cleanly. Again, if Dufresne is teaching Thermo, take it without hesitation, especially if it's required for your major: you will have no better in class experience during your time at Yale (which is especially useful considering the difficulty surrounding the subject matter)",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Thermo is sweet and Prof. Dufresne is an amazing Professor.",
    "This is a very comprehensive introduction to thermodynamics. Obviously, it's required for Mechanical Engineering majors, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. And even if you don't need to take this class, it's interesting enough on its own.",
    "An excellent course if taken with Eric Dufresne. Focus on conceptual material and really cool problem sets.",
    "Thermo was great! Dufresne made an otherwise dull and dry subject very comprehensible. His energy made the class extremely interesting.",
    "Probably not taking this class for fun or by choice, but it's as good as thermo will get. Professor Dufresne is wonderful -- great at explaining, sense of humor, tries to tie in as much interesting supplementary material as possible. Problem sets and exams require some creativity and problem solving ability. Not taught from a textbook, so go to class.",
    "Required. Difficult. Pretty usual stuff for ME. No textbook, sometimes tough psets, tough first midterm. You do get half of a side of a4 paper for the midterms, a full side for the finals. Granted, excellent professor, lots of help, and although the stuff is difficult, it's pretty cool to learn about. You go on tours of the powerplant, grave of Gibbs (you'll hear about him a lot), have lunch with the class, etc. Enjoy it if you can, was one of the better ME classes.",
    "Take it for a solid introduction to thermodynamics, but prepare to study really hard and spend several hours on the p-sets. Go to the section and the office hours."
