    "It was a meh class, I liked what I learnt at the end of the day but wish it had been taught better.",
    "UGH. This is worst class I've taken at Yale and definitely the worst class in the major. Just horrible and frustrating. Do yourself a favor and read up on econometrics and intermediate micro before you take the class and really pay attention to Stata in AQA. Just get through it.",
    "Great class in terms of teaching some basic approaches to analyzing a wide range of development issues (agriculture, migration, gender discrimination, credit, institutions). Very interesting class in terms of subject matter, though obviously the breadth takes away from the depth of study given to each subject (Professor Keniston pointed out multiple times that a class could be taught on each of the individual daily topics we cover). Overall though, i think it accomplishes what it tries to do as an introductory course. Also, you learn some useful econometric techniques and gain experience directly analyzing research studies' methodologies.",
    "The class looks at both quantitative and qualitative approaches to development\/poverty, so maybe a little more math heavy than one might expect. Overall, I think it is very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it to future students.",
    "Most students would take this only because it is a core requirement for the Global Affiars major. If you belong to this camp, I advise coming in with an open mind but be ready to be frustrated at times throughout the semester. You will indeed find that this course is useful nearing the second half of the semester, and the first half is more brutal due to the introduction of new econometric concepts. Nonetheless, try not to go in thinking that you will absolutely hate this course but rather try to seek help early from your TAs, classmates, and the professor especially when the problem sets come around. That will make your life significantly better I believe.",
    "I would only really take this course if you are a Global Affairs major and are required to. I thought the topics were interesting but that they weren't really taught in a way that made the course cohesive. Problem sets were unnecessarily difficult and weren't really covered in class.",
    "This course is best encapsulated by this image: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0Hs6woG.gif",
    "I am a development student, and I've taken econ \/ calculus \/ stats classes, but I still found this course challenging in terms of struggling through Stata pests. I felt like we rushed through so many different substantive topics and econometric methods, I'm not sure if they completely sunk in.",
    "This course has a pretty bad reputation among GLBL majors and I can say now after having taken it that the bad rep is pretty much deserved. Prof. Keniston means well, but he isn't the best pedagogue (he did seem to improve as the semester went on though). There were errors on lecture slides and notes all over the place, which would frequently have to be corrected mid-class which is very confusing when you're trying to learn material like this. This was also true for problem sets, which were sometimes so unreasonably difficult (i.e. there was some small trick you needed to know to manipulate data correctly) that only students who camped out at office hours and badgered the TAs were able to get the right answers. It seems like Keniston thought we knew much more about Stata from GLBL 121 (except that class basically teaches you nothing about Stata, as we all found out on PSET 1...), which really wasn't the case. Though I suppose its Jackson's fault for dropping the ball on that one. The one plus is that some of the material is genuinely interesting...but this is largely overshadowed by the negative aspect of the class.",
    "An apt survey of topics in development made controversial by differing student opinions. There are two kinds of people who take 225: those interested in research design methodologies and in how to code empirical research projects, and those who interested in the policy implications of current dev literature. This course did as good a job as possible at integrating these conflicting dimensions. Most reviews will be negative because students disliked one of the two aspects of the class. I liked both and had a great experience. Most who didn't resorted to complaining about 225 and questioning why it should be required for the major. Honestly, it's actually quite good! Where I would have liked to see improvements is in small administrative aspects, e.g., more timely grading\/returning of homework assignments without 3-4 week delays.",
    "worth taking as a requirement, you will learn things for sure!",
    "Just do it, find a good bunch of friends (who have taken metrics) to take it with you, explain concepts to you and work on the problem sets together. This'll make the experience go by a little more smoothly.",
    "This class should only be taken by those who are required. It is poorly structured and poorly organized, and very time intensive. Problem sets are vaguely worded and inordinately long seemingly for the sake of being time consuming over reinforcing valuable skills. Professor Keniston definitely means well and prepares for lecture, but struggles to explain the econometric methods he teaches. If you have a choice, take any development economics course offered in the econ department over this class.",
    "I would recommend this class. Some of the quantitative stuff can be tough and boring but it seems very useful to the field of international development. This class definitely exceeded my expectations given its bad reputation. If you're a Global Affairs major you don't have a choice about taking it, but try to keep an open mind because you really can learn a lot.",
    "Interesting material, miserable class. Lectures were sub-par and problem sets were surprisingly long and difficult. Take it because you have to, and hope that it improves in the coming years.",
    "Awesome course for students passionate about development as it covers a huge breadth of topics while still going deep enough on all of them for you to have an intelligent conversation about them with others. Its a very challenging course and with good reason- development has the power to do great things in the world but can also cause a lot of harm if executed poorly and one needs to spend the time to get better at it. The line between security and development is fading ever-quicker so its an awesome course for everyone to take and very necessary. I would take it again if possible just to really go in depth on all the topics - each one could be a course on its own. Don't come into the course expecting it to be good or bad because then you'll see everything in the course through that light - listen to what other people say but come in with a blank slate and form your own opinion, and be ready to put in the time because if making the world a better place were easy then everyone would be doing it.",
    "Worst class I've taken at Yale",
    "Survey into international development. Very interesting topics",
    "Mandatory course for global affairs majors. Despite the negative rep Professor Keniston has gotten, I think he showed that he was amenable to student concerns and criticisms midway through the semester. By the end, the lectures were still packed with material, but I think he did a good job slowing down to explain economic concepts to us throughout the course of the lecture. Exams and psets are adequately difficult; if you study hard for them, you should be alright. If Eric is your TA, you should be more than alright.",
    "If you're taking it, you probably have to. If you don't, skip it. There are better non-technical overview courses and technical econometrics courses.",
    "There's no way to get out of this class if one is a GLBL major, so I heard. I myself am not a GLBL major and only took this class because I wanted to have knowledge of experimental techniques in development and STATA experience. I thought I got what I wanted, although at times DK spent too much time on math details which (1) not everyone in the class liked, (2) not everyone in the class could understand the materials in class in a timely manner so more time could be spent on experimental techniques and results, and (3) understanding only the results without the derivations would not preclude an understanding of the actual papers. Don't get me wrong, DK is really good at synthesizing all relevant papers and results in international development, although I believe spending less time on math derivations would make students feel they're getting tangible information on what the international development field is about.",
    "Honestly, this class is not really as bad as everyone makes it out to be. The honest truth is that the average economics knowledge in this class is fairly low, which could explain why everyone struggled so much with the class. Otherwise, I thought that it was quite interesting, and even though I am a security track major, I appreciated the knowledge and details on development. This is not a class to slack off in - its much harder than intro micro and intro macro, but this also makes it more satisfying. You learn key research methods, quite a lot of stata skills, and a good understanding of some of the main developmental topics. I also think students were a little too harsh on Professor Keniston - he's not the best teacher, but he definitely improved a lot throughout the course. Where he was confusing in class, he would upload notes online that were clear and extremely useful.",
    "My fist thought in assessing this course is, why? Why does the Jackson Institute require it's majors to take such a poorly taught class? How can an Institute with such visionary senior fellows and abundant resources craft as mediocre a class as this and force all of its majors to take it? I know initiations are important components of many groups on Yale's campus, but if this was the Jackson Institute's version of initiation for the Global Affairs majors, it felt more like hazing. The only good thing that came out of this class was stronger friendship between my classmates and me who bonded over shared suffering. This class is the worst part of the Global Affairs major and hands down the most poorly taught class I have ever taken at Yale. It is such a shame that Global Affairs requires its students to waste precious class time at Yale taking these sorts of classes (Approaches to International Security and Applied Quantitative Analysis are equally as poor). The class structure from the syllabus looked promising. The topics listed are important and relevant. The course material, however, could not have felt more irrelevant. We read papers that were dense and then instead of discussing them, we were required to complete problem sets based entirely on stata code no class we have ever taken at Yale has taught us. And to add insult to injury, Professor Keniston did not teach us the stata code either. Furthermore, Professor Keniston admitted that Stata is a horrible program that will surely be replaced by superior software in the future, so WHY are we spending so much time being tested on how to do this code when it will not even be used 10 years from now when we find ourselves in the professional world? This major is going to turn into one where people only apply to get into the wonderfully taught electives and then drop it before they have to take the required courses. The Global Affairs major NEEDS to put more effort into making these courses inspiring, well-taught and useful.",
    "Horrible class. Maybe if it's radically redesigned you could think about taking it. Problem sets are impossibly hard (you will work in groups on them).",
    "Terribly taught course, but mandatory for GA majors. Some students even dropped the class and reconsidered the major because of it. Lectures are incredibly boring and are spent either going over algebra or reviewing policy papers. Problem sets are hard, but mainly because they were poorly written. I highly recommend going to office hours with Eric (if he's still TAing).",
    "Overall, not as bad as some of the course reviews of past years suggest. Granted, it is highly dependent on the professor. The class is pretty tough to grasp- especially at the beginning when the problem sets, STATA, and econometric techniques are thrown at you. It gets better over time, and the qualitative stuff gives a good overview of current topics in international development. It is definitely more economics and math-y than some people would like.",
    "One of the worst, sorry, actually, THE worst class I have taken during my time at Yale. The professor did his best and crafted a super super super interesting class, failed to put in the teaching to make it so. Like every econ professor at this school, I felt like I was always trying to be tricked during exams and during problem sets, rather than being tested on the material. As a security tack person, I was constantly confused as to way I had to take this course, especially since I will never be a development economist and the econ and statistical training I received in intro micro and macro as well as the AQA course are sufficient to have a baseline knowledge of econ and econometrics.",
    "I won't not recommend GLBL 225 to another student unless you are a Global Affairs major in which case you have to take it. Although, you do get a lot out of it be teaching yourself and learn a lot about using Stata. However, this course requires a ton of time and requires you to reach out to the TAs as much as possible.",
    "You have to take it :(",
    "I mean if you're a Global Affairs major you have no option but to take it so just do it. You do a lot of Stata and econometrics in the first half but it smoothens out to fun topics in the latter half.",
    "As someone who read lots of bad reviews before taking this class, I was very pleasantly surprised. Though it is a serious workload, I also think it was a necessary workload that made me learn a lot about development efforts, and how to analyze them critically. Though during some of the p-sets I cursed this class, I came out from it incredibly glad I chose to take the course. Take it if you have any interest in development, and definitely take it as a junior if you are a Global major.",
    "Don't get freaked out by course reviews that say this is the worst class ever. As long as you take thorough notes on class lectures, take the time outside of class to review your notes and the lecture slides, and show up to each section with clarifying questions on concepts that are still unclear, you should be totally fine. Keniston is a nice guy, and although not the best teacher (he tends to trip over himself while teaching and makes several mistakes that he later has to correct, which can get confusing at many times), the lecture notes and slides are able to stand on their own. Be sure to get into one of Eric's sections if he's still a TA next year.",
    "At the beginning of the semester I was absolutely terrified to take this course because of the bad rep it had. Yes it was hard, and yes it could've been taught better, but it was nowhere near as daunting as I had been led to believe from the comments. If you do your work, go to section, and talk to the TA's you'll definitely make it through ok, even if you're security track, and even if this isn't up there with your favorite Yale classes. Don't be too disheartened-even if it's esoteric, at least it can be interesting!"
