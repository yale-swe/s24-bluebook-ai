   "comments": [
    "Again, esoteria galore. But yes, the class is informative, runs along at a somewhat overwhelming pace but certainly manageable if you just put in the time every day or every other day.",
    "It is a great course to take if you want to become proficient in the Russian language in a short period of time. You must be prepared to work hard, but you will be rewarded if you do so. I would recommend this course to another student if they were prepared to do the work required.",
    "Yes! If you're looking for a great intensive language course, look no further. Constantine is magnificent.",
    "This is a course with a lot of work, and it requires a lot of hours invested. Still, for those who would like to learn the language in leaps and bounds rather than in steps, this is an excellent option. Likewise, one forms very close relationships with the Professor and the TA, both of whom are very invested in the students learning and learning the things that are personally relevant and interesting. It is a hard class, but it is exceptionally rewarding.",
    "It is an intensive course on Russian.",
    "A great way to learn Russian quickly--the professor is extremely good, and I never felt like the material was leaving me behind."
