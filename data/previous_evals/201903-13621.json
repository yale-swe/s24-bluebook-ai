   "comments": [
    "This was an fantastic class. I did have much knowledge of the ancient world, which seemed like a big gap in my preceding education. This class gave me a firm understand of ancient history, and insights into why major events took place, and who was behind them.",
    "I have developed knowledge of the later roman empire, as well as developing skills such as numismatics and higher level use of sources.",
    "How to look at government and leadership from a global perspective, how to evaluate ancient sources objectively",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of leadership qualities and theories that span the ancient and modern world.",
    "I learned how to take effective notes for lecture style classes. I gathered the ability to boil down the most salient points from readings and the lectures to understand the main concepts of the course. I learned that even though there is a lack of information about ancient leaders, there is still a vast amount of knowledge that can be gathered and collected that can translate to you everyday life.",
    "Ive learnt the most valuable strategies and foundations of affecting the change I want on my life, circumstances and the world. Weve studied the best of the best. Weve taken the greatest lessons distilled from the lives of some of the greatest leaders of history. Its more than just vague concepts about how to lead well. The takeaways are leadership strategies, in what circumstances they do and dont work and how they work together. We look at the leadership strategies that apply to the massive, diverse range of contexts of the ancient world. The ancient world from which are current society and culture is built. It ends up being a no frills sandbox for testing leadership strategies in the societies that fundamentally are echoes of our own. Its also not from a biased perspective. We are learning what works, not whats right. Great leadership in the ancient world is understood by what lets you influence people to act in a certain way. I feel that Im not be distracted by what a leader should be (in a normative sense) so much as what makes a leader most successful in achieving their goals. The class looked through all distractions to the applicable tools for effective leadership. They then back what they say up with contextualised evidence and examples. I feel like I understand the examples and the context. I hate just taking the professors word as given. This class doesnt require that of you. From the lectures alone, Ive learnt a great deal but the readings have been very valuable in enhancing my knowledge and contextual understanding. In regards to simple knowledge, Ive learnt enough to have a reliably workable knowledge base and understanding of the ancient world. I have an especially strong contextual knowledge and understanding of Ancient Rome from the 4th Century BCE to the 5th Century CE thus including the Roman Republic, Early Roman Empire and Late Roman (Byzantian) Empire. I also have a good knowledge base regarding Classical Greece. I dont know everything about the periods but I know enough that my knowledge of these vast periods can be contextualised and understood properly and that I can confidently understand the significance and realities of information about these regions in these periods which I might acquire in the future. Ive also learnt a lot about the great leaders of the ancient world.",
    "I learned a lot about ancient leaders, theories of leadership, and ancient history in general. The lectures were always interesting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - Taught by an extremely knowledgeable people, Noel Lenski and Kevin Feeney. Professor Lenski and Kevin Feeney were able to answer my questions in depth, and give appropriate knowledge and context surrounding the answer to the question. - Sections were insightful and thought provoking, and easy to approach or ask questions",
    "It was a nice setting with few students so we were very engaged",
    "I wouldve enjoyed learning about more well known individuals like Marcus Aurelius instead of certain niche individuals.",
    "The strengths of this course are the care and passion from the professors, the interesting subject matter, the effective application to modern day leadership, the vast amount of different leaders, and the great readings. The weaknesses of this course was the lack of information on how to cite ancient sources and the variance in format of the PowerPoints that made it harder to understand the main concepts (some lacking takeaways or not being able to connect it to the leadership theories).",
    "The course is useful, interesting and not too difficult, at all. Its only the first time theyve done the course too. I imagine it will get better. The professors are brilliant, the content is interesting and the assignments are simple but thought-provoking. The readings were engaging and the lectures and lecture slides were concise and very helpful. It doesnt require too much of you (if you need to miss a reading, you certainly can) but the effort you decide to give it is rewarded with lessons which are often really useful to your life. You should be careful not to miss many classes though. The only weakness I found for this course, if it was one, is that attending the lectures and sections made a big difference. Im not sure whether that counts as a weakness though.",
    "Great lectures, great assignments, and fun trip to the YUAG. Could only be improved with more streamlined readings at times, but Professor Lenski has already discussed with our class which readings will be changed in the future."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It was a fascinating history class that was exciting to go to, without overloading us with work or readings. Readings were trimmed well for the maximum relevancy of information. Lectures were well timed and very interesting.",
    "Absolutely, both professors are brilliant and clearly very engaged with the course material.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a survey course that covered a lot of what I was interested in about ancient Greek and Roman history and was taught by two really engaging professors.",
    "Yes, because it was a unique course and very interesting topic",
    "Yes! I enjoyed learning about leadership that transcends all of the ancient civilizations. You get to learn about great individuals on an in depth level and create your own idea of what constitutes a successful leader.",
    "Yes I would because the information learned can be applied to your own life very effectively. Also, the variance in leaders is excellent, so you get to learn about a multitude of different leaders with varying backgrounds, sexes, and leadership styles.",
    "This is a great course. Its useful, interesting and not too difficult, at all. The professors are brilliant, the readings are interesting and the assignments are simple but thought-provoking. It doesnt require too much of you but the effort you decide to give it is rewarded with lessons which are often really useful to your life. You should be careful not to miss many classes though. Its also serves as a great, light introduction to or sampling of ClassCiv. If youve come to Yale, youre someone who wants to affect change in their own life or the world. Youre competing with a million different people and a world of complexity. This class shows you how with great examples. I loved it.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Lenski and Kevin Feeney are both incredible teachers and lecturers, and very willing to engage with students. It's really a very fun course, with fun assignments."
