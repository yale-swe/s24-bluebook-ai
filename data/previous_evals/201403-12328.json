    "Crime and Punishment was an amazing class, one of the best and most challenging I've had at Yale. Professor Huber's an excellent lecturer, he's very knowledgeable and astute and does a lot of preparation for class. However, as someone who's never taken an intro course in polisci, this class was very overwhelming for me (at least in the beginning). There's a lot of reading, which you have to do in order to participate in section. Spend more time on the theory-inclined ones and the supreme court cases. There are quite a few New York Times articles as well, which you could just skim. You only get a midterm and a final if you don't take this class writing intensive.",
    "Definitely take this class!!!! Professor Huber is a great lecturer, and the material is all extremely interesting, thought provoking, and relevant to the world today. This makes it easy to go to lecture and do the readings! It is a very enjoyable class, and not too much work at all.",
    "Don't take it. It's not that interesting after the first few lectures. Huber's open-ended questions get old after a while, and you just feel like you're always getting ready for discussion section. If you know anything about the American justice system (see: 9th-grade civics plus a general awareness that it's harder to be poor and black than rich and white), then you won't learn anything. On the other hand, if you are unaware that poor people and minorities find it more difficult to go through the justice system, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS. It'll do you a lot of good. Also, it's not really a gut. I thought it'd be an easy writing credit, and it sure was easy. But the TAs (or at least mine this year) are kind of bitchy and grade randomly.",
    "A great intro class if you want to know more about criminal justice system. It won't get too technical.",
    "You'll get the most out of this class if you do the reading, of which there is a lot, but it's all very interesting. The course is well-organized, you'll never find yourself wondering what you're supposed to be getting out of it. Expect to walk away from this class with a knowledge of the moral underpinnings of the criminal justice system, an understanding of how it has changed through time, and a knowledge of issues facing the system.",
    "I'm a science major and took it as a SOC credit and it was everything I wanted it to be. I really enjoyed the readings, and the structure of the class was really cool I feel more confused about how I feel about the American criminal justice system than ever. We really did hear a fair treatment of both sides of any issue, which I found rare and also really intellectually stimulating. Took it non-writing, would recommend if you're short on time during the semester. Readings were pretty easy to keep up with, and then it was just a few days of the semester for studying.",
    "I would recommend this class. However, I think the readings provide much more information than the lectures. That being said, do not expect to be able to only go to lecture and learn a lot. Also, take with section leader Michael Sierra-Arevalo if able. In the end, I am glad I took this course, as many of the issues discussed are of fundamental importance right now.",
    "This course gives a general overview of the criminal justice system by emphasizing particular aspects of it. I think the policy of requiring drafts of papers is very helpful. The class sticks to the syllabus, so if you find the syllabus topics interesting, you'd probably enjoy the class.",
    "I would recommend it it really changes the way you think about justice and punishment and opens your eyes to several misconceptions and contradictions you may have. It's a fair amount of reading but you might not have to do it all",
    "Crime and Punishment has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. I enjoy the lectures and appreciate being able to keep track of the course narrative at all points - Prof Huber makes an effort to situate every new topic in a grander scheme of things. The course content was fascinating, and has challenged me to think critically about issues related to the criminal justice system, notions of justice, morality, etc, and also equipped me with useful tools for doing so. I took the course non-writing intensive, but nonetheless the readings for each week were very substantial. That aside though the assessment load is surprisingly light, with just one midterm and one final, both of which were open note exams. Prof Huber is a brilliant instructor, and is quite fascinating to listen to him speak at the rate that he does because of what it suggests about the rate at which he thinks! The course material cohered very well - the lectures, readings, section discussions all built on each other - and the course narrative was clever in its construction. He did seem rather aloof but towards the second half of the course tried to be a little more interactive during certain lectures, which I thought was a nice touch.",
    "It is an interesting course about the philosophy of the criminal law. I felt that the class got a little drier as it went on, and I wish there had been more emphasis on the law itself (as well as specific cases). However, it was not at all bad as a writing credit. If you are interested in learning more about issues of crime and punishment without a heavily legal focus, this class may be for you.",
    "This was a good course. It covered a lot of topics surrounding the criminal justice system and left me with a greater sense of my beliefs and new questions I need to answer.",
    "If you are at all interested in law or the politics of the criminal justice system works, definitely take this class. Professor Huber is one of the best lecturers I had at Yale. He is incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the class. I felt like I actuallt learned a lot from him and not had to rely on the readings to understand the subject matter but rather used them to supplement the lecture(which unfortunately does not happen that often). He is also very organized and informs us multiple times about the assignments and deadlines, which helped a lot when I made my own schedule. One problem was that the grading and curve can be pretty strict, and because the exams are open book and open note, you have to focus a lot on structuring your in-class essays, which is not easy at all when you have such limited time in the midterm(so you might want to consider credit d ing the class, although I don't know how they curve the finals). But other than that, this was arguably the most interesting class I took at Yale.",
    "Crime and Punishment is an excellent introduction to the American criminal justice system. Professor Huber is a great lecturer, and all of the TAs seemed very capable.",
    "Great Course with a great lecturer. There is a substantial amount of reading but you'll find, if you make yourself sit down and do them, that all the readings are very interesting. Moreover, you'll need to have done the reading for the final whether you take it as a writing course or not. My one issue with the course was that the writing students were required to take a final. It was only 15%, but I'd prefer that all the work be paper intensive for a writing course, otherwise whats the point.",
    "It was interesting but was not what I expected in terms of course material\/theory",
    "Good class, watch out for bad TAs from the law school.",
    "This is a very interesting class covering the issues with our current criminal justice system. By examining court cases, reading theorists, and comparing our justice system to other systems throughout the world, this class helps you think more critically about the justice system and understand how it has developed\/where it is headed. There is a lot of reading for section, but most of it is interesting and easy to read if you are truly interested in the issues surrounding the criminal justice system.",
    "Yes, good introduction to the law and the criminal justice system. Definitely a good range of topics covered. Lectures can get repetitive at times (as in sometimes, I felt that they were just summaries of the readings) but Professor Huber did an excellent job of connecting the readings.",
    "This class is an interesting overview of the U.S. criminal justice system that covers the case history regarding several topics and allows you to develop a new way of understanding arguments in regards to crime, punishment, and whether our justice system is inherently fair or not. The course load is: a midterm and final for non-WI students and two 10-15 page papers, as well as a shorter final for WI students. There is a lot of reading but it is manageable. I would recommend this class.",
    "This was an awesome class. It teaches you to approach the Criminal Justice System (and anything political in general) in a more analytical way.",
    "Really interesting class that explores broad questions about the criminal justice system -- things like the gap between the law as written and how it's enforced, the presence and effect of discretion in the legal system, and the importance of due process. Huber is an engaging lecturer and doesn't use a powerpoint, which was really great. Writing intensive is definitely a lot more work (two 10 page papers and a shortened final, versus non-writing which was just midterm and final), but tests were a bit difficult even though they were open-note. If you're comfortable and confident writing essays, you might be better off doing writing-intensive. I found that the essays were actually pretty fun to write.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the more practical or practice oriented area of political science but also wants to understand the WHY the government has gotten to the place it currently is. This is a spectacular class. Professor Huber is a great lecturer and it is a really interesting class. It is a lot of reading but well worth it.",
    "Take this class, your general education and understanding of philosophy and law will greatly benefit from it.",
    "I would recommend Crime and Punishment if you're interested in a somewhat theoretical take on the criminal justice system. Professor Huber is a very dynamic speaker, although sometimes his lectures felt a little disorganized to me. There are two ways to take the class, writing intensive and non- writing intensive. I took it non- writing intensive which only requires a midterm, final, and section participation. Writing intensive requires you to write papers, but there is no midterm. I preferred non- writing intensive because it required less work over the course of the semester, but then the final was worth 55% of the grade. Both the midterm and final are open-note, which is helpful for the final, but somewhat pointless for the midterm since you only have 50 minutes, which doesn't leave you with time to read through your notes.",
    "I liked this class. I LOVED the first half, which I thought had interesting ideas and and really got me to thinking about the criminal justice system. I didn't really like the second half of the semester though. The lectures got a lot more biased and it became obvious what the professor felt and wanted you to believe as well. This made it more difficult to enjoy the class. That being said, if you are interested in this subject, the class is comprehensive and interesting, and taught well. If you take it non-writing intensive it is almost no work at all. I literally didn't read a single reading for the midterm and got an A.",
    "THIS IS NOT A GUT. Also, take it writing intensive!!!!!!!!!!! It's much easier to get a good grade if you do it writing intensive. And at least do some of the readings because you will not do well if you don't.",
    "A great class if you're interested in the philosophy behind the criminal justice system. A lot of reading, but you'll end up learning a lot.",
    "Very good class. Definitely consider taking it.",
    "Crime and Punishment is a well taught course and a good class for anyone who is interested in the US criminal justice system. Lectures can get a little dry, especially in the 2nd half of the course; however, the course is worth it for anyone interested in the course material.",
    "If you find the material interesting, take this class. I took it writing intensive and I'd recommend that method - the two papers aren't bad, and being able to edit them is a godsend. I had a fantastic T.F. and section, so that probably influences how much I liked this class, but I still give this class a strong recommendation.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student. There's a lot of readings, but if you keep up with them, they aren't that overwhelming. Additionally, the readings are really interesting.",
    "Take Crime and Punishment! Huber is amazing and the course is extremely interesting. Take it even if you aren't into law or PLSC -- it's a great course! Take it writing intensive if you can; you get a draft on each paper so it's not extremely stressful, no midterm, and a shortened 15% final.",
    "Really interesting! I'd definitely recommend taking it if you are interested in the criminal justice system. There is a lot of reading, but most of the concepts are pretty accessible.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. TAKE IT!",
    "Either take it WR or credit D. Very interesting material and lectures are enjoyable",
    "Without a doubt you should take this class. The material is incredibly interesting and Professor Huber knocks it out of the park each lecture. He's so passionate about this subject and it really shines through each lecture. I was in a non-WR section, so with just a midterm and a final to study for, this class was not a substantial amount of work. Awesome professor + reasonable courseload + really interesting material. TAKE IT.",
    "Professor Huber is a masterful lecturer. He is incredibly smart, articulate, and engaging. I enjoyed every lecture and left each class feeling like I had really learned something. He's one of Yale's true gems!"
