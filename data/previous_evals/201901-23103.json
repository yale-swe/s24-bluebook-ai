    "This class introduced me to a completely new field and introduced me to texts that will be incredibly useful as I embark on my dissertation research.",
    "This course offered insights into the trajectory of organicist thought, mainly in the German tradition, across a wide range of thinkers, tracing its development, transformation, and intersections with other intellectual movements and world events. It foregrounded a discussion as to the principles of organicism, identifying their heritage, and analyzing their impact."

   "comments": [
    "The course's biggest strength was the incredibly knowledgeable professor. Professor Wetters demonstrated deep knowledge about each of the intellectual throughways we explored and had important insights for nearly every question we brought to the table. Overall, this was an absolutely engaging and excellent course. Professor Wetters' willingness to engage with student questions both online and in person is outstanding and unlike anything I've seen at Yale. There are some things that I think could improve: With some of the readings, the main motivation to engage them seemed to be \"background research\" for other texts. At times, this extremely genealogical approach came at the expense of engaging closely with each text. As much as I appreciate the idea of a class that traces an idea through history, sometimes it would have been nice to approach individual sessions as more \"self-contained.\"",
    "The course was both highly structured and experimental in its combination of texts and the form of discussion. Because the course was so diverse in both readings and in student body, it was helpful to spend time discussing how the ideas and texts the course was centered on have been taken up (or not) differently by various fields and for what reasons. Finding a way to merge such discussions with the weekly textual analysis throughout the semester would be greatly beneficial."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course or any course with Professor Wetters.",
    "This course provided an expansive look at an area of thought that is deserving on increased attention and it did so in an engaging manner. It would be a good fit for advanced students seeking to understand the intellectual history of many, more commonplace concepts within the contemporary discourse of fields such as art, music, and computation as well as the environmental sciences, biology, architecture, or even sociology."
