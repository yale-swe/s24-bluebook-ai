    "This is a required course for all entering PhD students, so you'll have to take it. It's a very comprehensive introduction, though (as mentioned elsewhere) I do feel it can be improved. Still, it was an experimental run this year, so I hope we'll see improvements in later years.",
    "I would recommend this class without hesitation!",
    "Nice thematic overview of the major questions and theories in Film Studies. Very useful to understanding the field and its history."
