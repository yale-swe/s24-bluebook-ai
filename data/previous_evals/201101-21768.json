   "comments": [
    "need econometrics or it will be a steep learning curve",
    "It is what it sounds like: the economics of issues relating to development. Lots of stata.",
    "Yes--one of the greatly useful Econ classes.",
    "interesting class if you like learning about the methods used and how certain issues affect less developed countries. papers can be boring to read sometimes, but presentation at the end is worth taking the class. problem sets take up alot of time, but only 4 throughout the semester.",
    "A fun, very interesting class. I learned a lot about the field of Development Economics and how to approach different papers and studies. Take it if you're interested in the subject.",
    "This class is structured around papers on important development economic issues. The papers are specific - such as the impact of hookworm treatment on educational attainment - and the class does not always connect the papers with relevant policy questions. It is more an in depth reading of a number of papers than an overview of the development economics field. I would recommend this class to economics majors, but not to anyone who is more interested in how to solve development problems than in how to study them.",
    "Excellent class. Interesting topics and it was very useful in learning the methods of development econ. Also, it helped me in reading economics papers quite a bit. You might want to take econometrics as a prereq.",
    "No.",
    "This class is a little ridiculous for a number of reasons.First, half of the kids have taken metrics while the other half hasn't, so professor Qian's response was to try and teach metrics in like a week. Needless to say, it didn't work. If you've taken metrics, this will be an easy review. If you haven't, you'll be very confused.Second, the class was really unstructured. Each week we \"read\" an article or two and then listened to the lecture on it, but there was very little cohesion in the syllabus. The upside is that you don't really have to do any readings.Third, the problem sets were ridiculously long. Like...upwards of 40 problems, and they're all really annoying. But you only have to do three, so it's not so bad.Finally, the upside to this class is that it ends REALLY early. There's a midterm and then final presentations (no actual final). My presentation was pretty soon after spring break, so I literally didn't have to show up to class during April. It was kind of nice to be completely done.",
    "DO NOT take this unless you have taken econometrics. Only take it if you are very interested in the subject because otherwise it will be confusing and boring.",
    "This is a very interesting topic. Class isn't too much work, and the professor is nice. Good econ class",
    "I would recommend the class only if you have taken econometrics and understand statistics, that would make the class infinitely better and would enable you to get more out of it. The problem sets are killer, just take forever, and stata is a pain to work with.",
    "I'd recommend it if you want to learn about how to look at development through an econometric lens and like to read economic papers.",
    "A very interesting course that covers a wide range of relevant topics in the developing world. You definitely will have an edge if you've taken econometrics; if you haven't, then it's definitely doable but will be a tougher courseload. The professor is awesome and there is only a midterm and no final. A great math-ey econ course for those interested in this subject.",
    "A development econ class which emphasizes reading a lot of econ papers and discussing them in class. Take intermediate micro and econometrics before taking the class. Go to TA\/her office hours",
    "Be prepared to work hard, but then you will actually learn the econometrics needed for writing your own research papers!"
