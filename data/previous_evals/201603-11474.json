    "I learned how to analyze papers, how to assess the coherence of an argument and whether it was tautological or actually a solid argument.",
    "Better summary analysis. Better skim-reading. Better synthesis of arguments.",
    "I learned a lot about general concepts, theories, and viewpoints in the field of comparative politics, practiced writing short responses, and had a lot of fantastic discussions about political science.",
    "Knowledge gained through this class was almost exclusively a result of the readings assigned, which means the important benefits of insight gained by hearing others' interpretation of the material was largely lost. I have a slightly better understanding of the issues around statehood, nations, ethnic conflict, and other cornerstones of comparative politics, but nothing nearing the degree I had expected.",
    "An overall understanding of politics and different events in the history of the world.",
    "I think the most important skill I took away from this course was how to compare different situations. So much of the course was about looking at the reasons behind certain occurrences, and we had to understand why some explanations were better than others.",
    "I learned about some pretty practical ideas in political science. Some readings were interesting while some weren't as much. I can now participate in fruitful discussions about things like the Arab Spring, voter preferences, civil wars, and how governments function. Some skills I developed were being able to better criticize arguments.",
    "Knowledge on how different forms of government work and which are more effective.",
    "How to critique political science papers.",
    "I learned a broad scope of topics regarding international and interstate relations. Very interesting",
    "I developed a solid background of theories that surmise important questions in the field of political science.",
    "This course helped me improve my analytical skills and taught me some important new concepts (like tautology).",
    "Analyzing prominent authors in political science. An important start to a political science major.",
    "I learned a lot about current political events and how to properly analyze them.",
    "Learned a lot about how to critique political science theories.",
    "Learned how to write about and examine political theory in a real-world context",
    "Writing and Reading. I also learned some insights into interesting questions on comparative politics as a branch of political science",
    "AMAZING COURSE! Offers an awesome introduction to topics in comparative politics and if you care about the subject matter, can gain a strong understanding of key thinkers such as Tilly, Bates, Kalvas, Boix, Downs, etc. Will help in upper-level political science classes, too!",
    "The understanding and complications of different theories. The ability to develop a critique towards a certain theory.",
    "How to analyze critically",
    "I increased my knowledge of political strategy and increased my argumentative writing skills",
    "I developed my writing skills as well as the skill of cross-applying different theories and causes to different countries and different events in time.",
    "Theories of democratization, state-building, and authoritarian rule. Recent history of Middle East region and Arab Spring. Critical analysis of political theory in the form of discussion and papers.",
    "Great Political Science class, you learn about democracy, authoritarianism and conflict.",
    "A solid foundation in comparative politics and an overview of important ideas, concepts, and terms of political science.",
    "I learned how to better induce reasoning through a multitude of theories or authors.",
    "I think this course did an excellent job of encouraging and teaching us to find counterarguments. The course really helped me develop analytical tools to dissect an argument and find its strengths as well as its flaws.",
    "A different way to look at the world",
    "Critical thinking, critical reading, comprehensive reading, historical learning",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was great, it is truly focused on teaching students. It does not try to make it difficult but instead teaches us how to think and build skills that enable us to better judge the papers we read.",
    "Gets better over the course of the semester. At first, readings seem a bit jumbled. But overall a cool class and you have a great introduction to key comparative politics concepts.",
    "I think that the strengths are its clear and informative lectures, knowledgable instructors, and personable TFs.",
    "The course itself is largely fine--it's a lecture format with assigned readings and a required section each week. The issues I had with it were entirely in the execution. For example, the professor's lectures were unclear, unorganized, and monotonous and added extremely little to the readings. The TFs each gave a guest lecture, and 3 of the 4 were a huge improvement over the professor's efforts--clear, concise, full of useful information, and provided a valuable analysis and summary of the assigned readings. Section was largely unhelpful and not an effective use of time. It would have been much more useful to have used the time more similarly to a typical seminar discussion, wherein students would discuss and compare the ideas of the various readings, rather than spend time looking up obscure points of a particular reading. It's really important for TAs\/TFs to have a solid grasp of classroom management and student engagement.",
    "I think that it is often hard to captivate the attention of students by doing simple PowerPoint lectures. Professor Lawrence did a good job at trying to get us to stay focused. However, it is hard to truly appreciate what she is teaching us when we are concerned with writing down the notes from the PowerPoint. I also didn't love the fact that we had to hand-write our notes because they were hard to access when I wanted to study, and transcribing them from hand-written to computer form is a lot of work on top of the other classes I am taking.",
    "Piazza felt more like a hassle than a way to engage with the readings.",
    "Strengths - Real world approach, Focus on past on current events, Not much work during the year (weekly section to keep up with readings, three 4 page papers, midterm, final, but class definitely gets stressful around exam time, Christopher Price as TA big + Weaknesses - Boring lecture, Difficult to study for, Not enough feedback on assessments",
    "Strengths: discussion section and lecture were pretty good at explaining the subjects Weaknesses: The readings were dull and the lecture wasn't engaging",
    "I loved this course. Wouldn't change a thing",
    "A strength is that everything that is said in lecture is relevant to the topic presented. The TA lectures were also very good.",
    "The workload is just right. Evenly spaced out through the semester, with reading responses that help keep you engaged with the material while also developing your own analytical skills.",
    "Little individualized material to engage with.",
    "Loved the readings. Consuelo is the best TF ever. Lectures supplemented the readings very well.",
    "Strengths: great and expansive overview of comparative politics concepts; Weaknesses: lectures were sometimes boring; content didn't always seem connected; expectations for assignments were occasionally unclear",
    "This lecture was a great survey of political theory. It was very helpful as background for other, higher-level political science courses. Definitely worth taking if you are planning on taking political science seminars in the future.",
    "Very structured and interesting material. Could do more to make class interesting and increase participation",
    "Strengths: Great subject matter, fantastic lecturer, and very logical (!)",
    "Pretty clear lectures and good TAs",
    "I did not do much for this course, but the lectures were engaging.",
    "Taught by a great professor. Teaching fellows are tough graders",
    "The lectures are engaging and section helped reinforce what we learned in lecture",
    "The class is very interesting and full of information. However, at times, it may seem that there is too much material being presented at once. The readings are very dense and hit or miss when getting their points across.",
    "Strengths: exams are fair, lectures are informative, sections are a great resource for review, new and interesting material about modern politics especially in second half of the class Weaknesses: lectures not always the most engaging, first half very theory-heavy, only about a third of the class attends lecture.",
    "Professor Lawrence was always very engaging and tried to make things clear. Probably the readings for the first part of the semester were not as great.",
    "Interesting lectures, very clear and fair assignments, and engaging material in class and section.",
    "The strengths were the strong and clear teaching style of the professor, and the structured summary by the TA. The weaknesses were probably the uniform fashion of homework",
    "I think the course was excellent for the first two units but then got very confused and directionless in the third unit. It seemed like we hopped around between peaceful protests, regimes, and the Arab Spring. Also, I desperately wanted at least one lesson comparing the EU to the US which seems super relevant to world events.",
    "Could have been more explicit about how some of the readings related",
    "This class is awesome -- it would be better if it were less intensive on the readings. It would also be better if we focused on some current events, or at least connected our learnings to current events more.",
    "it needs to be made clear how to study for the first exam, strengths were the grade distribution and TAs",
    "It is interesting material but relys too greatly on the readings",
    "This is a great survey course of many of the most prominent scholars and theories in comparative politics. I was able to relate some of the material I learned to other History and Political Science courses, and enjoyed the class's topic-based structure. Slightly more instruction on how to structure the three short papers at the beginning of the course would have been helpful. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, Adria is a great teacher, she will actually teach you and the course material is very interesting. I really feel like I got a lot out of this class.",
    "Take it. It's a good intro course.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed this class and I learned a lot about the material and my understanding of the topic.",
    "This was the last semester this instructor will teach this course, so I would imagine it would be better under the next professor. The course itself could be a very useful foundation for political science. As a survey course, it is really more about exposure to breadth than any real depth of understanding. It might be a more effective use of time to read some of the assigned readings on one's own for the information and take a different course instead.",
    "Take this if you want to learn about the history of politics and different events that occurred throughout the world.",
    "This course is relatively low-impact. If you're looking for a course to do well on the exams and the papers, by all means take it. It's very straight-forward. However, if you're looking for a course to absolutely 'wow' you and interest you, this isn't the class for you.",
    "This class was pretty engaging overall. I thought the course topics were pretty practical most times, but some of the readings were a bit boring. Going to lecture was always helpful (and necessary if you skipped readings). Professor Lawrence won't be teaching at Yale anymore so I'm not sure how the course will change, but I would recommend this course. Doesn't take too much time and the workload is pretty light. I'm not a political science major or anything and didn't find my inexperience in the subject to harm me much. I thought the midterm was very fair, though it was important to address all the main points of the readings in your answers, even if the professor criticized some of them. Final was a bit more challenging, but still very fair. Discussion section was pretty easy to participate in as well. The only thing I found annoying was posting twice on the piazza forum each week. Tldr; pretty good class with pretty light workload and fair tests if you know the main points of the readings and understand class concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student but they should proceed with caution. If you do not have a prior knowledge of any current events or a solid historical background you may find yourself at a small disadvantage compared to the students who do. For the essays, pay attention in section and take notes intensively on one topic your TA seems enthusiastic about, this will bring you to best results. The three essays are worth 30% of your grade and are graded out of 10, so 9's and above will really help cover up for a bad grade on the midterm and final. The midterm (20%) was difficult for me because I had no idea what to expect, if you make a comprehensive study guide outlining the readings briefly and have a general understanding for what the author is saying, you should be fine. Also, pay attention for clues from your TA in section, they know what they are doing! For the final (35%), I was a bit more prepared as I knew what to expect and how to study for it. It was a couple of definition id's from the lectures, a few short answer questions that come from the general ideas of some of the lectures and then one essay that covers the major topics in the class. You get to pick 3\/5 ids, 3\/5 short answers, and 1\/2 essay questions to answer so my suggestion would be to make sure you know several things really well rather than trying to know a little bit of everything. Overall this class was pretty good but can be difficult if you do not prepare well. If you are a student who can grasp major concepts well and would prefer less work during the school year in exchange for a lot of studying for the two exams, then take it.",
    "Yeah I would recommend this course to another student, it was fairly easy with its workload and getting an A is definitely possible. Grading was a little strict for the midterm, but the questions were fair (same goes with the final), and we were given more than enough time.",
    "Great course! Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in obtaining an overview of important political science questions and the theories behind them, and a student who's interested in world events, particularly dealing with other governments and revolutions and whatnot.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. If the material doesn't interest you then you probably won't care for it, since lecture and the class as a whole isn't too flashy--a more or less straightforward analysis of important questions in comparative politics and breakdown of the various theories that have been proposed to answer them. If you are interested, though, like I was, you'll love it. The readings were great, the contemporary issues explored fascinating, and the workload was perfect, enough to keep you very engaged with the class without being overwhelmed. I especially enjoyed writing the reading responses and discussing the material with my classmates in the weekly forums. Professor Lawrence isn't a breathtaking lecturer, but she helps break down the material very effectively and has some interesting anecdotes to spare. As an introduction to comparative politics, this course definitely succeeds, and I'm interesting in wading deeper into the field. Recommended!",
    "Yes if you are interested in reviewing important political scientists.",
    "Unfortunate that Prof. Lawrence is not returning next term. This class really is very interesting and not difficult at all. The readings are great and the lectures very informative. You can learn a lot if you want to.",
    "If you want a basic overview of comparative politics, sure. But, be cautious because not all students are equally invested in the course some are there just for a grade and don't actually care about the material.",
    "This lecture was a great survey of political theory. It was very helpful as background for other, higher-level political science courses. Definitely worth taking if you are planning on taking political science seminars in the future.",
    "Yes. Particularly those who have not take any political science class before. The material is interesting",
    "Yes! An excellent course, fantastic subject matter, and great staff (Cebul, Lawrence, etc.). Wish I could take this again - feeling nostalgic.",
    "Yes I would",
    "Absolutely. Extremely beneficial class when it comes to improving and developing skills to be used in other classes, not necessarily in the major. There is a lot of information to be learned and cross-applied to other courses.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class as a good intro political science class for prospective majors to understand the field of comparative politics. Workload is reasonable, exams are fair, material is largely easy to understand if you attend lecture and section. Overall, relatively interesting and manageable intro polisci class.",
    "Absolutely take it! The readings are very interesting and Professor Lawrence is a great lecturer.",
    "Yes!!!!! Great professor and TFs, and a solid foundation for anyone interested in political science.",
    "I would, I found the material engaging and the professor well spoken",
    "You should take this course if you want a relatively easy but interesting course on politics. If you're not into politics skip this course, the class is pretty self explanatory.",
    "Yes.",
    "Possibly it gets little boring at times and was not the course i expected.",
    "This class is really interesting and not too difficult -- a good political science course!",
    "yes",
    "Yes, the material is very interesting",
    "Yes, take it if you would like an introduction to the basic theories of comparative politics or as as a not too difficult fourth or fifth class."
