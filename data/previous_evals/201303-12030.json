    "Well, it's research for credit, so everybody's experience depends on their group and project, but I know my experience was very positive and rewarding. It was nice to bring a project I started working on the summer to near completion. The classes with Dr. Parr, on the other hand, were really instructive; everybody doing research should definitely receive training on ethical misconduct. The classes were also not demanding at all - only a couple of mandatory readings - so there was no added stress from them. You should definitely do this if you plan on going to graduate class or if you want to see what being a chemist is truly like. Lecture classes and teaching labs aren't really truly indicative of what chemistry in the lab is like. Do realize though that doing research in the academic year is not nearly as efficient as in the summer. You will need to have a good and flexible schedule (what would be termed as good depends on the nature of your project, of course) if you want to get the most out of the time spent in the lab.",
    "If you are interested in conducting chemistry research for credit, this is the course for you! You often find that the 10 hour minimum evolves into around 15-20 hours a week if you want to keep the ball rolling on everything, but it's a fantastic experience nonetheless.",
    "This is about the weekly 50 minute lecture by Dr. Parr...Boring ethics training that Parr keeps bearable with historical examples of plagiarism. The readings are actually pretty interesting, so I recommend doing them. No work for lecture, but there are obviously many, many hours of lab :(",
    "Required for the Chemistry major. Just sit through the sections.",
    "Yes -- if you're going to be doing research during the year, you might as well do it for credit. The additional work required for 490 is minimal: apart from 10 hours a week in lab, there's just some light reading during an \"ethics training,\" which lasts for about 5 weeks, and after that one person per week presents their research in an informal group meeting-style presentation.",
    "It's research for credit, it's what you make of it?",
    "I thought it was a rewarding experience. A lot depends on your PI, what you're working on, and who you're working on it with. Make sure you're really interested in whatever you're researching, as 10 hours per week is the minimum. If you're into it, you may find yourself wanting to spend over 10 hours in lab some weeks."
