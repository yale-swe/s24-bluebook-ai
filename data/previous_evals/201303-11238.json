   "comments": [
    "Great class. My professor helped us approach philosophy with the goal of answering questions instead of just reading the material. Highly recommend and second semester should be even better.",
    "Philosophy was easily the most challenging of the three DS courses, at least for me. It wasn't something I ever had the opportunity to study before, and philosophy papers are so different from any other academic paper I'd ever written it took some getting used to. That said, many of the concepts we discussed were very relevant--particularly the theological philosophy towards the end of the semester.Aaron was a great professor and I'm really glad I had him for my first philosophy course ever. He's very chill, and the forum thing he started in the large breaks between sections was a useful way to recap what we'd been talking about before the next class.",
    "Yes! This was my first time in a philosophy class, and it was a fantastic introduction to the subject.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "A look at a lot of individual philosophers; not so much a look at the big ideas and different philosophers approach--be prepared to do a lot of this thinking yourself. I would recommend it if you are willing to do the work and if you want a basic exposure to Ancient philosphy, particularly plato and aristotle.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it does an amazing job in familiarizing a student with western philosophy.",
    "Classes with Aaron were very interesting, and the atmosphere was relaxing enough for intense philosophical debate. He frequently announced the questions he wanted us to tackle at the beginning of the class, and then a show of hands decided which question to discuss first. The class would then immediately launch into discussion (or not, depending upon how interesting the question was!). At other times, he took online discussion forums that we were expected to participate in before coming to class, as the starting point for in-class discussion. The language used in class was pretty colloquial which further encouraged stress-free discussion. Overall, this was the best class I took in my Freshman Fall!",
    "If you're looking at DS chances are you're already inclined towards the sort of study it requires. Philosophy papers required a very different skill set than the other two. Many people found them subsequently annoying and difficult but many (myself included) found them the best of the three. They do, however, require a lot of thinking and engagement with the the text. Tracing the developments in thought are really fun. It's also great to see how you can trace a good deal of philosophy back to Plato\/Aristotle, Aristotle especially.Aaron Norby is also a wonderful professor. I can't stress that enough. His was my favorite section this semester. He is adorable, smart, funny and engaging, and always gives weight to student discussions in section. Also, he was always willing to go over concept talked about in section\/discuss papers in office hours, and my philosophy papers always had the most feedback out of the three. He did a great job of making himself available to his students. Don't switch out if you get him.",
    "A difficult but engrossing introduction to early philosophy. I would recommend it to another student for the scope of the readings and the many different perspectives that the course presents."
