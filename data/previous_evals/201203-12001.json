    "Now THIS is how a lab class should be. Meets once a week, with additional data-collection sessions later in the semester. You learn all you need to know to conduct EEG and fMRI analyses--an amazing feat for a one-semester course. Lab reports are eminently reasonable (none of the pedantic bullshit required in other lab classes). Professor McCarthy is great, and Su Mei is a terrific TA. I cannot recommend this class highly enough. Only thing: Cog sci majors, CONTACT PROFESSOR MCCARTHY AHEAD OF TIME LETTING HIM KNOW YOU WANT TO TAKE THE COURSE. Psych Majors get to preregister, so make sure to let him know ahead of time that you want to take the class.Take it take it take it.",
    "As a Psychology major, you are required to take one of the many Research Methods courses available. I had read such great reviews for this class, and thought that learning the procedures behind fMRI and EEG analyses would be extremely beneficial. However, a huge portion of the class was staring at computer screens for hours on end, followed by a lab report of your findings from the class wiki. Getting to visit the EEG and fMRI centers in person were interesting, as well as creating your own original research project, but other than that the class wasn't anything special.",
    "This class is great and is a really unique way to learn about research methods. If you have a background in neuroscience, go for it. If you do not, be prepared for a struggle that will be difficult but rewarding in the end. The professor is fantastic and a great person to work with, and the projects are really interesting. If you are okay with taking a really hard, really work intensive class, I would totally recommend it. You learn a ton.",
    "If you plan on doing any kind of cognitive neuroscience research for an extended period of time, this course is a gem and you absolutely have to take it. You don't come across a course like this very often. If not, you might still find some of the material interesting, but it won't be very useful to you.",
    "A really interesting class. The 6 lab reports took a great deal of time, but really I only stayed up late 6 nights in the semester to get them done. Besides that, the final project took a great deal of my reading week (which was difficult as it was no longer a week) and try to get it started early if you can. There is no outside work\/readings beyond these assignments, and the lectures are pretty interesting.",
    "230L is definitely a difficult course, but on the other side, it was definitely one of the most rewarding experiences I've had at Yale. Professor McCarthy is up front with you - it's going to take a lot of time outside of class, especially towards the end of the semester, and it does. Working on your own experiment, and finding results, however, is tremendously rewarding. We had a presentation during reading week where each group showed what they had been working on, and it was there I realized just how much work everyone had done, and it was really really cool. I loved this course, and if you're up for a challenge, I'd absolutely recommend it.",
    "I could not recommend it enough. You have the chance to do your own fMRI experiment, and to learn from Professor McCarthy!!! It literally does not get any cooler than that.",
    "Yes, but only if learning about the fMRI and EEG are things that you are REALLY REALLY interested in. Don't underestimate how much time this class will take, especially in the final weeks.",
    "PSYC 230L is a class that requires a lot of time and patience. It is a fantastic course, but the material may be overwhelming. It is best to really stay on top of the material and to do as much as you can during the allotted lab time. Unfortunately, I feel as if I was not able to fully enjoy the course because of my heavy course schedule. Make sure to take as much as you can from this course. It is extremely useful.",
    "If you're at all interested in learning how MRI or EEG works, definitely take this course! Professor McCarthy is a great lecturer and you get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to actually conduct your own MRI or EEG experiments and analyze your own data. The course is very technical though so it can be tough at times, and I would highly recommend having a strong background knowledge in neuroanatomy. But this course is so worth it!",
    "This class required a significant time investment, but in the end you really get a lot out of the work that you are doing. The weekly labs allow you to really gain an understanding of the work that goes into conducting neuroscience research, specifically EEG and fMRI. I think the final project, although it essentially takes over your life from Thanksgiving break on, really gives you chance to work with the other students in the class and really apply the knowledge learned over the course of the semester.I would recommend the class, but would warn that the workload for the class gets quite significant at the end of the semester. Expect lots of late nights at SSS."
