   "comments": [
    "Take it!",
    "This is a great class to take if it is out of your comfort zone.",
    "Yes. The material is interesting and the class is fun. The work is also perfectly manageable--no final exam!",
    "This is a good course for students thinking about starting the art history major or looking to diversify their course load with a relatively easy class that still holds interest.",
    "Professor Mimi is great but the material is incredibly boring and the exams require a ridiculous amount of memorization. Besides studying for the tests and writing the paper, there is essentially no work.",
    "Definitely recommend, especially as a fifth class, especially if you're interested in religious studies or art history. I'd never taken a HSAR class before and found it completely relaxing.",
    "This is a great introductory art history class. I would definitely recommend it, as it is very unique, and very interesting.",
    "A lecture-based course on very interesting material. The professor knows the subjects ridiculously well and is remarkably nice and accommodating. Interesting reading, although the only main work are the two exams and the final paper. Definitely would recommend this course.",
    "Interesting, not too much work. Can get a teensy bit repetitive. But good class.",
    "You should definitely take this course, regardless of your major. First, the artistic material is fascinating and allows you learn a lot about Buddhism from a variety of perspectives (philosophical, cultural, historical, religious, geographical, etc). Second, Prof. Yiengpruksawan is, without a doubt, one of the best professors I have had at Yale. She conveys her passion in each of her lectures, making you quickly fall in love with Buddhist art. She is also very considerate and approachable (she goes by Mimi). If you have any problems, doubts or concerns, she will do her best to help you. Finally, the workload is not very high. There are weekly readings (in total, no more than 50 pages per week), two midterms, and a 10-15 final paper.",
    "Yes, if you want to have an introductory overview of Buddhist art then take it. If you want to get to know a bit of the basic tenants of Buddhism take it. Prof. Yiengpruksawan is a great instructor and cares for her students. This is a really good art history class with a very manageable work load.",
    "The course is excellent. The information is thorough and Mimi does a really good job going through it. She is a fun lecturer and she very enthusiastic the topics since she had been to most of the places that she talked about. With that said, she does present all the information we need to prepare for the two midterms. Grading on the exams are very lenient. She is extremely easy going, and conversations with her is very enjoyable. This comes in handy especially when time comes for the final paper. She gives good advice and take many different opinions in terms of interpretations. This class got me thinking a lot more about Buddhist art and Buddhism in general, and I actually want to go to some of these Buddhist sites after taking the class. Take it if you have an extra credit to spare.",
    "It's a good course and Mimi is a great professor, but I would recommend shopping.",
    "A good intro to Buddhist art and art history. You will learn about the art and some of the history and some about Buddhism as well."
