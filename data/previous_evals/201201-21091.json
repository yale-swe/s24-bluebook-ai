   "comments": [
    "I think everyone who's interested in cultural\/social history in general should take it. It's best if the student had some background in history. The class also benefits one's writing techniques and enriches one's writing subjects.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Not only does it provide a great introduction to microhistory work, but it also surveys a wide range of microhistories, covering diverse fields and interests. I enjoyed hearing the projects pursued by students in the class, and I enjoyed the challenge of putting together what we learned over the first eight weeks into creating my own microhistory story. Lastly, Professor Wrightson is a strong seminar leader and made himself available during the research and writing process--offering great help outside of his field and genuine interest in his students.",
    "- great course",
    "I am recommending it to anyone with a pet project in mind and a curiosity about writing microhistory. Incredibly relaxing and stimulating class because it doesn't demand a common body of knowledge. Really stands out in that way and is incredibly useful. Also appreciated the slow pass of the presentation schedules, which gave everyone an opportunity to receive truly helpful feedback.",
    "Yes, would strongly recommend to anyone looking to understand better the craft of writing history",
    "I would recommend Microhistories to any student wishing to gain a better grasp of what microhistory is and what the methodology can offer historians. I'd particularly recommend the course to any early modernist wishing to gain a better grasp of what's been done with microhistory in the social, cultural, and religious history of the early modern world.",
    "History 602 is a great introduction to a particular methodology within history. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you are at all interested in how to do primary research on a fragmented archive--or historiography in general--you really should take this class. Plus the readings vary widely and are great fun."

   "comments": [
    "I am very interested in cultural history, and microhistory has always been an area that I wanted to explore. The subjectopened my eyes to possibilities of writing history, and the possibilities of ways of lives on this planet. It definitely nurtures a sense of cultural tolerance and appreciation in me.",
    "I appreciate the insight on another technique of history writing, and how to go about writing a successful microhistory. Also, it was great to put works into the context of the careers of the historian. If I continue to pursue history, this course will be immensely helpful.",
    "I've never worked microhistorically before, so the opportunity to read microhistories and discuss the methodology in depth and then construct my own microhistorical analysis was extremely fruitful. I was able to pursue a topic of research that I've been interested in for several years and that will add to my research here at Yale.",
    "This course improved my skills working with archival sources. I think the one drawback about trying to do micro histories in such a small amount of time is that it's hard to absorb all the necessary secondary literature and do the primary source work to make an effective microhistory.",
    "The micro frame of analysis was already the one I preferred. But this class strengthened my research skills and taught me to combine close investigation with larger questions. This style of approach will definitely make be a better scholar of literary history."
