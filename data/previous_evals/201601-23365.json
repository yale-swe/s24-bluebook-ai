    "The course is clearly based on material coming focusing the US and Connecticut energy and legal framework scenario. Even if there is a global session (the last third of the course) the course is extremely limited to US focus. Although the instructor did many efforts \"to keep the course global\", there was a lack of global case studies and an absence of situations to put hands on practical and existing international issues on climate change. Again the course is very US (if not Connecticut) oriented. It is not enough to call on question students from different nationalities to make the \"globalize\" the course and align it with the global needs of climate change. The instructor should assume different perspectives on the climate change putting himself in the shoes of several countries and contexts. I found this did not happen. There is an international session but even this part is taught to students by talking of a global issue from a US filtering lens, not assuming really an international point of view.",
    "13 Dan is an excellent professor. No frills teaching method, just him and the students and his notes. Very engaging, gets people to talk, very knowledgeable and uses real life examples to get people interested in the topics he covers each class. He is very supportive of students in class, but also pushes for a diverse set of answers, and is very approachable out of class too.",
    "I certainly enjoyed the course and found what I learned to be quite valuable. That said, its limitations as a survey course were apparent, and its admirable attempt to combine lecture and discussion did not feel fully successful. I would have appreciated more clear and lengthy explanations of frameworks for analysis, and perhaps fewer topics covered but a bit more depth.",

Its lecture-discussion style, while not perfect, did make it a lot easier to engage with material actively (compared to a straightforward lecture course). Policy memos were also quite useful and productive exercises.",

    "1. Policy Memos- Useful and practical. 2. Course structure and readings- Excellent and very well researched. 3. Lecture sessions- Were very engaging. This course was perhaps one of the few at FES which provided an opportunity for the integration of diverse global perspectives in class lecture. I gleaned a lot from from fellow students who had some form of expertise in particular aspects of the course. 4. Current and in tune with real time events in energy and climate governance, such as the supreme court ruling on the CPP and the December 2015 Paris Agreement.",

Also the Instructor should make an effort to detach from his \"US capitalist\" filtered view on climate change and assume different perspective when it comes to the global aspect of the issue. But I know, it is not easy to do!",

That said, its limitations as a survey course were apparent, and its admirable attempt to combine lecture and discussion did not feel fully successful. I would have appreciated more clear and lengthy explanations of frameworks for analysis, and perhaps fewer topics covered but a bit more depth. I also am unsure how to feel about the take-home final, which was portrayed as a way to explore ideas with intellectual vigor, but was constrained in time (justifiably, I suppose) and, more importantly, discussion of the exam with peers was forbidden. Though that makes sense in the context of an exam, it is not conducive to the intellectual exploration I would have found more fulfilling getting out of the exam and the course.",
    "More guidance on policy memo writing at the beginning of the semester, more explanation of participation grade, cover more developing countries, too many readings",
    "The class is designed to be more of a survey course than a seminar. Perhaps next year, Dan could limit the size of the course to provide for more fruitful discussion and offer a larger lecture course to complement the seminar course.",
    "The readings and course content were at times repetitive. Dan also selectively focused on certain issues, while I would have appreciated greater breadth of coverage.",
    "Perhaps more basic technical concepts of energy issues, which many lack. And also perhaps a field trip or group discussions and more debates.",
    "Having a better understanding of how to write a good memo in the beginning of class would be beneficial.",
    "Would be better as a seminar instead of a lecture. These topics lend themselves well to discussion and critical thinking, not simply being told.",

    "Esty tends to talk a lot about CT and his prior position as Commissioner at DEEP.",
    "There is too much reading material.",
    "Professor's Esty's talents are fallow without a tad bit of environmental case and statutory law. Many of us would have loved to hear him dive into the leaves of the CAA or Clean Power Plan, not simply wave his hand at the forest. His lucid contextual narratives should eradicate any fear of the course estranging talented people\/potential advocates lacking prior experience (especially if case briefs do not bear the burden of including such analysis in their scant pages).",
    "While the course is one of the few truly global courses at FES, I sometimes felt that lectures and class discussions on some topics lacked balance and\/or were not fully exhaustive. Specifically, the lectures on Climate Equity, Climate Adaptation and the Climate Governance role of some international organisations.",
    "More portion in course materials on developing countries would be great.",
    "There need to be a broader international outlook",

It can be said that this was done on porpouse to stimulate the critical skills of students to look around for other sources and have a variety of view on the topics.

To improve the readings should better selected. Also take new readings!! Many of them were dated around 2000!!!",

    "Be ready to write, write and write",
    "I'd recommend going with the paper option rather than the exam option. Also, I enjoyed sitting and listening to the lecture rather than feverishly typing out notes, and would recommend a similar approach.",
    "This course is an overview of issues of climate and energy, focused on policy and \"Comparative Institutional Analysis.\" It is definitely a broad survey course--depth is not its forte, but it gives good background on many topics. The course requires 3 short policy memos, which are manageable and quite useful to learn how to write. Beyond that, readings are manageable, though at times quite long and not always engaging. The course has a take-home final, which I recommend not procrastinating. I'd say the course is worth taking, and manageable even if you don't have a lot of background in the subject, though most of your classmates would. I also wouldn't expect everything to be super clear or concrete, but I recommend visiting office hours (and Dan's office hours) more than I did, which I think would help.",
    "Take the course in your first year.",
    "There is a lot of reading for this course, so make sure you give yourself enough time to get through what readings may be most useful for you.",
    "Take it!! You won't regret it.",
    "Take it absolutely!",
    "Be ready to participate in the class discussion",
    "Definitely take this course. It may be a bit of reading, but it's a worthwhile set of readings that are very actively discussed in class. The fact that the course is Law\/FES is really unique and helps provide unique perspective. Along with this, the students are from a variety of schools (Law, FES, SOM, Jackson) which adds color to classroom discussion.",
    "Do it!",
    "This course is a comprehensive survey of climate change and clean energy issues and policies internationally and domestically.",
    "To go through all the reading materials provided before class.",
    "Great course and I think it was the most necessary one I took at FES.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in learning more about the basics of issues in clean energy both in the United States and abroad. Not super high level, but a great intro level course.",
    "I'd advise students to target their policy briefs toward realms of Clean Energy with which they have the least facility, and to reserve depth in their focal area for the term paper. As a development economist, I had an epiphany regarding Environmental Communication prompted by an Esty deadline forcing me to write on the topic, and I am so thankful for the serendipity that opened my eyes to the topic. I hope for the same for you.",
    "Climate and Clean Energy is an ideal survey course for anyone interested in exploring the inter-linkages between energy and climate. The course also provides useful insights into global climate governance (policy & legal). I highly recommend this course for international students seeking to gain an understanding of domestic energy & climate policy.",
    "Take it! this a great course for those who are interested in climate change and the future trend of world's energy",
    "it a very good course and I learnt a lot",
    "Keep up with the readings (at least skim) and participate in discussion!"
