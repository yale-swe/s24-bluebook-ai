    "You learn about four major topics in vertebrate paleontology: the origin of vertebrates, including fish and amphibians; mammals; non-archosaurian reptiles; and dinosaurs, crocs, and birds. It's a \/lot\/ of information in a short period of time and Jacques\/Holger really like to talk a lot, but if you have the time and interest then by all means take the class. The material is high quality and you also get to see and touch lots of Yale-Peabody specimens (fossils and skeletons alike), so I'd say the class is a phenomenal overview of vertebrate paleontology, even if it is pretty tough.",
    "A really great class! Fast-paced and a lot of material, but extremely rewarding and fun.",
    "This is an in-depth review of every extinct and extant group of vertebrate. The format is four exams (one every two weeks), and a few quizzes at the start of the term. Labs every other week are review for tests, and you will see some of the best vertebrate fossils in the Peabody's collection. It's amazing to hear about the subject from one of the big names in it, but be prepared to learn a huge amount of information, both theory and memorization."

    "Well, I'm not a grad student, haha... but I'm really glad I took it, because I'm absolutely amazed by all of the information that we've learned mostly just from looking at old dead things and I'm thinking I'd love to be able to study and contribute to this knowledge base as well. I still don't know what exactly I'd study (though the course helped me narrow things down, kind of) but I know that I find all things Life fascinating. (Also, vertebrates > invertebrates, sorry.)"
