    "A boatload of reading and writing. An interesting class (and even better if you have good classmates). Thought provoking topics. Especially relevant if you are an athlete\/ minority\/ woman or any combination o the three. I also thing guys can benefit a lot from this class.",
    "Expect a heavy workload. Definitely my most challenging and frustrating class this semester, but I definitely became a better writer from taking it. The topics of in-class discussion were always interesting.",
    "If you love sports, I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! It is a lot of work though: readings, reading responses, four papers with drafts.",
    "Lot of work",
    "It offers a really interesting and different way to look at sports. You also develop critical reading skills and a good foundation for writing essays.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course but be ready for a lot of work",
    "I would recommend the class based on the subject, not for improving writing. Sports lovers should take this for a writing credit, but probably not anyone else."
