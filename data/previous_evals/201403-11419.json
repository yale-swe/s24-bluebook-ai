   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. A great way to learn about academic writing, especially with Anya. She is a fantastic instructor who is always willing to listen and help out, and is very adept at guiding class discussions. Take 114 with Anya.",
    "In English 114 01, students are taught how to write essays on the assigned readings. Since this section is focused on fantasy world, our readings mostly focused on authors like JRR Tolkien and critics of Walt Disney and other fantasies. We were challenged to view fantasy as more than fiction, and through this our writing skills were also improved.",
    "It's a good class to learn how to write and improve your writing. Don't take it if you're already a great writer b\/c that's frustrating for the people who need the class",
    "I would recommend ENGL 114 to a student who wants to hone their writing skills coming into college. Make sure to pick a topic that interests you and a great professor.",
    "Fantasy worlds is a fun writing class based on an interesting topic.",
    "This is a brilliant course. My teacher was great, the subject was fascinating, and there isn't too much work. You will be expected to read an article almost every night, but generally they are pretty interesting. Your essays are going to be graded harder than you might be used to from high school, but they will be graded fairly and constructively. This class really helped with my writing and I would definitely recommend it to other students who are interested in becoming better writers.",
    "A great course for students wanting to break into the college writing world. Think carefully about the English section which you choose, because the semester will be much more painful if you are not interested in the topics you are writing about. The course requires consistent effort, but you get out of it what you put in.",
    "If you want to take an English course that makes you think critically about writing effectively, this is an excellent choice. Should you also be interested in different ideas of \"fantasy,\" from old fairy tales to modern shopping malls, this is the course for you. The instructor is amazing and so is the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course as a good introduction to college writing. I would also say that it is time consuming and therefore people who take the course should know that it will require consistent effort and research to succeed."
