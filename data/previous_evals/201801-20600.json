    "I learned about the diversity of the cognitive science program. For people in the major who don't know exactly what their direction is or who are trying to flush out their direction, this class is so helpful to understand the breadth of what you can do.",
    "This was a good way to introduce the class to many different fields of study.",
    "This course allowed me to see different ways one can pursue their cognitive science degree! It was also nice to hear from various professors and researchers."

   "comments": [
    "Most of the lectures were pretty good. But the lecture from anthropology stands out as the worst lecture where I felt like I gained nothing. In contrast, Frederick gave an incredible lecture.",
    "some of the lectures were DREADFUL. Would've been a much better use of time if the lecture was half the time, and you had to prove that you met with a certain number of professors outside of class.",
    "I was a senior taking this class and it felt like a waste of time because the whole point is to get an idea of what to do for the thesis but I was already working on my thesis... I just didn't care at all",
    "The course was good in bringing in speakers from various field within cognitive science. Perhaps a bit more time could have been dedicated to how to find a subject\/project within cog sci that interests you.",
    "I wish the meetings were a bit shorter! I think it could be equally as effective.",
    "It seems at times not cohesive",
    "This was overall a great course given that it is required. The only weaknesses could be attributed to dull guest lectures, but the interesting ones were always worthwhile. Regardless of the lecturer though, the class is definitely long enough to feel tired and disinterested towards the end. I think it would be nice to somehow implement a short break in between. Mark's discussion of the senior thesis process was also helpful, albeit somewhat intimidating at times. Perhaps a running anonymous survey throughout the year for people to ask questions that can be answered in class would be helpful? Although I can't imagine any question that people wouldn't want to ask in class, but idk just a thought.",
    "Professor Sheskin does a good job of setting up his expectations for us. I would recommend that some of the professors have a better understanding of coming in with a prepared lecture. At times some lecturers would ask right at the beginning what our questions were, but if you didn't understand all of the intricacies in their research that you read two days before, which most likely you didn't because the papers are intense and dense, you didn't have a great place to start because questions would be dry or sparse. I think it would have been better for lecturers to come prepared with at least some what of a presentation before asking for questions.",
    "This course should be streamlined in the Professor choices. More in psychology and neuroscience, less in primatology.",
    "I liked the survey style of this course. I do think there could be more time for discussion among students, though, aside from the time spent with lecturers."

    "This is a very straightforward class and it is exactly as advertised on the syllabus. Some of the lectures will be better than others, but it's pretty cool to learn from a variety of speakers and their research.",
    "You have to take this class, but it is not a lot of work and it's pretty interesting to learn about the work of many incredible professors here at Yale (or beyond, we have someone from MIT).",
    "it's required.",
    "you have to take it",
    "It is a mandatory cognitive science major course.",
    "It's a required class for people in the major and only in the major. It anything amazing but it also wasn't considerably challenging and if you're cogsci you have to take it so...",
    "It's a requirement",
    "You don't have a choice but it's not a bad course (except for the time and length) so don't worry :)",
    "I would recommend this course but it wouldn't really be helpful unless you were a junior in the major, which is the precise audience this class is for.",
    "Its required, but I think it fills a valuable role.",
    "Yes! It's a good way to learn about different ways to pursue the cognitive science major."
