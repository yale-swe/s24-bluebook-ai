   "comments": [
    "Definitely not an easy course. If you are looking for a general introduction course on Southeast Asia, this is definitely not the one. Many complicated anthropology concepts are discussed in the readings and this class basically forces you to read one book (around 200-300 pages) each week. Some of the books can be really fun and insightful, while some may just be really dense and difficult. Other than the readings, there isn't much workload but the readings themselves will take up a lot of time if you do end up reading all of them. That being said, if you are willing to challenge yourself in the field of anthropology and are interested in the Southeast Asian studies, this course will do all that for you.",
    "A good class if you're interested in Southeast Asia; although much of what we study is more historical and far less contemporary. You do read the key anthropological texts related to the area, so the readings are absolutely fascinating. The undergrad\/ grad dynamic can be a little strange, and students come in with very different levels of knowledge, but it was still very rewarding.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT! This is a great class and if you ever consider traveling to or studying Southeast Asia, this is a course that will give you a very solid grounding in the Anthropology of the region - and inspire you to study more on your own! And as an Anthro major - this is really the course to get you thinking about grad school.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, even if you're not familiar with Southeast Asia, the themes are universal. A lot of work, so do the readings, but overall a manageable class. Super interesting and a great challenge.",
    "Yes, I learned so much about SE Asia from the professor, but also my peers on how the class was laid out"
