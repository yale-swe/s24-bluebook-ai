    "This is going to be a tough review to write because Prof. Rothman is really nice and legitimately tries to make the class interesting and engaging. However, I will be honest. This class is extremely useless. Even though I got a pretty grade in the midterm and problem sets, I cannot remember anything that I learned in it and I am not alone in this. A lot of my friends would go out of lectures saying that they did not understand anything. Generally speaking, it is super unclear what the lecturers want you to learn and most of the lecturers are extremely bad at lecturing. I honestly cannot say that I learned much in this course."

Strengths: - Prof. Rothman is really nice and goes out of his way to try to make the course work. He is very approachable and is always offering help.",
    "I thought the problem sets were manageable and that the material was interesting. Sometimes there would be mistakes in the posted problem sets, which made it confusing. I thought the grading on the problem sets was sometimes ambiguous."

    "Super dry class but Professor Rothman clearly has so much love for the subject matter and wants to help you learn. Easy BME credit but you'll be bored for sure",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you need a BME elective and are in the imaging track. This course helped me to understand the basics of imaging so that I am ready for my senior project. Professor Rothman was always there to help and was always willing to answer my questions."
