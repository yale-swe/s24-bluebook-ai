    "TAKE THIS CLASS! You investigate a subject of your choosing, and become an expert in it. Professor Summers is amazing!",
    "I thought this was a really fun way to learn science considering I do not have a very strong science background. I felt I learned more than I thought I would every class meeting and a lot about my specific subject.",
    "Bill (not Professor Summers; he goes by Bill) is truly a genius. He knows so much about so many different areas. Taking a class with him is truly insightful because you learn so much just from listening to him talk. MB&B 110 is a great chance to learn about different areas of science through active research and collaboration with your peers.",
    "I was able to focus on my area of interest and learn about the methods and tools necessary for my research."

   "comments": [
    "This is the best class for humanities and social science kids that despise science. You get to research a topic that you love, which is makes attending class incredibly gratifying.",
    "I thought that the students were mixed in how engaged they were in others' topics. If there was a way to encourage students to discuss the other projects, I think that would make the class meetings better. I also felt that there were a few students that were over qualified for the class and it was difficult to follow their projects or learn from their research.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it gives you a chance to learn about different and diverse areas of science in a laid-back environment under the tutelage of an extraordinarily knowledgeable and accomplished Professor.",
    "I think this course is perfect as it is."

   "comments": [
    "I am very unsure whether to recommend this course to another students since I have no conception of my performance and remain waiting to see my final grade, which has given a great deal of anxiety. Past students have warned that it is very unpredictable, so it is difficult to understand how evaluations are conducted.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's the best science class for non-science majors.",
    "This is a great class for a non-science major and I really enjoyed being able to practice researching independently and in depth.",
    "Highly recommended science credit. Take if you can get in (it's very competitive so keep your fingers crossed).",
    "Yes, this is a wonderful course if you have a niche area of interest in science and would like to study it further."
