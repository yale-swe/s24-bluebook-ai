    "I would certainly recommend Chinese to another student. Although you must put in a lot of effort every day inside and outside of the classroom, the results in terms of language comprehension and ability to speak are incredible. The teachers truly want you to not only learn the language, but they also want you to enjoy speaking it.",
    "What an amazing course. I went from knowing no Chinese to being able to have a conversation with a native Chinese speaker in just a few months. Although it is a lot of work, this rigor is necessary in order for you to reach the level that we did.",
    "Would definitely recommend to a student willing to put in the effort and wants to improve their language skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. After 3 months of learning a new language, I felt very capable in it.",
    "A lot of work, but you learn very quickly. Very fast paced class",
    "A great, methodical, intensive, and highly enjoyable introduction to Chinese.",
    "Yes, if determined to continue Chinese study for multiple semesters",
    "This class is excellent if you really want to learn the language and are willing to dedicate the time to do so. You will be learning at a fast pace so make sure that you don't fall behind or memorize just enough material to complete the daily quizzes. Like for learning any language, you must take the time to retain and apply what you learned from the daily assignments or be overwhelmed when you have to relearn everything. Doing the exercises, using online resources, making the best out of the weekly tutorial (basically a mandatory tutoring session), and visiting the professors during office hours if you have any questions will ensure that you will both learn the language and have enough time to integrate the class into your schedule."
