    "Well, you don't have an option :) But it's really a great experience to get to share your work with the senior class. We really felt like a team by the end, rooting each other on (an energy I don't feel enough in the academic environment of Yale).",
    "Work for the class (besides writing a senior essay) seems to vary from year to year depending on who is teaching on it.",
    "LING 491 is a required course for the linguistics major in which students research a topic and write a long paper detailing their research and analyzing their chosen \"puzzle.\" Although the writing process can be a frustrating one, it is ultimately fruitful and worthwhile to write and have written an original research paper prior to the end of one's college career.",
    "Come on. This is a required class for senior linguistics majors.",
    "It's the senior thesis. You have to do it. Please decide on something and limit yourself to it as early as possible. It's so easy to go on tangents that make you lose sleep and waste 50+ hours over spring break. :-("
