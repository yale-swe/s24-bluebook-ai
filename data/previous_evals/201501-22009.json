   "comments": [
    "You read selections from Icelandic sagas and other relevant texts and translate them using a glossary. You become familiar enough with the language by the end to understand bits of it without the dictionary. You also read the texts in translation and talk about them a little bit.",
    "An incredibly enjoyable introduction to the language, culture, and literature of the Norse world during the Viking Age. There was a good balance between linguistic components of the course, with most of each class devoted to translation, and discussion of the broader Norse context.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it gives students the tools to read and interpret a truly unique literary culture in its original language.",
    "I would recommend LING 183 to any student who is interested in medieval literature, Vikings, or the like, but especially to someone who is really interested in learning the language.",
    "'Twas an amazing course! The texts we read were surprisingly nuanced and entertaining; those expecting nothing but gory tales of Viking battles will be surprised at the understated wit and emotion of these tales. It might be intimidating to be picking up texts in a new language, but Old Norse is so similar to English both in terms of syntax and vocabulary that it is not too hard. But do be warned--as Roberta, the professor, states so emphatically, this is really a course for people who love language. Most of the work is translation-based, so if a couple hours of translation a week sounds daunting to you then perhaps you should avoid this course. Speaking of Roberta, she was simply amazing. She is unfailingly friendly and encouraging, and I think she did an excellent job of presenting these works in just the right way to capture the feel of the culture they came from.",
    "From the point of view of someone who has previously studied inflected languages, this class jumps into learning the language pretty quickly but is quite effective--by the end of the semester, you could grab a dictionary and be able to read any Old Norse text--and the literary and cultural aspects of the texts get plenty of time as well. I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the language, the culture, the stories, or the saga genre.",
    "As Professor Frank will emphasize, this is a language class. If you want to learn how to read Old Norse in the course of a semester, it's the class for you! We also learned a fair bit about Viking life and culture, but the focus of the class is being able to translate and interpret the texts. It's not too difficult, especially if you have experience with foreign languages, and it's so. much. fun. If this class sounds fun to you, take it! You won't regret it.",
    "Lots of work. Rewarding, though. Be careful about falling behind, because it's hard to catch up. I wouldn't recommend you take it on a whim!",
    "Take this class! Especially if you took Latin in high school and miss the experience of decoding a language, definitely check it out. I came into without any linguistics experience and took it Cr\/ D which I was very happy about but think that with a little bit more hard work it would be doable for anyone. Highly recommend. Also when will you ever get the chance to learn about something like this again?",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class! It's fun and intimate, and professor Frank is really engaging. That being said, be aware that many people Credit D the class, which might not be a bad idea for you to do as well if you're worried about not getting an A. Partial credit is not really a thing on the quizzes, and they're pretty difficult.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in Scandinavian languages and traditions. You will be amazed at how much you can understand and translate by the end of the semester. You will look forward to every class."
