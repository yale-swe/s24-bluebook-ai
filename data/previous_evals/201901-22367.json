   "comments": [
    "First, a broader perspective to view regional history. Prof. Manning helped me to see the interconnectivity of the ancient world, specifically, the interconnectivity of trades, commerce, ideas, and religion in the broader Mediterranean world. Second, both textual studies and studies of material culture are conducive to understanding history. The tricky part is how to make these two ways of thinking fit together and illuminate one another. Some monographs we read for the semester demonstrate a great integration of the two. Third, the beauty of interdisciplinary studies. Prof. Manning advocates interdisciplinary approach to studies and pushes the boundaries of natural science, social science, and humanities. His scholarly works nowadays demonstrate this aspect increasingly.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction for someone totally unfamiliar with the field of ancient history (a response that will make the identity of the person answering this questionnaire quite obvious!). I suppose I would say that I am now aware of the major \"trends\" in the field--the more careful integration of archaeological evidence into histories of trade, the use of climate data, coding, popularizing histories, comparative work that moves beyond the Mediterranean--but I think that the insight I gained, more generally, into the mindset of ancient historians is far more valuable. Ancient historians are much closer to our friends the sociologists than we modern historians. The fact that they work with a fairly limited body of evidence compels them to study vast swathes of time, which in turn makes them very aware of the Braudelian structural underpinnings of history--the relation between the environment, population, state forms, and the discrete political event--that those of us who spend our time dealing with voluminous written sources are apt to overlook. These are insights that I hope to incorporate to my own work in US history, which is often quite temporally constricted. Our understanding of the past changes dramatically depending on where we set our contextual boundary markers."

   "comments": [
    "1) We can choose several pieces, or even classical essay articles in the fields and do close reading. 2) Some introduction to the discipline history can be helpful. For example, why did 19th century European scholars show such a strong politically oriented view of the Classics\/classical history\/ classical political philosophy? How did the university system and scientific advancement make a difference? How should we understand and reevaluate the phenomenon now?",
    "The greatest strength of this seminar was, quite simply, its size. Seminars of fifteen to twenty people are all about who can speak loudest and longest. Discussion is interminable and directionless because everyone wants to get their word in, everyone wants to get the professor's attention. In a seminar of five to six people, you feel like you're part of a discussion; you get to know your fellow seminar participants, and you're genuinely interested in what they have to say; you might actually even come away thinking about something in a different light. Of all the seminars that I have taken in my graduate career (at least 15 by this point), this was far and away the most fruitful and enjoyable. Would that we could change the structure of the modern university in such a way that the ratio of students to professors was always kept reasonably low. I don't see any way of doing this, apart from hiring more academics (preferable) or admitting fewer students, and I recognize that both are unreasonable, but it is so important to the activity of learning that people are able to engage with each other as real human beings. The greatest asset in a teacher's arsenal is his ability to cultivate a rapport with his students, to know them on a personal basis. There are so many obstacles to doing this in our present cultural climate, which is very fearful of anything that looks \"unprofessional.\" A smaller seminar is at least a start..."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, for people who are interested in ancient history, archaeology, economics, and politics.",
    "All historians ought to study all of human history, at least fleetingly. I would (perhaps paradoxically) recommend the course most highly to a student whose interests are farthest from the ancient world. I would also recommend it over a course on the medieval period, simply because its methods are so different from those of any other variety of history. I find that I always learn the most, and am able to come up with the most original insights in my own work, when I immerse myself in a totally different field, and then turn back to look at my own field from that alien vantage point."
