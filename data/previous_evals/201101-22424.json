    "Yes, definitely. I have recommended this class to several students who like to take painting. I always added to my recommendation the warning that they would have to work really hard for this class.",
    "Yes. This class is a full commitment but it's worth it because it teaches you so much not only in terms of your painting style but also self-discipline, time management, and how to develop an idea daily.It's very much a class where you get out what you put in.",
    "Great course, but stressful!Besides teaching you painting, this course teaches you to more effectively organize your time. The course also has little structure which forces you to teach yourself how to structure your own learning experience.",
    "Yes, if you love painting and aren't afraid of work, this class will force you to spend the time on it to get better. The studio set up is great, especially with awesome people in class with you."
