   "comments": [
    "Great course if you're into genetics and want to know where the current field is heading. I would recommend this course. No midterms or final. Very manageable course load.",
    "MBB425 is a great way to learn about new techniques in genetic analysis. Be prepared to work hard though to do well on the take home exams- it's not regurgitation of material, but rather designing your own experiments to answer scientific questions. I would definitely recommend it- I felt like I learned a ton in this class that I will actually use in my research.",
    "this is a good survey course of some of the most applicable and useful methods used in genetic labs and analyses now. the lectures all cover materials that are connected to this theme but not necessarily connected to each other-genetics is a large broad field so the lectures each address different aspect of the field and the methods used to solve problems.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It isn't too difficult, but it does require you to put in time and energy."
