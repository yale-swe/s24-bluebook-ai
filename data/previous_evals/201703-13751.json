   "comments": [
    "Pigeons and pigeonholes",
    "Learnt math and had some practice at solving mathematical problems",
    "Learned a lot of really cool and useful math tricks--not only for competition math, but general techniques. The fact that there was no coherent theme for all of the problems meant that there was a lot of liberty in picking and choosing what we were interested in, then learning a lot about it and practicing.",
    "I learned some cool math tricks that help both in the classroom and on competitive exams!",
    "I became more familiar with common types of mathematical competition problems and strategies to solve them. I also came out of MATH 199 feeling more connected to the math community at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot more about the types of questions that appear on the Putnam, and a whole bunch of different and interesting methods for solving them. The approaches were organized by field recursion, number theory, functional equations, etc.",
    "Great way to foster community in the math major! As a girl who had often felt excluded socially (and in study groups) from her peers, this class and Pat gave me a great network of people not only to study with, but also gave me the opportunity to meet older math majors and hear their advice. Pat did a fantastic job of making the environment supportive for everyone and the class itself was more of a fun time than anything else.",
    "problem solving and general Putnam knowledge, as well as creativity!",
    "As this course was advertised a way to get better at the Putnam Competition, I felt that it accomplished this goal. The course was a structured approach to studying and preparing for the exam, with Pat preparing a lot of wonderful notes for us to use to prep for the competition. Most of the skills are the usual math tricks, this course merely sharpened them and kept them relevant in my mind for the exam.",
    "Learned some tricks for the Putnam",
    "This class teaches you general approaches to solving questions asked on the Putnam exam. This year that class split into two classrooms, one for people who wanted to go through the proofs in depth, and others who didn't want as much depth. Each class often had some sort of theme, going over way to use specific strategies for different types of problems.",
    "I learned how to approach Putnam problems, which involves a lot of creativity. We also had lectures each week from either Ross or Pat, and they led them just like any other class with great organization.",
    "I learned how to solve Putnam problems; most of the instruction was about basic topics such as Pigeonhole Principle, but there was also some nontrivial topics such as f(x) = 1\/(1-x) which is more Putnam specific.",
    "Lots of cool math tricks!",
    "Problem solving, putnam prep",
    "Fun Putnam questions",
    "I received some good practice for the Putnam competition.",
    "Techniques for solving Putnam Competition problems!",
    "Extensive problem solving techniques for math competition questions.",
    "I learned how to use various mathematical techniques to solve Putnam questions and also see the approaches that one might take in arriving at these solutions.",
    "This course covered a pretty wide range of topics from a number of different fields of math, including number theory (divisibility, modular arithmetic, etc.), algebra (polynomials, fundamental theorem, sequences and series, etc.), and combinatorics (pigeonhole principle, counting, etc.).",
    "I learned how to think through problems effectively in groups.",
    "Prep for Putnam Exam",
    "Problem solving skills",
    "Honestly, I was not expecting to learn a whole lot, because I'd tried and failed learning competition stuff before. Perhaps it was the fun, accepting environment, but somehow a lot of stuff just clicked this time around, and some of it actually helped remedy some deep, hidden concepts that I had left misunderstood or ill-understood years ago, which in turn just made me feel a lot more confident as a mathematician, even if my competition performance did not skyrocket. That said, I'm pretty sure I did better on the Putnam than I would have without going through this class (well, I guess it's probably not \/too\/ hard getting above a 1)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Could possibly be improved by better catering to different skill levels of people taking the class. Other than that, it provided a good opportunity to practice solving mathematical problems in a fun and stress-free environment.",
    "I really enjoyed the space for conversation and collaboration that this class provided; however, I felt like I couldn't get enough! Perhaps the course could be scheduled for a longer period of time, and\/or have problems assigned and attempted for credit. Segregation of the rooms into strictly quieter\/louder rooms might also be helpful.",
    "The course is a lot of fun and accomplishes its goal!",
    "This class is interesting, fun, and extremely low-stress. The biggest problem with the course was the decision to split the class into two class rooms: the \"Fast-and-Loose\" room, and the \"Slow-and-Thorough\" room. This enforced a divide between more confident (but not necessarily more competent) mathematicians and less confident ones, which I believe was detrimental to all of us. My understanding was that one intention of the class was to foster community among math undergraduates, and the splitting of the class worked against that goal. It also made learning more difficult, as the professors' and TAs' time and attention was split between two groups.",
    "It was really great!! The instructors were able to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time, and it was a nice mixture of independent work and instruction. Their enthusiasm was also great. I do wish we had spent more time going over solutions, or received solutions to the last weeks problems the following week. Many questions that stumped me, I ultimately did not find out the solution for, and I think it would have been valuable to go over 2-3 questions at the start, rather than 1-2.",
    "It was a good course, I think a little more teaching of material as in the beginning would be nice, or at least an option for people, and I think a quiet room to work on the problems without chatter would be cool",
    "Some strengths include the relaxed nature of the course where everyone was welcome to join and where everyone was very excited to learn about math. At the same time the lax nature of the course lends itself to being overwhelmed by a lot of students, including those who are serious about the exam and those who are not. Another major strength I think helped with prepping for the exam was the structure of how the material was presented in that every week had a different topic\/strategy for the exam. A last weakness, because there were a lot of students and not as many faculty it was hard to get help and feedback regarding the problems we were working on.",
    "It was fun, but pretty unstructured",
    "I though this course was great overall and loved that it was so interactive. For me, I would have liked to learn a little bit more. This math was often above my head, which made it hard to just sit down and do any of the problems on my own. It would have been nice to have an option that was a little more intensive of teaching, just so I would be able to learn more about how to solve these problems on my own.",
    "A great course for building community within the math major and also doing fun problems! I have no complaints.",
    "Extremely chill class. However, many students weren't really motivated (kinda wanted to find a free .5 credit). I personally liked working on the problems, but even still didn't feel quite motivated enough to work on problems outside of class. I was always a math competition person, but there's not a lot of time outside of class, and I suppose I don't value the Putnam quite enough. Without the credit though, I probably wouldn't have gone to the sessions, embarrassingly enough. The credit really gives a slight reward to putting in the hours every week, giving me an excuse mentally for spending time on preparing for the Putnam rather than doing my other coursework.",
    "I think it was organized in a great way that allowed you to meet new people easily.",
    "strengths: no work, everything is voluntary beyond attendance, pat is a great person to talk to weakness: better organization would make the course more engaging.",
    "Fun a bit disorganized",
    "It wasn't very structured, if you aren't at the level to be making progress on Putnam questions, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "The collaborative nature of this course was excellent.",
    "The course had a great structure with time both to do questions on our own, and going over things together with the instructor.",
    "Great course to relax and work on competition math problems that would not ever be seen in classes. Very collegial environment and had high amounts of discussion.",
    "the professor could teach more instead of having us do problems by ourselves all the time",
    "It was an excellent chance to work on problems that we wouldn't normally see in classes, in a really nice, collaborative environment. Maybe another session a week would help?"

   "comments": [
    "Fun, challenging, and a very low workload. Take it.",
    "Yes! The entire premise of the class is to learn cool math and enjoy yourself while doing it. For a lot of students, there is no accessible and formalized opportunity (in college) to learn competition math; this class was a great way to provide that opportunity to people of all skill and experience levels.",
    "If you want a light course to take for credit and to learn some fun math that will help you on the Putnam and in math generally, take this course!",
    "This is a fun lowkey course. Would recommend, although 6:30pm is an inconvenient time.",
    "If you like math enough to take a math class that won't fulfill your QR requirement, take this class. There are no assignments and no tests, so the workload is literally 0. However, the problems that we looked at in class were cool and fun, and were definitely useful as prep for the Putnam Competition. Just seeing that type of problem and having a little practice solving them is helpful. Also, Pat is a really fun professor who cares a lot about the math community at Yale--this class is very social, and a great way to feel connected to the math community as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Competition math may seem like something youre good at or youre not, but it turns out there are a whole bunch of learnable, useful techniques, and practice does help. Plus, its a lot of fun, the problems are diverse and cool, and you get to know a lot of other people in the Yale math community.",
    "Very much so! I wouldve gone even if not taking it for a credit.",
    "Yes, it was fun, easy and cool",
    "If you enjoyed math competitions and want to take the Putnam seriously, definitely take this course. If you are unsure and\/or want to learn more about math competitions and general math also a very good choice.",
    "Yeah, its super low commitment, and a lot of fun. If youre interested in math, this is a great way to meet other people who are also interested in math",
    "Definitely take this class! It's a great way to meet other math students at Yale. I found the problems really interesting and it was a fun challenge to try to solve them coming to class every week. I love how this class was serious about math, but allowed us to engage with the subject in a less traditional setting.",
    "If you're a math major and interested in taking the Putnam, or even if you just want exposure to fun and interesting problems, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Excellent class for all levels of mathematical ability. There's really no challenge persay, it's really how much you want to put into the class. Grading is literally attendance and probably not even that. Just enjoy the class and learn as much as you can.",
    "Yes",
    "yes, if you enjoy solving putnam problems.",
    "yes if you are interested in math and Putnam questions",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to prepare for the Putnam competition or is simply interested in problem solving.",
    "Yes! Take it.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are already at Putnam solving level. If not, it isn't a very productive use of time, and you probably aren't going to improve very much. Wait until sophomore or junior year when you have more experience with different kinds of problems, and it'll be much more interesting then.",
    "If you have any level of interest in math and want to improve your mathematical problem-solving skills by tackling hard problems in a collaborative environment, take this course. This course is designed to be taken in preparation for the Putnam exam, as each class focuses on a different concept that commonly appears on the Putnam. However, you can still take this course if you have no interest in sitting for the exam.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "Definitely if you are willing to engage in competitive math.",
    "If you love math and likes hanging out with other math people then take this class",
    "Would recommend, Pat and the other teachers are really wonderful and helpful, and the problems we worked on are fun.",
    "Yes, take this! It's not really a large time commitment, and it's also a hub for the undergrad math community, which is just full of cool, helpful people. Also really sharpens your problem-solving skills, especially when a lot of your math classes might be a lot heavier on the understanding-theory part rather than coming up with brilliant calculations."
