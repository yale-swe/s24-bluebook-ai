   "comments": [
    "I learned many of the different definitions of leadership, types of leadership, and the frameworks with which political leadership actions can be analyzed. When writing my paper, I learned a lot about contemporary Polish and Hungarian politics as well as the prominent literature about opposition management in different types of government. Also, I learned many writing skills from Professor Skowronek's thoughtful and thorough comments, and I can confidently say that my writing is clearer more analysis-heavy because of this course. Reading other students' papers as they progressed allowed me to see how different types of arguments develop over many revisions, strengthening the way I think about constructing arguments for the future.",
    "I learned about political leadership topics while developing skills in writing, research, and argumentation. I also learned how to provide feedback on peers' writing.",
    "I learned a great deal about leadership concepts and literature. Most importantly, I learned how to write a long research paper well, and form a convincing argument that carries through 25 pages.",
    "What is political leadership? What components does it consist in and how can we apply these to practice? And: how do I write a 25 page research paper? These--and more--are the questions that Political Leadership addressed. It, furthermore, allowed its students to understand papers from the perspective of a corrector: the seminar was arranged in a workshop setting and the 10 students criticized each other productively, but intensely.",
    "I learned about the specific study of leadership, what makes a leader and why and how a leader acts, which no class before had really explored in the same depth.",
    "I learned about the field of leadership studies, which I did not have any exposure to prior to the class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Skowronek's summaries of the texts were helpful to reinforce our understanding, and he was a strong facilitator of discussion related to the week's topic and readings. The process of seeing how all our papers developed over three revisions was very helpful in strengthening our writing skills in terms of clarity and analytical strength. If Professor Skowronek could write his line notes and paper comments more legibly (or use some kind of online editing program), it would make the revision process easier.",
    "Professor Skowronek essentially lectures for the first half of class and then the second half of class is committed to workshopping writing. A weakness is that students seemed to just skim one another's papers so they could not provide very thorough feedback during this time, often commenting on a rather superficial change that could be made to the essay - which is frustrating when you put a lot of time into the paper. I think students should potentially be expected to annotate the paper, either on their computer or on a printed copy. This would allow the paper writer to also get more minute stylistic feedback. In addition, a schedule of the presentation times\/dates for each group should be posted on Canvas.",
    "The readings can be a bit dense and boring at times. Additionally, the discussions are dry. But the process of writing is well-supported.",
    "The greatest strength of Political Leadership is the class format. Not only does it cover all vital aspects of political leadership without becoming superficial. It also allows their application to real-life case studies and encourages its students to apply their critical thinking to evaluate each others efforts. Furthermore, Professor Skowronek's feedback on the papers submitted was at once honest, critical and constructive. It was a pleasure to see it spark tremendous improvements in all of the students' papers.",
    "The strength of this class is the workshop environment in which you write your final paper. You turn in a prospectus, partial draft, and full draft to the class and, with the professor, your classmates give you feedback on how to improve it. However, it can be difficult to develop a strong idea about political leadership early on and you may find yourself writing and rewriting a lot. It happened to most students in the class and I, myself, had to rewrite a lot of my full draft. I think if Professor Skowronek had more one-on-one time with students to develop a strong prospectus at the beginning of the semester, this issue can be resolved.",
    "The writing process could be less rigid and the discussions around readings could be an actual seminar rather than a small lecture.",
    "The structuring of the semester-long essay really helped me improve my thesis. Each of us presented a prospectus, a first draft, and a second draft in class. My classmates' and professor's comments revealed the weaknesses in my argument and made me come up with a stronger thesis each time. I ended up learning a lot about my essay topic and political leadership!"

   "comments": [
    "If they are comfortable with in-depth research and writing about a sometimes ambiguous field of political science, absolutely I would! The class is a great instrument for honing writing skills and sharpening analytical arguments. Also, we learn about case studies not usually part of the political science \/ american political canon (especially the book about leaders who exploited ambiguity), which was refreshing.",
    "Probably not - the final writing project is exceptionally burdensome despite its intellectual rewards. Coupled with a great deal of reading each week, I don't know if these costs outweighed the benefits of what I learned.",
    "I recommend this class to students wishing to explore the leadership literature further and learning how to write a long research paper.",
    "If you are interested in learning about political leadership as well as how to write a 25 page research paper, take this class. You will read a lot, write a lot and discuss a lot. But if you like these things, you will love Political Leadership. And of course, you will benefit tremendously from Professor Skowronek. He is not only a brilliantly eminent academic, but also a tremendously approachable teacher.",
    "Take this course if you are into political philosophy and can work diligently and independently on a massive final paper throughout the semester. If not, you may want to stay away.",
    "Not really.",
    "Absolutely! This class will make you a better writer. The material is also very interesting and discussions were engaging. There are a lot of nuances in how we define political leadership, and in the age of Trump, we may need to rethink our definition."
