   "comments": [
    "Good class. Interesting material. Critical Thinking, no final or midterms. Just problem sets.",
    "Good genetic analysis course. Some papers are super interesting, while some are hard to understand given the technical rigor.",
    "It's a solid course, take it if you're interested in genetics. It's not much work at all aside from the take-home questions, which can be written very quickly but take a long time to hash out the answers for (there was an undergrad group that met every time we had one of these; if there is when you take it, JOIN IT). However, if you're not really into genetics, this perhaps is not the class for you.",
    "MCDB425 is a highly recommended course for anyone who wishes to pursue genetics as a career or loves genetics. It is great in that it teaches very recent advents and landmark technologies in the field of genetics, so it is good for prepping a future researcher.",
    "A solid alternative to the more traditional genetics class taught by MCDB. Take the class if you want to learn how to think, not memorize specific details.",
    "Take it! Light workload, minus the time-intensive psets and long papers. A light upper level where I learned a lot on genetic technique and how to articulate it!",
    "This is a good MCDB class to take your senior year. There is not midterms or exams, only paper discussions (with a 1-page summary you have to write) and problem sets (1 or 2 questions that usually have to do with experimental techniques you learned during class or in the papers). I took this to fulfill the BS Intensive major, and it was a fun upper-level course. Honestly, if you don't care for going to lecture, you would be fine not going. I don't know how much you get out of the class doing that, but it is an option. Overall, would recommend.",
    "Lectures were not particularly interesting, nor were most of the papers assigned. Take this class only if you need an upper-level class with an extremely low workload.",
    "Good class. Fills in the little holes that have accumulated in my genetics education. Not too much work. Some lecturers better than others, but you learn something in each class.",
    "A basic biology high level elective. The class is half grad students and half undergraduates in MBB and MCDB. There's a ridiculously low amount of work. 6 psets that take about an hour or two each and discussion sections. The sections replace class and are every 2-3 weeks. You have to write a summary for the papers you read for section, but it's graded on completion. All the assignments are limited to a page each so you can't spend too much time on them. The lectures are alright depending on the lecturer (they change every couple weeks), but you don't need to go to class to do the psets. There's no final.",
    "It's good class, but very inconsistent based on the lecturer.",
    "Very interesting class, although some concepts and discussions are pointless in comparison to others. Not too much work, most professors are interesting and easy to follow. Would recommend.",
    "Good fulfillment of the upper level bio course. Only problem sets and report write ups. No finals or midterms. You can work with anyone you want on the sets. However, you don't really learn anything in it, especially since the work and the class is very laidback. Mindless, but if you want something easy take it. If you want to learn something, take another class, it's very easy to back burner this class.",
    "Good class. Pretty chill, interesting assignments.",
    "NO I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS. The psets are incredibly difficult and there is no grading transparency. We had like 6 psets total and we've only gotten back 2. I have no idea how grades work. Professors also sucked. Only 2 were good. The pizza at the end was great, but it's not worth the pain in this class. You want a class in which professors actually seem to care. You will also not learn anything because the lecture material do not connect with each other. The psets are non-googleable and the answers cannot be found in the powerpoints. Everyone is confused, and worst of all, you never have any inkling of an idea how you are doing in this course. I asked myself multiple times throughout the semester why I was taking the class. It was miserable. Save yourself the pain."
