    "Professor Graham did a great job of structuring discussions between different students and perspectives, and helping us separate the objective from the subjective.",
    "I learned how to more effectively balance biases and work with people with difference opinions.",
    "Completely new way of approaching Russian us relations",
    "I now have a strong grasp of US-Russian relations and I feel confident that I can use this knowledge to interpret the current interactions between the two countries.",
    "This class is an excellent and comprehensive overview of U.S.-Russian relations. I learned a great deal about pretty much every aspect of the U.S.-Russian relationship, and was challenged to think beyond my initial prejudices by Professor Graham, an expert on the topic and a wonderful professor."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "More interactive in-class modules or scenarios might help get students talking to one another in the class in a more positive way. At times, I felt like it was difficult for us to achieve a common language in the course.",
    "Class is great. Don't change a thing.",
    "I sometimes felt like the student presentations ended up saying what Professor Graham said in class later.",
    "The strength of this course is surely Professor Graham himself, and our in-class discussions. His expert knowledge of the topic allows him to play members of the class against one another and \"balance\" the prevailing sentiment in the room. Additionally, the course is incredibly well-organized, and the readings are always relevant and interesting. The coursework is challenging, but manageable, and broken down well in terms of when assignments are due."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Graham is an amazing instructor and mentor. If you are interested in Russia, I could not recommend taking his course or at least getting to know him through outside of it.",
    "Professor Graham's grading is a bit harder than most Yale professors, but he really strives to get you to make a strong argument. He's brilliant and is able to argue both sides of US-Russian relations in a way that is difficult to find in this day. Take this class if you have a chance.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! This class gives a really great overview of US-Russian relations. I really enjoyed the in class discussions we had because Professor Graham tries very hard to make sure there are American and Russian students in the seminar.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, even if you have experience with U.S.-Russia relations already. Professor Graham is an incredible teacher, and the class is always lively and interesting. You will be challenged, and you will come out of it with a different perspective on the U.S.-Russian relationship."
