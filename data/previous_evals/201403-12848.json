    "If you earned a 5 on your high school AP French exam, this is a great class for consideration. Many students who earn 5's jump into FREN 150, which is great if you are well-prepared and have maintained your language skills since taking the exam. If there has been any significant amount of time since studying French though, definitely consider this course. It's very challenging and you still get to read great French literature. Plus, if you're just looking to fulfill Yale's language requirement, an L4 course works just as well as an L5.",
    "This is a course in which one will acquire a stronger grammar base of the french language. One will also need to analyze texts and film in the french language and submit responses to these films. It is a challenging course but a beneficial one.",
    "If you like French, I would definitely say yes!",
    "A literature and grammar based course. If you put in the work, you can easily get the grade you want.",
    "Pretty good; Mme. Vysosias is especially great. Difficult but rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who hopes to improve their grammar and wants a highly regimented and manageable class. It has a nicely predictable consistency that might be good amidst difficult courses. However, this class is not as focused on literature and speaking fluency."
