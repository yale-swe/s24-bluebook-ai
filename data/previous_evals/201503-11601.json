    "The class has many classic readings from the 20th century, and an emulation project that is open to all possibilities",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to fellow art or computing and the arts majors. The readings are fascinating and the assignments push you in unexpected ways to concretize your own ideas. And Jonathan gives you a lot of freedom even as he guides you to follow your own path while being mindful of artists who might be helpful to look at for help.",
    "A wonderful class to strengthen your artistic practice. Really good for people serious about their art. Jonathan is a great teacher, and the theoretical readings are really interesting.",
    "It's a requirement for art majors. That said, it isn't a bad class!"
