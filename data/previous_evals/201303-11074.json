    "Though it may depend on each instructor, I found Spanish 130 to be an enjoyable class. The workload is quite manageable, vocab memorization (aside from that found in the course packet stories) is minimal, and the grammar is taught at a reasonable pace. If you can, take it with Maria Rios; she is incredible!",
    "Spanish 130 01 is a great class; very relaxed, and the work is spread out very evenly over the semester so that the final is only worth 15 percent of the grade at the end (I guess the oral exam also counts, which is worth 7 percent). Make sure to stay on top of of your work, and keep the 94 percent \/ 90 percent cutoffs in mind the entire semester. Don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it, and use the resources in the tutoring center.",
    "It's a good class if the other students in the class with you are willing to participate and have fun together by speaking bad spanish. Maria Garcia Rios is a really good professor."
