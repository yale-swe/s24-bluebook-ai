    "This course could use much, much more structure. Weekly assignments, for example, would have been very helpful to keep students shooting regularly and thinking about photography carefully. I also would have appreciated learning more skills on photoshop, and receiving written instructions\/guides to the skills we did learn, which were only gone over once and hard to remember and reconstruct on our own. High points were slideshows of \"the greats\" -- Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, etc. -- and field trips to look at collections at the YUAG."

    "Zak is new to teaching, and so while he's a wonderful person and talented photographer, the course structure for this section of Intro Digital needs some revising."
