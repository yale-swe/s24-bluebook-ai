    "You are going to love it. He knows what he's doing--it's weird because the class is simultaneously spontaneous and scripted. And he knows how to teach. How many science professors at Yale can claim that -- that they can teach!? You learn the fundamentals and physical principles in the context of (mechano)biology, and then you learn to think about how one can use theory to guide experiment. Though it is a very theoretical class, the math is reduced to 1-D and you get the bio applications. (you also get a good flavor of mechanical engineering argot but only that which is relevant.)",
    "Amazing course, definitely recommended to anyone. Most of you considering this class probably have to take it for the major, but even if you don't this is a great choice. Humphey teaches everything in a very logical, concise (but thorough) fashion, and you'll leave with a very deep understanding of the fundamentals of mechanics and the fundamentals of experiment theory. You should DEFINITELY take this class -- there isn't a whole lot of complicated math involved, not much homework, and every lecture is absolutely worth attending.",
    "BENG 353 is an excellent course, and frankly should be the first course a BME major should take. It will go through the basic physical postulates that help us to understand biomechanics, and which inevitably are valuable in drug delivery and other areas of BME.Jay Humphrey is an outstanding professor, and teaches this material very skillfully. You will cover the fundamental principles of biomechanics in one dimension, which will allow you to get a grasp on the theory without having to do very complicated mathematics. Professor Humphrey's excitement about the material is contagious, and makes each class really engaging, interactive, and fun. This was by far my favorite class in the major, and I highly recommend it to anyone (though I think it is required now).",
    "Take this class! Biomechanics did a great job at laying the foundation for a new subject and explain how and why we're doing certain calculations. Professor Humphrey was one of my favorite professors at Yale! He was very thoughtful when answering our questions and really wanted our small class to understand all of the material. In future years, the class will be mandatory, but you won't regret this change in requirements."
