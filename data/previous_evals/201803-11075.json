    "thinking about everything that goes into filmmaking",
    "I developed a much better framework for understanding film on a technical, narrative, and historical level. I came into the class a cinephile, thinking I was a film expert. I left with the realization that the world of film is so much bigger than I ever could have imagined. Film 150 made me excited to study film further.",
    "I came into this class a huge cinephile, but I had always viewed movies from a narrative standpoint. In this course, I learned how films are made and how to analyze their technical as well as narrative elements. I learned about different cinematographic techniques having to do with lighting, color, camera movement, etc. I also learned about the history of classical Hollywood, Soviet, avant-garde, and other global cinemas. I had watched many films made outside of Hollywood, so I enjoyed screening so many international films and learning about the different principles that go into the making of these works versus popular American movies.",
    "Learned how to analyze films from a technical and social perspective. Was introduced to many great works of art I otherwise would not have seen.",
    "I learned about film history, theory, and production.",
    "I learned a lot about film from a theoretical perspective. I feel like I am now able to engage with films in a different way and consider the purpose behind various aspects of the production process.",
    "A sparse film history overview of global cinema, lots of theories of film, and many more movies in my repertoire.",
    "I think this course did a great job of combining formal analysis, theory, and history in its introduction to thinking and writing about films.",
    "Basic knowledge of film history and theory. Watched some classic films and analyses of them.",
    "I had never taken a film class in my life and this class really exposed me to film from a variety of countries. I learned how to analyze film on a basic level through knowledge of terms and different terms.",
    "I learned a great deal about film history and the evolution of the medium. I learned how to think and watch films of all types with a critical lens. It changes how you watch movies, allowing you to notice small details in the framing, editing, cinematography, etc. and how they contribute to the films larger message.",
    "I learned the history of film and how different genres were created as well as film theory and how production factors into film creation, diegesis, etc.",
    "I really got a sampling of the study of the film. I learned about different genres, different philosophies, writing about film, famous films, more obscure ones, and I truly loved the screenings...",
    "I learned a basic knowledge of how to talk about and analyze film.",
    "I developed a film critic's eye when looking at movies and I can now analyze films using proper film terminology in terms of structure, content and the technicalities of film such as sound. I can also better handle dense texts about films",
    "By taking this course, I learned so much about the world of film that I had not previously known. The class gave me the technical and theoretical tools with which to evaluate films and creative work in general. I learned a lot about the history of film, while being able to use the amazing resources the film department at Yale possesses, in order to access the unique worlds in which the films we watched took place.",
    "I learned a great deal about the terminology concerning film studies, how to construct an effective film paper, and a great deal more about early film history than I knew."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "If this class posted lecture notes like every other class in the recent history of Yale it would be a thousand times better.",
    "correlate lectures more with readings (including textbook readings)",
    "Strength: MacKay is an incredibly engaging lecturer and Bradley always reaches mindblowing conclusions. The readings are also all fascinating. A ~major~ strength was my TA, Ido: he made this entire class worth it. Every presentation was incredible. Every conversation during section. Notes on my essays. Ultimately, IDO was the reason I truly loved Film 150. If you take this course, SIGN UP FOR IDO'S SECTION. Such an amazing human being and teacher. Weakness: The readings were all pretty dense and not always mentioned or explained fully. Also, there were textbook readings but they were not necessary for the essay or final, so it just made for some extra, seemingly unnecessary work.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it synthesizes the study of film technique with the study of film history really well. I enjoyed the format of watching films each week and using these works as a window into the study of a certain branch of film theory or history. I would have liked if we had studied more of the seminal works of cinemasome of the movies that we screened seemed a bit random. And while I liked the global focus to some extent, I would have liked study more English-language films, as I feel that much of a film's meaning is \"lost in translation\" when you have to watch it with subtitles. There is also a ton of writing for an introduction coursewe had three long papers and a final exam. I think that there should either be two papers and the exam or just the papers. Or maybe we could have smaller assignments each week (i.e. responses to the films)it made me a little nervous that 70% of our grade was determined in the last week of the semester (35% for the final exam and 35% for the final paper).",
    "I think that the assignments could be better delivered. We never learned how to write a film theory paper. Instead, we were simply expected to write one.",
    "I think the powerpoint could be improved to contain more information and be available on canvas after the class for students to review.",
    "I think the weekly topics the course covered were clear and appropriate. I feel like I definitely got a holistic view of film at an introductory level. The lectures were often very interesting and engaging. However, I feel like the class did get a little tedious at a certain point with the screenings and papers. The screenings often lasted over three hours, and I think they should be shortened. I also felt like the papers were unnecessarily long, and the page count should be cut down in the future.",
    "An absolutely wonderful course! The professors are great, lectures are engaging and interesting, and the material is fascinating. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "The course could have been improved by having lecture slides uploaded to the course Canvas page.",
    "My only complaint is that going to class was pretty much useless.",
    "This course is a lot of work. There are the two 50 minute lectures, a 50 minute section, and the 3 (sometimes 3 and a half) hour screening on Tuesday nights. Aside from these commitments, there are also a lot of very long readings. A weakness of the course is how deeply you have to invest in order to get what you need to get out of it. It takes up more time than you would expect. A huge strength is the class's global aspect; we watched a lot of really amazing movies, and the foreign films were the best ones. It was amazing to see things that aren't the typical Hollywood output, although there is some of that too. Though it would've been nice to see more female directors' work, there are not nearly enough options to choose from, so it makes sense that there are only two. They need to keep acknowledging this lack and not pretend as though it's a fault of the syllabus; it is a fault of the world. Professor MacKay and Professor Bradley are both great, and their combined expertise provided pretty comprehensive lectures.",
    "The syllabus is phenomenal in how it manages to cover so much ground but still feel coherent, and in how it avoids becoming a check-list for the usual suspects. The trajectory of the assignments was also organized very well. In particular, having a shot-by-shot analysis as a first assignment was useful.",
    "Lectures were a little boring. Prof. Bradley's lectures were much too fast and complicated. Prof. MacKay was very clear and friendly. Readings were good and short for the most part. However, the overall time commitment that this class requires is ridiculous: two lectures, a 3.5 hour screening, and a section. Way too much.",
    "The strengths of this course is that the professors really do care about film, and really make an effort to acknowledge the films in a myriad of contexts. A weakness is that not all the TAs are amazing, I got an amazing TA but others are simply not that lucky, and the TA can make or break the class.",
    "The lectures can be quite interesting and many of the movies chosen for screenings are great, but many films also seem like strange choices: there is definitely an unnecessary focus on Russian films. The sections could be made more useful. But overall it is a strong introductory course.",
    "It is a very big time commitment with lecture, section, and the readings",
    "I think the powerpoints that accompany the lecture should hold more information, and they should also be posted to Canvas.",
    "While my TA was more than excited to help and also extremely knowledgeable, I wish that section has been more engaging.",
    "The lectures at times could be a bit hard to follow and take notes on. But the film screenings were very enjoyable.",
    "Some strengths of the course were that the teacher was very engaging and we watched a wide range of films. However, the film texts were a bit abstract and difficult to comprehend and therefore the course could be improved if a little more time in section was devoted to highlighting the main ideas of the texts.",
    "More interaction with students in lecture",
    "The strengths of the course were the screenings and opportunities to engage with film within the course restraints as well as outside the course. One thing that might have been a weakness was the amount of work and time the class demanded as an introductory course. However, the commitments were enriching overall, and helped to cover such a large and uncentralized topic.",
    "The strengths are the readings, which I think were consistently well done, and the lecture content. The film selection at times was a distraction from what we were learning and I questioned several of the films we were subjected to for their unique value."

   "comments": [
    "yes to be able to sit and watch these films in a welcoming and learning space",
    "If you already know you love film, TAKE IT! It will enhance your appreciation and understanding of cinema. If you just want a fun film class or you're testing the waters, look elsewhere. This course digs into film theory and technique that the casual film viewer probably won't find interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who would like to develop a foundational knowledge of the history of films and how they are made. I think this is really valuable knowledge to have as an American, since films are such a huge part of our culture. I definitely would warn them against taking it if they have commitments on Tuesday nightsI ended up missing a lot of the film screenings and then having to watch the works later, which was not as valuable of an experience as seeing the films in 35mm on a large screen.",
    "For anyone who is looking to for a basic introduction level to how to look at film critically, I would suggest the course.",
    "Only if the student was very interested in film. Despite being an introductory class, I felt that it was geared toward more serious film students.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are really interested in film. That said, this is not a class where all you do is watch movies. You must be willing to be engaged with theoretical perspectives, and you will often have to watch movies that the average person might not find entertaining. So, I think if you know you are interested in film as an academic discipline, you should take this class, but this isn't for someone who only casually enjoys watching movies.",
    "Absolutely. A great class!!! 10\/10.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! The movies are fantastic. You don't need to read the textbook if you have any prior film experience, but you have to read the theories! I say this because I did not and I regret it. When you are selecting your courses, make sure that you take this into consideration.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to other students, regardless of whether they're primarily interested in film. It's a great opportunity to gain a vocabulary for seriously describing something we often think of as mere entertainment.",
    "Not really, unless you want a very basic intro to film theory\/history or want to be a film major. I wouldn't have taken it if I didn't want to do the major.",
    "Yes. If you've ever watched a movie and though \"hmm there's more to know...\". There's so much more to learn about the basic blueprint of film and if you really engage in this course you can learn a lot.",
    "Anyone looking for a foundation and intro to film analysis should take this course. It is a great starting point even if it is the only full class you take or the first of many.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I think seeing the screenings and going to the lectures is very very stimulating and new, especially for someone without a film background.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student since it enables you to look at movies differently and develop different perspectives of a movie.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you like films, and can make the weekly screenings, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Completely, especially since you get a Wr credit along the way. Professors Bradley and MacKay were wonderful people and engaging lecturers. The essays we wrote were fun compared to other classes' essay topics."
