The text-book was good in itself but not directly linked to the weekly lectures so it was hard to go over the material that was difficult to understand from the lectures because the book chapters attached to that lecture were not necessarily the same (although they were broadly related). So it would be better if there was more material or somehow a summary sheet of the concepts in more detail. For example, the powerpoint presentations were great but if one did not understand them and we wanted to look up more details on a particular slide it was very difficult to sort through the 300pg book and try to find the answer.",

They were accessible to students and were genuinely interested in our projects and questions during class. I liked that even in a large class, they made an effort to come to our lab sections to give us feedback on our course projects. Larry was so helpful in both lecture and lab.It was helpful to break down the final project into the prospectus, progress report, and roundtable discussions, so we were forced to get a jump on the project early in the semester, and also to receive feedback.",
    "the project and the field trip!",

    "I enjoyed lab section. The sections were well organized and useful.",
    "I liked that the class included students from so many departments, yet the remote sensing methodology can be applied to all these fields. The instruction was great, and the lab well set up. forcing us to do a challenging final project at the end really got us learning the software and methods better.",

   "comments": [
    "too aggressively math and phsyics oriented in the first half of the course. no reason to learn why classification and its equations work the way they do math wise.",
    "The workload is too heavy for a 3 credit course. The labs took much longer than 2 hours to complete (the calculations took ~2 hours per week, but answering the questions took several more hours every week). The current course minus the project seems like 3 credits worth of work; the project could be an additional 1 credit. Alternatively, I would opt to take the course minus the project as a 2 credit course; the project could be an optional 1 credit.",
    "While the labs + presentation + paper seemed a little heavy, the thing that needs the most improvement is expectations about the final projects. The instructors seemed to have particular applications of remote sensing that they did and did not like, with particular things that they hoped to see in the final project. I think it would have been more useful to consider novel ways of applying the technology since there are may resources for common methods like change detection or land cover evaluation.",
    "data management. The FAQ website could be better organized too. Maybe more assigned reading from the literature.",
    "It would have been helpful to have a better understanding of the grading breakdown-- how much of our final grade was from the labs, homework, exam, final project etc. We didn't get much guidance on how our 10 minute presentation was going to be evaluated, and with only 10 minutes, it was difficult to know which aspects of the project to focus on.I much preferred Profs. Smith and Lee's lectures to the guest lectures. While it was interesting to see some applications of remote sensing, the format of some of the lectures didn't seem suited to an introductory remote sensing class, rather a seminar for others in a similar field as the professors. I wish more attention had been given in these lectures to the methods the professors used and why, rather than their results.Smaller groups for the field trip may have been better.",
    "i wish the labs were more related to real projects, although I know this is logistically hard. It would have been easier for processes to really stick in my memory!",
    "N\/A",
    "Instructor expectations were VAGUE at best. Students were never familiarized with the course's evaluation practices.There is a lot of material and tools not covered in lab sections (managing clouds, heat islands, etc.). It would be excellent if what is NOT taught is made known to the student so at least we know what remote sensing tools are capable of and can apply them to our final projects.EVERY student who submits a progress report on time deserves at least a few sentences of feedback from an instructor. Otherwise, why do this?",
    "We need more support for final projects from Larry and the TAs it was pretty hectic in the lab. While we had to turn in a prospectus and progress report, we got very little feedback, and I think we needed more help in terms of direction and methods for our projects. It would be useful to have TAs (several at a time if possible) staffed in the lab for a full 2 weeks before projects are due.",
    "1. poor organization with 2 profs, 1 lab coordinator and multiple TAs - there was often a lack in accountability for lab \/ project \/ HW questions.2. one of the most difficult parts of the project was finding and obtaining the proper images. we had no experience in this because it was already provided for us in our labs. in the future, it might be helpful to do a lab of how to navigate the Glovis, etc. websites and download images.3. field trip to collect GPS points was less relevant bc we didn't have the chance to import the points into an ArcView program and match their locations with the Landsat image.",
    "The labs. I'm not sure how the format of them can be improved. The instructions were very clear, but because the steps are so rote and available, I always left lab feeling like I had just followed a protocol instead of learning a skill. In the final project, it was useful to have to use the techniques we learned in lecture and lab and that process is what made them stick.",
    "See above - start individual project earlier, with more explicit relationship with TA established (like, is it their job to help with projects, or just to show up to lab?)",
    "I think the labs should be in a form of question which the student has to work a whole week to solve.",
    "Office hours should be set weekly especially for the first half of the course. (this is when problem sets are due). It was difficult to know who to go to for questions and I had to ask the Teaching assistants for a favor to help me with problem sets. There were so many TAs for the course that nobody wanted to take the responsibility to meet with me. So it should be made clear from the professor to the Teaching Assitants when then should show up for office hours on a weekly basis so that the students can meet them.",
    "More guidance for final project and more clear communication of expectations--flexibility is appreciated but the project design was so open-ended and requirements ambiguous, which made it more difficult"

    "The labs involved a little too much button pushing and not enough conceptual problem solving, though I did leave with a beginner's capacity to navigate the ENVI software platform. I would have preferred having selected a research topic at the beginning of the term, and applying all of the labs to it along the way.",
    "In the labs, I wish there would have been more of a discussion of WHY we were using a specificmethod, and integrate some of the background material into the labs, rather than just giving us a step by step guide.While I understand that there was so much material to get through in the labs, when we started our final projects, we didn't have any practice yet in downloading our own data and learning how to get it into a useable format in ENVI. I would have liked practice in learning how to navigate Landsat, MODIS, etc. databases and how to deal with some of the problems with getting the data in a useable format (i.e. Landsat striping, missing data\/outliers, etc.)-- more realistic examples, rather than having everything perfectly set up for us.",
