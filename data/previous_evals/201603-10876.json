    "I definitely developed my knowledge of french grammar by taking this course - learning idiomatic expressions was especially useful. The vocabulary lists to supplement course readings were also quite helpful, and I think my oral proficiency improved thanks to class discussions.",
    "More about french literature and grammar",
    "Strengthened my conversational French ability in the context of academic discussions surrounding French literature and, to a degree, some philosophical questions.",
    "This course greatly improved my ability to speak and write in French. Specifically, this course made my communication more consistent. Having to write and speak on a constant basis ensured that I acquired the ability to convey, if only on a shallow level, my thoughts concerning books, movies, and other forms of media.",
    "This course helped improve my written and oral french skills."

    "Benot helped me improve my fluency and pronunciation a great deal. I enjoyed when we would have 'in class debates,' as the topics were interesting and they provided good opportunities to practice a more natural style of conversation (rather than prepared answers). To improve the course, I would suggest posting weekly assignments on ClassesV2 earlier than Sunday night. Overall though, Benot was an excellent professor and I really enjoyed his class.",
    "The classes were always engaging and the readings were for the most part quite interesting. I really enjoyed the debates and thought they were especially helpful with helping us develop our speaking ability - wish there had been more of them.",
    "The main strength of this course is its consistency. Because there is always a certain level of work demanded, I developed the ability to consistently provide an adequate thought or reflection on whatever we were discussing. The main weakness of this course comes from its greatest strength. Although the course did equip me with the ability to speak on most subjects, it didn't deepen my ability to converse. When discussing a book or a film, for example, I can say a few sentences about it, but forming complex thoughts and arguments remain are still difficult especially in conversation. I recognize that, in part, this difficulty to articulate complex thoughts is one that even native French speakers share, but I think that the course could have done a better job of improving this skill.",
    "I loved getting to talk and debate in French. I liked how our interaction with literature was not strictly textual but also interpretative. The class had major emphasis on grammar, as most language classes do. Interacting with other kids from other teachers of FREN 150, I felt that certain teachers emphasized certain things. For example, some teachers emphasized little grammar rules and their students had them down. Others emphasized literature-style criticism and speaking."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who would like to improve either their grammar or oral proficiency.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a solid foundation in French upon which they can then deepen and perfect their speaking, writing, and reading abilities.",
    "If you want to talk and improve your french, take it. It is a tremendous way to work on your language skills. Realize though that the workload is fluctuates and can be fairly high. For example, you might have a set of grammar rules and exercises, a reading assignment, and a piece of writing. Another day you might have to watch a movie, do grammar exercises, and then a writing response. It is not a blow off class, but is worth it."
