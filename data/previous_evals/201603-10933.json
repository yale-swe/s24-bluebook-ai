    "The course helped me improve my German skills. I feel more fluent than I was at the beginning of it.",
    "I developed my German vocabulary and grammar, improved my proficiency in speaking and writing, and learned about a number of German cities. I'd say that the instruction re: the language itself was good, though I'm not sure why we needed to spend so much time learning about German cities.",
    "Speaking skills Listening skills Comprehension skills",
    "Intermediate knowledge of German language.",
    "Stronger grip on German grammar, greater familiarity with sentence order, useful vocabulary in talking about daily life, increased knowledge about German culture and what it is like to live in Germany",
    "An understanding of German culture and language. Writing and grammar skills more than speaking, however.",
    "L3 German was most helpful for improving the fluidity of my conversation and the size of my vocabulary. We didn't have as much grammar to learn as last year, so we got to focus on the communication aspects of the language.",
    "General improvement in grammar, vocabulary, and fluency in the german language.",
    "Better understanding of German vocabulary and grammar. There was a greater emphasis on speaking the language, so oral and listening comprehension skills were improved.",
    "Speaking, writing, reading German, sort of."

   "comments": [
    "I believe that the course should focus more on vocab and grammar revision, as opposed to mostly polishing our speaking skills. Oral presentations are fun, but the amount of them in this course seemed absolutely unnecessary and prevented us from spending more time on actual learning of the language sometimes we did not even get to all of the vocab of the unit until the last class before tests. The tests were at times also extremely difficult, especially the reading sections. Some of the texts that were given to us had A LOT of vocab we have never learned, and it was distracting and took too much time.",
    "I do wish that the class were perhaps a bit more grammar-focused, and that we spent more time on traditional exercises (writing, rote memorization, etc.). I think that the grammar-light, immersive strategy of the L15 German program works in some cases, but I also think that my German vocabulary and grammar are a lot more fallible because of the amount of time we spend on projects that dont necessarily reinforce this more traditional type of learning. I do enjoy our group projects, which are often cultural in nature and culminate in a presentation, but I think that these are done too frequently once a month would be more appropriate than once a week. Having to spend time on googling beer in Munich or art in Berlin feels like a distraction from learning the spoken and written German language, which is what were here to do. I also feel like there are simply too many short assignments per week in the course. Its hard to keep track of having to write 2 emails, doing a number of short blocks of Quia exercises, working on a group presentation, researching a famous German person, and often working on our final video project over the course of a week. Id prefer to simply have 34 worksheets due a week, in addition to final project work (and maybe the occasional group presentation). Id also be remiss if I didnt point out that I dont think the email exchange works particularly well since L1, Ive fairly consistently felt that these partners arent reading our emails, and that when they are theyre failing to actually respond to what were saying. It feels more like a bi-weekly short-answer response to our instructor than an actual chain of communication. As a Jewish student, it frankly feels a little weird to me that we have not once discussed World War II or the Holocaust in this class or in any German class that Ive taken at Yale. (Especially given that the Holocaust is generally a well-discussed topic at this university.) Im not blaming this lack of mention on my instructor, the program coordinator, or even on the German Department in general. I completely understand why it might be hard to broach such a difficult topic in a L3 class. I dont even think I have a solution to this problem right now it just feels like such an elephant in the room, and I dont think it needs to be that way. Finally, I really question the use of the final video project. Doing these twice annually in the L15 sequence is a huge time suck, given the amount of time that goes into filming and video-editing. These skills have nothing at all do with German. It's ridiculous for students to spend, say, 4 hours total working on their scripts and oral German abilities, but then to spend 6 hours literally just fiddling around with iMovie.",
    "Too many in-class presentations with groups which took too long. Sometimes the tests were too difficult and beyond the scope of the class - especially the listening and comprehension. In class it was enjoyable and interactive.",
    "Extremely difficult with regular testing. The tests were way too hard.",
    "Strengths: speaking every day in class and having frequent writing assignments helped to increase my fluency in German, using a textbook that grouped material by German city was especially interesting, email exchange with German students was very engaging and allowed a glimpse into the daily life of a German student Weaknesses: many prepared oral presentations that took away from time clarifying grammatical points, not much listening practice (listening to people other than the instructor) which made the listening portion of tests very difficult",
    "Too much focus on language mechanics and now enough on use. Very hard to translate raw grammar into usable language.",
    "On a few occasions, we had to do group projects involving creating a presentation overnight, finding out about them one day and having to present them the next. This is extremely difficult, as I (and most Yalies) have many commitments, and it is hard to collate three or four people's schedules on such short notice. Other than that, as annoying as the online workbook is, it was very good practice, and I feel that the assignments were generally very helpful for learning.",
    "Look its a tough language ok."

    "This course should really be worth 2 credits...or more. The amount of work that is due every day is enormous. Not to mention the biweekly emails sent in alternating German and English, along with the online homework every week. Grading was very subjective in many cases and incredibly frustrating. About a fourth of each test was a listening activity and reading activity that you could not really prepare for and was the bane of each student taking exams. The material was unrelated and the complexity of the reading passage was ridiculous for the level we are at, not to mention the time we had to take the exam. Thank goodness we only need to take L3 because the setup of this course and the subjectivity in grading dissuaded me from taking another year out of personal interest. Strongly consider if you want to have to put up with this time-draining class that is full of frustration in the hopes of bettering your german. You might as well buy the textbook, teach yourself in the summer, and save yourself a clinically-significant amount of stress.",
    "If you're really dedicated to becoming fluent in German, I'd recommend taking L3 (and I guess beyond). I found the structure and organization of the class tremendously frustrating at times, but speaking the language frequently is helpful in developing proficiency.",
    "Yes I would - was a lot of work load (but little, often) but it was worth it.",
    "Not unless you want to get completely ruined.",
    "Although the class does meet every day and requires almost constant work, it is very rewarding to see one's German slowly improve over the semester. In contrast to L1 and L2, this course focused more on increasing knowledge of German culture and of the issues relevant in Germany.",
    "German is a beautiful and useful language, and I would highly recommend taking it. I've gotten a lot of pleasure out of doing so.",
    "It should be self-evident as to whether or not this course is for you; if you wish to improve your knowledge of the German language than go for it. Otherwise, it's not particularly extraordinary among the courses at Yale.",
    "Yes, this class is great for all students interested in learning the German language.",
    "If ya gotta take it, take it."
