    "This course is a fast paced examination of statistical mechanics and electromagnetism. Again, this is a very fast paced course. You cover a lot of material so when it comes time to study for the final I recommend starting a few weeks in advance.",
    "Lots of material to cover (Stat mech, E&M, Waves etc.) but not as in depth as 420\/430. Good to balance the amount of topics this way. Definitely learn a lot.",
    "Learned a more in depth E & M and Stat mech",

    "Physics 402 was a great course. It is very challenging and fast paced, but I loved it. Shankar is a phenomenal professor and Alexey was an amazing TA. This class was very intellectually stimulating and I enjoyed every second of it.",
    "The course is fair as it is. No real changes needed to the format from my perspective.",
    "The material could be more organized",
    "Weaknesses: The last problem set was posted late and due during reading period, even though we had a week without a problem set during the semester. Prof. Shankar also did not stay around after class all the time for questions. Strengths: Prof. Shankar is an incredible professor who always took the time to answer questions during class (he encouraged questions during class, even if he was not always around after to answer more). The subject was fascinating, the homework was challenging but not painful, and Alexey was one of my best TA's at Yale."

    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in studying physics. The physics 401 and 402 sequence is supposed to take classical mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and electromagnetism and crunch it all into 2 semesters. Professor Shankar did a phenomenal job of teaching the course material, and I really enjoyed this course. However, this is supposed to be Shankar's last year teaching it, and I am not sure how well this class would go with another professor who isn't used to a really fast paced course like 401 and 402.",
    "Definitely a course to take with Shankar. Not sure who the instructor will be next year (something to check up on).",
    "This is basically a continuation of 402. It covers Stat Mech and E & M. The midterm and final were not terrible. Diff eq helps but is not necessary.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The material is incredible, and you learn the statistical mechanics and electromagnetism in enough depth that you feel competent in advanced topics in classical physics. There were many times during the semester where I needed to take a step back and marvel at how cool the physics I learned was, particularly when we united electromagnetism and special relativity in the last week. The homework was challenging but not painful, and Alexey was an incredible TA who made the material approachable and not scary. I could not have done this course without him. Prof. Shankar was one of my favorite professors at Yale, since he was always funny, helpful with answering questions, and gave us deep insights into how to think like a physicist first solving the problems posed. Definitely take this class! It was one of my favorites at Yale!"
