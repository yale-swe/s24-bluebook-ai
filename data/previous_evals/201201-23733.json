   "comments": [
    "Hard but valuable class to take. Great for anyone majoring in EP&E, Econ, Poli Sc and Global Affairs. Very important and practical topics being discussed and I definitely feel a lot smarter than when I started the class. Too many readings but pay more attention to Oatley and some of the online readings that your TA recommends.",
    "I would recommend this Class to anyone interested in better understanding Political Economy, and how politics, economics, and government all interrelate.",
    "Great learning experience, lots of material that is relevant to the world. I liked that it wasn't too econ\/math based and we didn't have to get into the details of the economic models but just understand the gist of it. Could have been better explained though",
    "Yes! The material is interesting and the class isn't particularly hard. Assignments get kind of long, but their are generously graded.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to a student. Last year they were still adapting it to an undergraduate class but now it has been figured out. Probably my favorite course taken thus far at Yale. Encompassed so parts of the world economy, from multilateral agreements on the environment, to national security, and democratic politics. This course solidified my choice in my major.",
    "I highly recommend IPE not just for Global Affairs majors, but for all majors; you really learn a lot of relevant material during the course and it helps you understand how economics and politics really work.",
    "I would recommend IPE for any student interested in the intersection between political science and economics. It is, for all intents and purposes, an introductory course, yet it covers some interesting concepts with compelling implications.",
    "I encourage you to take this class regardless of your background. It is one of the best courses in econ\/political science that yale has to offer that does not require a lot of previous knowledge.",
    "Recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in foreign exchange, trade and how that affects the economy, this course will give you a great overview of the topics.",
    "It's a pretty good course if you're interested in the topic. There are probably better courses out there, but this one isn't too much work. The psets take a bit of time, but there's only four of them (and they actually cancelled the fourth one when I took the class).",
    "It's not that hard of a class, with very few psets. Most of the work would be the readings. It's very interesting, we learn a lot of cool and useful stuff.",
    "Yes. Great way to relate theory to current events that matter.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you want to be able to understand how the world economy works, this is a necessary follow-up to micro and macro. Although we discuss economic concepts, the real focus was on political aspects of economic policy, which was an interesting dimension not taught in straight up macro. The lectures on financial crises were extremely topical as well. If you want to truly understand Krugman or articles in the Economist, take this course.",
    "If you like intersection between politics and economics, this is the class for you. It doesn't get too much into the economics of policies. Rather, the class works off of basic economic principles and then goes into the political implications, both domestically and internationally. A great class!",
    "Absolutely, for anyone interested in the topic. There are similar classes at Yale, but this one will interest those more interested in the political side of the equation.",
    "If you have no backup in econ, do the readings",
    "I went into this course with no political science background whatsoever. I felt like there were a lot of political science majors who had a lot of prior knowledge, but just as long as you're interested in the material and you go to lecture and section, you won't have any problem keeping up with the course. I highly recommend this class - it made meunderstand and appreciate the world a lot more. It'll make you a smarter person.",
    "Every Yale student should take this class. Honestly, its important for everyone to understand the state of the global economy, and it important that every Yale student be able to contribute to discussions on the same. You learn about the basics of international macroeconomics, which is really important and will be really important in years to come.",
    "the lectures were engaging since the professor would ask the students to participate.. the videos we watched in class were also a lot of fun! the charts on the board were also very helpful, although sometimes they were difficult to read.. overall, great general overview of the topic",
    "As much as I was worried about the econ component, most of the principles we discuss are fairly simple and intuitive. The topics combined provide a pretty comprehensive view of the modern international economic system (with a solid discussion of current events thrown in to keep things fresh). Just be ready to over-answer all the vague p-set questions in order to get all your points. Overall, a great class for anyone looking to go into business or politics, domestic or international."
