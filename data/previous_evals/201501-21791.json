   "comments": [
    "Yes. Of all the DS classes on either semester, I think the material in second semester philosophy was the best. And Professor Watson is great.",
    "This was a valuable course in conjunction with the rest of the DS curriculum. There are likely better philosophy courses out there and others that spend more (and much-needed!) time on difficult works. This was certainly not an inspirational course, but I am now familiar with many key philosophers and their works.",
    "If you're looking for a dizzying overview of prominent names and ideas that reappear in the Western canon, this class will do the trick. You will leave being able to associate authors and their main ideas and trace certain genealogies of thought across the syllabus. However, this is not a class that gives you full ownership of these philosophies. I was disappointed that I left without feeling like I understood why some philosophers devoted their lives to certain questions I wish that the class had imparted more desperation and urgency so that I would feel inspired to grapple personally with the problems that these philosophers deem the most important of them all.",
    "This is a broad overview of modern western Philosophy. I would recommend this class to a student interested in philosophy that does not necessarily want to study it. I think it was a great way to get an overview of a lot of different ideas. However, do not expect to go too in depth. Despite this, I would highly recommend it to most students."
