    "Understanding of the basics of information theory, along with a lot of general mathematical experience that I would not have gained from a more elementary course in information theory.",
    "This course seemed to cover a huge amount of ground in information theory, a subject I was not familiar with before. It helped sharpen my quantitative skills and especially knowledge of probability. Unfortunately, extenuating circumstances kept me from engaging in the class as deeply as I would have liked, which limited what I could take away from it.",
    "Probability theory, coding, data compression",
    "A theoretical understanding of entropy, divergence, mutual information, and their relevance to the fundamental limits of applications like data compression, hypothesis testing and channel coding."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The pace of the course was very fast, and we were able to get through a lot of material. In my opinion, the main weakness of the course was the reliance on the lecture notes which I had a lot of trouble studying from. They were too formal and were often difficult for me to parse. I also thought that the problem sets, while interesting and difficult, did not allow me enough exposure to easier, basic problems that would facilitate understanding of the basic concepts",
    "This course covered interesting material, and Prof Wu is a solid lecturer. I appreciated the structure of the course, with challenging homework assignments but more laid-back exams. However, the level of the difficulty of the course was higher than I realized, and perhaps higher than suggested by the prequisites. I definitely felt out of my depth at times, and did not learn as much as I could have with a stronger background. A clearer guide to supplementary readings would also be nice. The course notes are thorough, but written at a very high level. Often I found them nearly impossible to follow, or they required extensive background reading and careful parsing. Reading the joy and Thomas textbook helped me a lot, but if I had not bought this book, I really would have struggled in the class.",
    "Lectures were awesome, but the material was a bit dry.",
    "The breadth of the course was quite large, and the pace very fast which made it really interesting, but also hard to catch up and fully understand at times. Most of the topics covered were interesting and relevant, though sometimes the way they were covered in class was quite different from how they were presented in the notes, making it harder to follow along. It would be good to point out at the start of each class which sections of the PDF notes each lecture is drawn from. Both the notes and the textbook were very comprehensive, which helped!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "It is very theoretical and proof based, so a solid math and probability background is recommended. If you are looking for a more applied engineering course, this may not be for you.",
    "I would not recommend the course to anyone who didn't have enough mathematical experience. The only prerequisite for the course was probability theory, but I often had to do a lot of extra work to try to understand certain concepts that other students had already learned in other courses. But in general I think I gained a lot from it and would recommend it to anyone who had the necessary experience.",
    "A decent course, and the only way to learn about a very cool subject. So take it if you are interested in information theory. But be sure you are really interested, and well prepared. The course is harder than it seems at first, and it's easy to get lost along the way. If you lose interest, especially, it can be very difficult to follow lectures and get anything out of them. Professor Wu is an ok lecturer, but he moves very fast. Also the course notes are not much help; be sure to buy the recommended textbook. In terms of work, the homeworks can be very hard, but grading is generous and the exams are very reasonable. You should have no problem if you put in the time and effort, but be wary of falling behind.",
    "Yes, take this course iff the material sounds interesting to you. Don't worry about getting a bad grade because of how complicated it is. Yihong is very lenient and wants to help you learn",
    "Learnt a lot taking this class under Prof. Wu, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a solid mathematical understanding of the limits and capabilities of applications like data compression, hypothesis testing, and channel coding. Perfect if you're the kind of EE \/ EECS major who likes having mathematical and theoretical understanding. Psets can be hard, so find a group of friends to do them with (in our year, pretty much all the undergrads worked together). The midterm and the final are relatively simple in comparison, so your grades won't be jeopardized as long as you put in the work to this tough but fulfilling class.",
    "Info theory with Prof. Wu is cool but very challenging. Information theory itself has a wide range of interesting and often surprising applications, and if you like probability theory you'll probably enjoy this material as well. Yihong is a good lecturer, but because he covers so much material it's occasionally hard to keep up (you're probably better off just following along in the extensive lecture notes on the website). Grading was fairly lenient, which was good because the material and psets felt like they were aimed primarily at the graduate level. We (the ~5 undergrads) would all get together to figure out psets, and while we usually could figure out most of the questions together, I know I would not have been able to do so on my own. Overall, info theory was difficult bit pretty interesting, and I'd definitely consider taking it if you're interested in the material and have a friend or two to work on psets with."
