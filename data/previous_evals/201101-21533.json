    "Calc BC with more series work- manageable if you try. You will learn fairly interesting stuff for low level math, although the series stuff gets tedious.",

    "Boring, bad class. Did all the learning on my own. Struggled to stay awake in class. The tests and problem sets were ok though, I like working on my own and solving math problems. Don't take it with Coifman, take it with one of the TAs.",
    "Math 115 is basically AP Calc BC at a fast pace. Nothing too special. Just weekly problem sets, 2 mid-terms, and a final. Do all your work and you'll be fine."
