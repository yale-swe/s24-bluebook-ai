   "comments": [
    "SPAN 266 is a great experience because it is simply a class on Latin American Literature that just so happens to be in Spanish. The literature is engaging because we get to read original documents from the time of Spanish colonization without needing translations. The reading load is extremely manageable as are the two exams during the semester. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an L5 Spanish class.",
    "An amazing course taught by a phenomenal professor. If you are interested in the Colonial Latin America, then you should def. take this course. The texts are very interesting and excellent. Prof. Adorno is a very caring professor. I am already feeling nostalgic about the class.",
    "Great Teacher, interesting subject matter, not an overwhelming work load.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to practice their Spanish, learn about Latin American literature, improve close reading skills, and learn about something new and different.",
    "Span 266 is a great L5. It is intensive, but it won't kill you. Professor Adorno is quite charming, and the class is very interesting.",
    "Absolutely. The exams and course load were both very reasonable, but the biggest reason to take this class over any of the L5 alternatives is not the class itself, but Profesora Adorno. She was so knowledgeable and caring that even though I was not the best at speaking Spanish, I still felt very comfortable speaking in class. If you want an L5 class that you will undoubtedly enjoy, this one is for you.",
    "This is a fairly easy class from which you will learn alot. I would recommend taking this if you want to learn a little more about the history of the conquista, but it will at times get boring.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. If they have taken some time off of Spanish, it is a great way to reintroduce the language gently. It also taught me a lot about Latin America, and I would recommend it to someone eager to understand Native American history in South America.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Profesora Adorno is absolutely adorable, and her passion for the material will make you love it too, even if the content may sound a bit dry at first. The workload is also very reasonable. The class isn't super tough, but I was totally fine with that.",
    "SPAN 266 is an introduction into Latin American literature, with the colonization of the Americas. The material is challenging because of the language that was used in the 15th century, but the professor makes it accessible when she teaches it. If you work hard in this class you will enjoy it and do well!",
    "Gutty Spanish class. Excellent option for those who can get an easy language credit (if you were placed in L5). The two \"midterms\" were just straight term memorization and text analysis, so just read and you'll be fine. The two essays, one four pager and one eight pager, were slightly annoying but she grades easily. And best of all, no final!",
    "I went into this class just to fulfill a literature requirement for the Latin American Studies major and left inspired. The texts are eye-opening and bring a solid foundational understanding of the beginnings of the European development of Latin America. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is even slightly interested in Latin America and its history. The one downside was that we read nothing about the colonization of Brazil, which makes sense because this is a Spanish class, but I don't think that there is a Portuguese or Literature equivalent. Also, Prof. Adorno is wonderful. A bit nutty at times, but it makes the material more interesting than it already is.",
    "A really good class. While I still spent a good deal of time on the work for this class, I felt like it was easy and rewarding to do. It was interesting learning about all the history and culture of this time period, and I was really glad I took it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in colonial Spanish literature or just Spanish in general. It is challenging without being overwhelming, and I think that is a great way to get introduced to this type of literature.",
    "If a student is very interested in Spanish literature and is confident in their Spanish speaking skills, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Recommend! The readings might seem a bit dry initially but they get better once you learn about the history behind them.",
    "As an American student who does not speak Spanish as a first language, the way I have described this course to friends is \"an English class in Spanish.\" If you enjoy Spanish and analyzing books and authors this is the perfect class for you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I came in with lots of preparation in Spanish (but am not a native speaker), and though this is an L5 course, there were students who clearly were not entirely comfortable with the language. This is expected, and what really matters is that you work to understand the texts. I think as long as you have placed into L5 and are willing to do the reading (which again is engaging and very manageable), this class is definitely worth taking.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. It is incredibly interesting and a unique experience because you work with the original texts written by well-known conquistadors. Adorno is fantastic and will make this class the highlight of your schedule. She is very likable and helps with understanding the setting and context of the text.",
    "Great survey course in early Latin American literature. Some of the readings can be somewhat esoteric, seeing as some are even translation from ancient Nahuatl. That said, the readings were fascinating. The class gives a rare glimpse into a unique time period in Latin American history. The workload is very manageable, especially if you're a native speaker (in which case the pace of the class can be frustratingly slow). Professora Adorno is very sweet and genuinely interested in her students. Overall, great fifth class.",
    "Take this class, especially if you need a Spanish or language credit. Grading is fair and the material is interesting. Also, Prof Adorno is one of the nicest professors you will ever have. She really cares about her students and is a very understanding person.",
    "An accessible class for students of all academic backgrounds, this course consists of a close reading of major, representative works in early (Nezahualcoyotl through Sor Juana) Latin American literature. The class has a lot to offer even to those who have had previous exposure to the topic (e.g., AP Spanish Lit students); the selections are varied and carefully picked, and Prof. Adorno's masterful insights alone are worth your time."
