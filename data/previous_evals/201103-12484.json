    "Avoid it if you can. If you can't, switch into whoever's class everyone is taking and be prepared to do lots of work outside of class.",
    "Fast-paced, challenging, rewarding. Take it if you think you can and you're willing to put time into it.",
    "It's second semester single variable. If you're coming straight from highschool, at the beginning, you cover some AB stuff in greater depth and then go into newer subjects in the second half of the class. Keep in mind that you don't use calculators, which makes it seem like more of a real math class if you're not used to that. Would I want to take it again? Probably not. But as the class went on you get a better appreciation of it. Take it if you must.",
    "I would not recommend it unless it is a requirement or the person likes math.",
    "Math 115 is a math class. It isn't anything special and if you're looking to be completely engaged in the material, I wouldn't recommend it. However, you will learn Calculus concepts, which (in theory) are important to know.",
    "Only if they have taken Calc BC before. (See answer 1)",
    "I would recommend taking MATH 115 Credit\/D\/Fail. The concepts are important to know and understand, especially for subjects like Econ. However, you do not want to have to worry about your performance on problem sets and exams, as they are pretty tough.",
    "It is not a very good class to take unless you must take it. There needs to be better faculty and more fair grading.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course because it is extremely complicated, so it's a bit over the top if you're just looking for a comprehensive understanding of calculus."
