    "I would recommend the class to people interested in studying environmental issues because it is a good introduction to an often ignored, but crucial part of our existence.",
    "This is a great class if you want to learn a lot of new material but not feel super stressed out. Be prepared to spend a good amount of time on the research paper and studying for finals, and reading the articles for each class (there's usually a short quiz), but class won't be stressful. The lectures are easy to follow and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to people interested in the material. The course load isn't difficult and it's easy to retain a lot of the information.",
    "good class especially if you are interested in water issues",
    "Yes if you do not have a huge background in water\/sustainability. The class is very doable for anyone\/",
    "the class would be good for anyone to take because the science was not so complex that it would be impossible to take without chemistry or hydrology as a background. useful information that is very applicable to daily life and current world issues."
