    "Yes...although Prof. Seilacher (I think) is leaving at the end of the semester.Even without him, is a critical course for anyone involved in paleontology or evolutionary biology, in it's capacity for helping students develop the skills necessary for designing and undertaking research projects.",
    "You should have prior knowledge of invertebrate zoology and the concept of constructional morphology.",
    "This class was a tour of the weird and unique morphologies of invertebrate organisms and the hypotheses presented by Dolf Seilacher to explain these curiosities. I would only recommend this class to a student who had already had an invertebrate paleontology course and who was interested in the unique view of Dolf Seilacher on exceptions to normal invertebrate fossil organisms."

   "comments": [
    "Provided interesting directions in which to develop a minor discourse - great for developing new areas of interest and broadening horizons. Would not recommend to any student not comfortable with independent research.",
    "I had no clue about taphonomy before taking this course, and I am a little wiser now. I think that 'Dolf's ability to think creatively about organisms and problems describing them is something to strive toward. I hope to incorporate some of his thinking into my own dissertation work.",
    "This course introduced me to some of the weirder examples of different invertebrate fossil groups, broadening, but not really deepening my understanding of the topic. The information was presented in a manner biased towards the opinions of the professor which often was contradictory to the majority of published findings (which were not discussed or even addressed by the professor). The final project did allow me to explore a tangent of my research interests that I would not have otherwise have explored."
