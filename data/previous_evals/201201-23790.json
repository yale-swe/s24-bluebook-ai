    "The first part of the semester the homework assignments took 6 to 8 hours to complete. Over time, it became easier to complete the assignments once the expectations were clearer and the instructor decreased the size a bit. By the end of the semester, I spend about 4 to 6 hours on the assignments, which was management. However, during particularly busy weeks, I was not always able to read the additional lecture readings because I spent so much time on the homework reading and assignment. One additional concern is that it was almost impossible to receive a high grade on the homework without consulting with the TAs at office hours. Though the TAs were very helpful, I tend to think that a student who completed the coursework and paid attention in class should be able to complete the homework assignment with a relatively high grade without spending an hour or more with a TA.",

   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Exam more challenging than homeworks-homeworks excessive in length. The professor is fabulous.",
    "One of the most useful classes I have taken so far, all departments should have to take this course.",
    "This is a very in-depth course. I feel the expectations are set really high, which is not a bad thing. If I had to do it over, I probably would not have taken the class, because I doubt I will need this level of understanding of epidemiology in my career, but who knows.",
    "Very thorough intro to epi. It would be great if there were an introductory epi course offered at the PhD level. This was a very basic course assuming no science or statistics background.",
    "I think the course was overall very good. The instructor tried very hard to make it interesting and succeeded in teaching concepts entirely different, but reinforcing, of those in epi I. The course definitely improved as the semester went on because the instructor asked for feedback and listened to student feedback. I thinkthe course was maybe one level higher than it should have been. It was almost too different from epi I at times. It was certainly manageable, but I would have enjoyed it more if it was on pace with epi I. It would have been helpful if there was accessible readings that followed the lecture closely. Some of the readings at the beginning of the semester only confused me further about concepts that I could have used more reinforcement of. Additionally, I found that at many times the actual point of homework and exam questions was unclear; I answered many questions over the semester incorrectly because I didn't understand what they were asking, rather than that I couldn't answer them once the TA or professor explained in plainer terms what the question was actually getting at.Additionally, keeping the discussion section format of epi I would be beneficial to the class in my opinion. Our epi I sections were very informal and comfortable, making them an easier environment to learn and ask questions in. I didn't think the discussion section format of this class worked very well; although, I did learn from them.",
    "This class was frustrating in the beginning of the semester, but after the midterm evaluation conducted by the professor, I think that important improvements were made. Prof Dubrow did a better job of putting the material we were covering in context. He also made better use of the discussion section time, by making people feel more comfortable asking questions and by going through practice questions to review what was discussed in lecture.I found myself going to office hours almost every week though because I wasn't able to completely understand the information in lecture. Having graded homework put pressure on students. I was often able to get my questions answered in discussion, but the homework was due before that time.** With all new classes I think it's really important that the professors do a midterm evaluation. It really helped in this case.",
    "Though this is not Dr. Dubrow's specialty, a greater focus on infectious disease would have been welcome. For example, just one of ten homeworks focused on an infectious disease.",
    "Strengths: well defined lecture topic, in-depth knowledge covered for each topic.",
    "This course is a great extension of Epi I. It takes the concepts from Epi I and goes into greater detail on them. Additionally, this course introduces many new concepts that were not part of Epi I. This course is great in that we have weekly discussion sections in which we go over homework assignments relevant to that week's topic in lecture. The discussion and lectures are very cohesive.",
    "This course deepened my understanding of epidemiology immensely. The lectures, homeworks, group discussions, and TA office hours were all very helpful in learning and practicing the material. I especially gained from the group discussions after the mid-term that involved a review of both the homework and recent course material.",
    "The first part of epidemiology was a better course then the second part.Strength: lecture material was reinforced in journal articles assigned for homeworkweakness: initial homework assignments were too labor intensive and did not reflect the material that was tested on the midterm. The lecture material was not presented in an organized and clear manner.",
    "rich in contents",
    "It is a great course. I feel it is actually one of those courses which will distinguish you from your peers.",
    "The course didn't seem terribly organized. I know it is probably hard to build upon the first semester, but maybe instead of trying to go into further depth on some of the topics perhaps the division of labor between the two semesters should be split in a different way. Maybe do less topics first semester but more in depth and then carry over the topics that we didn't cover first semester in the second semester.",
    "The course is a great extension of Principles of Epidemiology I. The homework assignments, which emphasize in-depth reading of research articles, really helped refine our paper-reading abilities, which is an essential skill.",
    "This was an excellent course. While the workload was heavy, it was worth it. I learned a great deal not only about epidemiology, but also about statistical methods and analysis. The weekly homeworks were time consuming, but served as a great reinforcement for the week's lecture material. The discussion sections (especailly when the mini review\/multiple choice questions were added as the end of the sections) were very helpful in clairfying the material.",
    "This course covered a tremendous amount of information in one semester in a clear and logical manner.",
    "Strengths: Learn a lot about dpi.Weakness: too much to learn, homework's tools took up a lot of your time.",
    "Dr. Dubrow is awesome. He is receptive of students comments and critiques and adjusted the class ro fit the studnet's needs better",
    "strengths: very thorough course, took some warming up to (very different from how the course was taught in the fall)instructor was receptive to midterm evaluation-- no improvement necessary now.",
    "Hard class, but extremely informative. Felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Very impressive. A great add-on to Epi I.",
    "Homework shouldn't be graded so precisely. Errors and confusing should be permitted when you first do the homework.",
    "Good review of first semester epi. This class covers some special topics (RCT, screening, meta-analysis, disease outbreak) which I found very interesting and could be potentially helpful. Students are encouraged to think critically about various epi studies.",
    "CDE 516b ended up being an outstanding course. I really enjoyed the material, especially during the second half of the semester and felt it was very applicable to future courses in epidemiology as well as real world issues. The biggest improvements that could be made would be making the homework a little shorter (even after the homework was shortened for the 2nd half, it was still rather long), and providing more substantial material for the first half of the course.",
    "The course was great! Really learned alot!",
    "This was a great course. Even though the work load was greater than I had expected and the exams more difficult than in other classes because of the overwhelming amount of material, I learned a lot of very useful concepts that I am sure will one day benefit me.",
    "The class was appropriately challenging, and students generally agreed that we were learning a lot. All of the homeworks and discussions required us to become actively engaged in the material and helped us to develop the ways in which we thought about the material.",
    "The lectures were fairly comprehensive and the material offered an in-depth look at epidemological concepts and methods. This course was certainly not a repeat of CDE 508a material.The homework was very relevant, with well-chosen articles to match lecture material. Prior to the midterm, the homework assignments were long and involved, but after the mid-term the homework assignments became shorter and less time-consuming. The final exam was very fair and appropriate.The course was perhaps a bit too advanced for some students. In addition, the homework questions were sometimes vague, and TA office hours were needed to correctly interpret the questions. However, this demand for student involvement likely enhanced the learning experience.",
    "This course really made me work to understand epidemiology. It was very rigorous and there was a lot of work, but it was worth it. It made us learn how to analyze journals and understand the concepts learned in epi 1 in depth.",
    "The course is very much needed for all EPI graduates",
    "Building on key concepts from Epi I without simply repeating the material.",
    "The material was appropriate for an Epi II class. However, having taken Epi I with the same professor, some of the material was review. For the most part, the material was new or more in depth than Epi I material.The lecture notes were great. However, the relevant reading materials were selected from different books\/articles and did not completely coincide with the lecture material.",
    "I was frustrated with the course in the beginning, but Professor Dubrow really listened to student evaluations and made the course tailored towards what the students wanted. He did a great job!",
    "Overall, the course provided an in-depth view of the key principles of epidemiology. It was more detailed than Epi I but still refreshed my memory of basic epi concepts. The course did well to provide quality research articles and helped students analyze critically.",
    "This is perhaps the best course I've ever taken. Dr. Dubrow is an excellent instructor, both informative and entertaining. I really appreciate his teaching style and know that I will be revisiting the lessons learned in this course for future application.",
    "Some of the information presented early in the course was too complex for the methods to be clearly understood, as the biostatistics and data management classes had not covered the same information at that time period. Overall, the concepts learned in the course were very pertinent to epidemiologic practice.",
    "Strengths: Covers principle of epi I topics in more detail. Homework questions are long, but thorough.Weaknesses: Exams were very long and difficult. Perhaps more short answer questions rather than just mostly multiple choice would be good on the exams.The first three weeks were more tedious\/difficult\/less concrete. Afterwards, I felt that the class became more engaging. Having example multiple choice questions in the lectures later on in the semester was a good check for all of us and gave us the opportunity to think about the kinds of questions we might be asked on exams.",
    "Dr Dubrow was very responsive to feedback and especially in the 2nd half of the course the HW length was much more manageable. I learned a lot throughout this course.",
    "VERY CHALLENGING COURSE. Once a week lecture is not enough time to understand concepts. Too much material for one lecture per week.",
    "This class really did build on the fundamentals that we learned in Principles of Epi. I thought that using a journal article to base homework questions was a practical way to show how what we were learning is applied.",
    "This class really teaches you how to critically evaluate an epidemiological article; however, sometimes the explanations and examples in class were difficult to follow.",
    "The workload for this course is a little intense, but the knowledge is very helpful.",
    "This course repeats many of the concepts learned in first semester epidemiology while going into greater depth and applying these concepts to literature critique and analysis.",
    "Hard to sit through after biostatistics. (Of course that's not Dubrow's fault.)",
    "This was an excellent course. Although it was a difficult class at times, I learned so much this semester. I have gained a better understanding of epidemiology and critiquing research articles.",
    "Strengths:The class covered a lot of new epidemiology topics. I built on our foundation from Epi I. The homework assignments were great to reinforce the lecture material. Dr. Dubrow gave us an mid course evaluation to complete and listened to our feedback. The assignments became shorter and more manageable. There was more reviewing of the concepts in order to make sure we understood them.Weaknesses:The discussion sections were a little inconsistent. Instead of going over the entire homework, we could have discussed lecture material that we had trouble with.",
    "At least this course was rough, as it was Dr. Dubrow's first year teaching epi II, but as the course went on, it got much better and I learned a lot from the semester. Some was repeat of epi I, but there was a lot of new stuff which was great.",
    "Great epi course. The lectures were clear and the homework and Friday discussions were very beneficial.",
    "Strengths: covered relevant concepts and served as a good review of epi 1, prof was knowledgable, challengingWeaknesses: it was a first-time course so had some glitches, the HW took a VERY long time each week, some texts were difficult and not helpful, could have benefitted from the use of a textbook to lay out each concept and discus the relevance and context of each, lectures were sometimes overwhelming",
    "Strengths - lecture topics were relevant and interesting; weekly homework helped to reinforce the material"

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow clearly cares a lot about his students and is passionate about the field of epidemiology. He know the concepts inside and out and responds well to feedback. I only have two criticisms: 1) Dr. Dubrow's research interests are in cancer hence the course was very heavy on cancer examples, readings, and articles. His course could benefit from more diverse health topics and examples. 2) The lectures were sometimes very dry and lacked clear introduction of concepts or discussion of when and how we would apply such concepts. The lectures could be a bit more interactive.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is very enthusiastic about the material. It was obvious that he dedicated considerable amounts of time and effort to providing lecture slides, homework assignments, and exam questions that were challenging but effective learning tools."

   "comments": [
    "useful but not clear",
    "Take it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend the class for students considering going on for a Ph.D",
    "Very solid introductory epi course.",
    "This course will be a big drain on time for the semester and will probably be stressful. I feel like I've learned a lot. Although I've done the vast majority of the work, I'm still concerned that I will not excel in the final exam (the mid-term was quite difficult). However, irrespective of my grade, I've gotten a lot out of the class.",
    "This course provides a good review of the material covered in Epi I. We learned some new information, but the course served primarily to reinforce the material in Epi I.",
    "Yes. Because it is very useful for all aspects of public health.",
    "This course is an important building block on Epi I. It introduces a more in-depth approach to epi and contains concepts that are relevant to so many areas of public health. This class was incredibly useful.",
    "I really enjoyed this second course in Epidemiology. Dr. Dubrow did a wonderful job of expanding on concepts learned in the first semester of Epidemiology, and responded quickly and effectively to student feedback. This course was a great opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the subject!",
    "Overall, the course was good but it could've been better. The enthusiasm that I had for Epi 1 was not there in Epi 2.",
    "You could learn a lot from this course, though you will feel a little bit overload",
    "It is a great course. The course load may be a little heavy, but it all worths it.",
    "This is a great course taught by a knowledgeable instructor. The material is interesting and even fun to learn. It is not that time consuming if you work on the homework assignments throughout the week.",
    "I would highly recommend this to all CDE, EMD, SDS, EHS, and BIS students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I could tell that Dr. Dubrow really put a lot of thought into his lectures and effort into the course in general to make sure that we were learning what we needed to learn.",
    "This is a required course. Be ready to put in a lot of work.",
    "Take this course if you are in EMD even though you do not need to.",
    "I everyone would benefit from course, I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Useful and did learn a lot, though the homework is frustrating. And the questions of the final exam are hard.",
    "A good survey epi course to take. Most materials covered in this class are also covered in other classes.",
    "Great addition to basic epidemiology knowledge with many examples to enhance learning.I would definitely recommend this course! It requires more work than other classes, but I felt that it really was worth the time and effort.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a student. Builds off epi one.",
    "Difficult course but completely worth it.",
    "This course was challenging and time-consuming, which ultimately works in the favor of students who plan on applying the concepts from this course in the real world. This course is what we should expect from a graduate program at a top university.",
    "I thought this course was challenging, but it really made me learn epi on a deeper level. It was probably one of the most important courses I've taken at YSPH. If someone's not afraid of doing work, I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Great class taught by Dr. Dubrow, provides a good expansion on key Epi I concepts.",
    "This class is excellent for those who want to obtain a further understanding of epi principles. I would recommend this class for future students because the lecture material and professor a great. The homework also allows students to apply the concepts learned in class and discussion sections allow students to clarify any questions regarding the homework material.",
    "Really helpful, and really helps you get a comprehensive knowledge of epi.",
    "I would recommend Epi 2 if a student wants to learn basic epi concepts in depth. If a studentforsees themselves conducting public health research, taking Epi 2 is worthwhile.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's tough work but you will learn a lot of valuable and useful skills from it.",
    "I would recommend the course based on its pertinence to epidemiologic practice. It was very informative and well taught.",
    "Principles of Epi II is a class that requires a lot of effort and is rather demanding. However, Dr. Dubrow is very dedicated to his students and this course builds and expands upon that which we learn in Epi I. I would recommend this class.",
    "This course can be challenging - mix of homework and tests - but you learn a lot. The way to prep is to go through the lectures and really go through the homework (and fhe friday section) and you'll get the most out of the class.",
    "Challenging course. Go to lecture every week, since it only meets once per week. Also take notes at the weekly section and understand the homework because this is important for exams. Go to office hours if you are uncertain of specific topics.",
    "This course is really helpful with teaching you how to read and evaluate epidemiological articles,and should be taken by everyone studying epidemiology.",
    "Maybe. The knowledge is very helpful, but the workload is a little intense.",
    "The course greatly furthered my knowledge of epidemiology by introducing new concepts, reinforcing concepts previously learned, and applying said concepts to the literature.",
    "I found the examinations and assignments difficult and sometimes unfairly tricky.",
    "This course was sometimes difficult, but it was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Epidemiology II is a difficult, time consuming course but it is worth it. It helped to understand complex epidemiology concepts. I would recommend it as it has been one of the most valuable classes I have taken at YSPH.",
    "It can be difficult, but you should take it.",
    "Despite the rough start, it was a great course to supplement epi I. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Good epi course -kind of like a more in depth version of Epi 1. Professor Dubrow is great and you'll really get the hang of critically analyzing journal papers.",
    "I think my above responses summarize the pros and cons of the course",
    "This course provides a better understanding of study design through methodical reading and evaluation of articles. The material was extremely helpful for relating many individual topics that are addressed in other classes."
