    "A very fast class that needs a good relationship between all students and students and instructors. Because it meets everyday, it becomes sort of a family. It is important to stay on top of the work, but other than that it is very enjoyable. I would advise one to take it if they love the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student."
