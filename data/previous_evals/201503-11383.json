   "comments": [
    "Much better than 222L. The time spent in lab is definitely less. Christine, as always, is an angel. Same format with 3 lab reports. You get to work with partners which is awesome. Sometimes assignments feel like busy work though",
    "Pretty smooth\/understandable lab course. Not as intimidating\/difficult as you may think!",
    "The class itself is fine.",
    "I definitely would recommend it to another student. Most students wouldn't take CHEM223L because it's not required for most majors, but I think it's very helpful to see the science you're learning in Orgo lecture. Additionally, the TA's are usually very approachable, as is Dr. DiMeglio, so there is always someone around to answer questions. Lab itself feels very relaxed, and is very much a class that isn't too difficult to handle in terms of time commitment and material.",
    "This class s so much more relaxed than CHEM 222L. The reactions are easier, you can actually understand all the mechanisms, and there are only 3 small lab reports that are not graded harshly at all. Some students were bored by making white crystalline solids week after week, but I found it to be super fun and interesting. The lab exam is hard, but that's about it.",
    "Great course! Pretty low-key, not that much outside work but you will have to spend an entire afternoon each week in lab. You will get really good at synthetic chemistry techniques.",
    "It was definitely manageable and interesting-take it.",
    "If you're looking at this you probably have to take it. It's really not that hard and it's really similar to the first semester of lab.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this lab. It was straightforward and not time consuming, but I still learned and had a great time in lab. There were 10 labs, and a few built off of each other. There were also 3 post lab assignments, which took some time, but were also pretty straightforward. The final covered the questions included in the course packet, so it was easy to study for.",
    "CHEM 223L is a great organic chemistry laboratory course. The experiments are a decent length and are interesting.",
    "The course teaches useful skills and does not have a heavy workload. Assignments are reasonable and most labs are done with partners.",
    "Super chill. Take the class if you need to.",
    "I would recommend CHEM223L to any students interested in carrying out some of the reactions discussed in Chemistry class as well as to those who think they might want to pursue a career in Chemistry in order to enhance the laboratory skills learned in the lab for first semester Organic Chemistry.",
    "You gotta take what you gotta take. It's a lab course you can de-stress actually i think. Just think you're spending 2-3 hours one afternoon each week to cook something -- throw in a couple of ingredients, reflux, and boom. Enjoy!",
    "A good lab to take - you will be doing more per day compared to first semester orgo lab (for example, most labs will require you to collect the product, run the IR and TLC, and find the MP), but quite a few labs have the same basic procedure, so you will get used to the rhythm very quickly.",
    "A continuation of CHEM 222L. I would recommend it to other students, its pretty chill too!",
    "Continuation of Orgo I Lab, but the techniques are slightly different (more reflux and recrystallization), and it's slightly more laid-back. I don't think it related to the Orgo II class all that well, but it was an enjoyable experience. Odds are you have to take it if you're reading this, so please know it's an overall good experience.",
    "I enjoyed Organic Lab II a lot more than Organic Lab I. Overall, the environment encouraged collaboration, the workload was always reasonable, the content was decently challenging and the professors and TAs were accessible, helpful and intelligent. Strengths: -Much easier, more entertaining and positive than Organic Chemistry I. The best thing is that every experiment (except 1) is done in a team. The emphasis on teamwork reduces the burden on you greatly, spreads the risks of any major mess-ups and allows you to learn other peoples tips and tricks. Organic I was always more stressful because all the experiments were individual efforts and you were in trouble if you made one mistake. -Builds on the Organic I skills: you essentially master melting point measurement, chromatography, IR spectra, vacuum filtration and reflux. You will do this pretty much every week. You will do them so much that they become second nature. -A lot of experiments are much more closely connected to the concepts and understanding. The excerpts before the experimental procedure in the lab are more insightful and introduce new concepts. Regardless, I would strongly encourage you to take the course with the class rather than after it. Everything reinforces each other. There is also an increased focus on mechanisms (sometimes ridiculously difficult ones) in the lab course that will help with the main course. -Just much easier than Organic I because youre essentially doing the same things\/answering the same questions again and youve gotten better at everything. -The only source through which youll read Chemistry papers. Most of the papers are very very simple and probably not the very complicated\/cutting-edge ones but since the main class doesnt give you any exposure to real research, this is a good window into chemistry academia. Weaknesses: -Same old, same old. We basically dont cover any new techniques and skills. I feel we should learn at least 2-3 new instruments and skills e.g. fractional distillation, using an NMR instrument (we only do interpretation of NMR spectra), X-ray crystallography etc. -IR spectra not understood very well. At the end of 90% of the labs, you take IR spectra of the product but we never really see it\/care about it again (except 2\/10 of them on some post0lab assignment). It would be nice if we sat down and interpreted the IR spectra because theyre heavily heavily tested on the final exam. -No dedication to addressing discrepancies in MP, yield and chromatograms. If you got a ridiculous result (a yield higher than 100% even after drying), a MP off by too many points or a disastrous chromatogram, no one really cares By the end of the lab when everyone wants to get out (even the TA), everyone just gets the tasks done, even if theyre done half-heartedly.",
    "This lab course was really well organized and not difficult. Every week we were able to get out early, and the labs themselves were straight forward. The pre and post labs were not too much work either. Best lab course I have had at Yale!",
    "I enjoyed Chem 223L. It was very well-organized, and each weekly lab had a very clear purpose. The professor and TAs were very interested in helping the students, and this motivated the students to do their best. If you are unsure of whether to take this lab because of how awful Gen Chem lab is, don't worry-- Orgo lab is infinitely more productive and less stressful and arbitrary.",
    "You'll be fine, it's an easygoing lab",
    "Great lab to take. Not too stressful and extremely insightful.",
    "I wouldn't say this class is enjoyable, but if you have to take the lab, it's not too painful--certainly much better than general chemistry lab! The post-lab assignments aren't too demanding, but still require time, effort, and thought.",
    "Great lab. I highly recommend it. It reinforces your understanding of reactions you talk about in lecture and provides practical applications of them.",
    "Likely you're taking chem 223L because it's required, but regardless it is a really good lab course. It's well-run, you perform interesting experiments, it's not too much work, and Dr. DiMeglio is wonderful.",
    "Chem 223L is a great lab course! It is not very stressful, you often get out early, and it's actually pretty fun if you like that kind of thing!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was actually my favorite course I took this semester.",
    "I would say that you should take it if it is a requirement. It is much better than general chemistry lab, but I wasn't too fond of it.",
    "Best lab course I have taken at Yale so far. You get out early every time, and the labs are pretty straight forward. You also get very comfortable with all the classic organic lab protocols and techniques. You will be able to vacuum filtrate in your sleep.",
    "It is a lot of different reactions performed with similar techniques and product analysis. I would recommend this course because it is enjoyable and you fell that you learn\/master the material.",
    "I would recommend this course",
    "I would generally recommend it. This class consists of a lot of critical thinking, but it is enjoyable. How you enjoy the class will greatly depend upon what TA you have, but it is one of my favorite lab classes I have taken at Yale."
