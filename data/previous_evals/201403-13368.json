    "This is a very interesting class on the development of finance. I would recommend it to anyone interested in economics.",
    "Felt like more of an archeology\/art history course than a finance course. Went into it expecting an emphasis on the ways in which financial concepts came to be, ended up being more of an art history course. Classes would often revolve around a \"hey look at this neat coin\" approach, which did not interest me nearly as much. Still somewhat interesting at times, and involved cool case studies and writing prompts."
