   "comments": [
    "This course is an overview of both classic and recent literature in the fields of American cultural history and cultural studies. I would certainly recommend it to any student who has not yet been exposed either to this literature or to its more theoretical and analytical approaches.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great survey of cultural history and great for orals preparation!",
    "AMST 731 is a readings course in U.S. cultural history from the early national period to the present. The course also includes a preliminary section in which we examine the intellectual history of cultural history and its relationship to American studies. In addition to being a traditional readings and methods course, the course also provides an excellent overview of the current state of the field in American studies scholarship. I would recommend the course for all those interested in learning more about cultural history and the methods that surround the field. I would also recommend the course for those considering how cultural history might relate to their own area of study, because the course offers a great setting in which to explore those questions.",
    "This course provides a wonderful overview of recent and classic work in the field of cultural history. Students will come away with a better understanding not just of the subjects covered in the readings, but of the processes of writing, reading, and understanding history itself.",
    "An introduction to methodologies and ways of thinking crucial to becoming a successful cultural historian (or using the cultural historian's tools). Briefly demonstrates how these methods can be used in respect to varying kinds of sources, ranging from traditional texts to things like toys and games, and across different ethnic groups over the course of a semester. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student due to the usefulness of these methods for any kind of scholar in the humanities or social sciences.",
    "Any undergrad or grad student in American Studies should take this course--it is foundational.",
    "This course allows you to choose your own adventure. There are core themes, but the book you read each week is up to you. It creates a rigorous intellectual environment where you are continually challenged to listen, process, and engage. I feel as though it has excellently prepared me for the sort of conversations and back-and-forth one encounters at conferences and job talks. Six journal assignments force you to develop a plan of attack when reading. By the end of the course, I felt wholly capable of tackling a meaty book of cultural history in a single day. There is a focus this course brings to one's process of reading, digesting, and producing that is invaluable. That focus, then, when paired with the flexible final assignment options, encourages exploration and diversification that one feels ready, willing, and able to undertake.",
    "American Cultural History is an engaging, intellectually stimulating and challenging class with some of the best books for weekly readings. I would encourage any future students to select weekly books that made them get out of their comfort zone in order to better understand components of American culture. Arguably, American culture is hard to completely define, although throughout the duration of the semester the class discusses and attempts to define American culture over the ages. American culture can mean different things in different communities, geographic regions, and even time periods. Understanding American culture is important because it helps us to understand history, communities, trends, fads, powers and privileges, and much more. It's a fascinating subject that will continue to evolve over the ages.I would absolutely recommend this class, and I intend to tell incoming students that they must take this course!!"

   "comments": [
    "This course has broadened and sharpened my analytical peripheral vision. Both the readings and the discussion exposed me to new modes of analysis, which I am sure will have a significant effect as I both read more cultural history in my own period and further refine my dissertation argument.",
    "Great for orals and great for understanding the historiography my dissertation will be in conversation with.",
    "This course equipped me with a deeper understanding of what cultural history is, how it evolved, and what major issues are currently at stake in the sub-field. In so doing, the course really causedme to think seriously about considering cultural history as a major method in shaping my own work.",
    "This class helped 1st and 2nd years envision our Orval's fields.",
    "In ways innumerable. Generally, I feel much more conversant in the field of American Studies (as a field) on the whole. Topics that seemed once disparate have been thrown into relief\/brought into conversation with one another. The course, I think, had made my thinking more complex, more nuanced, more aware of its imbrication with the trajectory of the field as a whole. At the same time, somewhat paradoxically, I feel as though a focus and direction was brought to my questions as the result of both Matt's leadership and the freedom I was given to dig in where I was most compelled to do so. Overall, a brilliant classroom experience that I'll be grateful to have had for years to come. I wish, honestly, that some manifestation of this course would be installed in place of American Scholars.",
    "I appreciated the interdisciplinary readings, discussions and assignments in this class. I am interested in understanding Alaska race relations between Alaska Native people and Western people at the turn of the century during the Klondike and Nome Gold Rushes. I would now like to analyze the material culture during the gold rushes with a focus on the portrayal of Alaska Native people, and Alaska Native women in particular. I wonder if the material culture somehow impacted stereotypical representations of Alaska Native and Alaskan Eskimos in film during the 20th&21st centuries. I also wonder if the material culture expressed any notions about the interracial marriages and cohabitations that existed during the time period. I really enjoyed this class and I feel like it gave me a \"tool box\" for better grappling my dissertation subject in the future regarding the material culture of the Alaska gold rushes. I'm really thankful I had the opportunity to take this class and I had a challenging time and a lot of fun in this class every week."
