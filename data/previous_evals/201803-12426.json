   "comments": [
    "Basic knowledge of the political philosophy listed in the syllabus.",
    "I was introduced to several foundational questions in political philosophy that changed the way I viewed some classical political philosophy texts.",
    "I developed a basic knowledge of classical political philosophers.",
    "I gained a lot of insight about the fundamental political philosophers who have shaped our society today. This was an amazing survey course that really encourages students to heavily engage with the text and get a lot of exposure to key political theory that influences a lot of the decisions that have impacted our global political relationships.",
    "Learned about the western canon and great works of political philosophy.",
    "I learned a lot about how political thinking has changed over time and how our society has progressed.",
    "How to think about historical texts",
    "A great crash-course to some of the most important text in the field of political philosophy.",
    "A relatively substantial understanding of many of the prominent thinkers and texts of political philosophy.",
    "I think that this course has made me aware with some of the most important literary and ideological foundations of contemporary political systems and has made me think much more about the idea of who should actually rule.",
    "I learned the basic evolution of political theory through the writing of several important writers in Western philosophy.",
    "I learned about the main philosophers of the Western cannon, their ideas, and how they build or differ from each other.",
    "Studied many of the most prominent thinkers in the Western canon, from Socrates to Hannah Arendt. A fantastic (and more universal) substitution for DS.",
    "A broad overview of the western canon and an understanding of each author's perspective on politics.",
    "Learned to interpret some of the most important works of political philosophy, taking both the professor's point of view and my own direct understanding.",
    "I learned how to read a high volume of advanced political texts and analyze them in both small and large group settings.",
    "good overview of the western canon and intro into how to read pieces of philosophy",
    "Read a lot of canonical texts that were very valuable.",
    "I hadn't read any of the western canon and now I have. In terms of skills I don't feel like I developed much.",
    "I gained the skill of thinking critically about different systems of government, their merits and weaknesses. I felt that I went in not understanding many other forms of government outside of a democracy, but reading different philosophers helped me grasp the entire spectrum of political systems, past and present.",
    "Stronger writing ability, much better understanding of western political canon.",
    "Democracy!",
    "I feel that I have gained a basic understanding of what questions the field of political philosophy seeks to answer and how important philosophers answered those questions in their writing.",
    "A general overview of the theories of significant political philosophers.",
    "I developed a greater knowledge of the theories of classic philosophers and the ability to compare different categories of thought.",
    "This course was my first exposure to texts in the Western cannon and the works of renowned philosophers. I developed close readings skills, improved on my writing skills, and refined my ability to think critically about different arguments.",
    "So much insight about the western canon and the different philosophers that make it up.",
    "I had never before taken a course in Political Science or Political Philosophy. This class, more a crash-course than an in-depth exploration of any of the syllabus' authors, gave me a broad, decent grasp of a wide variety of thinkers. This course taught me how to begin critiquing and assessing governments around me in a political and also philosophical way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course didn't feel like it followed a universal thread. The readings felt scattershot at times. I feel like it could be improved by starting with a philosophical foundation into \"What is the state? and \"What is politics?\" and \"Why do humans need to live under a state?\" etc. This is what I was expecting from an intro to political philosophy class. These questions came later as we read other philosophers, but only tangentially, and were only really ever addressed in section.",
    "Lecture was not that engaging, and it seemed unlikely that anyone completely read ALL of the readings that were assigned. Section was a lot more engaging and helpful to my understanding of the material.",
    "Strength: Breadth of readings Weakness: Engagment in each text. Perhaps offer longer section or two sections",
    "Lower volume of reading would help students stay on track and maintain engagement.",
    "Strengths: texts, there was great depth in the texts we were assigned. We had to read many of the classic political thinkers, but we also had the opportunity to read a couple more contemporary thinkers who provided a more diverse background like MLK Jr, Du Bois, and Arendt.",
    "I think that it could be improved by letting students have more agency in creation of ideas and in the discussions, instead of staying so rooted to the textual evidence.",
    "The discussion sections were a huge help.",
    "Sections were very helpful in understanding the material better",
    "This course is great in covering a lot of material in one semester.",
    "The content is extremely interesting and section was effective at starting engaging discussions, but the lectures were slightly bland.",
    "I think this course was wonderful with Prof. Landemore's lectures often being engaging and demonstrating an true command of the information that was being taught; however, there were times in which her analysis could come across as one sided, leaving seemingly less room for students to draw their own conclusions.",
    "I feel like we went over everything so quickly that we didn't really do justice by any of it. I think the course should be narrowed so we can adequetly discuss the thinkers. I also don't think that the two papers reflected the range of ideas we discussed. Maybe have 3 or 4 papers and no final? Also, too much reading during some weeks. The long passages from Tocqueville could've been condensed and still captured the important ideas.",
    "A strength of this course was that it was a good general introduction. A weakness was that there was an unreasonable amount of reading.",
    "Lecture is not too engaging and information provided is not always supplementary to the readings, but rather repetition. Writing intensive section does not truly focus on how to write better other than the two big essay papers assigned. strengths: material is relevant and interesting",
    "Strengths: Professor Landemore was engaging and demonstrated a mastery of political theory. Vatsal as a TF was the best! Weaknesses: The course could have used more inter-text engagement during the lectures.",
    "addsd",
    "So much reading that its hard to keep up, wish we had more time in lecture because lectures were very valuable but felt too fast.",
    "I don't have a confident working knowledge of so many of the philosophers because we read small sections of them. I feel like we should do less texts and more thoroughly. I really enjoyed the background knowledge on what sort of ideas were big in science or culturally while the philosophers where writing and how that impacted their own thinking.",
    "The lectures were good and the sections were good. In general, a good course with some flaws. The lectures were a bit too much like a seminar style class which is hard with 80 students. It can be improved by standardizing grading across TFs. Writing and papers are already subjective but then subjectivity is added to subjectivity when different TFs are grading across WI and regular sections. However, i still did get good feedback.",
    "It was very interesting and the lectures were helpful. It could be improved by assigning less reading because many times I felt like I was trying to speed through to finish.",
    "Strength: captivating, lots of reading, Weakness: not too interactive in lectures, tooo much reading (if youre not a reader)",
    "More interactive elements would be excellent.",
    "I really liked the material\/thinkers chosen for the course. I also liked the use of the guiding question who should rule to make sense of the philosophy through one lens. Although at first I found the lectures interesting as Id never taken a philosophy class before, however, as the year went on, the lectures grew more boring and I retained barely any information making finals studying a lot.",
    "The lectures were interesting but some went a bit too quickly.",
    "This course attempts to cover a large volume of texts in a short period of time. It made it very difficult for me to spend the necessary amount of time studying each text. Ultimately I felt rushed and wish the pace could have been a bit more reasonable so that I could properly analyze each text.",
    "The lectures were really engaging. The reading was a lot, I would recommend trimming down the parts of each book that we read so that students can read those parts in depth rather than skimming long sections of text.",
    "A weakness of this class is its sheer volume of reading; covering such a wide range of authors, I never felt too engaged in any one author that we were focusing on--by the end of the week we had already moved on to the next one. That being said, Professor Landemore and the Teaching Fellows did an excellent job of giving students a decent grasp of each author despite the constricted time limit and the quick pace of the class. Any student should walk away with a basic understanding of upwards of ten authors. This is an impressive feat, in my opinion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Good to have a base in political philosophy before taking further courses (for example Classics of EP&E), even though I feel the course could be improved as I before explained.",
    "Not really. If you are super interested in the topics, sure I think you would enjoy the class. I just didn't find the lectures to be that interesting.",
    "Yes. It's a neat introduction to reading and writing at Yale.",
    "Yes! I think that learning about these classical thinkers is essential.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in political theory, history of politics in the US or anyone considering majoring in any of the fields that have anything to do with politics, American history, economics, or philosophy. This is a survey course that provides you with the opportunity to learn about many of the most popular political philosophers who will surely be brought up throughout your other courses. At the end of the day, even if political philosophy isn't exactly your cup of tea, you'll walk away smarter and more capable of sustaining an intelligent conversation relating to political theory.",
    "Yes, I think at the end of the day the class is kind of a pain, but it definitely makes sense if you are at all interested in philosophy or politics (which you all should be). Take it. You can get away without doing the readings if you really don't want to. It's a good introduction to political philosophy. You won't have fun, but you'll survive and be better for it.",
    "If you're really into reading a bunch of different political books and analyzing everyone else's ideas, then yes.",
    "Yes, I think its important to read texts like the ones we read and understand how our government today has evolved",
    "Absolutely. This course will help flesh out contingencies one may have, I think, with the current affairs of international politics and regime types. By taking a look into some of the founding individuals in this field, one will walk away with a great appreciation and understanding regarding the original purposes behind the wide array of regime types.",
    "Yes. It is very broad in scope and useful in what it teaches you, whether you're a PLSC major or not.",
    "I would because this course has personally widened my perspective and made me feel a lot more knowledgable than before. I think the readings are important for most people to do as they offer valuable insight into political workings today.",
    "Yes, it provides a solid foundation of western political thought",
    "I wouldn't. Unless you really want to study political theory and you didn't do DS, there's no reason to take it. I thought I'd get a lot out of reading the classics, but the literature as well as the course itself were not that interesting.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student. There was way too much reading, so if you like that then sure.",
    "Yes -- if you want to learn about political thought and read through much of the Western canon. As a science major, this was a welcome change in programming. However, thinking on a different level of abstraction was challenging, but a worthwhile one. Even if you don't need this course for EP&E requirements, it's worth it to take it if you have the course flexibility!",
    "Yes. I am glad that I took this class because it is always good to have knowledge of authors like the ones discussed in class (Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, etc.). While lecture isn't amazing, it is sufficiently helpful.",
    "If you are interested in the books that are listed then, yes. The course is not too difficult and the essay titles are actually quite interesting. Lecture and section are fine, but you will only find the class rewarding if you are interested in reading and understanding the books, because it's very much focused on the books. The readings are not that long, and if you want to do some reading of classic books of political philosophy this is a good class.",
    "I would, if they are interested in a foundational course in politics.",
    "yes",
    "Yes!! Very good, although difficult. Expect to work.",
    "Yes, but probably do not take writing intensive unless you're sure of the time commitment.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, I would. It is informative but fairly low-commitment.",
    "Yes, I think it was a great class for any student interested in government and politics.",
    "Yes, it gives a good overview of political philosophy for those that have never read any before.",
    "I would but only if they had the intention of majoring in political science\/philosophy. Other than that its not the most exciting course in PLSC offered.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have ample time to read the texts. Some weeks had very heavy loads of reading and it is necessary to read the texts to succeed in the course.",
    "Absolutely! While philosophy and the western cannon aren't really my favorite thing, Prof. Landemore made it really engaging and I feel like I gained a great knowledge base that I can apply in the future. I really feel like a learned Ivy League scholar now that I can name drop all sorts of philosophers.",
    "Yes, I would! This class is an excellent introduction into the world of Political Philosophy. To anyone who is willing to spend hours reading, taking notes, and thinking deeply about the world around them: take this class!"
