    "Good class. Harsh grading however so be diligent when doing the exams. Prof. Asensio is great!",
    "Yes, if you're looking to improve your Spanish proficiency then take this course!",
    "It's likely you are taking this class to fulfill a language requirement; if so, take it with Pilar Asensio. She's really great.",
    "It's a requirement.",
    "Work load wise this course isn't too hard. It meets everyday which sucks, but that's any L3 class.",
    "Spanish 130 is essentially a more in-depth review of grammar and vocabulary concepts introduced in Spanish 120; be prepared to cover familiar material like the various forms of the subjunctive, the conditional, and the other fundamental tenses and constructions. There is very little newmaterial, though the course itself has some interesting readings that are excerpted from works by authors like Borges and Cervantes. I felt that this exposure to the cultural elements (literature, current issues, etc.) was the most valuable aspect of Spanish 130.With that said, if you plan on taking this course, I highly recommend Professor Pilar! She explains anything you don\u0092t understand about the material very clearly and will always make time to meet with you out of class if you need more help. She also is super nice and energetic, which somewhat lessens the pain of having to attend class every day.",
    "It's Spanish 3.",
    "Fill your language requirement.",
    "I would only take it to fulfill a requirement.",
    "If you have to take it, take it."
