    "I learnt how to solve a specific set of ordinary differential equations as well as a few partial differential equations. The course did not cover all of the topics that it was prescribed to cover.",
    "Wow. I learned an insane amount of math in this class. First-order ODEs, second-order ODEs, fourier series, fourier transforms, laplace transforms, PDEs, heat equation, wave equation, etc. This class is a great advanced math course for anyone interested in differential equations. In addition to just learning the material, you will learn a ton of different mathematical methods to simplify and interpret different kinds of expressions.",
    "I generally developed an appreciation for the complexity of Math.",
    "Didnt learn anything. Only memorized equations and prayed to the lord to hold my hand during every exam.",
    "lots of math",
    "I learned how to solve ordinary and partial differential equations in the manner prescribed by the course, which is something. It did not feel as though we plumbed the subject extensively, and I'm not sure how well I will remember the methods or mentality necessary to solve ODEs and PDEs in the future, but feel satisfied to have checked the course off.",
    "How to solve a limited number of ODE problems",
    "Learned mostly ordinary, some partial Diff. Eq.",
    "I learned how to use Khan Academy to learn about ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.",
    "This class provides an excellent introduction to solving 1st and 2nd order ordinary differential equations and 2nd order partial differential equations. Professor Levchenko explains the physical\/mechanical\/electronics relevance of certain mathematical problem-solving techniques (e.g. RC circuitry, heat conduction with heat loss), which helps students to understand how to apply the skills that we've learned.",
    "Technically this course is supposed to teach you ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations from an engineering perspective, which means that you are supposed to learn what these equations mean and how they are useful in real life. However, during lectures, most of the time is spent on the theories and proof of stuff that you don't even use in any of the problem sets or midterms. If a lecture is 75 minutes, 65 minutes of it is math you don't understand (and don't worry you don't need to understand) and the last 10 minutes is going back to the beginning. No single example was solved in class, and you are expected to do a problem set every week. You go to lecture thinking you learned something and then you start the problem set and you realise that what you did in class had nothing to do with what you are asked to do. So yes you learn differential equations, but I cannot guarantee you will learn those in class.",
    "Gained a how to approach solving ordinary and partial differential equations.",
    "I learned many different methods to solve a variety of ordinary differential equations and have a broad understanding of how to solve specific partial differential equations.",
    "I learned Ordinary and Partial differential equations.",
    "I had taken differential equations in high school, but it is very different than what I had ever done before. You learn about a higher math that isn't too hard leading up to the two midterms but gets difficult before the final. You do learn a lot, though, about a higher level math.",
    "ODEs and PDEs, and how to solve them",
    "I learned the basic techniques and applications related to differential equations.",
    "I really don't think I got much out of this course. It was overall a fine course and could easily be an \"extra\" course. This will not be the hardest course you take. I learned how to solve simple ordinary differential equations and got an introduction to important methods in solving partial differential equations. The structure of the course made it very easy to learn the material - regardless of if you attended lecture.",
    "As someone who took Differential Equations in High School, I acquired a more in-depth grasp of the actual equations I was solving, and how they could be representing real-life scenarios.",
    "You learn how to solve ordinary differential equations and a few types of partial differential equations. Overall a lot of material is covered.",
    "I learned how to solve basic ordinary and partial differential equations. I expect to use this skill frequently in my physics courses.",
    "How to solve differential equations, and basic concepts of the different ways to manipulate equations. Hard course, and unclear at many points about what we were doing and why. But overall, not an unreasonable course.",
    "I got a great and thorough foundation in both ordinary and partial differential equations.",
    "I gained a good understanding of how to approach differential equations and the systems they are used to model.",
    "I learned how to approach most differential equations and solve them.",
    "This course teaches its students the theory, equations, and practice that makes up ordinary and partial differncial equations. I essentially learned how to solve various simple forms of differential equations.",
    "I strengthened my skills in differential equations. However, there was not training in partial differential equations, as the syllabus and the name of the course implies. I understood how many differential equations work and practiced specific strategies that allows for ordinary differential equations to be solved.",
    "Learned the techniques to solve ordinary and partial differential equations",
    "Good class overall, Problem sets are challenging but fair, Exams are difficult, The final was extremely hard, But Levchenko does an ok job at teaching the class",
    "Great introduction to Differential Equations, with heavy focus on ODE's and a little bit on PDE's.",
    "Knowledge and insight about differential equations up to the second order and various techniques used to solve for them.",
    "This was the worst class I've taken at Yale. I learned almost nothing in this class.",
    "This course spends a lot of time on ordinary differential equations and only briefly covers partial differential equations. This course allows you to develop good math skills and helps you learn how to solve these types of problems. However, although this is supposed to be applied, almost no application is done in the class.",
    "Exactly what the title of the course is. I learnt how to solve ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. We also had a slight exposure to their possible applications, especially in physics.",
    "I feel like my mathematical ability definitely improved taking this course. I wasn't a total deer-in-the-headlights when faced with problems I had never seen before, which is an improvement."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Proofs aren't very helpful for actually solving problems. Lectures should go through many more example problems.",
    "The course and lectures should be much better organized.",
    "Weaknesses: The organization of this class was very poor; class was canceled multiple times and we found out only hours beforehand. Those lectures also were not made up.",
    "The first half of the semester was very manageable, but the second half was very rushed. We went through a lot of material very quickly and it was hard to keep up at times.",
    "Strength: Overall, a great course. Weakness: Time management was definitely an issue, and the course was very poorly taught towards the end, which made the final very difficult.",
    "I really liked how this class paired most concepts with their applications in real life. This helped put what we learned in context with their actual applications in engineering and modeling physical systems. It was helpful to have lecture notes uploaded online, but I think it would have been helpful for us to have more practice materials prior to the midterms and final so we had more practice and a better idea of what to expect.",
    "No strengths really. weaknesses range from everything to everything.",
    "Too early. Hard to get up and do math at 9am.",
    "As a required class for most STEM majors, Diveq was bound to be dull and rote. It was. The instructor did his best, but the class is not supposed to be scintillating - it's a matter of learning specific processes and methods and regurgitating them. The class could definitely have been made easier with the inclusion of more practice problems in class.",
    "You go over how to solve some ODE problems, and a few PDE problems as well. The lectures mainly consist of deriving equations, which I found hard to follow and not very useful. Very little was mentioned about practical applications of ODEs and PDEs.",
    "The load of the course is actually not that bad, if it's taught well. Prof. Levchenko missed SIX classes this semester (i.e. 3 weeks) which caused a lot of the material at the end to be rushed. Also, midterms were very early in the term so much of the later material was not tested at all until the final. He also assigned a p-set during reading week which I did not appreciate at all. Overall, midterms should be more spread out, more time should be spent on PDEs, and the final p-set should be BEFORE reading week.",
    "One strength of this course is that there were always notes posted online that helped clarify lectures\/provide material if I wasn't able to go to class. One weakness of this class is that there were very few concrete examples gone over in class so it was really difficult to know how to do homework questions.",
    "The lecture notes that Professor Levchenko posted were comprehensive, thorough, and incredibly useful (especially with the textbook) in solidifying my grasp on key concepts. The lectures in the second half of the course were disjointed, and, without the online lecture notes, I often struggled to see how these topics were integrated. The problem sets were very instructive and useful in exam preparation- the homework on PDEs was particularly challenging and helped me to identify and fill in gaps in my understanding.",
    "Appreciated how formulaic the class was. You could study from the textbook and lecture notes and be prepared to do well.",
    "This course is a very important class, considering that every engineering or science major ends up taking it. It should be an easy course to teach since there are basic principles and you just need to go through them. However, the way Professor Levchenko structured the class made no sense and it left the people who haven't been exposed to this material before very confused. The people who had some knowledge however, got like 120 per cent on the tests. Personally, I had to teach myself everything by watching youtube videos and looking on online lectures to find something relevant to get me through the class. Honestly, if the lectures included at least 2-3 examples on how to solve the actual equations given on the problem sets, I cannot see any reason for people not to be successful in the class. Also when you think about it, the people who take this class, have already taken multivariable calculus, if the class revolved around more application than history of mathematicians of 60 minute derivations, maybe we could see the connection between engineering and differential equations. I learned more about these equations in my mechanical engineering class than I did in lecture. Also the last part of the lecture is supposed to be partial differential equations, however, only 3 lectures were spent on them, and none of those lectures included a strategy to actually solve a partial differential equation. We were told that those would be on the final and I can assure you that there is no way one could expect these students to solve the problems given on the final test based on the material covered in lecture. It is really easy to improve this class. First of all, the professor who teaches it needs to abide by his own syllabus and follow the time frame to make sure that there is actually enough time to do all the material in class. Also so that he doesn't have to assign a problem set over reading period. Also if the professor actually cares about the class and doesn't have to cancel at least 5 lectures and send in subs. Everything started to make sense when we were studying for the final exam but none of that is based on the lectures, we basically went over a lot of external sources and judging from those, it is really easy to structure this class since it is the core of any science practice.",
    "The strengths of the course were that Professor Levchenko was a good professor and taught the course clearly and the homework assignments were fair and helped emphasize the material. One way in that this class could be improved would be for Professor Levchenko and the TAs to be more available to help students (Levchenko's office hours fell during the time between when our problem sets were handed in and the next one was assigned so this wasn't very helpful for homework and the office hours with the TA often lacked structure.)",
    "The teaching was definitely the highlight of the course and the posted lecture notes were extremely clear and thus very beneficial. The organization could have been a bit better. We were a little bit behind (he covered ODEs very thoroughly) and then rushed through the last third of the course which was undoubtedly much more difficult. The midterms were extremely reasonable. They should have prepped us better on the final (the practice exam was the exact opposite of the final) and those were the topics that we rushed through during the course.",
    "I found that the course was very difficult to follow. Over the course of the semester, the material became too difficult to understand without the help of external sources, such as Khan Academy videos. The TA was also not helpful during problem sessions, and the lecture notes were sometimes difficult to interpret. Additionally, the psets were often on material we had not covered during class time.",
    "The first 2\/3 of the course is quite easy, but the final third is quite difficult. I think if that last third got more time to be explained more deeply, students would benefit because they'd be able to understand it better. I do think it is structured well for the first 2\/3rds though.",
    "Lecture notes are really clear and neat, a way to improve upon it is to have more examples for the last part of the class, the PDEs",
    "The strengths of this course are mainly in that it provides the overview of differential equations necessary for many STEM majors at Yale. The lecture notes were also posted which was really helpful. Most of the weaknesses have to do with how it was taught. It was difficult to know what was a proof and what was a formula we had to apply, which was frustrating as this is an applications course. The professor missed several lectures, never held make-ups, and sped through the material at the end to make up for it but still didn't cover all of partial differential equations. This made worse the fact that the class is very badly balanced--the beginning is easy and the end is extremely difficult. The psets were often unreasonably hard and could not be completed without going to a review session where a TA would help us. Psets were also assigned irregularly and sometimes late. We were often given types of problems on the tests that we had never worked through on a pset (which is often crucial for learning), instead we got those problems on a pset randomly several weeks later. I wish there had been more opportunities for individual help--the review sessions were good and the TA was great but I wish the TAs had office hours and the professor had more than one office hour a week. We were also not allowed to take a formula sheet into the final exam, which made no sense as students in every other semester of this course have been able to and there are so many formulas to memorize which is basically a waste of time. Professor Levchenko also gave us a mock final and stated that it was very similar to the actual final, when in reality it covered all the topics not on the actual final--that was very confusing and unclear and led to students studying completely the wrong things (he did not state that it was similar in format and not in content.)",
    "Strengths The online lecture notes. Weaknesses The inconsistency in who would be lecturing. As the course is, it makes for an alright course if it doesn't set its sights too far. It does however have the potential to become something much more. It doesn't ask much out of us. The ordinary differential equations could be covered (to the same depth) much faster.",
    "Problem sets were so hard and only one TA held office hours and he didn't really know how to do the problems anyways. The professor expected most of the learning to happen on the homework which would have been fine if there had been better help resources for us outside of class. Also, he posted the lecture notes for each lecture and they were identical to the lectures, even clearer than the lectures most of the time. There was really no reason to go to lecture except to hand in psets.",
    "Strengths: The exams closely mirrored the homework, so you generally were able to know what you should study. Weaknesses: Partial Diff Eqs were kind of thrown in at the end without much emphasis. I actually understood these more than I understood ordinary equations, but I do think it was almost an afterthought as far as the syllabus goes.",
    "The strengths are the breadth and utility of the material covered. The weaknesses are that at times the class is not very engaging, and while the material we are learning has many applications, they are lost in derivations that are not taught to illustrate any importance.",
    "I would have appreciated more attention to the theory of differential equations. It would have been nice in particular if the instructor had provided students with a background in linear algebra with a description of how to analyze ODEs and PDEs using linear algebra. Aside from this, I felt that the course covered ODEs in depth, and the brief treatment of PDEs was interesting.",
    "How to solve differential equations, and basic concepts of the different ways to manipulate equations. Hard course, and unclear at many points about what we were doing and why. But overall, not an unreasonable course.",
    "I thought this was a great course. I wasn't planning on taking it but then fell in love with it during shopping period. I thought it was very fair and that Professor Levchenko presented the material in a very organized way.",
    "The course was a good survey of Diff EQ but not very thorough when it came to being able to implement problems in real life.",
    "Professor Levchenko was engaging and lectured with clarity. Overall te course was very straightforward.",
    "I think this course was thought well in a sense that all the concepts were clear and the practice problems given help understanding greatly as well. In addition, very sufficient and helpful lecture notes were posted online if there was any part that was hard to understand in class. The only thing I wish was stronger was a greater sense of cohesion in the whole course. To me, each class made sense but there was little connection between different topics. I wish at the beginning or end of lecture we would go over how each part fit into the whole picture of the course.",
    "This course had really great course notes and a great textbook. However, the lectures were not very good, nor the problem sets. I often felt that the problem sets, especially for partial differential equations, did not help at all. They used very simplistic, almost trivial, cases, that did not deepen understanding of Fourier transforms and other Partial Differential Equation techniques.",
    "The course has material which is challenging but Professor Levchenko provided excellent lecture notes and took his time to explain concepts so well that it made it really easy",
    "Professor Levchenko is a relatively good lecturer (considering the material is pretty dry). The course is well-structured, but the problem sets are very technical and lack any real-world application which would help with understanding.",
    "Wish we had more practice with problems that appeared on the final. Lots of questions were unconventional given the types of homework and practice problems we had",
    "Lectures were very straightforward and organized for the most part. Homework assignments were fair and aided the learning process immensely. Exams were also very fair. Lecture notes posted online were very helpul, though at times they were unclear and contained mistakes.",
    "Well structured Psets and tests. Textbook is amazing. Material presented well.",
    "Kinda early time and I don't like the lecture hall the class was held in as I could very rarely see the board, however the notes that were posted online was great. I also found grading to be harsh though the TA's and Professor were immensely helpful. The main challenge was mostly just difficult material in a condense course.",
    "This course could be good if it were taught well. Psets were not posted regularly, quality of instruction was not good, etc. I honestly did really well in the first half, then was very confused by the second half but didn't qualify for a tutor because my grade on paper was good. This was such a bad experience.",
    "A strength of this course is that it goes through all of the derivations of the equations, which are useful to know not only for this class, but also math classes in the future. Differential equations are very useful in the real world, and this class is very practical. This course could be improved if it covered more applications of the math, in engineering, physics, etc. Also, it would be helpful if more support were given such as practice problems.",
    "The material is very interesting, but it is presented in a weak manner. The lectures are very unstructured, i.e.you have no idea where the professor is going with his deduction until h is done with it, and most of the time you are not even assessed on it, making it superfluous and unhelpful for solving actual problems. The textbook however is quite amazing and putting the lecture notes online is very helpful. Also, the second midterm was way to close to the first one."

    "If you have the option to take the same course but taught by a different instructor (i.e. not Levchenko), please do. Avoid his teaching at all costs!",
    "Useful material that is essential for STEM majors, but otherwise don't take it.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in differential equations. You will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who likes math. I enjoyed learning the material in this class, especially seeing the connections between differential equations and their actual applications in physics (we didn't do much of this but it was interesting).",
    "No, take it unless you need it.",
    "If you're Engineering and many science-based majors, you need to take this class. If not, there are other classes that would probably be more engaging than this to take as an extra class.",
    "I would recommend this classes. It tied together a lot of concepts that I learned in physics and physics lab, and it was great to be able to understand how to analyze a lot of physical phenomenom and the activity of different systems. However, after the halfway point in the semester, the class went from 0 to 100 real fast and required a lot more time to do the problem sets and truly understand the more complicated concepts of the course, such as Fourier series and transforms and partial differential equations.",
    "No no no no no no no. You probably have to take it anyways. Be prepared to learn everything on your own and still do poorly.",
    "Yes! This class was taught extremely well by Levchenko. He goes very slowly and explains things very thoroughly. Last few weeks were a little confusing though. Final was so much harder than the practice final.",
    "My recommendation is unnecessary because the course is required for so many students - this is unfortunate because I'm not sure how much the instructors look to improve the class to meet students' needs. Levchenko allegedly made the course far more bearable compared to previous instructors, but students were still making the comments that they were virtually self-taught before the final.",
    "You can't avoid taking this course if you're an engineering major, and it's definitely a pain to take.",
    "Only if you really need to take it, and if you have a different professor.",
    "I would not recommend this class because I don't think it was taught very well. I didn't learn much from going to class, and I had to look up a lot of the material online in order to make sure I was prepared for homework assignments and tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a very practical course that teaches you problem-solving skills, and the usefulness of these skills in engineering and physics is readily apparent.",
    "You will probably have to take this class. But whatever you do DON'T take it with Levchenko, because you will end up teaching everything to yourself. But if you must, hopefully you will have good TAs that can help you with thousand questions you will have. This class made me question my major and everything related to math because this was the worst structured class I ever took at Yale. I do not exaggerate when I say I learned nothing in lecture. Literally NOTHING. The textbook is also not really helpful, but there are some good video lecture series online. But for the partial differential equations, you are all alone because that stuff is not even vaguely discussed in class. But also maybe hopefully, your professor will end up making up the classes he missed so that you get a chance to cover that material.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The material definitely gets more difficult as the semester progresses so I would recommend keeping up with the material and taking advantage for the first midterm. The course load isn't bad and the homework assignments aren't too time consuming. The second midterm and final are more difficult but still aren't terrible if you app up with the material.",
    "I would not recommend this course, or at least not during the 9 am slot where it is already difficult to focus on the material without it being very difficult concepts. This course was also extremely disorganized outside the classroom, with lecture notes that were difficult to follow and psets that were unrelated to the course. The TA was not helpful, and multiple lectures were sporadically cancelled or taught by a different professor.",
    "I do think you learn a lot and would recommend taking this class, though most people who do take it because it is required. Just be prepared for it to suddenly get much more difficult than it was previously.",
    "Definitely take it with Prof. Levchenko",
    "If you have to take this course, go for it. But if you like math and have the time you might as well take the full math course and have an interesting and less frustrating experience.",
    "You will mostly learn how to solve 2nd order linear differential equations (the kind you see in physics). But importantly, you will learn very little to nothing about partial differential equations (in the last couple weeks you have to memorize certain results). This course would be great preparation for physics at the PHYS 200\/201 level, but not at the PHYS 260\/261 level or higher.",
    "I wouldn't recommend unless you're willing to teach yourself because that's basically the only way you can learn in this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course",
    "If you're in the class, you probably have to take it for your major. I would not recommend it to anyone for which it is not required. You learn some useful skills, but many lectures are not engaging and hard to follow and most of the learning comes from the problem sets or following the posted notes.",
    "The ability to solve ODEs and PDEs is essential in many STEM fields, and as such I would recommend that most students in the sciences or in engineering strongly consider this course. Students looking for a rigorous mathematical treatment of the subject may be disappointed, however, as the course did not go into the theory of ODEs as much as I would have liked.",
    "How to solve differential equations, and basic concepts of the different ways to manipulate equations. Hard course, and unclear at many points about what we were doing and why. But overall, not an unreasonable course. You probably need to take it, so ya...",
    "As a non-engineer, I think this is class gives you a stronger foundation than Math 246. I had a great experience and would definitely recommend it.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "I'm not sure how this course differs from the Math Department course, but I do not think ENAS 194 was too difficult or demanding. There were not many applications to engineering or physics, so I imagine it is similar to the other class.",
    "AAA If you are looking for training in partial differential equation, please do not take this course. I would not strongly recommend this course. Professor Levchenko is a very diligent instructor, but is unfortunately not a very good lecturer. The morning lectures did not aid understanding of the content, nor were the problem sets very helpful. The exams were straightforwards, although the final was appropriately challenging.",
    "Yes. If you are reading this you most likely need to take this class for your major so my only advice is take it with Professor Levchenko. He's the best",
    "Only take this course if you have to. In the real world, you just do differential equations on a computer.",
    "Good class. Take it if you need it for your major.",
    "Yes, clear introduction to topics.",
    "You take this class if you have to and you might find things or perhaps just the idea of differential equations interesting at best, but this is not a casual class that I would ever recommend.",
    "No it was awful!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think it covers very practical information that is good to know for any STEM field. It also helps the student develop modes of thinking that help with learning. However, it does require a lot of work, particularly on the psets, then the exams are usually more straight forward.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if the time is not Tue-Thur at 9-10.15am. Let's be honest, with that time slot and with the lecture notes being posted online you will just never go to class. That is sustainable in the first half of the course, but the second half is much more complicated.",
    "This class was honestly pretty good for a STEM class. I'm personally very bad at math (relative to most Yalies, at least) so the class was challenging in a way that was sometimes very frustrating, especially when we moved into PDEs. There were so many PDEs on the final and I felt like I never really learned how to do them correctly. But overall not a terrible class."
