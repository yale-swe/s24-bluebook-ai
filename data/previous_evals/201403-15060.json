   "comments": [
    "It was an alright course. Not too much work, but not very engaging either.",
    "Insightful material, great readings, excellent professor and a manageable workload. You get what you put in. Very knowledgeable, passionate, and approachable professor. There could be more variation in the way each class is conducted.",
    "This was not a good class. I came in expecting to learn a lot about India and its economy, but rather left with a very hollow understanding. Classes felt disorganized and often like a lecture rather than a discussion. Furthermore, the focus on student presentations (as a huge part of the grade) made me feel like I was only hearing regurgitated information from economics papers. Professor Keniston, as a first time professor of the course, didn't seem completely in tune with all the material and it was evident during the course. I would be cautious about taking this course if I were another student. Professor Keniston is a great guy, but not necessarily the best professor for leading a discussion seminar such as this one. Classes felt disorganized and communication with Professor Keniston was sometimes a struggle.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class for a senior seminar. The workload is very manageable (~60 pages a week, that you can get by not doing; midterm paper; final paper; presentation on one of the readings). Professor Keniston, although a bit disorganized, is knowledgeable about the topic and always willing to meet to discuss the course. The class is also great because it discusses many of the current issues that India is facing today across a wide array of topics!",
    "An overview of India economics, starting from pretty much nothing. By the end you have a really nuanced view of how things are and why they are how they are.",
    "An extremely interesting topic but an unfortunately disappointing class. Keniston is not the best professor - he's nervous, doesn't always respond to emails, provided very little guidance on papers. The readings aren't as interesting as they could be, and discussions were dull. I'd take the class, but not with the same professor.",
    "Yes. Do the readings."
