   "comments": [
    "I hated this course. I hated the subject material. I hated the homework. I hate the room I took it in, because it is the room I took this course in. If you somehow imagine this course fitting into a larger intellectual framework you need to do other work at Yale, then maybe take it. But if you don't need this specific course. I wouldn't. But you do you.",
    "Take it for the QR and\/or philosophy major requirement. Do not take it for any other reason, because it has no independent interest whatsoever.",
    "This course is ok. I think it's main flaw is that we move far too slowly, the material is very easy, and so it's not very interesting. Even if I found logic interesting, we did such little logic in the class that I still probably wouldn't have enjoyed it too much.",
    "This is an interesting and not super hard QR for humanities people. But warning: it does get a LOT harder as the semester progresses, and even though getting good grades is easy, it may take more time than you're willing to give.",
    "First-order logic is a QR gut for people who don't need QR guts. I hear it can be difficult for some students, many of whom end up dropping the class, so try to think about whether that's you. If you don't plan on taking Mathematical Logic or other classes which require PHIL 115, I would suggest not taking this class, simply because learning the method without applying it would be unfulfilling.",
    "There is no reason not to take this class. You can't go wrong with FOL, since everybody starts from the beginning, unlike math or science classes. The content is relatively straightforward, and whenever you need help the TA and the professor are so helpful that I never experienced problems with this class during the semester.",
    "This is a general introduction to first order logic that is accessible to humanities majors. It is well taught and a good way to complete onerous QR requirements. One of the few QR's that will actually help one in humanities (especially philosophy) courses, FOL does much to improve one's thinking.",
    "Really interesting introduction to logic. It definitely changed the way I think. I would recommend it to anybody, but be advised that the weekly homework assignments can be time consuming.",
    "Do not take if you are looking for an easier QR. you are better off taking a real math\/Econ\/stat class. For a humanities major, the material is difficult to synthesize, understand, and requires LOTS of time on the side. Psets took hours and unless you go to every section, many office hours, every lecture, and read the book in depth, you will not be successful. Lecturer is boring, long winded, confusing, and not very helpful. Would not recommend this class.",
    "Don't take this class. It isn't interesting, practical or easy. But if that still sounds appealing, philosophy is probably the right major for you anyway.",
    "An easy course that introduces the language of logic. The class is well structured and the material is presented understandably. It's a good class to develop some logic skills.",
    "Good QR class. A lot of work, but well taught and manageable, and fairly straight forward to do well in if you put in the effort. Interesting as well. Feels like it might actually apply to life (a rarity).",
    "Want a QR credit? Take this class. Besides fractal geometry, this is probably the closest you will get to an easy distribution credit. The class goes over some of the basic notions logic used in building arguments. If you're a prospective philosophy major that has to take this class, this is actually a very helpful class to fully understand how some arguments in your philosophy classes were constructed. Not too difficult a class with very easy, sometimes entertaining problem sets in which you construct proofs and evaluate the truth value of certain statements. The one thing I should warn is that it requires you buy a rather quirky program and textbook called \"Language, Proof, and Logic.\" If you're thinking of getting it cheaper, don't bother. You need the software\/textbook set to be brand new in order to complete assignments. However, at only $70, it's at the lower end of the spectrum of total cost of books anyways.",
    "Definitely an interesting course, I learned a lot about arguments and using logic to solve those arguments. Great LSAT prep, but don't think that it's a gut. Definitely every bit as hard as any other QR.",
    "This class is pretty easy. It is probably the least mathy QR credit you can take. It's also not a lot of work and the professor gives us practice exams before the real tests so it is very clear what is expected of you. The only thing is that, while most people I talked to had a pretty easy time with the class, some students seem to have a really hard time grasping the concepts and it only got more difficult as time went on. If you find that you just don't grasp logic problems easily, I would probably drop the class, because it only gets harder with time. If you are doing fine during the first couple of weeks, then this is an easy QR credit and I recommend it. However, if you don't need the QR credit, the class can feel too easy and like a waste of time. It's also not really necessary for classes that list it as a prerec. So in that case, you probably shouldn't take it. The problems sets aren't too long but they can be tedious.",
    "A good introduction to logic. However, the workload does ramp up as the semester goes on."
