    "I loved this class! Comprehensive introduction to chemical engineering concepts, focused on similarities between concepts, which made it easier and more interesting to learn. Definitely level appropriate my for math, chemistry, and physics background - algebra manipulation skills are the most important thing you use in this class, you integrate some stuff at the very end but that's all the calculus youever use. Many people hated the textbook but I thought it was great, provided a lot of examples that were similar to the problem set questions and walked you through them step by step. Lectures were dry and confusing if you hadn't really grasped the chapter, but if you did you'd mostly understand what was going on. Professor Haller was okay, not terribly exciting but not an awful lecturer either. He's a really nice guy and was always available for questions about course material and for general advice about the chemical engineering major. Made fair exams and graded them fairly. There could have been better communication between him and the TF about due dates for things, make sure if you get an extension for something that it's actually okay. Make friends and study together. The class this year is WAY different from how it's been in past years, and I was really thankful for that. I feel like I learned things that will actually help me in my future chemical engineering classes.",
    "Only take this class if you want to be a chemical engineer.",
    "This is probably a requirement for most students looking to take CENG 210, but there are some interesting problem solving techniques and processes taught along the way. Some of the things you learn in this class come up in other classes too, which can be fun.",
    "Principles of Chemical Engineering and Process Modeling is a thorough and complete introduction to chemical engineering as a whole. We used a different text from previous years which focuses on complex processes of graphical analysis of multistage distillation flow, to dimensional analysis, and differential equations for multi step reaction mechanisms. Overall, I felt I left the course with a strong foundation in many of the subjects which will be turned into semester long courses. I think the strength of the class is Professor Haller's preparatory meetings and willingness to meet with students whenever there is a problem. On more than one occasion, I've asked him for help and he has always made time out of his busy schedule to meet and answer my questions privately.",
    "Recommend CENG 210 to complete your Chemical Engineering major requirement. If you are just thinking about the major you should also take it but it isn't entirely representative of what the major\/career looks like. I would recommend to also try some research to get a complete perspective.",
    "ChemE 210 is an introduction to chemical engineering. In theory, it should help you determine whether you want to pursue the major (in my case, it really didn't draw me in the way I hoped it would, so I don't know). The material itself isn't hard, but it is often not explained clearly, both in lecture and the textbook. Lecture was excruciatingly boring.Don't takeit unless you're thinking about being a ChemE.",
    "If you're interested in ChemE or EnvE, you really don't have a choice. However, I think this course is useful, doable, and overall a positive experience. Lectures will get boring though, so beware."
