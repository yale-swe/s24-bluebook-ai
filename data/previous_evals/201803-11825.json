   "comments": [
    "By taking this course, I developed my use of the Italian language in all facets, but primarily through my continued use of the language in a context where I could speak with my peers about a wonderful city, Naples.",
    "I learned about the history and culture of Naples as well as the Neapolitan dialect.",
    "Further developed all of my Italian skills. Learned the language in relation to Naples specifically.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of Naples and about the city today. Anna is a great teacher and she gave us very good sources. I have taken many Italian courses here, including advanced ones, and I really liked the readings Anna assigned. It was great taking this course also because Anna herself is from Naples and she always illustrates what we discuss with personal reflections. Anna asked us to complete weekly written homework of 8-10 sentences to write about a source we had to read, a movie we watched or a part of history of Naples that we discussed. I really appreciate that in the writings, Anna wants us to express our personal opinion about the sources.",
    "I gained an in-depth view of Naples' history and culture, aided by the readings, music, and movies we explored in class. I improved my Italian speaking, reading, and writing, and gained experience reading academic writing in Italian.",
    "I learned about the history of Naples and culture. My Italian speaking skills improved. I especially enjoyed units on superstitions and modern Naples.",
    "I learned so much about Naples! Lots of historical facts but also lots of information regarding contemporary culture.",
    "I improved my Italian writing skills and learned about the history of Naples. I learned a lot from this class about Naples. I would not say that this class is heavily focused on improving language skills.",
    "In this course I learned a lot about Neapolitan history, culture, and dialect. This class also gave me lots of exposure to reading Italian and speaking it in front of many people, as we gave a number of individual presentations throughout the semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the professor. Anna is very passionate about the course subject and loves her hometown of Naples. Weakness: the only thing I did not like is that there was a lot of students in the class (16) and for a language course, I would have liked to participate more and use the language more in a smaller class setting.",
    "This course was all around engaging. I think that sometimes there wasn't enough conversation between students that could force people to participate and speak in Italian.",
    "Anna Iacovella makes the entire course amazing.",
    "I really liked the course. I think there is no better person at Yale to teach this course about Naples than Anna, because she is from Naples and she knows its history very, very well. She is also very open to discussion and to answering any questions we have.",
    "Strengths: Anna is a wonderful, approachable, and incredibly knowledgeable teacher. The seminar style of the class allows for closer interaction between classmates. The assignments are reasonable. Weaknesses: The main readings--the two textbooks--are very dense and there is not much preparation for reading texts of their difficulty.",
    "The course was so interesting in learning about Italian in the context to the culture around the city of Naples. I got to practice my Italian writing and speaking skills while learning about the rich history of the city, and I learned so much about Naples. A weakness is how I wished we did a bit of grammar (maybe five minutes a class) so that I could continue to build that foundation.",
    "I really enjoyed all the video clips we watched. We also got to have mini cultural experiences, like preparing and trying out real Neapolitan coffee. I also thought the assignments were really balanced; we had a fair mix of presentations, papers, and readings.",
    "A strength of this course is that it forces students to interact with the content. A difficult piece of the course is that the texts are written at a high level that is extremely difficult to read."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students seeking to continue speaking Italian and learn about the wonderful city of Naples with an amazing Professor.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as a nice way to stay involved in Italian and learn about Naples!",
    "I would recommend any course Anna Iacovella teaches. She is very enthusiastic about teaching courses in Italian and about Italy. She also pays attention to the words students do not understand and makes sure to explain it in Italian. Everyone in class could ask her questions from the meaning of certain words to contemporary history of Naples. She answers all questions and encourages students to participate. Anna also had us present on different topics from the history of Naples. This was very helpful, because we got to look at a part of the history of Naples in more detail.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class for any student interested in gaining an in-depth perspective on an Italian city with a fascinating history, culture, and populace.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it was such an interesting course with a lot of flexibility for papers and presentations. I got to read various pieces of literature and learn about important people and traditions surrounding the city.",
    "Yes! A fun and engaging L5 class.",
    "Yes. Professor Iacovella is a great teacher.",
    "100%. If you're interested in learning about a completely unique Italian culture you will love this class. You not only get to learn about Napoli's rich history but also watch contemporary films, listen to songs, hear a little about the Camorra, and even learn some of the prominent features of the dialect. This class is not too challenging but there is homework due every class, though it is usually short and simple especially if you are interested and engaged with the class."
