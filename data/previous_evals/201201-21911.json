    "This class is excellent. Definitely take it! It was 14 students and two professors each time, and we discuss two papers. We talk about a common theme\/big picture each time, the experimental results, the methods, and major conclusions. The professors are very entertaining and pose questions that guide the discussion well. The class is pretty laidback. You really learn how to critically read papers; I became much more comfortable reading a scientific journal article at the end of the class. I also became more confident discussing science. The workload is not very heavy since you only have about 20 pages of reading each week (one long and one short paper). The final presentation\/paper were good in that they really needed you to use what you discussed and extend an experiment. Thinking of a good topic is the hard part, but the writing itself is not difficult (short paper). The professors are willing to give you feedback along the way!",
    "Methods& Logic was the best class I've ever taken! I'd definitely recommend it to all MB&B majors (and anyone else who can get it). You read and discuss 2 papers each week, and you get to really think like a scientist and dissect them. I feel like I've learned more from this class than any other class I've taken at Yale, and the professors are all amazing! Take this class!!",
    "Awesome class. Low workload and fantastic discussions. The professors are great. If you're a senior MB&B major you have no excuse to not take this class.",
    "YES. Brilliant class. Every MB&B major must take it. Every class you've been doing in the major is leading up to this kind of class where you actually read primary literature and understand the big discoveries in the field and where they came from.",
    "This is an excellent course, and one that every MB&B student should take. You will explore numerous concepts and be challenged to think creatively. The intimate nature of the course is invaluable and you will come away with a better understanding of science in general.",
    "Best MB&B class available. The professors led very insightful discussions and the papers were very carefully chosen. The format of the course is very interesting, as it allows for students to be independent thinkers as well as good team players.",
    "GREAT CLASS. BEST IN MB&B DEPT. TAKE IT!!!"
