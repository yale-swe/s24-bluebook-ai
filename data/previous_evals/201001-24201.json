    "I would recommend Digital Drawing only to non-art majors who are interested in the medium. Art majors usually have an idea of the course they want to pursue in such courses, and will have difficulty expressing their vision in the class as its currently structured. If a non-art major has a serious desire to work with digital media and the problems of vision associated with it, they would enjoy the course.",
    "do not take this unless sarah has revamped the course. you'll go in thinking its a fun course about digital drawing but its not. you'll be forced to do mind numbingly boring assignments with scanners, projectors and printers - basically the entire class was an exercise in \"how do i make something i like that sarah wont despise?\" which was very difficult. if you're not interested in sitting in on 4 hour printing tutorials, overly long crits about \"the loss of information.\" dont take this class. if you're into that and you like being told what to do and what is interesting, go ahead. this is the worst class ive taken at yale.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend the course if you're interested in 21st century art and where it's all going.",
    "fantastic, take any opportunity you can get to work with Sarah Oppenheimer.",
    "Digital Drawing is solely about using a facet of contemporary technology to drive a series of extremely abstract investigations. The class is primarily concerned with data loss, including scanning something until it disintegrates as an image, how to wrap light coming out of a projector, and the general loss of information from the concept to the viewer. This is not a technology class, though. You won\u0092t learn Photoshop or Final Cut or whatever. Sarah\u0092s a master of Rhino 3D and Maya, but there will be brief workshops, if anything. You\u0092re expected to find your technology interests and teach yourself on your own\u0097whichcould be a big deal.Sarah will also be away for the 10\/11 academic year.",
    "This class is a really great forum for you to explore independent ideas through digital technology. It is not intended as a software tutorial, however, soif you are simply interested in learning programs, this may not be the class for you. You will have the chance to work independently and learn a lot from your own ideas as well as those of your classmates."
