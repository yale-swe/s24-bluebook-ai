    "I would recommend Spanish 130 to a fellow student needing to fulfill the language requirement. The class functions quite similarly to a high school Spanish class, which can be a bit of a downside in a collegiate environment, but it's what you have to do to learn the language. If you can, take the class with Reymundi because she is an excellent teacher."
