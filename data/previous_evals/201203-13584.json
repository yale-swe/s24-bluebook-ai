    "The course was great in introducing a theoretical framework for unpacking development work that we've all encountered in various periods of our studies and work. The structure of the class was also helpful, with the first half as lecture and second as discussion, where discussion is led by students."

    "Everything :)The process I went through during the course of this semester!",
    "This course gives you a solid foundation in the literature that discusses conservation and development projects. Dr. Carpenter is excellent at explaining the material and the student led discussions (and sentences required every week) allowed students to try analyzing the materials themselves.",
    "The critical social theories were very valuable in confronting today's environmental and development challenges, especially in discerning false solutions.",
    "The readings and application of the concepts to the final paper.",
    "I appreciated that Professor Carpenter focused showing how Foucault's theories of power, discourse, governmentality, etc. inform contemporary analysis of development and conservation programs.",
    "Coverage from an anthropological perspective of many of the major problems with development. Really important perspectives-- reading in detail many important, foundational authors.",
    "The discussions.",
    "Class readings, lectures, and discussions helped me think critically about development and conservation projects. I now see these projects through a different lens and will be more critical and cautious when implementing projects in the future.I liked the format of the course, with readings being the foundation of class lecture and discussion, but also allowing class lecture and discussion to expand beyond the readings."

    "The literature focuses on Asia and Africa. I would have been interested in more literature on Latin America.",
    "Some of the readings are really poorly written--Mosse in particular. Most of the readings are very much chosen from Carole's perspective, and I would like to have a few more pieces for contrast. This course is about a certain perspective, and it's not that you can't have any other ideas, but they won't necessarily make any difference in class.",
    "I would have liked to see some more urban-related readings, especially given the growing amount of interest in urban environmental issues.",
    "Some of the readings were dense and difficult to get through. I think some of these readings could be substituted with more practical and applied readings. I particularly liked readings about specific projects, so it might be helpful to have more of these readings.While there are no projects that have not had some negative impacts, I would have liked to read about the positive impacts of some projects\/case studies and examine how those positive impacts were achieved, in order to help me envision what strategies can have some success in achieving positive social and environmental impacts."

Annotating is very helpful, and make sure you're actively reading; instead of focusing on the details, look for the major analytical arguments, the methods, and the way in which the findings relate to the theoretical framework that the author(s) set(s) up in the introduction.",
