    "Junior seminar is an introduction to critical theory that also makes connections to studio practice. There are weekly reading responses, one paper and presentation, and a peer-edited and revised draft of an artist statement. It is required for the major, but I would recommend it or maybe even Critical Theory in the Studio in your sophomore year if you'd like to look at some theory earlier on.",
    "It's art theory - post structuralism, modernism, death of the author, some color theory, some philosophy and psychology. Often deals with very abstract ideas, a lot of times the readings are hard to follow. It's required for art majors. If you don't have to take it, only take it if you're really interested in the topics.",
    "I guess it's required for all art majors, but I think if a non-art major was allowed to take it, it'd be a really interesting exposure to theory.",
    "It's required (as of right now), but it's also useful I think. Writing (and reading) about art and its related theories is an important part of being in a creative profession. It is also an important foundation to have in terms of advancing one's own work. Overall, the readings and writings you do are important, but discussions were as variable as any seminar and dependent on class makeup.",
    "I can't say this has been my absolute favourite course at Yale, but I can say that it offered some pretty important insights into creating art and understanding art (your own and that of others). I learned a fair amount that I hope to carry with me as I create more.",
    "It's a theory-heavy course intended for art majors, mostly juniors and seniors. I'd recommend this course to any art major who wants to build their academic knowledge of the subject and doesn't mind a lot of reading.",
    "These are texts one should be familiar with. It is easier than it neds to be and sometimes you'll want more out of it than you are getting."
