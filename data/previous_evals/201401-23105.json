    "No. Absolutely horrendous structure.",
    "Don't take the first half if you took MBB's Macro course - it's all redundantSecond half of the class is a nice summary of the pharmacological relevance of structural biology, which could be useful when thinking about future careers.",
    "I would say it is a very valuable course if you are planning on studying pharmacology.",
    "Good introduction to various techniques used in pharmaclogy and the current problems of interest.",
    "I would recommend it if they are interested in this subject or it is likely that their research will be related to the material, but otherwise I would not. I was not very satisfied with this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, but only for somebody very interested in this field. The material is somewhat dense and confusing, but if you enjoy it then it's a great course!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone looking for a practical understanding of pharmacology research. It overlaps greatly with the MBB course on Macromolecular Biophysics but the practical portion of crystallography was only covered in Pharm 529, making this course very useful."
