    "A pretty good introduction to ergodic theory, mixing, ergodic theorems, conjugacy, symbolic dynamics etc. I appreciate that Ilya worked a lot with examples, usually with the doubling map or rotations, but I would have preferred more theoretical results.",
    "I got a good overview of ergodic theory from the class and some of the important theorems as well as sufficiently many examples of probability measure preserving transformations to have some intuition for them."

    "Ilya is a reasonable, if not slightly awkward, professor who is pretty helpful in office hours. On the one hand, I think Ilya tried to make this course as accessible as possible; though measure theory is \"required,\" you didn't need it to take this, so that may be a strength. In my estimation, though, I feel as though Ilya should be a bit more forceful about it; I think the class was very slow at the beginning, partially because there seemed to be a lot of confusion about things you would learn in 320 (or even 305 for that matter). The problem sets were pretty fair and decently spaced, so not a problem. Overall, I think this course could be a bit more theoretical, and could also benefit from having a more canonical textbook, say like Walters. However, that's just my preference; others might find the course fine as is."

    "It depends on how interested you are in ergodic theory. It's pretty interesting in my opinion, but I was hoping for more theory than I think we ended up covering. Ilya is very helpful, so don't be put off by his lecturing style. The workload isn't bad at all, so that's also a plus. But again, I would absolutely encourage taking this after 305 or 320; I get that oftentimes the pre-reqs are unnecessary, but I find it hard to believe one can really understand a lot of these results without a very solid measure theory background. But like I said, it won't actively hurt you grading-wise."
