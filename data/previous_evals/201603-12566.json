   "comments": [
    "Close reading, thinking about ways of knowing, seventeenth century texts I had never approached before, which were all fabulous - a great syllabus!",
    "I feel very intrigued by the 17th century! I did not know how much I liked it until now. Getting such a broad look at all these writers was wonderful and helpful.",
    "This course helped me to think about 17th century as not just an isolated period, but responding to and constructing different modes of thinking -- stemming from religion, science, and philosophy -- that reached across different time periods and cultures. This course was challenging in the best of ways.",
    "I had only read a few of the authors on the syllabus prior to taking this course, so I gained familiarity with a wide range of authors and types of texts that I would not otherwise have read. Many of the texts I would not have naturally gravitated towards actually turned out to be the most exciting readings for me -- it seems I actually do occasionally care about the \"New World\" and about religious concerns! This discovery will be quite helpful to me as I move forward and try to tease out exactly what central intellectual questions will motivate my work.",
    "I was not particularly familiar with 17th-century literature before taking this course; it provided what seemed to me to be an excellent overview of the period, including the study of a few more unusual writers or texts.",
    "This course was simply excellent. I learned to read the literature of the period with a critical eye, and the course offered an insightful and comprehensive overview of both seventeenth-century writing and its scholarship. We covered a different author every week, but I found that despite the brevity of time devoted to each one, I still came away from classes with a strong grasp of his\/her work, perspective, milieu, and political\/social\/religious concerns.",
    "I developed a solid understanding of the various intellectual and literary currents that shaped English literature in the 17th century. I also worked on my oral presentation skills, and on working with secondary sources.",
    "This course opened an entirely new body of literary works for me. Never before had I specifically studied 17th C Literature and there was a way in which the ideas being explored then felt very relevant and important for today. I was reminded that an examination of the past is often the best method to illuminate the future. I also became a much stronger thinker, writer and communicator throughout this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses - a GREAT discussion space.",
    "The texts were so interesting! I thought the two-presentations mode worked really well, and enjoyed hearing from all of my classmates. I thought the workload was manageable without being easy. The secondary texts were very well paired with the texts and helped me find in-roads into some of the works I was struggling with.",
    "I especially enjoyed the class presentations, and thought that they were a very useful way of sparking discussion and also gave us the opportunity to engage with the texts in a more meaningful and in-depth way. I also thought that discussions were the major strength of this course. Professor Rogers was great about facilitating discussion, and making sure that the atmosphere was friendly, productive, and encouraging. This was a really great class.",
    "This course foregrounded both specific authors and considered how the concerns of diverse writers engage with one another across texts and genres. I thought there was an ideal balance of primary and secondary sources among the readings, and the presentation aspect of class was extremely useful for working through both types of readings. I found that the presentations I delivered helped me think much more deeply about the text(s) in question, and that other students' presentations genuinely offered exciting new perspectives and analyses.",
    "The dual presentation format that John established for each class was very helpful in terms of guiding class discussion and providing students who were not presenting with more in-depth perspectives on a text. John's willingness to follow different avenues brought up by students during class often resulted in unexpected, but fascinating looks at different parts of the text. As someone newer to the 17th C, I might have benefited from a slightly more in-depth introduction to the period in the first session of class, though I certainly acquired this contextual knowledge gradually as we moved through the semester.",
    "I can't think of anything I'd change about the course. We were given ample time to prepare for presentations as well as final papers, and always had as much support as we needed. I also very much appreciated the sessions at the end of term where students were given the opportunity to receive feedback on their work and give feedback on their peers'. I think perhaps the greatest strength of the course is how quickly yet thoroughly and insightfully it manages to cover a wide expanse of texts and authors; it's very efficient, and at the same time it really nurtures the students' interest in the material. The result for me was a strong impression of the concerns, interests, and anxieties governing the period, as well-rounded as I could possibly have hoped for from an overview course of this nature.",
    "Sometimes too much of the class was spent on presentations, which sometimes prevented us from close engagement with the text. Maybe presentations could be encouraged to have a certain \"proof\"-like quality: that is, that they must support the claims they make, or that secondary sources make, by demonstrating how their arguments work.",
    "Strengths: I found the class presentations to be beneficial both for the individual giving the presentation and for the class receiving the information. None of my other classes incorporated that type of assignment and I thoroughly enjoyed and grew from this experience. I also thought the paper workshop classes were immensely helpful for the entire class. I wish this had been a component of my other courses this term."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes - John Rogers is wonderful!",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, definitely take this course -- it's not just a great introduction and in-depth exploration of the 17th century, but it also helps you think about big picture\/universal concepts ranging from feminism to spiritual epistemology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It seemed to me that it worked well both for students with extensive background in this discipline\/historical period and those with less training in this particular sub-area. The wide sampling of texts speaks to a variety of interests (sacred\/secular, dramatic\/lyric\/prose) which means that there will be weeks that excite right off the bat and weeks that slowly reveal themselves to be exciting in the ways they connect to the other texts that more obviously speak to each student.",
    "I would recommend this course to both newcomers to the period and students who already have more expertise; I believe it would reward both kinds of students.",
    "Yes",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course! I can't imagine a better introduction to and overview of seventeenth-century writing, and I think participants can expect to come away with a comprehensive grasp of 17c texts even if they've never studied anything from the period before. The course covers a different author each week, so naturally it moves at a rapid pace, but Professor Rogers makes each session both exciting and very insightful. Those who don't focus on the period were made to feel just as welcome as those who do, and I always felt that the input of each and every student was highly valued.",
    "Absolutely. It covers material that is not offered elsewhere.",
    "I have already recommended this course to my fellow students. It is a wonderful and exciting course due to the material and the instructor. Perfect combination of passion, growth, and development. The classroom environment was dynamic, welcoming and constantly forced students to stretch outside of their comfort zone."
