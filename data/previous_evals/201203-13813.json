   "comments": [
    "Summary: COOL. For example, after Sandy he walks into class and says, \"Who wants to hear hurricane stories?\" Also, guest lecturers were a big part of the class. He's AMAZING",
    "I would undoubtedly recommend this class. It's a special opportunity you wont come across ever again.",
    "very little work -- but the class is not about the work. it's about the seminars, who you meet, what you do, and what you take away",
    "Extended Master's Tea.",
    "Yes, great seminar.",
    "If you want to listen to the Chief and other members of the NHPD talk about policing, then this is the course for you. If you want significant time to discuss, choose a different seminar. Class was trying at times - the Chief likes to talk and can get a little repetitive - but I got a lot out of it that I don't think I would have gotten anywhere else. You also get fantastic access - to the Chief, to his officers and staff, and to opportunities to go on \"ride-alongs\" for 4 or 8 hours with regular NHPD beat cops. If nothing else, just shop the first class: he gives a fantastic speech on public service and America's urban problems that everyone should hear.The workload is very light: two 1-page responses and two papers with a total of ~12 pages. Reading is relatively optional because there's so little discussion and the Chief is prone to stray off topic.",
    "This is a hard question to answer. The class was not really a class in the traditional sense, and definitely not a seminar. Chief Esserman treated us extremely well, was cordial, gave us his number, etc etc. But he never knew our names (often referring to us by our numbers on his class roster) and in general just very clearly did not have enough time to be a professor. This was much more of an extended master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tea, with very little topic variation class to class. As we got into the middle of the semester, he started dragging assistant chiefs and other officers into class with us (sometimes he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there) so that they could \u00e2\u0080\u009ctell their story.\u00e2\u0080\u009dI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t begrudge him any of this. He has an extremely important, taxing, and obviously time consuming full time job, and that is keeping our city safe- and I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have it any other way. And I certainly learned things from the class- saw the inside of a police department, I got to meet and interact with one of the most progressive and brilliant police chiefs in America. But by Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards, this class really shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist, and he is not a professor.We had very little work: two short essays (assigned with no warning and also with no hard due dates) and two reflections, one on a ride along that we had to go on, and one after we attended a CompStat meeting at the NHPD hq. We also had weekly reading, but this reading was maybe mentioned once all semester. There wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even a reason to take notes- I found that my time could best be spent only listening to the often amazing stories that we heard from the officers that showed up in that room. But that shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen under the auspices of being a class at Yale.",
    "Having entered the course with very little knowledge of how police departments operate, I learned a lot from Chief Esserman. That said, this course would've functioned much better as a lecture -- we had very few opportunities for discussion and the class was more like a series of master's teas than a college seminar. Because we didn't engage in discussion, there was little incentive to do the readings, and they typically didn't align with what we ultimately ended up talking about. In sum, while I appreciated being taught from someone so experienced and outside the sphere of academia, this course needs re-working. Take it if the course format changes or if you're prepared for, again, a series of master's teas led by the very charismatic and intelligent chief of the NHPD.",
    "I would recommend the class, it's a great insight into the NHPD. But I wouldn't take it for an easy grade as none of us received any of our papers back.",
    "I would not recommend this class. If you're interested in the chief, ask your master to host a Tea with him and ask him all the questions you want \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he'll be happy to answer. But there are so many better ways you can use a credit at Yale.",
    "Probably. Well, yes. The Chief is a brilliant, caring, supportive professor, and I'm glad I took this class. There's nothing else like it and it totally changed how I see urban policing. However, it's one of those classes that you leave thinking \"Wow, this had so much untapped potential, it was an ok class and I wish it had been great!. You'll hear from a lot of great guest speakers, and a lot of the chief's philosophy, though you won't have to do much critical thinking on your own, which is a shame. Also, not a whole lot of work (I wish there was more!). But basically a solid class, which will hopefully be much better next year.",
    "Policing in America is more like Introduction to New Haven Police Department--Chief Esserman brings in a variety of different officers from different parts of the city and the department. In class, these guest speakers tell their life stories and through it we learn about the complicated relationship between the police and its respective community, and along the way, between Yale and the police. I would HIGHLY recommend it for anyone interested in getting to know a police department--Chief Esserman grants all students an all-access pass into the department to do with what you will. The technical and academic aspects of policing are learned in doing the 1-2 required papers, but the in-class experience is why you should take this course: unparalleled access into the New Haven Police Department.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but be aware that it's less \"academic\" than most classes at Yale, and it generally consists of two hours of Chief Esserman and guest speakers talking about their lives and their police work. However, the class will give an insider's look into policing that you probably wouldn't get to see on your own. The ride along was a particularly eye-opening experience. We had a guest speaker or two for most of our classes, who would often speak about private details of cases they've worked on. The workload includes weekly readings (which weren't really touched upon in class) as well as 2 papers and short responses on a police ride along and police Compstat meeting. I'm not exactly sure how we'll be graded, but it's definitely a worthwhile experience!"
