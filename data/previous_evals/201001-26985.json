   "comments": [
    "If you need a language credit, and are good enough at Hebrew, don't turn this class down! It is very interesting, not a great deal of work and Shiri is fantastic!",
    "Definitely take this class-- it's a fun way of learning hebrew, you will learn a lot about Israeli history and culture, it's not too stressful. Watching the films felt more like a break than like assignments. And the writing work was very good for my Hebrew writing and vocabulary, so I liked doing those too.Highly recommend.",
    "The class was very good. Shiri is amazing - knowledge-wise, and niceness-wise.A lot of great movies, though you might not like a few.If you put in the effort, the class won't be hard. But the more work you put in, the more you gain from it.",
    "It was a good way to keep up my Hebrew, and get a better sense of Israeli culture. I didn't realize I couldn't write in Hebrew until I took this course, and I think that improved a lot. Shiri is a lot of fun as a professor.",
    "This class is sort of a tour of Israeli cinema in film, conducted in Hebrew. The movies we watched were great, and Shiri is awesome. This was my first L5 Hebrew class, and I enjoyed it, although it was difficult for me. Be prepared for a fair bit of writing, but no reading. Take it, but also be prepared for the fact that since it's at a high level, everyone speaks well, and if you're like me and still struggling a bit you have to jump right in there to make yourself be heard",
    "Yes! Really fun selection of films, captures Israeli society from so many angles. Improves your Hebrew, too, through discussion, written responses, and listening comprehension. Also teaches how to analyze film.",
    "I would definitely recommend Modern Hebrew 158 to another student as long as he\/she is comfortable talking and writing in Hebrew. You watch a film and write a short response paper each week and have a vocab\/spelling quiz every other week. The movies are good for the most part, though they tend to be depressing."
