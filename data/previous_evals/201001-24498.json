   "comments": [
    "EP&E 223 is a fantastic class that's extremely dependent on the type of people that take the class with you (I so happened to be in a fantastic group of 7, and the class was extremely fun because of it). Justin Fox is at his best when he can treat himself like another participant in the course and talk when he has something interesting to say rather than having to lecture for extended periods of time. The class is less a survey of broad issues in Formal Modeling and more an extended case study of a bunch of different but somewhat disconnected topics, but it does what it does very well. The workload is extremely manageable and Professor Fox is extremely friendly. Recommend heavily, but get a read of the other people in class during the first session.",
    "This is a good course for those interested in rational approaches to poli sci. I took this course silmuntaneously with Classics of EPE with Kapustin and they were perfect complements (and complete opposites) of each other.The Professor does nothing to lead the discussion, so your enjoyment of the course will depend entirely on which students you get stuck with. I was pretty lucky to get a couple that were very interesting, but there were also some not-so-interesting ones that sadly tended to dominate the discussion. Thus, the course was split between interesting and dreadfully boring.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student, not just to those in EPE. The professor is great. The discussions are great. The material is, you guessed it, great. You will walk away from this course understanding our political institutions at such a higher level than you did when you entered. You will also understand how to use and understand game theoretic models. You will also learn how to analyze empirical data. Most of all, you will understand how to evaluate academic scholarship. Take this course.",
    "I would recommend this to any student who wants a thorough introduction to game theory and also a broad sense of how game theory is employed in academic papers (and in modeling various phenomena).",
    "An excellent course! It was really great, no kidding. Professor Fox has created a really relaxed but very rewarding course structure here, with the (somewhat optional--just make sure you get the point) weekly readings and response papers, and a low-pressure final paper (that I actually enjoyed writing!). The material is ALWAYS at least somewhat (if not quite) interesting, Fox has really found some great papers and material for the students to read and discuss. Also, Fox is an extremely chill professor, and great at directing discussion (with minimal direct interference) and excellent at explaining the game-theory concepts (often much better than the books or papers did)."
