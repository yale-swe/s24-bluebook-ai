    "this was a fascinating study of non-homeric ancient poetry, and i guarantee it will contribute to your understanding of other texts. the linguistic notes will also prove helpful in grounding your greek grammar.",
    "A good course to further practice your Greek-reading skills \u0096 the emphasis is on reading and understanding the text and some of the issues it presents. While Hesiod doesn\u0092t have the name recognition of Homer, he too has a great influence on classical literature. As a senior preparing for the Greek comprehensive, I found that once I knew Hesiod, I saw his influence everywhere. Since his poetry makes up the bulk of the course, I\u0092d definitely recommend this on that account \u0096 he\u0092s a good poet to know. Professor Bakker takes you through the text well and also teaches some historical linguistics, and the workload is entirely reasonable.",
    "Definitely! Hesiod is incredibly interesting and the wisdom poetry is really accessible and fun!",
    "The material is really interesting, and it is a surprisingly light workload. Professor Bakker is very knowledgeable.",
    "Yes, if they enjoy ancient Greek poetry."
