   "comments": [
    "Great class - if you want to use quantitative skills but not make a life out of it, take it.",
    "An excellent introduction into quantitative analysis for those with or without strong quantitative background.",
    "Great crash course in quant methods. Will leave you wanting more math. Seriously!",
    "This is a crash course on applied statistics and the underlying calculus. I think this class is very useful for a certain spectrum of IR students but it is not for everyone. That has nothing to do with Lloyd and more to do with the professional and academic trajectories of his students.",
    "I would recommend this course to every student. You learn a great deal of very useful, practical skills that can be applied to any career.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you plan on entering the policy world - it provides useful and marketable skills (STATA).",
    "This class is great if you want to brush up on your math skills and you need to learn STATA. I was one of two (I think) people who took this course without being required to do so, and I don't regret it",
    "Absolutely. The skills one learns in this course are essential to both descriptive and inferential quantitative analysis, and Lloyd does such a good job of teaching it. I have already recommended him and the course to many fellow students.",
    "Maintain as core curriculum for IR students.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to every student of the social sciences. It is so important to get hard skills, and with his class, you'll learn the hard skills and be reminded of how they're important with examples and applied uses that you're actually passionate about.The calculus, which would typically make advanced STATA inaccessible, is digestible and introduced by such a fantastic teacher, you'll actually be looking forward to this class. The consistency and impeccable organization of the syllabus keeps a consistency that makes learning the calculus and code so much more digestible and less intimidating.",
    "INRL 771 spends the first half of the course providing instruction in calculus principles, and it spends the second half of the course providing instruction in statistics and the use of a stats program called Stata. It's a foundation course that is critical for further study in quantitative concepts or for a career in policy-making. I would whole-heartedly recommend this course. (Just be sure to allocate yourself an entire weekend to do problem set 10!)",
    "Recommended for anyone who wants to learn how to read critically academic articles that involve regressions or other forms of statistical analysis. Even if you haven't done stats before.",
    "Yes, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to all seeking a good foundation in calculus and statistics.",
    "Brilliant class - this is a class that will teach you about applied statistics in an interesting and stimulating way. No prior knowledge is assumed. The class starts from the beginning but goes at a swift pace. Applied examples from demography and international relations are used. The teacher is brilliant.",
    "I'd recommend it only if they were interested in academia or think-tank work afterward. It's a marketable skill to have, the info in this course, but it's a lot of work for someone who may never use it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a fun math\/quant course, even for those who don't like those types of subjects. It also gives someone with a social science degree real-world skills that can be put on your resume and applied the workplace.",
    "Would avsolutely recommend it for a fellow student.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. I learned so much and now can use STATA and understand academic journals which utilize the program. Lloyd is a fantastic instructor.",
    "Absolutely."

   "comments": [
    "It gives me the tools to measure the world. That's key.",
    "Enable me to better consumer quantitative aspects of research.",
    "This course is unrelated to my personal academic interests, although it is a prerequisite. If it had not been a prereq I would not have taken it. I do not anticipate using this material again.",
    "This course rekindled my interest in calculus and statistics, and helped change the direction of my chosen future career.",
    "Yes - it refreshed my knowledge of calculus and introduced me to an entirely new skill set.",
    "I need to be able to use Stata for my master's thesis, so this course was very helpful.",
    "I am interested in international political economy. This course will help me with the applied skills needed for the kind of work I hope to do. It was also a great way to refresh calculus and stats concepts I had learned before.",
    "This class will strengthen my research, as I know have the power to utilize the vast potential of data sets with STATA. I have an unexpectedly deep knowledge of STATA, a software I had not heard but am not excited to apply to every research project I can.",
    "Quantitative reasoning has become an important tool for policy makers today, and this course provided an important foundation for that. This is a key development course for future policy makers.",
    "I am now able to use Stata so if I ever need to do quantitative analysis, I'll know where to start - and where to go for advice!",
    "This course really helped me understand a key element of my discipline and is inspiring me to take further statistics courses.",
    "Opened up a whole new quantitative area for me. Very useful - I want to pursue this area more in subsequent courses. I would not have taken this class if it had not been compulsory so I'm very happy it was compulsory!",
    "I can evaluate studies and data now, more so than ever before. I also critically examine information more than taking it for face value.",
    "As a quantitative course, it's creates a good and also relevant balance to the more reading-heavy IR courses.",
    "Got me extremely interested in this realm of research and using quantitative methods to analyze data. Led me to pursue a number of different career paths related to this field which I found incredible.",
    "The course allowed me to understand quantitative aspects and how linear regression works. Now I feel somewhat comfortable being an educated consumer of academic articles which utilize STATA.The calculus part which comprised the first part of class and the second part comprising STATA came together really well as the class progressed.",
    "I feel much more comfortable interacting with analysis and critically reviewing research and conclusions.",
    "ESSENTIAL. Already, having a background in STATA is opening a world of academic and professional doors. Thank you."
