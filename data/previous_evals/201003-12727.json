    "Turkish is a very interesting language and this is an okay setting to learn it. Generally speaking, the course seemed a little bit chaotic\/unstructured at times, but I found it added a nice sense of relax-ness to the process. Often it is difficult to gauge your progress\/work and often vocabulary isn't specifically covered in class and you need to pick it up from the book. I am generally not that good at languages but I still enjoyed the course.Also, Professor Erol is a funny, very nice, and helpful guy.",
    "There's no reason to take this class unless you want to learn Turkish, obviously, and if you do it's the only class you can take. It's a beginning language class like most others: you learn grammar in successive chapters of a textbook, and vocabulary expands as you move through the book.Professor Erol is very funny and personable, and also (though he doesn't always make it obvious) quite smart; getting him started on long tangents about Turkish culture, politics, or (especially) cuisine is one of the major joys of the class. He doesn't assign much work and is an easy grader.As for the language itself, Turkish is very different from most other languages: its grammar is agglutinative and involves vowel harmony. However, the unfamiliar grammar is pretty intuitive, simple, and totally consistent, so it's not difficult to get used to. For me the most difficult part was the vocabulary, which doesn't have many cognates in English. (If you're familiar with Persian or Arabic, though, you'll have fun spotting the shared words.)",
    "It's a great intro language class - well taught, not stressful at all and a fantastic way to explore a new subject."
