    "I'm sure that if you do 485 you will spend more than 10 hours a week in lab, so you might as well do 495 (although I think I went well over 20 hours every single week of term). Non-research requirements are pretty easy: 2 page project summary due the first week of classes, 5-10 page mock grant due the last week of classes, 10 min oral presentation, and you have to go to 3 presentation sessions of your peers (which was actually pretty cool). If you like research you should obviously do 495. Highly satisfying.",
    "Good course, I would recommend it, but it all depends on your lab really and you really have to enjoy it to be in there 20+ hours a week. I'd recommend spending at least a summer in the lab before committing to this. Differences between this and MCDB 485: your grant proposal is 5-10 pages instead of ~5 pages, you present both semesters instead of just one. And 2x hours in lab obviously.",
    "There isn't a good evaluation for this course because it's very dependent on your PI. Choose your PI wisely!!!",
    "If you're doing MCDB 485, you honestly might as well do 495. It's twice as much class credit for like 5 extra hours a week in the lab. Beyond that, the two classes have identical requirements...You'd be a fool not to take up that deal.",
    "Take initiative in the class. Talk to your PI\/research mentors for guidance in the assignments well ahead of the deadline. There was little-to-no interaction with the course instructors. There should have been an emailed template\/guideline for how to create a formal proposal, PPT presentation\/speech, and mock grant well ahead of the deadlines (not a last-minute email two days before the deadline with a brief one-sentence list of paper sections). Feedback from the PPT presentations and turned in assignments would have been helpful for improvement. Many of my peers were left clueless on how to write the mock proposal days before the deadline.",
    "Take this course if you have been working in the lab for a while, you know the chemistry is great and you have a project in mind. You will have to write papers and present your work, but if you have already been working in the lab that should be something that you're already used to.",
    "I'd recommend taking this class instead of MCDB 485 if you are really interested in research and especially if you already have been working in a lab. Putting in 20+ hours a week allows you to accomplish a lot more during the school year.",
    "You get to have more time to do your research. That is good.",
    "20 hours of lab work a week seems like a lot but I felt that it was far less stressful than taking two separate classes and having that solid chunk of time really helps get things done.",
    "This allows you to conduct research for at least 20 hours a week, which is great if you want to dig into the research. You must attend three presentation sessions and write a grant proposal at the end of the semester."
