   "comments": [
    "Excellent lectures. Professor Frank is an amazing professor with the rare ability to get students to understand difficult concepts. The lectures were very interesting and Frank is a great speaker (and funny too). Many interesting ideas covered in this class. I took this class as a CS major with no linguistics background and still ended up learning a lot. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Take this course if you enjoyed Language and Computation I (LING227). I know some seniors who took LCII without the pre-requisite, and they also enjoyed the course. The programming assignments weren't too difficult and Bob Frank is a knowledgeable and entertaining lecturer. Also, do the readings. They're fun.",
    "Under Aspnes as DUS I was able to get both a CS credit and a SO distribution requirement, so in that sense this course was a great move. But I barely went to lecture because they were kind of slow paced and uninteresting, which lead to a lot of stress and cramming for psets and quizzes. Psets and quizzes were well designed, and just having solid lecture notes posted would make this a perfect class to never go to lecture for. But if you're more interested in social sciences (Not me at all) or linguistics you'll probably be more into it.",
    "There's more math than you might expect, although you can get away with not fully understanding the basis of the models we discuss.",
    "A wonderful course that further examines techniques commonly used in computational linguistics. You learn about dependency parsing, machine translation, compositional semantics, and more! You get to implement your own programs for each of the main topics, which really helps solidify the material from class. Professor Frank is such an intelligent and engaging professor, too. Take this class - it's well worth your time!",
    "Yes, take this course if you are interesting in nlp, computational linguistics, and semantics. The psets are very laid back, and so is the class in general.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in getting in-depth with NLP. The scheduling and pset grading can be a little slow and disorganized, but this was also the first year it was taught (so I'm sure it'll get better). Bob Frank is a great lecturer and he teaches the material really well.",
    "'Twas an excellent course! If you want to continue building on Language and Computation I to learn more about where the field of NLP is today, I highly recommend it. Bob is one of my all-time favorite teachers, so even if you can't take this course I recommend that you take some course with him before you graduate. My one big complaint about the course was the timing of the work--we had very little work at the start of the semester, then at the end of the semester we had a quiz, pset, and final project all crammed in, at a time when there was also a lot of work for other classes, so I would've preferred if this had been more spread out.",
    "I was excited about this class, but it ended up being disappointing. The class was a weird mix of too specific and too general--we spent lots of time in lecture trying to work out confusing math, but then we also never really made systems that worked well. If the curriculum is redesigned, then take it. Otherwise, you might be better off taking something else.",
    "If you enjoyed the material in Language and Computation I, this class is well worth taking. Lectures are good, and you'll get a solid background in some core NLP topics like text classification, parsing, and machine translation.",
    "I absolutely would not recommend the class. It's format did not encourage me to truely learn the material.",
    "Take it! Bob is great, the material is interesting, and the workload is really manageable. One of my favorite Computer Science electives at Yale.",
    "This is a decent course covering natural language processing topics like parsing and translation. I found the lectures a little dry and was hoping for more coverage of cutting-edge techniques, but overall it provides a good foundation. And the workload is fairly light.",
    "Good survey of computational linguistics. The problem sets could have been a little more interesting and the class a little more structured, but these issues are understandable for the first time a class is offered.",
    "This course, compared with LING227, is a survey of the newer techniques for the Natural Language Processing tasks including text classification, parsing and machine translation\/bitext alignment. The last week of class was on computational semantics. There were three in-class quizzes, three programming assignments in Python and an open-ended project. Professor Frank is a great lecturer, but he often does things in a last-minute manner. I would recommend this course if you found LING 227 interesting.",
    "Though this was only the first iteration of the course, it worked great as not too work intensive CS elective. I didn't take the pre requisite course but found the material and psets accessible, though some included so much hand-holding that it was heard to tell if it had much to do with my own progress. I am sure the course will only get better with time, as Professor Frank as a wonderful professor: supportive, funny, and really knowledgable both about CS and linguistics. Lectures at times could be a little bit dry.",
    "Take this course if you liked the first one at all, but keep in mind that it tends to be even more focused on the computational side things (after all, most modern statistical approaches to language problems are less informed by linguistics than they are by stats). Bob Frank is a great professor, who is energetic and really cares about students. You wont regret taking a class with him. Sometimes the course could be *slightly* disorganized, leading things to get a little backloaded, but this is probably mostly because it was the first time it was run and all as a result of Prof. Franks tendency to be kind with extensions. Bottom line: this is not an easy course, but it is interesting, and you will probably sharpen some valuable skills. Plus, Prof. Frank is a great professor and the course is fun. Take it!",
    "CS major here: Solid course. Medium to easy in difficulty. Only 3 simple, straightforward problem sets and a few quizzes. Should probably do practice problems for the quiz to prepare, but they weren't too bad even if you don't. I took Lang Comp 1, but many people didn't; it definitely wasn't necessary though I definitely think it minimized the work you had to put in as the class reviewed a lot of material from Lang Comp 1. Bob Frank is great. Final project is what you make of it, and you can work in groups. Would recommend. Also counts as a CS elective.",
    "Good course. Professor Frank is fantastic and I enjoyed his sense of humor. I am not sure if this course will be offered any more, but I recommend that anyone who is interested in NLP, computational linguistics, or machine learning take this course. I did not take Language and Computation I, but there did not seem to be a problem!",
    "What a good class. If you're interested in computational linguistics, take it. If you're not, I'm not sure why you're reading this review but I'll go ahead and recommend the class to you anyway.",
    "Most people who take this class are CS majors who need a Social Science credit. As a course, it has the beginnings of being great, but it's not quite there. The concepts of natural language processing are very relevant to students who might be interested in AI, and we were briefly exposed to various statistical methods in the course. As someone who didn't have any background in stats or linguistics, I was worried at first about keeping up, but then realized we didn't go into enough depth that it really mattered if you have the background or not. There wasn't enough reinforcement of material in the course. Homeworks and quizzes seemed to be prepared for us at the last minute and we didn't have enough practice to fully absorb the material from lecture. The lecture slides lack detail at points and don't explain things very well. The textbooks are good, but I usually didn't have enough time to dig through them to make up for spotty lecture slides. On the upside, professor Bob Frank is very enthusiastic and helpful. Speaking to him at office hours is both educational and delightful."
