    "I would not recommend this class to another student. Though you're pretty much guaranteed an A if you show up, participate in critique, and turn in projects, if you're looking for a class that will seriously develop your portfolio, teach you about technology, or even learn how to provide meaningful critique, you might investigate another 100-level art course.I'm an artist, but not really an art person, if that makes any sense, so much of the play and experimentation was tortuous to me.",
    "Yes!",
    "Creative ways of looking at visual solutions to a prompt by experimentation, variation, thought process AND, importantly, accident.",
    "Art majors have to take the course. For non-art majors, I would go with an introduction course in one medium so it is not as general.",
    "A broad overview of visual art media, with a focus on conceptual principals of art.",
    "Visual thinking is a fun art class where you do some cool projects (computer-manipulating an image, making a 3 dimensional sculpture based on another student's 2D drawings of a sculpture in the YUAG, making a video about \"light and shadow\", making a horror movie, and making a sculpture of flowers that subverts their \"flowerness\"). Many (though not all) of the projects involved collaboration. You're encouraged to do a lot of experimentation. That being said, I think you should only take it if you are an Art major (and thus need the prereq).",
    "Visual Thinking is a very good intro art course. It exposes you to a variety of media and also Yale art buildings if you haven't visited them before (Green, YUAG, the DMCA, and for our class, the grad students' studios). It's rather free-form and experimental, and while the projects do tie together and can built upon each other, it can seem like there's not a unifying point to the course. It's not trying to have one, either, so that's fine. Anna's a great teacher. I don't know what the other one(s) is\/are like, but she's definitely worth taking it with.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to a non-major looking for an art course, but it's necessary for art majors, so I guess you've no choice.",
    "Great Class - lot's of experimental photography, film, and photoshopping. The midterm was real fun: a group horror movie 4 minutes long. The final changes every year to whatever the class votes on. DEFINITELY take it with Anna Betbeze!"
