    "Most benefit from guest lectures.",
    "I didn't learn much new material in this course. Most of it was a repeat of epi I and II, except presented in a far less coherent manner.",
    "informative",
    "This course is required for EHS students but did not teach any information that wasn't taught in Epi 1, Epi 2, and exposure assessment. THe entire course was a review of epi concepts previously learned with a focus on environmental stressors that are all covered in exposure assessment. This course adds nothing to the EHS student's learning experience.",
    "This course is a waste of time for all EHS students and for any student that has taken epi with Dr. Dubrow and assessing environmental stressors with Dr. Leaderer.This course covers material that we are all comfortable with but does so in an unorganized and confusing manner. The material is poorly taught, the presentations are unprofessional (full of typos) and difficult to follow (most lack complete sentences). The professor's assignments lack any real direction, for example homework consist of reading a paper and writing a one page response to the question \"do you agree?\".I think that this course is unfortunately below the standards of YSPH and it is a shame that EHS students have to waste our time when we could take other course that will teach us something new.",
    "The course covered application of epidemiologic principles specifically for environmental health sciences research. The focus on practical applications was helpful."

    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0I think that Dr. Zheng is a very nice and smart guy. It is obvious that he is a talented researcher but unfortunately he is not a good teacher. His English is difficult to follow and i think that his duties prevent him from taking thetime to make this course what it has the potential to be.I think that Dr. Zheng has to revamp this course completely before I can recommend it to any student.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Dr. Zheng clearly focuses on the practice of environmental health research, which provided insight in the application of the theoretical knowledge of principles of epidemiology I and II."

Some of the guest lecturers were interesting, but most of the course material is already taught (more effectively) in epi I and II.",
    "informative",
    "I would say to a student \"do not take this course!\". I would recommend epi 2 with Dr. Dubrow and any other EHS course. No useful content is presented in this course, it should not be called environmental epi because we only talk about the environment for 2 weeks. This is a below average course that fails to meet its potential and the standards of YSPH.",
    "This course does not advance anything new, beyond that which was learned in a basic epi 1&2 class",
    "The course is of a much more practical than theoretical nature. Because of this, I would recommend the course to students interested in environmental health research, but not necessarily to those in other divisions."
