   "comments": [
    "Love it-- Shiri is one of the sweetest, most caring, most understanding, most knowledgeable professors you could ask for at Yale, and the material is super interesting. Even if you've never taken a class on Israel or literature, you will probably enjoy this class.",
    "A good class on Israeli works of writing. It is basically like an English class on Israeli literature and films. We read a novel or part of a novel each week and then critically analyzed the work in our class discussion. Great professor who challenges you to think. Occasional reading responses and 2 major papers. The readings each week are the most time consuming.",
    "Yes absolutely, although you need to have some interest (not background, just interest) in the topic",
    "highly recommend this class, the professor is great and if you like reading interesting books this should be a good fit.",
    "Definitely take it! If you like Israel, you will love Shiri, the syllabus, and your classmates no question, so it is pretty much a no-brainer! I recommended a bunch of the books and tv shows to my family and friends, and had a blast learning about Judaism and Israel in a unique way.",
    "Israeli Narratives is a great course. The readings are very interesting and definitely manageable. Professor Goren is wonderful. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, a great class-Shiri is amazing and the materials you read range from intense to breath-taking to make-you-think to can't put it down. Just a really great way to be exposed to Israeli literature, history, and ideas.",
    "Anyone who is looking into this course should take it for the interesting and unique material and also for the professor. Professor Goren cares about her students and is always willing to help them improve. The course is fair, but do expect to read almost a novel a week. There will be few opportunities where you will be able to read Israeli literature, so take this course. The seminar style is also great."
