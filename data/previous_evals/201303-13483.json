   "comments": [
    "English 115 Section 3 was a very good course overall. The literature focused on anthropology and the portrayal of some other group in literature. However, the course is still primarily a writing course, so most of what we focused on had to do with analyzing literature for the purpose of writing about it. Having taken the course, though, I am much more confidant in my ability to interpret literature and write about it in the academic style. The course probably has more reading than an English 114 course, but it focuses more on literature, which I enjoyed. We read a wide variety of works, and I really enjoyed most of them. I think that if you enjoy reading and want your writing to improve, then you should take English 115. If you do not want to do as much reading, you could take English 114. In the end, you should read the syllabi to find a course with content that interests you, because you will be doing a lot of reading and writing about it.",
    "I would recommend English 115 in general to another student if they are interested in building a strong foundation in their critical reading and writing skills. 115 03 in particular is interesting because it has a big emphasis on theidea of anthropology, and while some of the philosophical texts on anthropology where very hard to read and understand, we read some really cool stuff as well, and in retrospect I'm very glad I was in this section because I was reading material I never would have read otherwise.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. Though there was a lot of reading and always something due each week it really helped me grow as a writer.",
    "It's a decent course to fulfill the writing requirement--super interesting reading and conversations.",
    "This course is great for a student interested in the close study of human aspects, such as gender and culture. It is a great course for developing both writing and close reading skills.",
    "Really great. Engl 115 might bot be the best, but this section (Anthropology in the Vein of the Literary Body) is great.",
    "This English 115 section is an exploration of anthropological literature, just as promised. We learned various techniques for incorporating literary theory and secondary sources into our literature analyses, and I feel that my writing really improved over the course of the semester. Edgar is a wonderful professor; he not only gave detailed feedback on each essay but often met individually with students to give advice and feedback during the writing process. The course was quite laid-back and tailored to the interests and abilities of the class (one day we used the techniques we learned in class to analyze art brought in by one of our classmates). I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in anthropology or fantasy\/SF literature.",
    "The Anthropology Vein in the Literary Body English Lit seminar is an excellent way to get insight on improving your writing while reading and analyzing interesting and controversial texts from a wide range of time periods, from the poetic prose of Shakespeare to the modern sci-fi of Ursula Le Guin. English class the way it should be - a majority class discussion with a lot of on-your-own reading and constructive writing. It's a great option as a introductory college English course. Professor Garcia knows what he's doing.",
    "Brilliant class. However, the student might need to be prepared for a considerably-time-consuming amount of reading - but, it's a literature class after all - and a little weird material."
