   "comments": [
    "Great overview of the body in art since 1945, like the title says. But honestly, if you want to get a better understanding of art in general and art history, this is a great class. This was my first art history class and I thought it was a great introduction to the field. I genuinely enjoyed the material and if you're at all interested in art, or performance, you should take this course. I look at things so differently now.",
    "Take this course for the great syllabus; try your best to pay attention in the dense lectures!",
    "A bi-weekly art history lecture that explores body art in the post-wwii era, from all over the globe, with a focus on American art.",
    "Great class overlooking a variety of themes in modern art. Highly recommend, riveting class.",
    "This was a great course as an ER&M\/WGSS major who has never taken an Art History class before, this was the best possible point of entry into the subject, as it covered social and philosophical issues that were pertinent to my interests. I received a comprehensive overview of all the major contemporary artists, and when I visit museums and galleries now, I feel well-equipped to appreciate and analyse art.",
    "Excellent lecture. Its workload isn't very intensive. There's a lot of dense reading, but Professor Mercer basically hashes it out in class, so it's not totally necessary. There's one slide identification test at the beginning of the semester, two short writing assignments, and a final paper. A lot of people were taking this class Credit\/D or auditing. Super interesting material - I learned so so so so much and I highly recommend it if you want to learn more about art history.",
    "An enlightening journey into the presentation of the body in art since 1945. Would highly recommend this course if you are a creative spirit seeking new perspectives of looking and seeing. Also will redefine the way you look at human bodies not just in art, but in the world."
