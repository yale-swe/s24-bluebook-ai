    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 126 to another student, especially potential English majors (for obvious reasons, but also just because ENGL 126 is a great survey course). Milton's Paradise Lost is beautiful--making even Satan sympathetic--and Eloisa and Abelard (Pope) is probably among my favorite poems. My only major qualm was that we weren't able to spend as much time on each individual poet, but this is to be expected from a course that is giving more of a taste of what is to come than a full meal",
    "English majors: Brisman's section is tops. Non english majors: class will be very thought provoking, but 5 essays and a final will demand a lot of you.",
    "In the end, no matter how unnecessarily harsh Professor Brisman may sometimes seem, I value my experience in this class, as he is just unbelievably smart. I am not certain, however, that I would recommend this class: one would have to be committed to the idea of learning for the sake of learning, growing for the sake of growing, and willing to accept what often seems to be absurd grading.",
    "I would recommend it, simply because you go so in depth with the poems, address ideas completely on your own that you never would have thought of. Professor Brisman's greatest strength was guiding us to very complex ideas in the poems through peppering each seminar with real-life anecdotes, and through our essays. I think however, that he could have guided us to these ideas in a slower and more organic way, such a through more peer to peer discussion.",
    "If you are a potential English major, this is a good course to test it out in. But this might also turn you off the major because of the work and difficulty.",
    "ENGL 126 was a phenomenal class - the poetry selection was amazin. Each poet brought a style and content that was both fresh and innovative. I especially liked Professor Brisman's simultaneous teaching (the first year he's done this) of Eliot, Yeats, and Gluck. Professor Brisman, wry, dedicated, and unforgiving (in the best sense of the word), pushed everyone to be better readers of poetry and, I would like to think, more thoughtful human beings. He transformed the class from one formally about verse to one about life. I can think of no better teacher for inspiring those considering the English major. That being said, Brisman is notoriously tough grader and does not put grades on critiqued papers. You may ask, though, at the midterm for a progress report. Nevertheless, this should not downplay the amount I learned this semester from Professor Brisman.",
    "A good class, but be warned that Professor Brisman has a unique style of teaching that might not be for everyone."
