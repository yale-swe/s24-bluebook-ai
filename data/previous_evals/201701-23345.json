    "Definitely become more comfortable talking about complexes and reading papers about them.",
    "Basic inorganic chemistry (including some review from 252), symmetry\/group theory with respect to molecular orbitals, fundamentals of spectroscopy, metal-ligand binding kinetics, Marcus theory, and how inorganic chemistry is being applied in a variety of research areas.",
    "Knowledge and understanding of coordination chemistry.",
    "This course is a great introduction to coordination chemistry and some of its modern applications. Professor Mayer's teaching helped cultivate my ability to think analytically about how to apply basic chemical principles to understand more complex concepts.",
    "Wow. I learned a lot about how to think about the different competing effects in chemical systems and how to compare them. I really learning how to situation myself in the context of different limits within inorganic chemistry and the basics of bonding in metals.Very interesting bit on Marcus Theory and ligand lability. Overall, one of the most influential courses on the development of my chemistry intellect at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "Great course, but could be a little more organized. I think the matrix derivation of point groups should be covered, because Dan explained it in section and character tables made a lot more sense after that. The student presentations were cool, but the open book final on them seemed like a bit of a pointless exercise. Chem 333 should be a prerequisite, but Mayer knew that all the undergrads in the class had taken it and it sounds like hes willing to adjust the syllabus if thats not the case in the future.",
    "Unfocused. Needs a clearer set of topics to cover rather than a hodgepodge of random related ideas.",
    "Professor Mayer seemed genuinely concerned with helping his students learn. However, the psets were often very long and confusing.",
    "This course introduced a good variety of subjects in coordination chemistry, especially the topics related to physical chemistry and spectroscopy. That being said, the structure and direction of the course was sometimes a bit unclear. It could benefit from a bit more organization.",
    "The class was very well-taught, and the material was well-organized and covered a broad variety of topics that were all very interesting. The biggest strength of the course was the guidance through each problem set that helped me review and think more deeply about the content taught in class. There were no glaring weaknesses of the course.",
    "Strengths: Beautiful exploration of the topic of inorganic chemistry. Great qualitative understanding which is, for the most part, fairly well rationalized. Nice contact with theory and the actual literature in the field. The project proposal was hard, but fun and a good idea. Weaknesses: Okay, yes. It was a bit disorganized. I personally like to have a clear reading schedule accompanying the course and this course was no where near organized enough for that. From a departmental stand-point. I think this class basically should replace CHEM 252. I fail to see the purpose of CHEM 252 in the context of the material that is basically re-presented here (luckily, I did not take 252, so this was not a problem for me). But further, this really was not a grad class so I feel very badly for the graduate students that basically sat through intro inorganic again.",
    "coordination chemistry is an important class. unfortunately, it got pretty disorganized around halfway through the semester, though prof. mayer is extremely smart and worth listening to. 9am lecture isnt chill tho",
    "The content of this course is very absorbing. Some very important concepts from symmetry and spectroscopy to kinetics and Marcus theory are covered which are not quite covered in other chemistry classes. It took a while for the class to pick, with the first couple of lectures being a little confusing and drawing from too many varying fields. And sometimes it was hard to tell from lectures what the most important take away was. However, the psets cleared away any confusion (which is really novel - in most classes psets are the confusing part) highlighting the important points and driving home the key concepts to be learned. It was a very effective way of using assignments to teach. I only wish all the questions were graded rather than just a couple. It is only fair for ones hard work to be taken into account when one spends the time to answer 11 questions. Having only two questions graded detracts from the value of the work - and if one had the bad luck of making mistakes in those questions, then that is more disadvantageous. I also wish the class had a real final instead of presentations. I would have preferred to be forced to revise everything we had studied and end the semester feeling confident that I remembered as much as I could than to be forced to sit through hours of presentations that were, to be entirely honest, not at all instructive."

    "A good choice of a chem elective if you're interested in inorganic. Prof Mayer has a great way of intuitively explaining things that will change the way you fundamentally think about chemistry, but class can get a bit scattered at times. Weekly problem sets are a typical length (3-5 hours) and informative, but they can be confusing and occasionally hell assign an 7+ hour doozy. Tests are tricky, but the questions heavily resemble homework questions, so if you take the time to really fight through and understand the homework problems then you'll be fine.",
    "The course is fine, depending on the instructor. It was very disorganized this year.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone interested in inorganic chemistry. It provided a more comprehensive understanding of many of the subjects discussed in intro inorganic lecture, like molecular orbital diagrams and splitting in coordination complexes and spectroscopy.",
    "Modern Coordination Chemistry is a great class to take. The workload is very manageable with weekly problem sets. Professor Mayer is great and loves to talk about coordination chemistry, his research, and his experiences in the field. It is definitely a good upper-level chemistry class to take to fulfill the requirements of the major.",
    "Yes. All day, every day. I think the perspective I developed during this class was invaluable. (I say that fully in the context of the instructor)",
    "This is a great course to get a really good understanding of the fundamentals in inorganic chemistry.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. The content of this course is very absorbing. Some very important concepts from symmetry and spectroscopy to kinetics and Marcus theory are covered which are not quite covered in other chemistry classes. It took a while for the class to pick, with the first couple of lectures being a little confusing and drawing from too many varying fields. And sometimes it was hard to tell from lectures what the most important take away was. However, the psets cleared away any confusion (which is really novel - in most classes psets are the confusing part) highlighting the important points and driving home the key concepts to be learned. It was a very effective way of using assignments to teach. Prof. Mayer has an interesting, holistic perspective on chemistry that is very helpful in developing an intuition for the subject. He spends a lot of time making sure students have understood the fundamentals. The psets are long but not terribly difficult and only a few questions on them were graded. There is a final presentation that is optional for undergrads - I recommend you do it because you will miss out on the skills it will teach you."
