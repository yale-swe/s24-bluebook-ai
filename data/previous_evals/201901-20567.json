    "You learn your way around the Leitner Planetarium and how to set things up, run shows, and start making your own. It's always fun to be in class and the assignments are whatever you put into them, you can go as far with the class as you want to.",
    "I learned how to use various rendering programs and the graphical programming language Processing to put on shows in the planetarium dome. I learned how to create and present astronomy-based shows as well as using the dome to simply tell a funny story or create a simple video game.",
    "It's a strangely specific, but enjoyable class about managing planetarium equipment. It's very practical, so expect less instruction on mathematics and astronomy and more on the peculiarities of the tools used."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths - very fun and engaging class, each project taught us different skills and use cases for a planetarium show weaknesses - had to upload all projects on the dome computer, very inconvenient for students living far away from the observatory (basically all but Franklin and Murray people)",
    "I would have liked if there was a showcase of the class work during the class time towards the end of the semester!",
    "Strengths: the projects werent too time consuming and were very fun. You got to use a lot of creativity to complete the two large projects Weaknesses: it can be difficult to operate the planetarium software. The professor makes it look very easy but when youre trying to do it by yourself it takes a lot more time to figure it out",
    "Maybe be a bit more explicit about the benefit of having a background in editing or photography (although it definitely is not required).",
    "The class lectures mostly consisted of examples of how to do certain things on the planetarium, usually related to homework assignments, and this definitely helped when trying to do the problems myself. Four of the assignments pretty much consisted of taking what was taught in lecture and redoing it yourself, but two of the assignments gave a lot of room for personal creativity, which was a great learning experience. The classroom is in the observatory, which can be a bit of a walk for a lot of people, but Professor Faison frequently brought in little treats to encourage class attendance.",
    "Professor Faison clearly enjoys the subject, and the class feels natural and friendly. I'd be willing to work the planetarium for a public night after taking the class. It is difficult to handle dome time and get up to the planetarium a few times every week (especially in the snow), so be ready to commit to that. Also, grading is somewhat opaque."

   "comments": [
    "If you need a half credit and are willing to try something new, and walk a lot up science hill, go for it! If you like working from the comfort of your dorm, don't!",
    "This is a very unique class and if you get the chance take it! You get access to the planetarium and get to work there on your free time. It was very rewarding to make use of Yale's many great resources. Highly recommend.",
    "This is a fun, straightforward course. While I doubt I will ever really use the skills that it taught me (as I am not an astrophysics person), it was fun all the same!",
    "Yes! It was really cool to learn how to operate the dome",
    "Yes, really interesting use of technology here on campus.",
    "Yes! Especially if you want an engaging science half credit and getting to know the planetarium, a really cool space at Yale.",
    "This course was a lot of work at times, but also a lot of fun. It is very rewarding to see a project that you spent hours on being displayed on the dome in all of its glory. Almost nobody comes into the class with any knowledge of putting on a planetarium show, so you will definitely learn a great deal about the whole process of doing so. Moreover, you can get paid to put on Tuesday night planetarium shows once you become comfortable with the programs.",
    "It really depends on your schedule. The half credit of science is great, and the class itself is pretty calming after the chaos of the rest of the week. On the other hand, if you're already busy, going up Science Hill in the rain all the time can be a real drag. (That's not something that can really be changed, unfortunately, so I don't fault the class for that.)"
