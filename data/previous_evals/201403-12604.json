    "Yes, please take this course!! It was so fantastic! You get to perform the actual experiments that some of the first pioneers of the field did, and they really work! We examined the extracellular AP's of earthworms, dissected the NMJs of the frog thigh muscle and stimulated the nerve to examine the action potentials. We added neurotoxins discussed in class and were able to observe the effects we predicted, we stuck muscle fibers with electrodes to do intracellular recording of the resting potential, we stuck electrodes in the eyes of fruit fly mutants to measure the response of their photoreceptor cells to light, and we mapped the visual field of the descending contralateral movement detector neuron in a grasshopper, to name a few experiments. The professors who teach the lab are directly involved with the students and all of the experiments (not just the TA), and are excellent teachers. The only complaint is that typically you get out of lab at 6:30 instead of 5:30, but it is worth it for all of the stuff you get to do. And it often directly relates to the topics discussed in lecture.",
    "This is one of the best labs I've taken at Yale with some of the most interesting material. They walk you through each experiment in detail, but you still feel like you have agency over what you're doing and learning. And with the difficulties you will inevitably run into, it all just makes you gain much more respect for the professors, who seem to do it all with ease.",
    "This lab can be frustrating at times because experiments often don't work, and I spent a lot of time just waiting for the TA or professor to come around to help me. Despite that, I actually enjoyed this lab more than any other lab I've taken. You'll work with worms, frogs, and flies - the worm experiments are ehhh, but the stuff you do with the frogs and flies is actually really really cool. There are lab reports for most labs, but you only have three due dates (so you hand in multiple lab reports at each due date). And the reports really aren't that bad, they don't grade you on tedious junk that other intro labs knock points off for. Just go into the lab knowing that the labs are going to be really long and you're going to have a lot of down time, but if you get some good lab mates it's going to be a good time.",
    "This is a great lab! You learn a lot without having to write tedious formal reports over and over again. The professors are primarily focused on your understanding and your ability to go one step further (in thinking of additional experiments, for example). Written assignments consist of just discussion sections, which allows you to devote a lot of time and thought to the actual point of the experiments rather than re-explaining a bunch of stuff you already know\/did. The professors are really friendly and supportive--meet with them! Especially Dr. Keshishian.",
    "A wonderful course. While it may seem at first daunting, it is ultimately very accessible and very rewarding. It is not hard and the workload is not intense: all you have to do is do the readings for the lab and understand them, then come in with an attitude to experiment and learn from your experiments. Ask questions. You are surrounded by wonderful instructors who just want to help. It's a small class so you get to know everyone very well. One of the best labs I've taken and probably one of the best courses as well."
