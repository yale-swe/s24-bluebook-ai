   "comments": [
    "I learned more about active conservation efforts taking place globally and sustainable practices that can be performed.",
    "Learned a lot about conservation biology policy makings and cost\/ benefit which I thought was very interesting.",
    "A better understanding of the real environmental challenges we face everyday and how to approach them in a clear framework.",
    "I gained a massive appreciation for conservation and a great understanding of the problems that we are facing and, most importantly, creating on our planet! It opened up my views of the world we are living in (and destroying) and also made me aware of efforts to rectify climate change, pollution, etc. I think this is a perfect example of how science credits can be broadening and important during our time at Yale.",
    "Very useful information the allows for a better understanding of the environment and biodiversity",
    "I learned the basics of conservation biology.",
    "I was strongly considering a major in ecology and evolutionary biology when I signed up for this course, and this course strengthened that idea. Even those who aren't interested in EEB should still take the course, though. It provides fascinating insights into the work required to protect and rehabilitate the environment. There is more to environmental health than saving the animals and decreasing pollution, and the steps needed to save the environment are complex, and each action could have a negative reaction. This course was honestly my favorite.",
    "I learned about the principal concerns of conservation biology. More importantly, I learned about the various actions humans take that have an adverse effect on the environment, and what we can do to ameliorate those effects. I also learned about ways to make conservation compatible with market efficiency\/sustainable development",
    "I learned a lot about conservation techniques from this course, particularly in terms of the challenges posed by small populations and the ways that humans are contributing in various ways to the challenges animals (even aside from those you might immediately think of, like polar bears) are facing these days.",
    "I learned a lot about sustainable development and how we can value biodiversity in a changing world.",
    "Learned a lot about how conservation methods and the current issues in conservation.",
    "Close to none. This class does not rely on any sort of personal growth or comprehension of knowledge. The only way you can be correct in the class is if you have the same opinion as the professor and the T.A.'s. Even if you have a correct answer by what you learned in class, it could be graded as incorrect simply because the grader does not like it.",
    "Straightforward material that is over complicated",
    "I learned how to apply scientific facts to practical thinking to solve problems in Conservation Biology.",
    "I leavened skills evaluating what is environmentally friendly, which will hopefully be helpful in a future job.",
    "I think I gained a good, practical perspective of conservation biology. I think I can engage with policy arguments in a more nuanced manner and I have some general examples that I can use to understand other questions that may come up. I feel like I see conbio issues everywhere now.",
    "Fluidity in understanding and articulating biological threats and solutions to anthropogenic environmental impacts",
    "A good and comprehensive survey of the field of conservation biology, which I had previously known little about.",
    "I learned a lot about about conservation and the various conservation techniques that are out there. I think I gained some ability in reading scientific papers and understanding how science has to work in both theoretical terms and policy terms.",
    "Basic knowledges about conservation biology and reserve design.",
    "Course was not nearly as insightful or enjoyable as it could have been with the topic.",
    "Almost nothing.",
    "great overview of conservation biology and current environmental issues",
    "Overview of the definition, goals, and challenges of conservation biology. Good science for non-science majors. Great case studies in Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction,\" most of which is read in class.",
    "Learned the basics about conservation. I hadn't taken any science classes at Yale, but did have some limited background in conservation from involvement in environmental advocacy groups. Honestly, I didn't learn much from the textbook and the concepts covered. Many concepts were basic, self-explantory environmental\/conservation ideas that I already knew about. I felt like the textbook and lectures simply assigned a complex name to a basic concept that was already widely known."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very dull course and the exams are unnecessarily difficult.",
    "This course is harder than it seems, and can be improved by being explained more so to students about the nature of the course.",
    "More grade transparency",
    "The tests were very ambiguous and therefore difficult. It's hard to tell what they were looking for.",
    "I liked kolbert! I think it was a nice way to frame the concepts we covered in class!",
    "The strengths of this course rely solely on the material, which is interesting and incredibly important. The Kolbert book was a highlight for sure. Unfortunately, lectures and sections often lacked creativity and definitely lost a lot of people's interests.",
    "Good professor, interesting material but the tests were unnecessarily hard",
    "Weaknesses: NOT A GUT. *You must read 2-3 research papers and discuss it in the discussion section *You must read a book The Sixth Extinction *They REALY make you memorize the name of the author, the year published, the title and about what it was about *Classes are usually boring",
    "Elizabeth Kolbert's book, \"The Sixth Extinction,\" was required reading for the course. The book was fascinating, and I'm glad I got the chance to read it, but some of the chapters were a bit unrelated to the course itself, especially those about previous extinctions in Earth's history. The chapters lay the foundation for Kolbert's pointing out the extinction event occurring now, and are incredibly fascinating, just a bit unrelated. I loved the book, and I hope to read it again outside of class.",
    "Strengths: breadth of topics covered, guest lectures, in-class lectures Weaknesses: far too many readings, which were very scattered and repetitive. The textbook was a vaguer version of lecture, and it felt superfluous alongside the Kolbert reading AND weekly section case study readings. Moreover, the P+S textbook was incredibly repetitive between chapters, which made reading it a chore. The lecture slides should have been more descriptive. Of course slides without written content will benefit students who attend lecture, but even for those of us that always attended, the slides did not reinforce content because they usually included nondescript photos. Thoughts on Kolbert: keep it! Enjoyable to read and showed clear application of course materials. However, if you keep Kolbert, either take out the section case studies, which often contradicted things we learned in class, or remove the mandatory textbook, which felt superfluous anyway.",
    "A strength is how it teaches material to students with little background. A weakness is that it is disorganized and often does not test on the correct material.",
    "I thought the course was great -- I would have liked fewer guest lectures, though, since those sometimes felt like they didn't totally fit in with the flow of the course. I liked the Sixth Extinction a lot -- it was interesting and fun to read. The course also assigns the perfect amount of reading -- not so much that it's overwhelming, but enough that you get something extra out of it.",
    "I thought the lectures were very good and thought provoking. However the tests limited creativity and were graded harshly even though the questions were broad.",
    "Strength: I really liked the Kolbert book. Weakness: I wish I got more feedback.",
    "This course did not teach much science. It focused on current policy issues in conservation. I disliked the fact that all tests had subjective grading in which the instructor would look for a specific answer to a very general question, and if you didn't answer exactly like she wanted then you would lose almost all points.",
    "Before the first midterm I don't think any of us knew the kinds of questions that were going to be asked, which made it difficult to study.",
    "This class is a normative pile of garbage even though it is a science class. Linda Puth didn't know what she was talking about most of the time and the course lacked any sort of grounding in principles.",
    "Great science class to take if science isn't your thing. You learn an lot from the outside lecturers and readings rather than specific course material but sometimes very over complicated",
    "It was really hard to do well on tests - they didn't correlate with what was in the textbook, and despite a huge amount of effort and really comprehensive answers, because the graders were looking for incredibly specific answers, I got a lot of points off.",
    "I thought the discussion section activities like the debate and the Kolbert reading was great. Sometimes questions on the exams were vague. I think more explanation would be helpful so that people could be sure they were answering the right question.",
    "I thought it was a well organized course. I like the books - the textbook is very clear and Kolbert was a really great and interesting read. I think they balanced each other with very practical reinforcement of the class and then some really fascinating examples that were more memorable because of their story value. I thought we covered interesting material. It might have been more fun if it were a little faster, but overall a very good course. Also the guest lecturers were really well chosen! If anything, I would say more case studies would be fun. One thing is that the grading on tests and other assignments felt very arbitrary - not about my actual knowledge of the material but rather about my ability to guess what the grader wanted to hear. Which was quite frustrating.",
    "Note to Professor Puth - I thought the Sixth Extinction was a fantastic addition. I wish we spent more time discussing it.",
    "Good course",
    "lots of random assignments that felt irrelevant (the debate).",
    "Course was well and clearly structured. It lacked rigor and didn't challenge students to problem solve enough. Material was hugely important but lectures covered material that was common sense in too much detail.",
    "Overall decent class and good lectures. However, I think that sections were poorly structured and felt really redundant. In particular, the debate assignment should definitely be revised and\/or replaced; in its current shape, it doesn't make much sense, especially considering that it is 10% of our grades.",
    "I think it's a very accessible science course about important material. The professor's lectures are clear and fine, though not the most engaging I've ever had at Yale. I enjoyed reading the Sixth Extinction for the course, as well. I think the largest weakness with the course is how poorly the exams are written -- Professor Puth is clearly looking for one answer, and yet the way the question is asked gives you zero indication at which specific answer she is looking for. Maybe with some multiple choice and short answer, rather than all short answer writing, or just generally more specific questions this could be much improved!! Also please put the three exams during class time rather than on the second to last day of finals.",
    "The lectures in general can be more engaging and well structured. It was sometimes easy to lose direction during lectures.",
    "Weakness is definitely the TFs and Professor try to make the course more complicated than it needs to be. No one I know enjoyed the class and everyone was disappointed with how it was structured and how the tests were organized. Literally, no one I know enjoyed it. I would not recommend.",
    "Linda Puth's lectures were rarely clear, and the questions on exams were often poorly written or ambiguous.",
    "the exams try to fit too much into too short of a time period, I think it would be nicer to dive deeper into just a few selected topics rather than test regurgitation abilities",
    "Really interesting and doable for those without a strong science background. Professor Puth is a great lecturer, but she does speak very quickly and will rush through material near the end of class if time is running out. Slowing down material to allow for better understanding would be my biggest recommendation.",
    "I was genuinely interested in conservation and environmental protection, and took this class to learn about the issues. I did gain some important knowledge from it, but often felt like all I took away from a lecture were more definitions and very basic ideas (another related issue is the lectures were often extremely basic, but the questions on exams were at a much higher level. The level covered in lectures didn't really correlate to that of exams). Perhaps some of the more basic concepts could be made more advanced. For instance, memorizing the definition of rehabilitation, reclamation, restoration, and others just didn't give me much lasting knowledge about conservation and is likely not something I'll remember or will be meaningful in the future. It was also very difficult to learn from my mistakes on the exams; it seemed as if points were taken off for the tiniest wording variations. That was frustrating, particularly because the lectures had been relatively broad and even in review sessions the answers to questions were quite broad. Points were taken off for the tiniest, most pinpointed errors and it was difficult to improve on those. One of the highlights of the course was the Sixth Extinction book. I'm very glad that I had to read it, as I learned a large amount that I had not previously known (for instance, the ocean acidification connection with climate change was an important concept that I did not previously know about and could be helpful in future environmental advocacy work).",
    "I consistently felt very unprepared for examinations. Questions on the exams didn't quite line up with what we discussed in lecture or in weekly section.",
    "weaknesses: the lectures are rather banal; feels as if the professor is just reading off the slides; the style of lecturing (i wouldn't necessarily call it teaching) did not match the style of the tests strengths: the course does open its students' eyes to a lot of the problems the world faces and gives concrete issues and possible solutions to ponder."

   "comments": [
    "I would NOT recommend taking this class, it is very boring and you will not get a good grade because though the material is very easy, the exams are all difficult and no one is engaged in the material.",
    "I would not recommend it, because it is not an easy science class for non-science majors as they make it seem.",
    "Yes it's a great and relevant science credit I feel like I learned a lot from the class I can apply in other aspects of my life even aside from traditional \"science\"",
    "This is NOT a gut. It's not for science majors, but the exams are hard and you have to be engaged to do well. An interesting and not too difficult class if you want to learn about conservation and environmental issues.",
    "I took it for an easy science credit, which it was in some respects. It's really easy to get at least a B\/B+ by virtue of the material. But the tests were often poorly worded and the assignments had barely no instructions yet the scoring of both seemed to look for very specific things. So it was a frustrating class and can be hard to get an A in even if you put in the work.",
    "Great science credit. Mostly just conceptual approaches to conservation, without ever delving deeply into actual biology. Interesting introduction to the topics of conservation, climate change, etc.",
    "Yes, if you are a non science major definitely take this course",
    "I would recommend if you are REALLY interested in conservation biology. If you don't have any interest, or if you are undecided if you like or not, DO NOT TAKE IT",
    "Good course for non-science majors. You will learn about conservation biology, climate change, and conservation solutions. You will need to work hard to do well. There are numerous non-exam assignments, including an in-section debate, outside lecture writeup, problem set, and in class presentation. This is all in addition to two exams, final exam, and readings from textbook, additional Kolbert book, and weekly case study readings. The exams treated all of these sources as fair game, so you really have to do the readings.",
    "A. For someone looking for a relatively interesting science credit, I would recommend this course. Conservation is a fairly relevant field and will be more so going forward. That being said, this is not a traditional \"gut.\" The material is taught at a fairly basic level, which convinces many people not to put in much effort in to the course. This is misleading because the tests expect a higher level of knowledge and understanding than would be expected from the way in which the course is taught. Go in to the class knowing that you should be actively trying to learn the material in order to do well.",
    "I took the class as a science credit, and it was great. I would definitely recommend taking it -- not too difficult (although you do have to put in some time! Studying is key it's a lot of content!) and it's interesting stuff. They do a great job of actually showing the practical implementations of conservation lessons you learn in the class.",
    "Yes because you will learn a lot that is valuable give current climate issues but don't expect to get a good grade even if youre engaged in the material.",
    "Yes. The material is relevant and definitely caused me to think more about the ways in which I live and affect the environment on a day to day basis.",
    "This class is not very engaging, however, it is a good science for a non-major.",
    "No.",
    "Yes, the course was basically applying problems in conservation biology to policy, which was great. It can get a little dull at times, but is a very timely subject with great importance.",
    "No absolutely not. This class is horrendous and should not be taken by anyone. This class gives conservation biology a terrible name and makes it seems like some sort of academic joke. None of the material is difficult. There are no difficult concepts. There are little to no calculations. However, you will still end up with a very low grade because of Linda Puth's grading style. Do not take this class. Stay away from it at all costs. It is a poor representation of the sciences at Yale.",
    "Yes for non science majors",
    "Good for a science credit, pretty interesting and a little bit of a deeper dive than most science for non science majors. Seems relevant to current events also, especially with the readings.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this class as a good science credit. It isn't terribly challenging and covers interesting material that is really relevant in current policy debate. If you are interested in the environment but not a scientist, this is a good course.",
    "Yes. While taking the course I thought it was a bit unorganized but also too \"dumbed down\" for \"non-science\" majors. I thought it would be better taught if just taught normally! But after I took the class and the final I realized I had absorbed quite a lot of information so maybe it actually worked! Otherwise it's a decent science credit for those non science people out there and the professor is super nice. The tfs were awesome too",
    "Good science credit for non-science majors on an important topic that we should all know something about. Relatively easy if you study \/attend lectures. Three exams plus a smattering of sort of random\/ annoying other assignments (attend an outside lecture, conduct a debate in section) but overall not bad. Highly recommend for non-science majors. If you're a science major this may not be the class for you, not necessarily because of the content or teaching, but just because it was pretty clear that no one was very engaged",
    "Take this class for a relevant and easy science class. Don't expect to be challenged or to learn a ton more about the environment (especially if you have any background). I took this with too much science and environmental background to get a ton out of it but take it if you aren't a science person and would like a well framed background on environmental chance.",
    "Yes. Overall decent Science credit that will teach you new and important things, but that is also doable without being too challenging.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for an interesting, accessible science credit. I thought I didn't care much about conservation, but this class made me care. Beware, the lectures are clear, but not the most exciting you've ever seen. There's three exams and the real problem is they're not well written -- every question is super vague and it makes it hard to succeed when you have no idea what the question is asking and have to clarify with TFs every three seconds.",
    "A good science class for non-science students.",
    "No. terrible class. Worst class I've taken that I've had an interest in. Very sad.",
    "Do not take this class. Puth's lecture style is awful, and no amount of studying will prepare you for her poorly worded essay questions. Takes Botany. Takes Issues Approach. Take anything, except this class.",
    "YES this class offers a great overview of environmental issues and conservation biology as a whole. Its not a crazy amount of work at all, just weekly readings and 3 tests but you get out what you put in (and all the readings are super interesting). The tests aren't easy but going to lecture and discussion section should prep you.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. The material is really interesting and relevant to everyday life, and the course is taught in a reasonable way in which not a lot of science background is required.",
    "While there were pros and cons, I would generally not recommend conservation biology. I feel like I really didn't gain much from the course content, which often simply assigned names to relatively self-explanatory conservation concepts.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. TAs were unhelpful and lectures disorganized. Questions asked on examinations were often beyond the scope of what was discussed in class\/section. Very little transparency in grading."
