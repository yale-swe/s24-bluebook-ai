    "Particularly for a first run, this course was well thought through and implemented. We've thoroughly evaluated the course with recommendations for next year during the course itself, so I'm not going to repeat my impressions, but I appreciated that Gordon and the team welcomed so much dialogue and evaluation of what went well and what could be improved.",

    "Great course! Gordon was an incredible professor and I look forward to the continuation of the course.",
    "Q4. The workload was heavier considering that we needed to devote entire spring break for it. But then it never felt like work!!!",
    "I thought the trip was excellent, but I think it could have been better planned. If we had been able to connect with the hospital earlier and talk about the schedule for the trip, we would have been able to schedule more things related to our projects and gotten more valuable research accomplished."

    "1. Gordon and Gary; Jason and Jared; All the classmates - very good initial screening!2. The trip to Haiti3. The flexibility given to students on the projects4. The opportunity to contribute to a real world sustainable development effort5. The parties at Gary's and Gordon's6. The experience of working with different schools at Yale7. The HAS hosts and the wonderful place we stayed at8. The sincere efforts of Met Lemothe to teach us Creole9. Gordon's motherly concern for everyone and even chaperoning one student through the immigration process10.",

    "it should be taught \/ co-lead by a development practitioner.",
    "I feel there was an over emphasis on agroforestry. At times it seemed like the other projects were much less important.",
    "If possible, deadlines and intermediate goals\/assignments should be clearly outlined at the beginning of the semester. Communication between teams and between HAS and teams could be improved.",
    "1. Learning Creole a bit earlier and more in detail2. More time in Haiti3. A couple of class lectures - like the one on project management",
    "Focus and direction.",
    "The class should definitely talk about what \"sustainable development\" is first and then move on to setting goals and coming up with projects. Without everyone being on the same page about what the goals of a \"development\" project should be first, it's very hard to work on a project proposal. Also, Haiti in general and the culture and people of the Artibonite Valley were two very important areas that should have been covered much more in depth. While the talks from outside people were very useful, I felt basic information was dropped to include them."

Seek outside support from experts in the field you're assigned to\/volunteer for, in terms of projects--you will not get all of the training and advice you need within the course. However, that's the point--you're building a team to consult on a semi-unfamiliar issue and you will need to marshall external resources to do so.",
