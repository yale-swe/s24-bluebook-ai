   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you're into policy. Even if you're not into global policy per say, you'll definitely learn a lot. It teaches you practical skills you'll never learn in another Yale College class.",
    "Strategic Thinking in Global Heath is a great course for anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in the global health field. I really enjoyed the class because I felt like it was less based on theory (which most Yale course are) and more based on practical application. The professors are very knowledgeable and the assignments relate well to the course.",
    "A great class if you are interested in strategic thinking and global health. The combination of undergrads, public health and medical school students works surprisingly well. While most of the work is focused on a big final presentation and final paper, they bring in AMAZING guest speakers for most of the class meetings.",
    "A challenging but very realistic class; my favorite so far at Yale.",
    "Yes. if you are interested in global health, this is the class to take.",
    "In all, this course teaches you valuable skills to formulate a strategy to solve Global Health dilemmas. You write a brief and do a presentation. While the feedback is valuable, this class is graded WAY too harshly. If you're an undergraduate, don't be surprised if you end up getting C's and lower B's. You're in a class with public health and medical students. While the course preaches collaboration, on the final paper you're essentially competing with students. So PROFESSORS, if you want to keep your undergrad crew, you're gonna need to lighten up on the grading. C's and lower B's will be devastating to our transcript and job and graduate school applications!In all, this course taught very valuable skills that can be used in many jobs in public health or in consulting. It is an analytical class. I just wish they didn't grade so harshly. Take it credit\/D\/FAIL",
    "Yes, for anyone interested in going into management or policy",
    "Grand strategy, but for health, and only one semester, and no classics reading.",
    "This was a fabulous course. This was a fabulous course from the very first lecture to the very last assignment. I strongly believe that I learned more practical and relevant information in Strategic Thinking in Global Health than I did in almost every other class that I took at Yale University this year."
