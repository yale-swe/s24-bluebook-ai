    "Without question I would recommend this course.",
    "This class tracks the path of progressive reform throughout the twentieth century. It deals pretty much entirely with domestic politics in the United States, and in a rather ahistorical way. The class includes a massive amount of reading, much of which is glossed over in class discussion. But, if you are interested very specifically in the topics covered in the class, it becomes very interesting, and I felt that I learned quite a lot throughout the semester.",
    "This was a great concept for a course, and was done fairly well. You read a whole lot about progressivism, part political theory, part history of administration, and part critics of progressivism. Take this if you're really interested in what progressivism is and has been. If you're not that interested, you probably won't enjoy yourself very much, since it's pretty deep into the subject. Professor Skowronek is very knowledgeable and is also willing to listen to different perspectives, although he rarely changes his mind. It's unlike most other history and poli sci courses at Yale, and in a good way."
