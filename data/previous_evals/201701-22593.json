   "comments": [
    "It is by far the most stimulating course I have taken at graduate school. Prof. Eller stimulates her students, listens, and creates a space in which students can think aloud about the trends, methods, and purpose of studying history as a practice, and of Caribbean history as a field. Professor Eller also made conscious efforts to ensure everyone in the seminar was invited to add to the conversation. I can only speak to the course's strengths. Though it was labor intensive (more so than most other grad. courses at Yale so far) I believe my writing skills and knowledge base have improved by taking the course. Prof. Eller is also incredibly helpful in suggesting additional reading in your field of interest. Working with students at Cornell was incredibly productive and I aim to reach out to fellow colleagues at Cornell to propose panels for conferences in the future."

    "I could not recommend this course highly enough. The level of intellectual stimulation in this course has been second to none for me. Prof. Eller forces students to think in new ways while also encouraging students to appreciate how the field has shifted."
