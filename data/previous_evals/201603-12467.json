   "comments": [
    "As a student who plans to go into research, the skills I learned in this were invaluable. Being able to interpret and understand data and data analysis, as well as the thought process one must learn when developing an experiment, were especially important.",
    "First part of the course covered AP statistics material - boxplots, t-tests, etc. The second part of the course covered other unfamiliar tests, such as ANOVA and U-tests.",
    "Applying statistics to other subjects; learning on my own",
    "This course was a fine survey course of the statistical approaches relevant to biological sciences.",
    "Statistical analysis to various degrees 1. Parametric tests 2. How to analyze and come up with conclusion from General Linear Models 3. How to reduce bias and sampling error in experimental design 4. How to select the best GLM's 5. The benefits of Non parametric tests The use of Bayesian Inference and Likelihood in conjunction to probability",
    "This course (umbrella and life sciences) taught me all the basic intro stats concepts.",
    "Great class to get a basic introduction to stats!",
    "I developed very versatile statistics techniques that can be applied to most situations, and I believe I will be able to use these skills in my research in future years, even though I will not be taking another actual statistics course.",
    "As an E&EB major, my courses often require that I read and understand primary scientific literature. Many of the scientific articles I come across are full of statistics jargon and statistical analyses, and after taking this class, I feel better able to critically analyze the tests the researcher conduct as well as their results, instead of just blindly following their conclusions. I've also begun to build a statistical foundation and understanding that I can build upon as I continue my studies in other, related fields.",
    "I learned how to utilize relevant statistic data in research papers as well as everyday news-statistics",
    "This class was really helpful. I immediately started using what I was learning in my independent research project, which required a lot of statistical analysis. The first half of the class with Jonathan was pretty straightforward. The second half (Life Sciences) was more tricky, although it directly applied to my research. Life Sciences students learned ANOVA and General Linear Regression.",
    "Stats is great for actually getting you to think critically about the statistics you see everywhere in life (nutrition, politics, etc.), as well as being a very important tool if you do any sort of research. This class helped tremendously with my previously-uncoordinated flailing through the statistics required for my senior project. In general, even though I'm not planning to do much more with serious statistics and will probably forget a lot of the specifics from this course, I expect the basic principles to stick with me in a way that will be very important and useful in both professional and personal life.",
    "Learned the types of statistical analyses to use for certain data sets and experiments and how to interpret them. However, I was only capable of a surface level of understanding, and much more was expected.",
    "How to apply statistics in real life situations",
    "Having never taken statistics before, I found this course to be one of the more practical ones I've taken. A basic understanding of statistics has allowed me to look at problems in a much more nuanced way. It's very useful to be able to evaluate predictions rigorously.",
    "I found it difficult to retain information from this course based off of its large lecture format as well as the professor from the life science statistics portion being confusing and quick moving.",
    "Elementary statistical analysis and knowing when to use certain techniques, as well as being able to recognize sources of error in experimental design."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the second half of the course was especially relevant for my interests as and EEB major, and the first half did a god job of giving a foundation. One of the biggest complaints I have with many introductory science courses, particularly the bio sequences, is that they are so tailored to premed students that they often don't address many issues or attempt to address topics that are of interest to the portion of the class that doesn't plan on being in medicine. I really appreciated that stats, even in the general half of the course, didn't focus primarily on its relevance to medicine.",
    "JRS is a very good lecturer, although his humor could be a hit or miss. He made fairly boring material interesting. Professor Jetz was alright during lectures, but his p-sets were usually worded in a confusing manner. Sometimes grading did not follow what was discussed in class.",
    "Strengths: First half of the course is taught by JDRS; amazing lecturer, quite engaging, made lectures fun. Weaknesses: Transitioning to a different professor for the second half.",
    "I think there really needs to be more communication between the professor that teaches the first half and the professors that teach the second half. The class went off the rails in the second half of the course and I think that could've been avoided with some insight from the far superior first half.",
    "Strengths Very thorough and well detailed. The content was plentiful for a subject that I thought would have been much simple (mean this in a good way). Clear how a lot of what we learned in class can benefit me with other classes, projects, experiments etc. The general course taught by Professor Scheuning was very nice because of the video recordings and also self taught short videos. Really helped me with review. Weaknesses Not enough engagement with class once we split. Learned more from the TA than from the professor most times. A lot of times he'd explain something in 20 minutes that we spent a lot of time going over in class, I was able to understand most concepts only after going to office hours. Asides from that the class was fine, just wasn't a great enough connect or transition from the general course to the specific course (Life Sciences).",
    "Poor ta",
    "First half of the class is great--everyone is together. Once the classes split, they should be graded separately--teachers are very different. I liked the smaller class setting, it was nice.",
    "The online access to information for the course was very inaccessible sometimes. For the second half of the semester, for example, when the lecture splits into smaller groups, the website for my section was never launched, so I could not access the syllabus or other important information. Also, there was not good communication of important information. Everyone I talked to, for example, did not know about the \"flipped-classroom\" option of the course, and this could have really helped some people.",
    "The course is very fast paced, and many of the concepts are difficult to grasp at first. It was not until reviewing for the final exam (at which point I'd reviewed some of the lectures exhaustively for the fourth time) that everything began to come together and make sense.Additionally, the material can be dull. It was challenging to get excited about it, but essential to learn it. The office hours helped me to grasp the concepts better, but this is a course that could be improved by perhaps narrowing the breadth a bit to allow for better understanding of the most important 75-80% of the material.",
    "This course was very fast-paced and the lectures were not very well explained in my opinion. The homework required much extrapolation from the concepts that were taught in lecture.",
    "Strength: I liked that it started off as a huge lecture to learn some basic statistics. It was good to split off and learn some more specific techniques based off of the field we were working in. Overall very manageable course for people coming in at all levels. Weakness: The homework for the second half of the course (life sciences) was not always clear. It was hard to know what the instructor was looking for in some of the questions. The lectures were also not as clear as the first half.",
    "Strengths: Good introduction to principles, generally well-organized, excellent teaching for the intro section, good TA availability Weaknesses: Unpredictability of second-half teaching quality, can be dry and\/or unintuitive, homework\/exam wording can be unclear Possible improvement: The first half was really great in all organization and teaching, mainly because Prof. RS is just very good at what he does. The second half is unpredictable since it completely shifts to a new professor, and it'll be difficult for any professor to live up to the standards Prof. RS set in the prior months. I guess I'd just encourage the second-half professors to keep their organization systems as close to the first half as possible (which also just helps reduce changeover confusion).",
    "In the 2nd half of the semester, the professor expected that we learned more than we actually did. Without seeing a TA outside of class it was difficult to know how in depth things should be understood. In the 2nd half, when problem sets were graded there was no explanation for why points were taken off or what they were taken off for.",
    "The first half of the course was very strong because the professor kept us engaged and was very accessible with office hours. The second half of the course was not as strong because the professor went through the information very fast and did not take time to explain it in class. Office hours with the TA were very helpful though.",
    "The material was very useful. Professor Reuning-Scherer put together an excellent intro series of lectures. The lectures were tedious at times, but that's too be expected with laying the framework. I felt very prepared for my section after this intro series. The smaller section was also very useful. It was more applied, which made it more interesting. I didn't always have the same level of understanding as I did for material in the intro series, but I was nonetheless able to apply my knowledge to real-world problems.",
    "It moves very quickly, especially for someone who has not taken statistics before. My personal section, Life Sciences, was very difficult and I felt that both the professor and the TF in this section did a very poor job teaching and helping the students.",
    "The course gives a strong introduction to many different types of statistical analysis, and through sheer repetition students are able to recognize and remember with ease certain core tenets of each technique."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. The skills you learn in this class are essential for anyone planning to go into any kind of job where you deal with data.",
    "I wish I could rank the above questions for each part of the course rather than as a whole. Stat 101 is very informative (we covered a lot of tests I hadn't seen before in AP Stat), but the p-sets can be a pain because you don't always know what you have to write. If you are looking for a more chill, STEM-focused stat, I would take medical stat.",
    "Yes, if you have to take it, take the 100 series",
    "Do not take this class if you don't have to. You slowly warm up to the material in the first half of the semester, only to come to hate it the second half. If I wasn't required to take it for my major, I'd have dropped this class right when it broke up into sections.",
    "No",
    "Yes. The umbrella course was enjoyable and informative; the life sciences course was, while not particularly specific, a good continuation of the class.",
    "Great intro stats course. JDRS is the bomb! Engaging and funny. Jetz is smart, but he thought we knew a little more than we actually did, so it was a big jump from Jonathon's lectures.",
    "Yes, because it was a genuinely useful and relevant learning experience, as well as a more (in my opinion) reasonable math course to take, especially if you are not a math\/engineering major. I will never use calculus, for example, but this statistics course will actually help me in my future.",
    "If a student is taking statistics to fulfill the major requirement, I would recommend another section, as I have heard others are easier or cover similar material in a more engaging manner. However, despite the difficulty of this section, after having completed it I feel more familiar with many of the concepts field biologists must understand to conduct research.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to another student as it teaches very useful informational for in the statistical world.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I used a lot of what I learned in the research that I'm doing in lab, so it's very useful. As for people deciding between Life Sciences and Medicine, I heard that Medicine was significantly easier. However, I'm glad that I took Life Sciences because we learned ANOVA and GLM, which is useful.",
    "Yeah, I'd generally recommend it. It's not something you take because it's fun (though Prof. RS gets it close), but because it's useful--and it is, very. Statistics is incredibly important in all academic fields and most other professional ones. We're also swamped with varyingly-accurate statistics in the news every day, and knowing how to interpret those numbers contributes hugely to your understanding of the world. You'll get as much out of it as you put into it, but if nothing else you'll get the basic principles to use when people throw percentages at you.",
    "It was helpful for me to learn when to use certain statistical analyses and how to interpret them, but I didn't want to know the ins and outs of stats and this course wanted me to know that. So, depends why you are taking the course. If you just want to know how to use some analyses take it Cred\/D.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is very interested in applied statistics. If someone if looking for a statistics requirement, I would not recommend the life sciences section.",
    "Take this only if you need it, but as a life science student (EEB major) I wish I had taken a course that taught me more about the computer programs and how to use them.",
    "Yes, it was a math class more applicable to the life sciences than a straight calc class for example.",
    "Although this course is tedious at times, the content is very useful. The course gave me a whole new set of tools that I have found useful in all sorts of areas like biology, or even something as simple as reading the newspaper. This is a subject of which everyone should have a basic understanding of.",
    "It is a potential prerequisite course that isn't that challenging in the big picture. Once you leave the large lecture, in which the professor is fantastic, make sure you know which specific section you are signing up for. I would not at all recommend Life Sciences. I did not learn anything from the course and was left frustrated and discouraged.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend the first half of STAT 10x to other students. The material is immediately practical to innumerable fields, and Professor Reuning-Scherer makes even the large lecture class engaging."
