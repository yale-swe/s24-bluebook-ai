    "I learned the importance of understanding children's minds in order to create a positive future. It is an integral part of self-knowledge.",
    "I gained an appreciation for children's psychological development and how amazing children are at learning. I think this course allowed me to view children from a new lens and will help me in my future interactions.",
    "So much about development, a new appreciation for the sophistication of children and the importance of understanding development in order to understand adults",
    "I learned the importance of first understanding infant behavior to in order to have an understanding of adult behaviors and later-emerging forms of psychopathology.",
    "I learned how i developed into the beefcake i am today.",
    "I gained a lot of theoretical and practical knowledge of how children's minds work, and by extension, about adult psychology.",
    "I learned a broad understanding of developmental psychology. In addition I developed skills for comparing the different theories of development.",
    "I learned a lot about the development of psychological and cognitive processes in kids and through adulthood. I learned just how complex things like language acquisition and development of motor skills are.",
    "I learned alot about what is innate and what is learned in the human brain. I learned alot more than just this, but the tragic thing about psychology is that really everything is contested, so there are few other clear facts I gained from this course.",
    "I now have a much better understanding of developmental psychology, as well as a better feel for how to design experiments.",
    "Great class, so interesting but very difficult.",
    "Developmental Psychology knowledge, designing a proper research paper skills",
    "I feel like I learned a great deal about how we, as humans develop from rather knowledgeable babies to full grown adults with the ability to change the world. We learned about a whole multitude of different fields in which people do this, including with language, morality, and many many more.",
    "Creating an original experiment, research, and memorization skills.",
    "This course offers a really comprehensive insight into theories of developmental psychology. It also teaches you how to write an in-depth research proposal."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is all strengths. The lecture format suits the material, and the textbook perfectly supplements the lectures. The reading responses and the essay dovetail into the material seamlessly, allowing me to feel prepared to tackle the assignments.",
    "This course has a lot of very interesting experiments. However, I wish we would have a more structured class, rather than just straight lecturing every single time. I liked the classes where we do a telling activity like trying to associate two images using either imagery or repetition strategies because that was something I couldn't just read in a lecture book on my on own.",
    "Strengths: Well organized, interesting content. I liked the variety of ways in which we were tested (exams, papers, debate response essays)",
    "This course is all strengths no weaknesses, I had a great time",
    "I thought the syllabus was definitely engaging. I found that I could almost just as easily have read the textbook alone as take the class in terms of content, which is both good and bad. But the lecture style was also pretty engaging.",
    "The strengths of this course were the engaging lectures. In addition I enjoyed that the textbook was written by the professor because it allowed for students to further review and understand what was discussed in class.",
    "The lectures were sometimes fast paced, but interesting. Professor Keil did a good job of explaining the important information through the use of experiments and case studies. The text completely supplemented the lectures which was helpful in ingraining the material.",
    "The strengths of this course was that it was comprehensive and used a bunch of very interesting studies that really broadened my perspective in psychology. On the other hand, the exams in this class (especially the final) are absolute nightmares. A week before the exam, Professor Keil gives you 30 questions. These questions are long essay questions -- they each easily fill a notebook page worth of writing. You then expected to in 7 days figure out each answer to the 30 questions and then memorize the answers. That means I had to cram my head with 30 pages of written psychological information in 7 days for the midterm. On the exam, he chooses 5 questions randomly that we have to answer. While the midterm was rough, the final was an actual nightmare. In the final, we not only had to learn and memorize 30 new questions, but we had to rememorize the 30 questions that were in the midterm as well. He chose 7 for us to deliver on the exam (of course we didn't know which those were until 30 seconds before the exam started). By the time I had checked over my answers with other classmates (we can consult our book and other students on the questions, just not the professor nor the TFs), I only had 4 days to memorize 60 questions. I had to use evry memory strategy I had ever learned in psychology to study for this exam, and even then I almost had a panic attack 30 minutes before the exam. While I missed all of my meals for a week through cramming for this test, even then it was virtually impossible to prepare. The short amoutn of time he gives for us to prepare for the exam forces us to cram, which induces stress and creates a hell week for everyone. Even if the professor gave the questions out as he went, giving one question a week, we could at least be studying as we went so that exam time wouldn't be such hell.",
    "This is a really, really good class. I have no suggestions that could make it better.",
    "The course material is so interesting but I think the workload was too much. Could be improved by not having both a final paper and final exam, or not having so many questions for the exams.",
    "The course is great but there is way too much memorization for the test and the grading is quite harsh on these tests",
    "I believe a strength of the course was having weekly debate\/discussion questions. They allowed us to review the material more regularly and more critically so that everything was not as difficult to manage. Also, the progress reports were great because they allowed us to work on our papers in small increments so by the time the paper was due, we were well prepared to write it.",
    "Strengths: The material was very interesting, and taught in a way that was interesting. I found myself doing a lot of extra work as to fully understand all of the material, which I wholeheartedly enjoyed. Weaknesses: One could tell that Professor Keil has taught this course many times occasionally, as it would feel like he wasn't fully invested in the lecture.",
    "The lectures can be a little dry, and the readings don't always seem to match up with the lectures the way they should. However, the material is really interesting, my TA was wonderful, and the professor is very knowledgeable and kind."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in experimental design and psychology. I think that if you are going to work with children in any field such as education or medicine I would also recommend this course just because it gives a lot of insight into how children think and their capabilities at various ages of development.",
    "Whether or not you are particularly interested in children, this is a really enlightening class about development and provides important background information for understanding adults. Also, we all will, at some point, be forced to weigh in on issues involving children, whether or not we have them, and there are a lot of phony claims out there about children, so it seems important to be able to know what the truth is and to use that information in making decisions involving children.",
    "Yes, this was an excellent course and I learned so much. Sure there was a lot of material, but it was extremely useful and interesting.",
    "yes",
    "It's a great class, the information is great, the professor is very funny and intriguing. Overall, great course and start the final paper early or it will destroy you.",
    "Yeah, this class is pretty cool. You learn about a lot of interesting and surprising studies, and develop a good knowledge base.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it think the material was extremely interesting and the class allowed for discussion and deeper thought into the theories.",
    "Yes I recommend this course. If you're interested in development, this course is a really good one. You get to learn about a lot of cool experiments and case studies that show you just how complex and interesting development is. The course really isn't that much work but you do have to be prepared for the midterm and final (which he gives the questions to in advance). Lectures are normally pretty interesting despite Professor Keil's somewhat monotone voice.",
    "I recommend this to the student who is ready and willing to work their butts off. I recommend this to the student who can be fascinated at mundane studies about babies all day. I recommend this to the student who can easily criticise psychological experiments. However, a normal student who isn't a psychology major and doesn't want to work hard should not take this class.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone who has taken intro psych. The lectures and textbook are very clear, and you really learn a lot by the end of the semester.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you're ready to work your butt off. It is very demanding, especially around the time of the midterm and final and final paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Psychology",
    "Yes; it requires work to stay on top of the readings and to complete the weekly assignments. However, if these are completed and you attend lecture then the class is very manageable. You cover a lot of material and there are a lot of details. Yet, you leave the class learning so much.",
    "I highly recommend to any psych student or any person interested in the development of humans from babies to adults. I find this to be a rather interesting course, but if one is not interested in the material, it may be difficult for them to be fully engaged.",
    "I would certainly recommend this based on its content; however, be prepared that there is both a final paper and a final exam, so the workload at the end of the semester is really difficult."
