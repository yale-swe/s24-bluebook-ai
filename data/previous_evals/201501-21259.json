   "comments": [
    "The class was a little fast paced. May be not having the two last guest lectures will benefit the course.",
    "Good class to gain a surface-level knowledge of Python and C++. Too much materials is attempted to be covered in too short a period of time.",
    "It can be a difficult class to keep up with at times, but it really does a good job of introducing you to C++, which is used quite a lot for scientific computing. What's a bit annoying is how sometimes, the problems are more physics than computing--which is to say that understanding the physics part is a lot harder than the computing you need to do. Which is understandable as it is a physics class, but I feel the computing should be more emphasized.",
    "Great course - learned a lot about Python and C++ (and taking advantage of object-oriented languages in general). Mandatory class attendance was annoying though. Beware - the last couple of psets and final project more than make up for the simplicity of the first half of the course.",
    "This class is a crash course in Python and C++. I would recommend it to any students wanting to become knowledgable from each language. It is not for students with no programming experience.",
    "A challenging class that is rewarding if you have the time to commit to it"

   "comments": [
    "This class was outside of my major, and not really applicable to my research. However, in the future, I think I will need to use computing to help with my research, so it should be useful then.",
    "I am now comfortable with Python, which will be useful for my research.",
    "I did learn a lot, but again, if we learned a little less and spent more in depth time on the other parts I think this class could be really amazing."
