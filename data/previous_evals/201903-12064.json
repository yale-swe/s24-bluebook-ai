   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength of this course was that it continues to build upon prior knowledge of quantum mechanics if students are already familiar with the subject. The biggest weakness of this course was the lack of overall physical intuition provided and the lack of non-abstract motivation behind problems and approaches. In particular, it felt like the way the material was presented was nearly entirely from an abstract vantage in which the main motivation behind problems and techniques was the existence of some more fundamental mathematical techniques. This was particularly true regarding the presentation of spin as an abstract object via the introduction of SU(2) rather than by presenting spin as an explanation for physical experiments such as the Stern-Gerlach experiment. There also seemed to have been a large disconnect between what students were meant to understand from the problem sets and what students actually got out of them.",
    "I think the main strength of the course is that it teaches material at a level that's useful for students who plan on taking more theory intensive courses and\/or doing theory research, while still managing to provide a mostly accessible review of core ideas of quantum mechanics for students who aren't necessarily interested in theory generally or quantum theory specifically. Definitely the main weakness of the course is that problem sets are generally too time consuming, and usually in ways that are not particularly useful to most students (i.e. doing tedious amounts of algebra).",
    "The lectures were super clear. However certain parts were too mathematical and some intuitive introduction\/summary would be very helpful. Also there wasn't a lot of applications which I assume are saved for QM2",
    "Strengths: Weaknesses: sometimes the professor didn't elaborate in class and referred us to the notes fairly often.",
    "The most significant weakness that I found in this course was the disconnect between the homework and lecture. Often content on the homework was not covered until the lecture before the homework was due.",
    "I think the way this course approached most topics was from a theoretical\/mathematical background that perhaps made some concepts difficult to understand or intuit, and perhaps did not help me build much physical intuition for quantum systems. I think it may be valuable to approach some of these concepts from an experimental perspective: e.g. for introducing the j,l,m basis etc. it may be beneficial to motivate the problem using addition of spin\/orbital angular momentum of the electron in a hydrogen atom. I don't have much experience with group theory, and I plan to work in experimental physics, so the nuances of the SU(2) and SO(3) groups are unfamiliar to me, and will likely not be useful in future research. As such my eyes glazed over and I missed most of that lecture content despite my best efforts to appreciate its importance.",
    "Liked emphasis on symmetries and group structure.",
    "I think it basically satisfies what it should do. I think it is a bit too dense, however. The course should be slowed down, and we should have done more examples in class that are similar to homework and exam problems. Also, I am not a fan of the textbook, I would recommend choosing a different one. I also wish we had a bit more engagement from the TAs, and had homework returned sooner so we could know how we were doing in the class.",
    "The layout of lecture and the focus on building up the Quantum formalism piece by piece was very helpful.",
    "Well rounded",
    "Good intro to Quantum. Really wished the intro to axioms went faster. Took way to long to get into actual interesting topics. Instead built up basics for weeks. Also wished tests were take home. In class tests ended up being time crunches where small mistakes ended up making entire problems incorrect. Tests really didn't test you on if you actually learned the material, instead tested you on how fast you could do some calculation. Homework also was way too heavy on calculation and algebra machinery instead of developing greater understanding."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, this course did a fairly decent job of presenting material to better grasp quantum mechanics, but I would only recommend it to students who have had substantial exposure to quantum mechanics on at least a thorough undergraduate level. I would primarily suggest this course for theorists that are less interested in the historical and physical developments leading to the topics and more of the underlying abstract mathematical concepts that describe the subject.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who care about relearning the basics of quantum mechanics at higher levels of mathematical rigor in preparation for further study in quantum theory.",
    "A great introduction to quantum mechanics. The lectures were incredibly clear and came with very detailed handwritten lecture notes. However some lectures seemed too fast and overly mathematical. Intuitive explanations of the whole formalism and experimental implications were mostly left out and as a sophomore without much exposure to QM, I felt the class has taught me mostly on solving algebraic problems and proving linear algebra\/group theory statements.",
    "Yes. It was well executed.",
    "You can't NOT take this course, so I doubt this is relevant. I think the lectures and organization were as good or better than I would have expected a first semester graduate QM class to be.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes.",
    "It is required for graduates. For undergraduates, maybe take this if you want a sense for graduate level physics courses.",
    "Yes. Helps provide a better understanding of the foundations of QM and its formalisms.",
    "Yes",
    "Dr. Goldberger is a good lecturer and very helpful. He is a very fair professor. I would recommend his class to others.",
    "No, because you can just learn better by reading books and doing problem sets. BTW, I never saw any teaching fellows and never knew any of their office hours because at the start of the course, TF's assignment was so confusing that make me confused also. They did not actively approach us either, so far as I could remember.",
    "No. If you can get out of it do it."
