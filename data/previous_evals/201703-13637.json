   "comments": [
    "1. learnt to write different kinds of papers from the academic ones i usually wrote in my other courses at Yale 2. got to meet amazing people from the field of business journalism - Joanne Lipman, Paul Stieger (ProPublica), Stephen Adler (Reuters EIC), Gerard Baker (WSJ EIC). 3. field trips to the Fed, WSJ, Bloomberg, Buzzfeed",
    "I learned the most important elements of journalism: accuracy, accuracy, and accuracy. For that I will be forever indebted to Prof. Herman.",
    "I learned so much from this course, from writing to reporting to career options.",
    "I learned to understand, discuss, ask about, and write about large business and financial issues at a much deeper level. Learning to do these things with a journalistic approach was an incredibly useful and interesting skill to learn.",
    "The course helped me gain some knowledge of the news industry that I did not have before. It also provided some insight into what business, finance and economic journalism does in this world.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS!! I learned so much about journalism and in particular coverage of business and financial topics. I had little relevant background knowledge, and I still got a ton out of the class. The assignments were super interesting and provided freedom to delve into topics that I found personally interesting. Professor Herman is incredible. He cares so much about each student as an individual. He arranges amazing guest speakers and field trips, and his expertise on financial journalism is present in fascinating comments in class. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale!",
    "I learned very tangible skills about how to be a better journalist and a better business journalist. I learned tips to improve my writing, my journalistic ethics, what journalistic claims need evidence, how to interview subjects. This was one of the more practical classes I've taken at Yale, especially as I hope to become a journalist after college."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: 1. different kind of class 2. cool guests 3. interesting assignments (also, Prof Herman is super flexible about them, so you can basically pick your own topic for the last three papers) Weaknesses: 1. sometimes I felt the class lacked structure, was a little repetitive. But in all fairness Prof Herman really tries to drill some principles of journalism into our head (accuracy, accuracy, accuracy!) 2. Would have really liked to see more diversity in our guests who were mostly middle-aged white men. I understand that this is not entirely the class' fault, and journalism as an industry still has a diversity problem. But considering so much of the class was talking about looking forward and understanding how journalism would change in the future, i think diversity should be an important part of that conversation.",
    "Strengths: taught by a supremely knowledgeable and caring instructor. Amazing guest speakers. Amazing field trips. A pleasure each week! Weaknesses: incredibly tough grading (far tougher than other journalism courses, or many other courses at Yale for that matter). Comments from Prof. Herman were generally good, but every now and then I thought he marked down on misreads. Lots and lots of work (this is generally good, but it compounds at semester's end).",
    "The course was fantastic. I greatly enjoyed each writing assignment, and the guest speakers and field trips were incredible experiences.",
    "The course, though termed a seminar, was essentially taught as a lecture. The biggest weaknesses were a lack of discussion and the repetitiveness of the sessions.",
    "This is a great class. The trips to New York and the amazing guests that visit the class were highlights of my semester.",
    "This class was incredible. Professor Herman is fantastic. He provides extensive individual feedback on each assignment that really helped me grow as a writer, and his insights in class are always fascinating. He clearly cares about his students, distinguishing him for the better from many Yale professors who take a much more impersonal approach. The guest speakers and field trips are also excellent and really add to the experience. No weaknesses come to mind!",
    "Strengths: Wide variety of assignments allowing lots of journalistic license, fascinating guest speakers who were extremely informative, an interesting array of topics covered each week, a reasonable workload, great and thorough feedback on assignments Weaknesses: The class could've been a bit more organized in that I just didn't feel everything was laid out consistently. For example, the presentations seemed like they were forgotten about, and then like 8 kids presented in the final two weeks, it was just a bit weird. Would've appreciated stuff being more laid out (like presenting schedule, like note-takers schedule) much further in advance so we had notice."

   "comments": [
    "Yes yes yes! My most engaging course this semester, because I actually cared about what I was doing. This class will make you create content that you will be proud of!",
    "Absolutely recommend. The best journalism course at Yale: the toughest grading, the most demanding workload, the best in-class experience. We had A+ guest speakers throughout the year, from editors-in-chief and reporters at top-10 papers to industry executives looking to make change. Numerous field trips to NY only sweetened the deal.",
    "Yes!",
    "I could not recommend this course enough! This truly is a life-changing course. It opened my eyes to a world of other career options, and the amount of guest speakers and field trips we had just made the class even more special. Professor Herman is honestly one of the most amazing teachers I've ever had, and the amount of love he has for his craft and his students is just incredible. This class will open your eyes to a new world of writing and teach you so much about business and finance. By far one of my favorite (if not my favorite) courses at Yale.",
    "Absolutely! This seminar is fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone looking for an engaging seminar with an incredible professor.",
    "No unless you are really interested in journalism.",
    "Yes, its really a great class. Professor Herman makes it very special.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS!! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Herman is amazing. He cares so much about each of his students and takes the time to get to know everyone as individuals, a big improvement over many Yale professors. You'll learn a lot about journalism and covering business\/financial issues. Don't worry if you don't have any experience in either area. I did not, and I still learned a ton and was able to do well in the class. The assignments are super interesting, and there is lots of flexibility to write about what you find most interesting. There are also amazing guest speakers and field trips to New York. TAKE IT!",
    "For a prospective journalist (especially a prospective business journalist), this course is a must. Professor Herman is great, has a wide breadth of knowledge and experience, and the field trips and the guest speakers are fun. For someone just purely interested in the topic, I would definitely recommend taking the course, but I would warn that it is not that easy (Professor Herman has high expectations) and that is a class that you really should put 100% effort in in order to get everything out of it. This is a special type of Yale course."
