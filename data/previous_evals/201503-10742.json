    "Take it! If you're interested in men's health, inequality, marginalized groups, or inequalities. It was my favourite class this semester.",
    "I would recommend M&MH to anyone wishing to engage with feminist literature from the perspective of men. Masculinity is usually examined from women's point of view, and the often leaves out the complex ways that men embody and become socialized by masculinity. This course critically examines the formations of masculinities, how they're upheld in a gender systems, as well as how they are embodied in sickness and in health.",
    "Yes, take it if you can get in! You will learn so much.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gender and\/or health, and from any school at Yale. It would also be useful for anyone who might not be studying these issues directly but who is interested in broader questions of social justice. Marcia structures her course so that students from mixed backgrounds and studying different topics can all participate, though it is mainly an undergraduate course. The books are engaging and will definitely teach you something, and Marcia gives very helpful feedback on writing and how to think through the broader implications of a work as well as its specific contributions!",
    "It is, as Marcia says, a weekly book club about masculinity. Students lead discussions for each week and engage in the conversation. I would recommend it for anyone who is even remotely interested and has the time to really commit to the class.",
    "This class is partially an examination of masculinity, partially an examination of health issues affecting men, and partially a class on ethnography. Masculinity as a subject was addressed a bit each seminar, but ethnographic method and generally health issues affecting men were also discussed via the weekly ethnography. It was a sort of health and masculinity-oriented anthropology book club. I enjoyed it a lot; I wish there had been more theory addressing masculinity and gender, but I'm not sure there has been much theory written covering masculinity to begin with. Dr. Inhorn was great - I recommend the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to another student.",
    "A book a week. All of the texts are insightful. Take it if you're willing to do the work."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me think through my own research a lot, and helped me see where I can start applying broader debates around gender, sexuality, and health to my own specific project. Marcia's feedback is always valuable, and it was also useful to watch how she interacted with the undergraduate students and try to learn from her example for my own teaching!",
    "As an international public policy student, this course gave me a critical understanding of the pressures men face and the ways that they construct their identities in a variety of settings. This course should be required for anyone hoping to study or work in gender-related areas, and would be very important for anyone hoping to work in development or policy.",
    "It allowed to gauge a wide array of anthropologies of sexualities."
