   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Mme Sherak. You'll develop your French vocabulary A LOT and definitely improve your writing skill level. Also, the readings and movies for class are very interesting and make for great class discussions. Most of the class is focused on class discussion with a little bit of grammar review as well. Overall, a great introductory course for L5 French courses.",
    "Take it if you have not had too much French. There are other classes with more reading and more speaking work, but it hits all the bases of film, literature, grammar, and speaking.",
    "If you want to read more texts and learn more grammar, go for it. However, this is not the kind of class you want to take if you want more conversation and real-life language skills.",
    "It's basically a review of advanced French grammar (tested through 4 tests), lots of readings, and 4 papers. It was all manageable though. I hadn't taken French in a while, so this class was a great refresher, and I feel like my French significantly improved just throughout the semester.",
    "yes, would recommend",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who wants to read different books in French and watch films. They are not always the best choice but it does help build your vocabulary."
