    "Only take it if you have had some background in French. Most people in the class already came in with some French, and it's a very difficult class for those who didn't. So unless you are willing to work extremely hard for a good grade, don't take it without taking French previously. Other than that, it's a good course.",
    "French 110 is a fast-paced, immersion-based intro class. The workload is heavy and the tests are weekly. It is an intense course, but absolutely worth it if you want to learn French.",
    "YES!",
    "Take Madame Hoffmanns section!",
    "you learn basic grammatical structures in french through pierre capretz's \"french in action platform\".",
    "FREN 110 was a basic introductory course. Participation was extremely important and class attendance was one of the most instrumental parts of being successful in the class. I would recommend it- although it was a little tough I learned a lot.",
    "A great introductory class that leaves you being able to hold elementary french conversations. There is a consistent workload that will leave you with about an hour of homework a night if you actually do it all, but it is well worth it.",
    "If you have had some prior experience with French, take this class. However, if you have had no experience with the French language, and you are just looking to fulfill your language requirement, do not take this course (unless you feel you learn languages easily). The weekly tests and never-ending workbook lessons are exhausting. Really make sure you have the best possible section for this course as well; it makes all the difference.",
    "If you want to learn French, take this class. It's a lot of work - workbook pages, compositions, quizzes, and weekly tests, but it's not overwhelming.",
    "I didn't have a great experience. You learn French but there a bunch of huge problems with the way the course is run (see above)"
