   "comments": [
    "I think the course sometimes jumped into material assuming that students had encountered it before, such as IPA or Reconstruction. There seemed to be a slight mismatch between what was taught in lecture and the problem sets.",
    "The course is amazing, as it takes you through the most important concepts of historical linguistics and builds a nice flow between them. The professor is excellent. Also, the feedback was great. The TA was very helpful and motivating.",
    "I believe that sections and assignments were not very aligned with the lectures, so perhaps that could be improved upon. Otherwise, it was a very good and informative course!",
    "There wasn't a huge amount of overlap between the homework assignments and the course content, which lessened the incentives to come to, and pay attention in, class. The work also felt like it was graded at an unfair standard for an introductory class, although that could be the TF as much as anything. The content was extremely interesting though."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It was interesting and I received good feedback.",
    "Though Professor Bowern is very knowledgeable in her field, this class is not suitable for those without significant background in linguistics and requires a lot of self-direction since some assignments are vague and do a poor job of evaluating learning and understanding.",
    "Recommended for STEM majors who need a Wr credit. Problem sets are very logical and writing light.",
    "Absolutely. This course is unique and wonderful. You'll learn so much and challenge yourself so much that by the end of the course you'll be surprised by how much you've improved. The professor is superb and the TA super helpful. This course is a gem.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was very fascinating, and both the content and professor are very interesting, but I would warn against thinking that just because it is an intro-level class, it is a gut. You need to put a fair amount of work in, but in the end it's a good introduction to historical linguistics, and linguistics as a whole."
