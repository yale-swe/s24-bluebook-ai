   "comments": [
    "Very poorly organized class; lectures were not clear at all. Professor often went on tangents that made it difficult to grasp main points. The biggest problem was that the professor seemed unprepared \/ without a coherent plan for lectures, which resulted in very little actual teaching during class. I did not learn much in this class.",
    "This class, though advertised as an AI class, is only about natural language processing and grammars. Take it if you're interested in that (since there's no other course you can take on that subject)",
    "Prolog is fun (first half of course), but the course slows down considerably after that. 5-6 psets, 1 midterm, 1 final, all extremely variant in difficulty. Pick Prof. McDermott's brain about philosophy instead, and you'll find that the class was worth it.",
    "Absolutely not, unless you need an extra CS credit. This course isn't much work at all. That's why I took it. 6 psets that each take 4 hours, plus a midterm and a final. While the psets were graded really easily, the midterm and final were unpredictable, so the grades might not be as easy to come by. As a course itself, this is poorly organized, lectures are pretty redundant with the reading, and expectations are unclear. Seriously, only take this course if you need it.",
    "I think it is a good elective, and it's on the easy side, so if you need a few easy CS credits, you should take it. The problem sets were kind of fun, and not too difficult, too.",
    "Probably don't take. You won't come away with any real understanding of AI. Not a very hard class, but still stressful because lectures were so hard to understand",
    "This class has nothing to do with Artificial Intelligence. It is a class on natural language processing and logic, as well as the half-idiotic half-elegant functional programming logic language called Prolog. If you are someone that likes going to lecture, I would not recommend this class. But if you are someone who just does the psets and crams for the final and you are in need of a CS elective, the pickings are pretty slim so why not.",
    "This course should have been called computational semantics rather than artificial intelligence. There was very little about general AI, and a lot about prolog and semantics. If this is what you're into, great. If not, I would not recommend taking it. Prolog is a huge pain, the problem sets were not clear, and to me, semantics is a boring field.",
    "I read the reviews for this class before I took it, and I thought \"it really couldn't be that bad.\" I was wrong. This class was honestly terrible. Lectures were completely useless and made no sense, problem sets were not at all illustrative of the concepts we \"learned\" in class, and the final was confusing and difficult. Yes, it's very little work, but I would have much rather taken CPSC 323 over again instead of taking this dumb class. I learned absolutely nothing about artificial intelligence. Do not take this class. Period.",
    "Much more computational linguistics than machine learning.",
    "Deceptively hard and frustrating. Although you do learn some fun things.",
    "What you learn in this class will be largely left to the whims of professor McDermott. His syllabus literally said \"there may be 5 or 6 problem sets but that does not mean there will be.\" Expect this level of disorganization throughout the class. Combined with a draconian late policy (not given to you until after shopping period), you'll be quite frustrated by the end of the semester."
