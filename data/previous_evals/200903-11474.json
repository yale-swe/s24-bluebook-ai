    "I would recommend it. Problems sets are challenging but doable. Class is not thrilling but that just comes with the topic.",
    "This course is mainly about MRI with some guest lecturers about PET and fluorescence. The class is interesting and now I have a feel for an area of BME that I wasn't necessarily focused on. The class has a problem set a week, a take home midterm and final and a final paper. The workload is pretty light throughout the semester, but at the end you have a large paper. I would recommend this class as another BME elective. Also, the professor\/TA are very accessible and willing to meet after class for help.",
    "Take it if you need another bme elective.",
    "It is a survey of biomedical imaging devices.",
    "The course work is very manageable. A problem set almost every week, two take home tests, and a final paper. The course is designed to show how different sensing and imaging devices work from a mathematical and engineering perspective. Make sure you see the professor and teaching fellow for extra help, they are very helpful."
