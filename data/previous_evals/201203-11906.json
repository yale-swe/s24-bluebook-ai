    "Take this class if you have programming experience and like math! I have one of the characteristics, and not the other. While I found the course incredibly interesting, I just had a really, really hard time (in more descriptive terms, I've died and been emotionally reborn more times than I'd like to remember during the course of this semester, and never as a phoenix but always as some withering, lame rodent, limping and bracing myself for the next problem set).There is a lot of overlap with Stat 238, but I've heard it's actually useful to take both courses at once.",
    "Excellent course that really compliments the computer science major. In addition to the linguistics basics, you also cover material with closer ties to computer science in great detail. For example, whereas the into AI course in the computer science department only covers parsing and HMMs very briefly (a few minutes at most) you spend multiple lectures on both topics in this course and actually learn\/implement interesting and useful algorithms.",
    "If you can program well (in any language - the first two weeks of the course are a primer on Python), and know some absolutely basic linguistics (read the chapter summaries of any textbook), this course will be a great experience. Grading in this course is very generous, though the exams are kind of a bear (but they only constitute 30% of the grade combined, so it's not too bad). This course exposes you to many of the Big Ideas in modern linguistics and certain subfields of computer science, and provides you with a great jumping-off point for any future studies into machine learning, NLP, etc.",
    "The class is sort of backwards. The homework and tests are strangely fun, but the lectures aren't. If you enjoy programming, the problem sets will be especially fun. If you know how to program, then the problem sets are easy too, which is a bonus.",
    "Great programming class! And I emphasize that it is a programming class. I would say that for someone who's looking to explore programming outside the CS department, this course is the way to go. Also, if you are only going to take one programming class at Yale, take this over CS201. Gaja is a bit timid of a lecturer, but her powerpoints are all online and they're great. The exams aren't too bad, and the p-sets are pretty fun.",
    "If you've got any interest in linguistics and some programming experience, this is a great course! You go through lots of different areas of computational linguistics, from spell-checking to sentence parsing, so it's a good overview of the field. There are programming assignments every 1 1\/2 to 2 weeks, which are really fun and not that hard. You don't need to know Python specifically (the first few weeks are an intro to Python) but you should have at least a little programming experience. You also get 10 \"flex days\" that you can use to extend the deadline for any assignment, which is very generous. There's a midterm and a final, both short and not too hard. Attending lecture is important though, because the concepts can be pretty abstract but Gaja explains them well and works through specific examples.",
    "Really great course! Covers a lot of materials interesting to both Linguists and CS kids. But definitely know how to program before! This course does a lot of programming and if you are constantly struggling to learn how to program before engaging the material itself, it'll be hard",
    "Ling 227 is a fun course. As long as you have some programming experience, it's not too difficult and gives you good exposure to techniques in computational linguistics. It's a fairly specific field, but it is interesting and rewarding. Gaja Jarosz is great, too. Definitely recommend this class."
