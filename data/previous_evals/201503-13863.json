   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course! It's unlike anything I've taken at Yale. When else would you get to work with former WSJ reporters and editors, tour the Buzzfeed newsroom, or have your articles critiqued by a former columnist?",
    "Highly recommend even if not interested in pursuing a journalism career.",
    "Would recommend credit D for an easy 5th class. Only 1 meeting per week and you definitely do not have to do any of the readings.",
    "Without a doubt. The only hesitation I have is that the Friday visits to New York are one of the best parts of the course, so if you cannot make them, you should wait for your courses to line up better so you can. The field trips were time consuming, but absolutely amazing and should not be missed.",
    "This class is awesome -- but not in the ways that you think going into it. The writing assignments are fun, but time intensive if you do them well. Only take the class if you're going to have fun writing papers that involve interviewing people and being creative -- otherwise you're not taking full advantage of this class. The field trips are incredible, not only because of the awesome places you'll visit (Buzzfeed, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, etc.), but you'll get tight with the rest of the class and get to know Professor Herman very well.",
    "If you are very dedicated to journalism and want to practice your craft, there are other and better classes to take. If you are looking for a more cursory overview of the industry, or enjoy being starstruck at Yale, this is for you.",
    "This is a hidden gem in the Yale Bluebook. The course will allow you to meet heavy-hitters in the fields of journalism, business and politics - and interact with New York newsrooms and heavy-hitters in the press directly. The projects you'll get to do are exciting, captivating and very hands-on, and Tom Herman provides impeccable feedback. This is a brilliant course that's fun and low-stress. HIGHLY recommended.",
    "Definitely a journalism class that anyone remotely interested in the subject should take. Professor Herman is an expert with so much insight and knowledge.",
    "Yes, TAKE IT! It will be one of the best classes you'll ever take at Yale. It might be impossible to find someone with a bigger heart than Professor Herman. He cares so much about his students and will go above and beyond to help them succeed. He lives in NYC and commutes to campus once a week, but he will always make time to sit down with a student (before class, after class, over lunch\/dinner) to talk to them about anything, from concepts learned in class to life lessons. If you're ever lost in NYC, he tells us, please don't hesitate to reach me via cell phone and I will come find you. Almost every week, he brings in an incredible guest speaker, usually someone very high up in the ranks of the journalism industry and very difficult to access, much less reel into speak to college students. He also somehow always convinces top editors to book an two-hour long meeting with us tudents when he takes us on exclusive trips to see cool institutions like The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Stock Exchange, and Buzzfeed on his own time. Professor Herman is so selfless in the way that he will pull all the strings he can for his students. Professor Herman is at Yale for only part of each year, as he also teaches at the Columbia School of Journalism and the University of San Diego, so we're very lucky to have him for the short time that we do.",
    "CSMC 330 is an excellent course, probably the best I have taken at Yale. First off, Professor Herman is terrificwarm, thoughtful, and engaging. His genuine passion and excitement for journalism is infectious. In addition, he gives interesting assignments and invites amazing guest speakers (Howard Dean, Paul Steiger, Joanne Lipman, and Jim Chanos, among others). The class trips (to the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Buzzfeed, NYSE, etc.) are also incredible. You will learn a ton and have a great time in the process. Highly, highly recommended!",
    "Take it! It will be your best class at Yale!",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this class to anyone with even the slightest interest in journalism and the economy. Professor Herman is an incredible teacher and does everything in his power to help you succeed. Class trips to the Wall Street Journal, Buzzfeed, Bloomberg and the New York Times along with visits and discussions with distinguished guests were also highlights."
