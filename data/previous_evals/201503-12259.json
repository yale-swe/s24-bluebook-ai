   "comments": [
    "I would recommend for a student with cellular\/molecular or animal research interests.",
    "It is a class that aims to prepare you to read and discuss papers on the topic of neuroscience. I actually think this class is the most important and most useful class of the first semester of graduate school although I feel it could be improved.",
    "You're going to have to take this course and you'll get out of it what you put into it. Do your best to encourage others to be active participants in the discussions. No one benefits if the students are too quiet.",
    "NSCI 501 is a very helpful course for anyone interested in doing neuroscience research. I learned so many different research techniques, as well as how to write as a researcher (effectively and concisely) and how to ask pertinent questions. Just be warned that, if you are an MD\/PhD student, it takes a lot of time away from studying for your medical school classes. I put more effort into this class than I did any of my med school classes.",
    "This is a course focusing on reading about various topics in neuroscience, discussing research articles and writing constructive critique. It is a very helpful course that I strongly recommend for all first year neuroscience students.",
    "It is a really good course where you can learn most updated research in many different fields.",
    "Yes. This course is useful and interesting."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the cellular and molecular techniques (e.g., Ca2+ imaging, patch-clamp recording, staining, etc.) To be honest, it was a struggle keeping up with some of the jargon used in these fields, but ultimately I feel more prepared to talk about this research than when I began the course. However, the majority of the topics discussed do not relate to my research.",
    "This course provided me with a more in-depth look at a breadth of neuroscience that is not possible in many other classes. It prepared me to read and critically analyze papers which will be important for my research and dissertation in the future.",
    "Certainly deepened my knowledge of a wide variety of neuroscience disciplines. Minor usefulness to my research though.",
    "Extremely helpful. I definitely can write and think scientifically a lot better than I could back in August.",
    "It exposed me to many important research topics in neuroscience and the approaches applied, which together with the experimental design will help my research.",
    "It helps me improving my writing skills.",
    "While I enjoyed the course, most of its didactic information is a repeat of undergraduate material.",
    "I learned about a lot of new research methods in neuroscience and the pros and cons of the various methods. The weekly papers were helpful for practicing my writing and ability to think critically about research papers."
