    "A lot of work, but worth the effort. My french improved very much,",
    "This is a great class--a lot of tedious work but well worth it. Madame Burton is a funny lady and this class, though early in the morning, was never one I considered skipping. The tests are low stress and the class work is engaging. You read l'etranger, le petit nicolas and m.ibrahim and you watch two films, l'argent de poche and jules et jim. This class will require 1-2 hours of work every night, however, so be sure you have time in your schedule.",
    "A solid, if work-intensive, course in intermediate French. The work is not difficult, but it can feel sort of unrelenting, so do be wary of the credit-and-a-halfness. It's real. But that's why it's so successful. Madame Burton was solid and nurturing, take it with her if you can.",
    "yeah, a good transition from high school french to yale french.a lot of work though. daily work.yale french is the best in the country. take advantage of that.",
    "French 130 has a lot of work but is very manageable. The books you read and movies you watch cover a lot of different subject material.",
    "This is an amazing course, I learned more in three months here than I did in 4 years in high school. There is a lot of daily work, but it's fairly constant so you always know what to expect. I would recommend it highly, but it is one of the most intensive classes I've taken so far.",
    "French 130 is a great course, very informative. It is a lot of work but very worthwhile."
