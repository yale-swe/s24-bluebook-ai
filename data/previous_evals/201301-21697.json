   "comments": [
    "you have to take it so good luck. it's fun but, you get a B+ in the end.",
    "It is a relatively easy course with regards to both subject matter and workload. The experiments themselves are not that interesting and focus more on the basics than on actual experimental work.",
    "PHYS 205L is definitely a very tough course. It assumes a lot of knowledge and understanding of equipment that you most likely have never encountered. The final is also brutal and I just did not feel prepared for it because the course was so rushed that I never got the chance to completely understand all of the procedures we went through. Although it is permitted, I highly recommend NOT taking this course if you are only in PHYS180\/181",
    "Take 205 if you need it for your major, otherwise I'm not sure you'd gain much from it. It's a pretty standard intro physics lab, and the workload is certainly manageable (only a couple homework assignments outside of class, but all data collection and write-ups are done during lab). Occasionally, finishing the lab on time was an issue, but usually everything is pretty straight forward. The worst part about this lab was having to walk up science hill in heavy rain and\/or snow. In general, the assignments are easy, the labs are useful (though occasionally boring), and the exam is fair.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. There's really not much I can say except that it's not exactly the most fun lab, but you might pick up a few ideas and skills that will be useful later in life.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to for your major. You won't be overwhelmed, but you also probably won't enjoy yourself.",
    "If you are reading this, you likely have to take this class. I won't lie to you and say it is a fun class, but a good TA can make all the difference. If you don't like your TA, consider moving to a different day.",
    "205 lab is an interesting low key introduction to lab work. The labs are not too difficult, but you never have enough time and the grading is not very consistent.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Labs are no fun.",
    "The content of the course is cool: lab work is tremendously satisfying, and you get to play with some fun equipment. The structure of the course is more frustrating. Although there's very little work outside of class, the labs themselves feel hectic and stressful, and the grading is pretty mysterious.",
    "Please only take this if you are CERTAIN you are a physics major, engineering major, or on the pre-med track (and have to have lab as a pre-req). As a non-physics major, I found that even though I liked the labs and learned some new things, I really felt I had wasted a class just because of how specialized it is. How much you like this class will also depend on whether or not your TF grades harshly, because it gets demoralizing\/stressful when your TF continually grades on a B+ scale.",
    "Take it if you must. Not a huge time commitment but a bit tough in terms of grading because it is on a curve. Tough to finish labs on time and your grade gets docked if you finish late",
    "Nobody takes a lab because they want to, and this class is no exception. The labs are long, and needing to finish after class is always a possibility. The plus side is that, for the most part, preparation outside of class is somewhat minimal.",
    "This is one of the few lab courses that comes close to actually being .5 credits. Almost all the work happens during lab, so you don't have to write lab reports outside of class. There is a little bit of homework on statistics, and a weekly classesV2 quiz that actually takes a lot of time, but it's a lot more manageable than other labs. The experiments are interesting, but the lab is a little stressful because there's never quite enough time and you have to write an abridged lab report in your notebook during class. Overall, though, I would recommend this lab.",
    "It's hard to know whether I would recommend this over the lower level lab, but I had a pretty good experience overall. Not having write-ups is great, the quizes feel low-stress, and a lot of the experiments are pretty fun. Perfecting your lab notebook is hard, but I think the same is true of the other lab. I didn't have a great experience with the practical but I think this could have been improved if I had been more careful during labs (learn how to use the multimeter! It's deceptively simple yet evil.)",
    "If you struggle understanding some of the concepts in Physics like I did, lab really helps to understand some of the physical implications and how it works in the real world! I just wish we had some more time to actually enjoy the labs as opposed to rushing through them constantly.",
    "if you gotta take it take it",
    "I would recommend this lab if you need it. Time wise it is rushed and can get stressful nearing the end of a lab when you still have two sections to go and only 15 minutes. Raphael was a decent TA but it was his first semester TA~ing the class so he was also learning along side my class. The professor does not talk or do much so don't expect anything from him\/her. Most of your help will be from your TA\/classmates.",
    "If necessary take it. If not, don't.",
    "I can't say I'd recommend it, but it's kind of necessary if you're planning on being a physics major. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother with it.",
    "It is a requirement, and try to take it with a small section or with some people that you know.",
    "I actually really enjoyed taking this lab and I feel that I learned a lot. Compared to Chemistry labs, these labs are completely self-contained. So beyond the three hours or so of the lab, you don't have to do a separate write up, which is really nice.However, once the labs start, you don't get a single break all the way through till the end!",
    "Take it for your major, otherwise don't. You learn some useful material that you probably won't study in an intro physics class (DC\/AC circuits, oscilloscopes), but every lab is a rush to finish, and grading is largely arbitrary (and a bit harsh).",
    "No. Do not take this unless it is absolutely necessary.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you need it as a prerequisite. It's mildly interesting, but somewhat tedious.",
    "I very much recommend this lab course. Although I found the labs challenging at times, I feel like I learned a lot and got a lot out of the course.",
    "Physics lab 205 is pretty fun. You get to play with lenses, circuits, and radioactive decay, which is pretty swagged out. We made a telescope. It was sweet. I creeped on someone across the room. Really though it's very little work outside of the actual lab time, which is awesome. You still learn a lot from it.",
    "The labs were almost always interesting and not extremely stressful. There isn't much homework outside of lab outside of reading the handout beforehand and doing a short quiz so it's very manageable.",
    "If you have to take this class, then take it, but try your hardest to get Sandweiss, because he is by far the most helpful instructor."
