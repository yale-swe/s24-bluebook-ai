    "As an economics major, this class provided an interesting perspective on the economy that my econ classes did not provide. It helped me analyze the economy in a different way and made me more away of topics like discrimination. It is not too much work, as the papers do not require any research and the readings were not too onerous. The readings were at time technical but mostly pretty interesting. If you want to look at the economy from a different perspective, or want a writing credit that is not too much work, I would recommend this course",
    "Interesting course, worth taking if you're interested in the subject",
    "SOCY 321 is a survey course of topics in Economic sociology. Some sections are more interesting than others, but as long as you do the reading, you should be on track. Make sure to participate in the class discussion, otherwise class won't be so interesting! The class is not too much work (three papers).",
    "I hope that future sections are more invested in the class. This is a class that relies on strong discussion, which this section for the most part lacked. If you do not sense that yours is, I would not recommend the class. If you do, however, I would suggest you make your decision primarily on the syllabus. If you find the readings interesting and are wiling to write a LOT, go for it. Otherwise, you will find the class dull, as I know some did.",
    "Great class, definitely take it.",
    "Fantastic course at the intersection of sociology and economics. A seminar, so quality of discussion will vary depending on how excited (and prepared) everyone is. Professors were good at facilitating discussion. I was not a sociology major, but as someone who hasn't looked at economics from this perspective, I found it very enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. There is a bit of writing but it's pretty straightforward, and the final project proposal is pretty fun and brings the class together."
