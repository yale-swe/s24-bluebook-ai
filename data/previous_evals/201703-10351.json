    "Yes but with caution. This is the first class that \"low workload\" did NOT correlate with an easy class. Over a third of the class was composed of PhD students who want to pursue a similar field for a living. As a result, the exams were challenging and not curved unless someone didn't get a 100 (which someone always did). I took the class Cr\/D and that was a fantastic decision on my part, who came in knowing nothing about specimen identification. Also, the class is less a mammology course and far more an anthropology course with a smattering of fun facts about an animal.",
    "Yes! Take it-- there': no other class like it! Both labs and lectures will leave you feeling fresh and inspired.",
    "Absolutely, but only if you are entirely committed to it going in.",
    "Yes, definitely. Should be offered in several sections for more people."
