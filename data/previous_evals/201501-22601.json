   "comments": [
    "An amazing class. One of the best you'll take at Yale. Do it.",
    "A must take class! Professor Latham is amazing and his lectures are even better. My favorite class at Yale so far!",
    "Absolutely would recommend this class. Very interesting material and a great professor.",
    "yes! so interesting!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that this is very important material, and that even if you aren't interested in the law, learning how the law in relation to health has changed over the years is very interesting.",
    "If they stop grading so harsh - YES! Interesting and not confusing",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. If you're interested at all in law, this is a class to take. It is an interesting and fairly straightforward approach to law and interweaves some thought-provoking bioethics questions and themes.",
    "This class covers a wide range of bioethics topics and examines the laws that govern them. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested, even if they have no previous background in law. The class is very interesting.",
    "Plsc 257 gives an overview of the ethical and legal issues in modern bioethics. There are two exams and one paper in addition to readings. The material is interesting regardless of one's field of study, and I would recommend this course as a fun and easy lecture for anyone who doesn't feel immediately repulsed by the notion of reading court opinions.",
    "Good class. Really interesting topic",
    "Pretty easy course, the material is interesting for the most part and Latham is an amazing lecturer. Take it!",
    "totally!!! a subject matter that all individuals should explore, offered in a great setting",
    "Latham is one of the best lecturers I've had in the past 6 semesters here at Yale. He has the ability to orate for 50 minutes and keep you engrossed. There's a significant amount of reading, but going to class should help you get around all of that. Other than the reading, there's one midterm paper (5-7 pages), a midterm, and a final. Both the midterm & paper were graded pretty strictly but the TF's have been saying that the final will be much more lenient. Regardless of grades (and regardless of how uninteresting bioethics may sound), TAKE THIS CLASS. Shop it, at the very least. Latham is one of those professors that can make even the most boring topics come to life. If you're worried about your GPA, start it Cr\/D and wait for the midterm & paper to come back before deciding whether or not to switch.",
    "Great class, you learn really interesting stuff about our healthcare system and legal system and it is a lot of fun.",
    "This class is kind of overrated, to be honest. I don't think you actually learn a ton.",
    "Very large lecture w section.",
    "Highly recommend it - as a pre-med student it was a great social science credit and very interesting if you will be heading into medicine.",
    "Ok class. Not an easy A but interesting material",
    "Great class! Super interesting -- pretty much everyone has to deal with bioethics at some point in their lives. Highly recommended",
    "Take this class! You will be an above-average student (AT LEAST) by doing what's expected of you! Go to class, pay attention, take notes, read (at least most) of the assigned casebook readings, glance at the supplemental stuff, and go to section. The midterm felt frantic, but by relying on my course knowledge, it went very well. TFs are also receptive to the arguments that you make in your very short, 5-7 page paper.",
    "Amazing. Latham is a great lecturer- probably one of the best I have had at Yale. The exams are extremely fair and all of the topics and related cases that we discuss in class are extremely interesting and thought-provoking. I went to the lectures and did the readings because I genuinely enjoyed them. Regardless of your major, you should absolutely take this class before you graduate",
    "Bioethics and Law was a really good class. I took it for kicks to fill out my schedule. Although it wasn't a tough class and I did none of the reading, I still went to every lecture I was in town for and never zoned out while taking notes- they're that engaging.",
    "Definitely would recommend - a must-take course at some point at Yale. The professor is incredible, the material is fascinating, and the work load is very manageable. Absolutely great course!",
    "It's a wonderful class and everyone should take it!",
    "If you are in search of The Law, steer clear. Do not be fooled by Professor Latham's acting performances in opening lectures; the bulk of your semester will be spent staring at a book full of laws that your corporate finance lawyer or medical school TF grade according to their own respective fields. Little intellectual freedom exists, unless couched in trigger warnings. The argument that a logical corollary of the right to life is a right to die, for example, receives the \"gotcha!\" remark that \"you must have erred, then assisted suicide could be legal.\" Many seemed to retain their dignity and enjoy Prof. Latham by taking Credit\/D.",
    "amazing",
    "Solid large lecture, interesting material, super-easy as a credit\/d but also interesting enough to be rewarding. Latham is clear and easy to follow as a lecture. As with all classes of its size, sometimes feels like cattle herding (i.e. during exams).",
    "Take it only if you plan to go to class. If you're going to miss Latham's lecture and study from your friend's notes; don't bother taking this class. If you plan to attend all lectures, it will be a great experience.",
    "This course is amazing. The workload is pretty small, since most of the reading just affirms what Professor Latham says in class. However, that means that the grade consists entirely of a midterm, an essay, and the final exam, which can be a bit nerve-wracking. Overall, the topics are extremely interesting and Professor Latham is a great lecturer.",
    "Very cool class and cool topic. The lectures are for the most part really interesting, and we touch on major bioethical issues such as informed consent, abortion, end of life care, and assisted reproductive technologies. There is very little work needed for this class. The grade is based entirely on the midterm, a 5-7 page paper, and a final. You can definitely get by without doing any of the readings or even getting the book because the midterm and final are essay exams and the questions are for the most part about large themes. If you go to all the lectures and take notes, the exams should be really reasonable.",
    "Amazing lectures with interesting and sometimes controversial topics. Professor is the best professor I've had in 3 years at Yale. Would recommend for everyone to take before graduating.",
    "The class is extremely interesting. I loved the topics that we discussed and Professor Latham discussed them in a manner that was appealing and approachable. I wish that he would write more things down, such as the names of the cases (I thought that the Schiavo case was Shybow based on his pronunciation), but it wasn't too difficult to find the correct spelling online or in the back of the textbook. My only qualm is that for a course that says that no you don't need any law background the grading was a bit questionable. I found that the TA's expected analyses that reflected a level of legal knowledge that someone who has never taken a law course wouldn't have.",
    "Great overview of pertinent and interesting issues in bioethics and public health law.",
    "Take the class! You learn about fascinating, relevant issues in bioethics, and Latham might be the best lecturer I've ever encountered at Yale (I'm a senior). There's barely any work -- case reading every week, one short paper (5-7 pgs), and a midterm and final. A great way to be introduced to America's legal system as well.",
    "YES take it. great class.",
    "Bioethics and Law is a very interesting lecture and highlights several important biomedical issues that should be thought through. I highly suggest",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I loved the material and class discussions.",
    "I recommend it if you're interested in bioethics or law school (this gives you a small taste of what it's like) but be prepared for some rather arbitrary grading--this class is definitely not a gut\/easy A.",
    "A fantastic course, would definitely recommend it to every student at Yale, regardless of their major. Prof. Latham is an excellent lecturer and the workload is just right.",
    "Professor Latham is an excellent lecturer. I definitely enjoyed taking the class. You learn about interesting questions in healthcare and the law. For instance, when is assisted suicide permissible? Do states have a right to take your organs when you die? Can you refuse life-sustaining medical treatment?",
    "Pretty good; especially solid CR\/D. Interesting and important material, relatively light courseload. Might be hard to get an A, but a great fifth class CR\/D.",
    "take it. take it. take it.",
    "TAKE IT! It's super interesting! I always found myself talking about the class and the different cases to my friends.",
    "I would for sure recommend this course. People claim it is an \"Easy 5th class\" but that is not true. Getting an A is not easy. I suggest taking it credit\/D if you can. I loved the content and the professor was great.",
    "Take it, good class. Learn about the law son",
    "I know most people took this class as a gut, but honestly, in my time at Yale, I've never felt more engaged by such a large lecture class. Professor Latham doesn't rush through material; he repeats what he's said a couple of times to make sure you get it in the no-slides-just-lecture teaching approach. Take good notes and you'll be awesome (aka, it only took one day to study for the final if you just read your notes a couple of times). Great gut class if that's what you want, but for me, I recommend taking it to learn a lot. It was important to me!",
    "Awesome course, highly highly recommend",
    "Great class. Can apply to current events as well. Lectures are very interesting.",
    "Great class in which you will learn extremely useful information. Try to get a good TA.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Full disclosure, I only went to one lecture after Spring Break, but from before, Latham was a very good and interesting lecturer. Still, I think I did well because I studied my butt off to make up for it. Don't do what I did, it's a waste of one of your classes at Yale (you only get 36 or fewer!). Go to lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 257. Not only is Latham a great lecturer, but the class material itself is very interesting. It does not require a lot of work. If you go to lecture everyday, then you will do fine in the class.",
    "Take it! Material is extremely interesting and well taught! Final is worth 50% of your grade though..",
    "Low workload, interesting lectures, interesting readings (that you don't really have to do), interesting discussions. You can't go wrong.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to another student! It's not too much work and it's a great 5th credit.",
    "Awesome course (especially for Cr\/D). Great entertaining lecturers and not so much work.",
    "Definitely a must take at Yale. It is interesting and doesn't involve too much work or reading. It is a little harder than most people think it is to get an A so don't come into it think it is an easy class",
    "YES YES YES. Best class I have taken at Yale so far. Great Credit\/D if you're looking for a fun fifth class. Engaging lectures with a super star professor. One paper, midterm, and final--all very straight forward. Must take.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Wonderful class with minimal work until studying for the midterm\/final\/writing the essay. Super interesting.",
    "Yes, everything should know the basics of American healthcare. Plus the class is really fun.",
    "Coming into the class as an international student, I had only a foggy idea of how the U.S. legal and healthcare systems were like. But Professor Lathams a great lecturer and he did a great job of making the material accessible and appealing. Its really up to you how much of the case book you want to read, but its actually really interesting reading those cases, learning about the stories behind them and looking at how the courts really made their decisions.",
    "Really good class. Latham is an excellent lecturer, and manages to keep the large number of students in his lectures engaged. You learn a ton about the American health and legal system, and gan practice thinking in a more legal oriented way. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Recommend!! One of the most interesting classes I've taken so far. Professor is great at lecturing despite huge class size. 1 midterm, 1 paper, and 1 final, which were fair",
    "Really fun and interesting class. Latham is a great lecturer, and if you can get a law school student then section is good too. There is really not that material which makes studying for tests pretty manageable, but it seemed like grading has gotten a bit stricter than recent years. Definitely not an easy A, but definitely still reccomend!",
    "Really chill and interesting, would recommend!",
    "Great class. Fascinating topic. Latham is an incredible lecturer and bioethics \/ public health law is controversial material. Take it Credit\/D if you can for the full experience, or else that 50% final will take a lot of preparation.",
    "Bioethics is a great class! The material is relevant and interesting and Latham is an excellent lecturer. An excellent 5th class with a manageable workload. Previous knowledge of law not needed, but wouldn't hurt.",
    "It gives an overview of bioethical issues in the legal context.",
    "This course is an amazing course that allows students to engage in legal biomedical issues. Professor Latham is a great lecturer and the topics covered are fascinating. Moreover, the workload is manageable and accessible. I definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in the topics, especially premeds!",
    "EVERYONE should take this class just to be a more educated member of society. The topics are all interesting, no matter what your primary field of interest is. Latham is an amazing lecturer and so easy to learn from.",
    "Would recommend taking credit D so that you don't worry about the section curve since test and essay grading are arbitrary.",
    "Great class, great lecture, excellent class for my last semester",
    "I would recommend this course. The material is really interesting and PRofessor Latham is an awesome lecturer. You'll cover material including abortion, stem cell research, cloning, organ transplantation, public health and more. The material is really relevant and provoking. However, don't just take this as an easy gut. I think this year they've tried to make this class harder. A lot of my friends and I received grades lower than we thought we deserved with little feedback. That being said, my TA was great and discussion sections were interesting.",
    "Take it! Very interesting topics, and if you are interested in case law you'll enjoy the readings. Latham is a great lecturer so it isn't hard to attend the classes. Very doable workload, with one midterm, one final, and a short paper.",
    "Giant lecture course, but Professor Latham is a great lecturer -- you will want to go to class. The material is interesting as well.",
    "Overall a pretty good course! Know that this course had over 500+ students in Spring 2015, so its not as personal during class lecture. However, one of the coolest parts is the TAs all of whom are from the law school and are pretty cool people who are genuinely passionate about law :) I wish Professor Latham had a bit more structure during his class lectures (he has no PPT slides, essentially just talks the entire time), but besides that, the material and topics were really interesting!",
    "Fantastic class that is a nice, basic introduction to bioethics. Would definitely recommend you take it. I loved looking over bioethics cases and learning how the field has evolved over the past several years. It's not too much work, but just enough work to make sure you learn a good amount about bioethics and the law!",
    "Very very interesting material and easy enough if you show up to lecture (you don't really need to do the readings).",
    "Take it",
    "If another student is really interested in bioethics, I would, but overall I kind of wish I had taken another class that lined up with my interests a little better and maybe I would have gotten more out of. Overall, a good class to take credit\/d\/fail.",
    "A fantastic option for a 5th (or 6th if so daring) class. Stephen Latham is one of the best lecturers you'll have here, and the material we discuss is just really relevant to problems we talk about every day. The readings are helpful but definitely not necessary, and the workload is VERY low. Also, if you're a STEM major, you need a social sciences credit!",
    "PLSC 257 is a very engaging course from which you will get the best understanding by keeping up with readings as the course progresses. By examining the legal basis for certain policies and decisions, and seeing how they might change over time, you will get a better understanding of how and why the American healthcare system works the way it does.",
    "Take it for a great overview of the state of bioethics and public health in the US",
    "Would definitely recommend this course to anyone, especially pre-meds who might actually have to face these issues in the future. The course is interesting, well-taught, and is very manageable in terms of workload. It's a great addition to your schedule (especially as a 5th class) because it's so interesting and not at all overwhelming work-wise.",
    "The material is really interesting - but make sure you get a good TA it makes all the difference. .",
    "Bioethics was a great class to add to an already hectic semester. It's midterm, 5-7 page paper, final. When I took it, the midterm and paper were both in the weeks leading up to spring break, so after spring break it was pretty smooth sailing. But don't be fooled! Keep going to lecture. Attending lecture is the only thing you need to do in order to do well in this class. I never bought the textbook (it's really expensive), and just planned to share a copy with a friend, but I only ended up needing to look at it to find a paper topic. Latham is an amazing lecturer, at least for the first half of the semester. He's incredibly organized and succinct, as well as compelling in rhetoric and content. The second half of the semester went a little down hill, as he started repeating himself a lot or going a little off topic. Still worth it though. Even if his tangents aren't on the final, they're still incredibly interesting (think Obamacare). I had Ben as a TF; I think he's graduating from the Law School after this year but if not, get into his section. Maybe its just the law student thing, but he had an great working knowledge of the material themes and of the cases. He did a great job explaining legal terms and precedents to all of us non-law students, and was pretty funny in section. Most importantly, I'd say try to get a law student as a TF because its easier to gauge their expectations for your paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend Bioethics and Law to another student who is looking for an interesting lecture class to round out their schedule. It did not require a huge amount of work, but it also did not feel like a waste of time. The reading was interesting, not too time-consuming, and related directly to the content of the lectures, so it was not hard to understand.",
    "Yes, amazing class",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Everyone should take it to understand how bioethics issues are governed in our country.",
    "If you're looking for an interesting, low-workload class, possibly as a fifth credit\/D, this is the class for you. The material is super interesting, and Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer -- I was pretty engaged though every class thanks to his teaching style that felt more like storytelling than a lecture. There's one midterm, a 5-7 page paper, and a final, which were all fair, but apparently only exceptional performance gets an A, so this class might be better off credit\/D (there's also a lot of reading, but if you go to lecture and section, you'll be fine as long as you're not aiming for an A).",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to other students. Try to memorize case names even if you don't have to.",
    "Great class and lectures. You learn so much!",
    "Bioethics and Law is a very interesting course that does not require much work on a weekly basis, though don't be fooled, this class is not an easy A. The grading in this class is tough, but nevertheless, a great course for anyone interesting in law, politics, medicine, or philosophy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is incredibly interesting and has a lighter workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's one of those must-take classes at Yale. It's a huge lecture, but you'll enjoy every second. It's super low stress, just a midterm paper and a straightforward midterm and final. Just pay attention in lecture and skim the readings and you'll be fine.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. A lot of people take it because it is easy to get by but I would not encourage you to approach it this way. You really get what you put into it: if you actually engage with the class, participate in section, do the readings etc. you will gain a really valuable experience. It won't be too much work, but at least you'll be learning something!",
    "Good intro to law and bioethics. Great class to credit\/d",
    "Broad survey course of how the law fits into bioethics. This is not a purely bioethics course--you will learn about legal infrastructure or the lack thereof. It's not very time consuming but you do need to pay attention in lecture and also listen closely to what your TA wants in order to do well.",
    "Decent class, not as good (or as easy) as I expected. The final was surprisingly difficult and the questions were overall very vague on both the midterm and the final. It's kind of gutty, but not as gutty as it had a reputation for being. However, it's interesting and I usually enjoyed the lectures.",
    "Definitely take the class, especially if you're premed!! It will make you think about aspects of the healthcare system that you've never considered before. That said, it is not a gut class, and you should definitely consider taking it Credit\/D. There is not a lot of work (a midterm, an essay, and a final), but don't let that fool you into thinking this is an easy class. Grading and how sections are structured are highly variable based on TA, so make sure to get a good one. Ben Graham is very knowledgable but a hard, hard grader.",
    "Seriously take this class and show up for lectures. Time passes by so quickly because Professor Latham is so engaging...and basically a bioethics and law boss.",
    "An awesome, awesome class that is super manageable",
    "One of the absolute best courses offered at Yale. Fascinating information and cases. Definitely take it Cred\/D if anything!",
    "Overall a solid course. Engaging lectures, and a really interesting section. Harder than I expected ended up keeping it Credit D, and it was the perfect class to take as such. Very doable exams and a paper.",
    "I'd definitely recommend PLSC 257 to a fellow student. All of the material was engaging and very relevant, especially for pre-med students. Definitely study up for the midterm and final though; they're worth a huge chunk of your grade, and this year in particular, the questions asked were very cross-cutting and difficult if one does not study or go over the material thoroughly.",
    "It's really enjoyable. I personally found it pretty easy, but I have a lot of experience with law and just humanities-style classes in general. People with science or pre-med backgrounds seemed to struggle a little more, but I don't really think they were trying that hard to do the readings and stuff because it wasn't just straight memorization like they're used to. Latham's lectures are fun, he's engaging--even to a room of hundreds of people--although sometimes they aren't the most structured because he talks straight off the top of his head.",
    "Great class to take for credit or grade. Great textbook and professor, bad sections.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's not very difficult so it works well as a 5th class or a CR\/D and the topics are very interesting and relevant.",
    "Loved this class. Latham is a very engaging, likeable lecturer, and the content is extremely relevant, not to mention fascinating. The few times I had to skip lecture for other work, I was actually upset. Would definitely recommend!",
    "This is the most amazing class and you must take it before you leave Yale. You will learn about he intersection of science medicine law and ethics in a unique and engaging way. This class is whatever you make of it and has the potential to very easily be amazing.",
    "The papers and tests essays were arbitrarily graded harder just because so many kids were taking it, which discouraged me from switching it to a letter grade and caused me to not taking it seriously because it's as if the class was intended to be a credit\/D. Interesting subject matter, Latham is a good lecturer",
    "I would recommend this class to others, although it is for sure less of a gut class than before. It's a great class to take it you're interested in the ethical implications of modern technology and the relationship between health systems and the law.",
    "TAkE IT! Favorite course at yale so far.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "This is a really great class that is not a lot of work. Professor Latham is a fantastic lecturer, and that material covered is really interesting. Homework is minimal: I found I could get by not doing the reading (though it is really interesting if you have the time!) and there is only one paper and one midterm. You do get a basic feel for our legal system, thought that also depends on how much work you put in. Basically, this class is like listening to a really great live documentary for fifty minutes twice a week. Would recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend Bioethics and Law to another student. This year, the class had approximately 500 students and was held at the Law School. The class does not have too much work on a weekly basis (readings are not required to do well on the exams). Your final grade is determined by 3 assessments (a midterm, a paper, and a final), with the final determining 50% of your grade. Therefore, if you mess up on one of those, your final grade could suffer. So, if you are going to take this class, please take it cred\/D.",
    "This is an incredible class! I wound up taking it more out of chance than choice, and I am so glad that I ended up in the course. It became one of my favorite courses. It provides a very in depth analyses of health and bioethics in the US law system, but still keeping the information basic enough that you don't need a law degree to understand it all. Definitely recommend!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student.",
    "I'm sure you've heard a lot of things about this course. The first thing you should know is that it's fascinating -- whether you're pre-med, pre-law, polisci, interested in bioethics, interested in public health, whatever, it's great. You will enjoy coming to the lectures and you will be surprised and intrigued by many of the cases you hear. If you've taken Issues in Bioethics, though I did like that class more, they don't overlap a ton, so don't worry that you'll be taking the same class. They do complement each other very well. Also, do not expect this class to be a gut. Maybe it was in years past, but this year the grading was deflated. You really had to come to lecture, section, and do readings to do well in the class. Not that it's a bad thing to work hard in a class, but if you're taking this as your 5th class, expecting not to go, and do well anyway....welll don't do that. It won't work. Latham is great though; seriously one of the best lecturers at Yale. The TAs are good, too. It's a great course, but be aware you'll have to put the work in if you want the grade.",
    "A good overview of the legal treatment of bioethical issues in the US. If you've taken some polisci and HSHM classes before, proceed with caution - I had, and a lot of the information was repeat for me. It's also very much a survey class. You will come away with a very basic understanding of a lot of stuff, but it's basically a memorization class, not a deep thinking\/analysis class. For what it is though, it's really well done.",
    "Great lectures, little work, and only two 50-minutes classes and a 50 minutes section a week. What more could you ask for? If you won't settle for anything less than an A, however, I would recommend taking it Credit\/D\/F.",
    "An interesting course that gives great insight into how the medical world works behind the scenes and how many different branches of government are intertwined. I would recommend it for anyone looking for an interesting class to take while in college. It's one of those classes that you don't really need for your major but is interesting enough to not be a waste of your time.",
    "Great class; a must-take for insight into a highly specific but relevant field.",
    "This is a fantastic class that challenges students to consider how politics and policies are constantly shaping the field of medicine and bioethics. The progress of technology in the medical field has created many new capabilities (such as end of life care, abortion, and cloning); consequently, there were new debates on how to deal with these capabilities and the importance of both patient and doctor autonomy when developing policy. Furthermore, Professor Latham goes into depth about the state of our healthcare system and conversations on the developing the concept of \"global health law.\" Definitely take this class in order to learn more about law in general, as well as important factors regarding our healthcare system and the policies that shape it.",
    "Yes, good class. Take it.",
    "Not a gut! They cracked down on grading, but very interesting class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. it was one of my favorite classes so far. The material covers a wide span of subjects from patient\/doctor confidentiality to contraception to right to die laws. It provides a very good insight into the legal system of the US and the material is stuff that informed citizens should know. Prof. Latham is a great lecturer--class was always interesting and oftentimes funny. It was a really big class and the final is 50% of the grade, but those are the only two downsides to this class. I loved it and I really learned a lot.",
    "Great course, minimal workload, excellent material for ALL majors. As a pre-med student, this course was an excellent introduction to the healthcare system and major topics in bioethics that all future medical personnel should be aware of and be able to discuss.",
    "Take this course if you want. Though it's graded extremely subjectively, Latham is great and just get a good TA.",
    "It is a great class. I would recommend it to everyone. It is easy to do well, which makes it even better.",
    "PLSC 257 was an amazing class and I would definitely recommend it to anyone remotely interested in this topic. I had never taken a class on bioethics, and as someone extremely interested in law, it was a perfect class for me.",
    "I would recommend this if you want a course that's not too hard and has a good lecturer. The readings are dry but you can just kind of skim them.",
    "Great material. I really felt like I learned a whole lot just by listening to two 50 minute lectures each week. The grading, tests, and paper are all a bit frustrating, but material wise it was great.",
    "This was a thought-provoking class and I definitely learned a lot. Take it regardless of your major if these topics interest you!",
    "Don't take this class. It may seem like a gut and it is very interesting but you won't spend the time on it, you won't want to go to class and it's is graded on a down curve with few assignments that makes it hard to do well. Stay away.",
    "Good class with interesting topics but grading can be harsh. And trust me, you can't shop TAs. You just can't.",
    "Take it! Expand your mind!",
    "Yes! But watch out for what TA you choose.",
    "A great intro law class that anyone would enjoy.",
    "Great class that's super interesting and applicable. Make sure you get a good TA though, or section isn't worth it.",
    "Definitely take this class!!! It's fun, interesting and not heavy on the work load. You won't mind doing homework for this.",
    "I would absolutely recommend, the material is extremely interesting and Latham is an absolutely outstanding professor.",
    "Summarize... This course is pretty easy in terms of workload. The reading is pretty much optional (though I did it all and found it interesting). You have an in-class midterm, a paper, and a final exam, so it's very straight-forward. The final was four essay questions, of which you had to answer all four, so that sounded like a pain until I got the exam and realized I could in fact answer all of them. I would highly recommend the course, especially with Latham.",
    "Yes definitely a necessary course to take at Yale",
    "Fascinating course and lots of fun. Take this class! Not a ton of work, but still work you will enjoy. Professor is amazing.",
    "This class was really good, and I would recommend it to people interested in this course and interested in stating their own opinions and values. The lectures were really interesting, and Professor Latham is very engaging. The readings are long but Professor Latham usually explains the important cases during lecture",
    "Great class with not a lot of work. Readings aren't necessary. Only a midterm, final, and one short 5-7 page essay.",
    "I would recommend the course. It was am interesting topic that was taught well.",
    "Depends on the TA",
    "It's a great class. The topics are interesting, the lectures are engaging, and the work load is very light. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it. Not a gut, but super interesting. I loved it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student because almost anyone can find a way to relate to the material. The class is very interesting and not stressful. Do your best to keep up with the reading so it doesn't pile up before the midterm\/final. Also, doing the readings makes the lectures easier to follow.",
    "Currently, I would not recommend PLSC 257. It is not necessarily the gut everyone cuts it out to be. The material covered during lecture doesn't necessarily correspond with what is tested.",
    "Awesome class",
    "I would recommend PLSC 257 to any student as an easygoing and interesting course.",
    "Because of the way the course is structured, this is a great Cr\/D\/F class. That way you can just enjoy lecture and absorb the material and not have to worry about a 25\/25\/50 grading breakdown. But it's very interesting and pertinent material and Latham is a captivating lecturer.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "This course is so interesting! Definitely take it if your interesting in ethical issues and\/or the medical field and\/or the legal system.",
    "10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Bioethics and Law was an interesting and fulfilling class. It didn't have a ton of work, which was really nice, and Stephen Latham is an engaging lecturer. The material is thought-provoking. A good course to take if you are looking for something light that isn't useless. Honestly, Yale needs more courses like these we're so overworked that finding classes that are relatively easy but not totally meaningless is so great.",
    "Yes it teaches about current important topics.",
    "Bioethics and Law was a good course that I'd recommend. The amount of work was reasonable and if you're interested in bioethics at all I'd say take it.",
    "If you're interested in health, medicine, biotechnology..etc then this is a great class which gives you a a good idea about how our health system legally operates. You also get to discuss modern and pertinent issues such as physician-assisted suicide, surrogacy, cloning, and public health. This course is definitely a survey course so if you're looking for an in-depth analysis of the law, then you shouldn't take this class. The book, though not essential to do well in the course, gives great analysis about some of the most important cases discussed in class. Also, Latham is a great instructor who does a good job of keeping you entertaining and engaged during class!",
    "Great survey of bioethics issues in the legal realm. Professor Latham is extremely knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer; he speaks off the stop of his head because he knows the material so well, yet his lectures were still organized and coherent, without being overly formal. The topics discussed (e.g. organ donation, end of life care, assisted reproduction) were all extremely relevant -- issues you hear about in the news all the time -- and it was very interesting to hear about such issues from a legal standpoint. Great course to take Cr\/D\/Fail if you're interested in just hearing great lectures about relevant current event issues, without having to worry about the exams. Highly recommended!",
    "A phenomenal class. If you're at all interested in law, or at all interested in questions of bioethics, this class is for you. Professor Latham presents the information in a clear, coherent, and very interesting manner, and the work is totally manageable. A great introductory lecture.",
    "Great class. Interesting and important to the real world. Latham is the man",
    "A good solid large lecture course. Nothing particularly exciting or unique about it. A solid overview of an important topic.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material is engaging and the work load is very manageable. It was a lecture I always looked forward to.",
    "Great class that is really informative and useful but not too stressful",
    "Great class! Not too stressful and really interesting stuff to learn.",
    "Great course, interesting material, but not as easy this year as it has been in the past. For example, in my section, no one got an A on the midterm, and several people did quite poorly. The lectures are super interesting and Professor Latham is very engaging, so I would recommend the course, but this year they seemed to be trying to make it less of a gut, so be aware of that.",
    "Take credit\/D. Good subject and lectures.",
    "Lecture based class with discussion sections. You must go to the lectures to learn the material. Discussion sections are also very useful for learning how to make legal arguments. Very interesting topics. You will never be bored in class."
