   "comments": [
    "Choose the red pill of understanding modernity.",
    "Given my comments in the above section, I would not recommend this class to other students or take another class from him in the future.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course to anyone wants to take a graduate level history course.",
    "It is a class that covers such a wide array of topics that I cannot aptly summarize it. Every week was as completely different topic, all relevant to each other only by their relevance to us as global citizens.I would recommend it to a student who needed to familiarize themselves with why things are the way they are, with the great works of our time, the forgotten or underestimated movers and shakers, and one who seeks a greater understanding of the implications of these and ourselves.",
    "I'd recommend this to anyone really - it's a fun class. Particularly if you haven't studied history and want a broad and challenging introduction to major themes and debates.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "INRL 791 provides a foundation on basic IR texts and theories. Every week consists of a \"deep-dive\" into a different topic, ranging from war, to technology, to capitalism, to the gay revolution. The reading load is heavy, but the discussions are usually great and very stimulating. The professor is very good. You write a medium-length paper at the end of the semester on the topic of your choice. This is a required course, and I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who is looking for a good history of liberal enlightenment thought.",
    "Would definitely recommend, if only to get the insight of Professor Tooze and not necessarily to participate a whole lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. While challenging, it was an extremely rewarding class. The class is very demanding with lots of theory involved. But it gives a good theoretical basis to understand many modern themes. It is less practical though and sometimes, not directly related to IR.",
    "Stimulating course about broad themes in recent history. Adam Tooze is an impressive teacher who will stretch you in the discussions.",
    "I really don't know. I might describe it as a class to take if you already have a strong grasp of history and historical figures but would not recommend it for most people who are not on an academic track.",
    "An in-depth summary of the history of mankind, since Tamarlane. An in-depth look at Imperialism: its roots, its history, and its present demise\/decline.I would recommend it - I saw value in it for the Jackson MA candidates as a core class, but it was very heavy for such a non-elective requirement. That said, I would recommend it, because the background knowledge I gained through my research in the course undoubtedly has prepared me for the courses I will take in future in my pursuit of the IR MA."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my place in the world, and the world's place in me...so by extension I am sure it will inform my profession",
    "See above.",
    "Yes, much of the content was entirely new for me.",
    "This course gave me a taste of the most important questions and debates in international affairs. It had widened my perspective and my curiosity.It has contributed greatly to my research interest because it has made me aware of phenomena I was not aware of.",
    "There was something in the readings for everyone and I found some of the books\/articles particularly helpful in triggering ideas for further research.",
    "Much of the course was not directly related to my interests within international relations, but it was nonetheless valuable.",
    "I'm not sure how this course will help me advance my career in public policy; however, I am grateful that I had the chance to read some key foundational IR texts in this class.",
    "Have me a good general understanding of the various events that led to a Western understanding of the world. That said, I wished it had included readings from a more diverse group of countries (I.e. not so Europe heavy) and with more emphasis on the social issues that we discussed in the latter half of class like gay rights and racism as opposed to big philosophical ideologies that were incredibly dense and less accessible (Schumpeter, Sartre, Marx).",
    "It helped me to understand the relations between themes. It also gave a great overview of the grand theories around nationalism, genocide, human rights, etc. I came to understand the financial crisis in context.",
    "Interesting course which broadened my awareness of big issues.",
    "Professor Tooze is incredible but the class did not leave me feeling significantly more knowledgeable on the topics considered.",
    "I am not sure yet. However, as mentioned previously, I know that topics and information covered and researched here will lend itself greatly to future endeavors in subsequent coursework (and in life).",
    "Helped refine - redefine, actually - the way I understand and analyze the contemporary world. Enhanced my understanding of the major tensions we're experiencing in the present, how we got here, and how to think critically about solutions."
