    "Field trip to gas station didn't seem very necessary. Same experience could have been gained by an in class case study with pictures on 5 slides in 15 minutes.Asking students to take an 11 hour field trip to MA during reading week showed little respect for the time that is supposed to be allotted for students to write papers, finish projects, prepare for finals, and attend final exam review's hosted by other professors. I find myself irresponsibly skipping group work, finals prep, and a review session to attend this \"mandatory\" field trip. Show some respect for this one week where students need independent time to prepare and move the field trip to a weekend.",
    "The field trips were very conducive to learning the material and applying the information taught in the classroom. However, the full day field trip during reading week was somewhat unfair to students who needed that time to study for finals. Having the trip on a Saturday would have been better.",
    "Field trips were definitely interesting but I am unsure how much I learned from them and the final was surprisingly heavy on questions about them. The last field trip especially was perhaps too much driving to be worth the content?",

    "This was of the two best courses I've taken at F&ES, hands down. I was one of two auditors, which gives me little incentive to inflate my opinion of either the instructor or the way the material was presented. Dr. Anisfeld presented complex material in a clear, incredibly interested way -- and constantly sought opportunities to improve students' understanding through the use of field trips, out of class sessions, and guest lectures.",
    "Shimi is an amazing instructor...always available to help.",
    "Shimi--he is a treasure among FES faculty. Although he is demanding and expects a lot from his students, he is also very open and willing to explain complex concepts as many times as is needed for students to understand them. He is also very even-handed in his presentation of material, and will give both the \"environmentalist\" side and the \"industry\" side of the story when there is disagreement.",
    "The first two-thirds of material. the Problem sets were also rather useful in teaching and bridging between concepts.",
    "Shimi is an amazing instructor and is probably the best thing about this course. I can't imagine that it would have been taught better by any other professor.",
    "Great review of chemistry knowledge, very interesting background material on how\/why different chemicals affect the environment\/us.",
    "The professor. Interesting material, too, but this is probably because he presents it so clearly.",
    "The field trips were the best things about this class because we were able to use the knowledge we had gained in the class.",
    "Clear lectures, teacher cares a lot, good amt of basic background to understand issues with organic pollutants."

    "Drop the sections on :risk assessment, environmental law and policy, and freeze\/thornton. The prof is the best I have ever had for chemistry concepts but by his own admission is not the best at the university to teach these other concepts.As a graduate student, this part of the class seemed to stick out as being very survey\/undergrad like, where the prof tries to introduce too many topics without going in sufficient depth in any one area to be very helpful to students preparing research. I think either the previously mentioned sections need to be dropped and more time spent on chemistry concepts or simply don't offer the course at the graduate level.",
    "I felt that too much time was spent on the organic chemistry component of the class and too little time was spent on the different classes of organic pollutants.",
    "The tests were far too broad. We learned A LOT of information in this class and while it is all interesting, I think the professor needs to do a better job of summarizing and emphasizing the MOST important information for memorization. Also the I",
    "Can't think of any.",
    "More about herbicides and pesticides and how they work would be nice."

He goes out of his way to help students during his office hours and is always prompt with his email responses. Elyssa and Jess were just as great. They were so helpful during office hours and could make the most complex information understandable. I could tell they both enjoyed the class and it made me like it even more.",
    "The instructor had bountiful help sessions and was willing to just sit by while we did assignments in case we had questions. He very patiently walked me through my more remedial chemistry and math issues and I always left help sessions feeling like I had grasped the material.",
    "Shimi is amazingly available and generous with his time. TAs as well.",

The subjects covered in the last 3\/4 of the course are critical to understanding the fate of pollutants in the environment, but for some reason are rarely covered in other courses.",
