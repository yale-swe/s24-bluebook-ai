   "comments": [
    "This is pretty much the worst class ever, and everyone knows it, I think the professor included. It's not his fault. Professor Ryan was engaged, but the material is bad, no one goes to class, the group project is an epic waste of time, and there needs to be a serious overhaul. The group project is essentially 45 minutes of guesswork and making up extravagant conclusions. There is no way to adequately prepare for the exams, and class is general is miserable. I'm also probably going to get an A, maybe an A-, so it's not sour grapes; I just want to save future students from having to go through this nightmare",
    "section is an absolute joke. no one goes no one was going to lecture, either, by the end The course gets progressively less interesting each week great job giving quick, clear feedback on grades for assignments",
    "Problem sets were very helpful for a class where concepts\/derivations aren't enough to \"get\" the material. Canvas quizzes were great too. Prof. Ryan was a great lecturer and didn't just read the notes off of the slides. Second time I've attempted this class and he did a MUCH better job than my last professor.",
    "All of the solutions were apparently online which is unfair to those students who did the problem sets in good faith. Lack of coordination between TAs and professor.",
    "I thought the lectures were very organized and easy to follow -- it was always clear what direction we were headed, and I appreciated that we always returned to the \"bigger picture\" even when we began to explore more complex analytical tools. The final project was also a good way to synthesize the information we had learned over the course of the semester. However, I felt like it was complicated by the fact that we had not learned most of the tools needed for data analysis when we started the project at the beginning of the semester. For my group at least, this made the project a little difficult because we found that we had to continuously revise our research questions throughout the semester as we learned new techniques and figured out what was feasible or infeasible. I think it might be helpful to make the project even bigger and use it to replace the final exam, as I think the project by itself can already thoroughly demonstrate our understanding and mastery of the data analysis techniques we learned in the class.",
    "Too dull hard to follow or understand",
    "More help with psets",
    "Having a final project AND a final was a little much. In the future, I would suggest just having one so that we could devote more effort to it.",
    "More options regarding group projects - e.g. the option to do a solo project. Strength - the professor, the TAs, all the tutors and other resources available. Many assignments over the semester put less pressure on one test and allowed you to see progress.",
    "Poorly taught. Lectures and section were really unengaging and not informative.",
    "Only one weakness of this course truly stood out to me; it was otherwise a strong lecture by a competent and engaged professor who structured exams fairly. However, the class more than any I have ever witnessed as a student encouraged blase academic dishonesty. Every TA in the class knows that the problem set answer keys were put online last year, accessible by a Google search of \"Yale ECON 131 Answer Keys\" or some similar combination. Everyone knows where it is, and everyone in the class has looked at them. They neatly give each answer from the previous year's problem sets, which are identical to this year's problem sets. I was surprised by how many of my classmates had 10s on their returned problem sets the first and second week, and then I too heard about the answer keys. My grade in this class suffered because I did not use the answer keys and rarely checked over work with students who did use them. The class syllabus writes, \"The use of any solution materials prepared in a previous year for Econ 131, other than materials distributed this academic year by the course faculty, is strictly prohibited.This includes 1) any notes, spreadsheets, or handouts distributed by faculty in a prior term of Econ 131; and 2) any notes, solutions, or spreadsheets prepared by former students of Econ 131, in either written or electronic form.\" I was frankly astonished at the level of academic dishonesty in this course, at the cavalier way students would discuss the easily accessed answer sheets, and at the nonplussed TAs who did nothing about it. The answer should be obvious. On one question of one problem set, change a number so that the answer key gives a reasonable but incorrect answer, and any other student would find a different answer. If \"48.389%\" is the answer key solution and the problem set has a true answer of \"44.221%\" to it, then it should be clear who the cheaters are. Give them zeros on the problem set and warn them that the next assignment may be similarly altered. This would take a total of ten minutes of Professor Ryan's time, but he somehow did not do anything of the sort, indicating either a level of resignation to the academic dishonesty or a level of radio silence between the TAs and Professor Ryan that is similarly disappointing. I do not understand why Yale would stomach this level of academic dishonesty. I do not understand why it was allowed to persist without any intervention. I do not understand how this is not a scandal the YDN has reported on, or why this is not seen as a problem. It just does not make sense to me. Professor Ryan's class punished students who did their problem sets alone or in small groups without the aid of illicit material from the last course. I will likely get a lower grade despite outperforming most students on the exams and quizzes because I did not have a guaranteed 10\/10 on every problem set this year. This class's curve is tinged by the presence of widespread academic dishonesty, and Yale as an institution committed to academic achievement should not allow it. I recommend that either a thorough examination of all available problem sets (those that were electronically submitted, perhaps?) be conducted or that the problem set portion of the grade be tossed out and the course be graded based on the parts of the course that were free of fraud: the exams and final project. It was lazy to begin with not to create new problem sets. But when faced with known academic dishonesty, no action was pursued. This is unacceptable.",
    "Professor Ryan was very monotonous and it was really hard to focus on the lecture no matter how hard I tried. Moreover, the exams were less about understanding and more about regurgitating information as quickly as possible. This is unarguably the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I think this was a wonderful course. I had never taken statistics before and this gave me a solid introduction in the field. I don't think it can be improved. The class structure was wonderful. I think we had just enough assignments to practice the material.",
    "i wish office hours had been more advertised and help with STATA had been more straightforward to procure there was not very much feedback on problem sets in terms of answers or grading policies",
    "The weakness is that I feel like the course is unrelated to economics in general and more heavily dependent on stats",
    "This course would benefit from assigning more problem sets to reinforce the material.",
    "final projects kind of stupid",
    "One of the strengths of the course is that it is very well organized - students know well in advance which material is covered in which week, and it makes it very easy to review material and learn in an organized matter. The course was also strong in that it had many components - quizzes, midterm, problem sets and final project - which ensured that we stay on top of the material. The empirical project was especially a useful component which helped us solidify the material by trying on our own. What could be improved is that letting students know ahead of time that this is a work-heavy and intensive course with a lot of components.",
    "The class is not thought in a way that would make student be more engaged and participate in class. Not enough material is learned in class and almost none of the learned material is though in a understandable, applicable and cohesive manner. The most needed change would be to make the class a lot more engaging."

    "Waste of time, but you have to take it for econ, so power through. The group project is a waste of time and can be done the night before",
    "Only take this course if you need it for the Econ major. Seriously.",
    "You have to take the class for the Econ major so when you take it, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR RYAN. He has a much better understanding of the material than other professors, and is extremely nice and approachable. The problem sets take time and the material is frustrating at times. If you commit to the workload, you will make it through alive.",
    "I would recommend this course, with some reservations. I enjoyed learning various techniques that can be applied to real-world economic problems, because I feel like the other economics classes I've taken focused on theories and did not have hard data and analysis to ground them in reality. Prof. Ryan was also a great lecturer -- his powerpoints were very clear and his explanations always easy to follow. However, as someone who had zero background in statistics, the class was quite challenging, even if it was supposed to serve as an introduction to most statistics-related concepts. Furthermore, the exams, which were designed to be challenging, were difficult and a little demoralizing, because I felt like I wasn't able to master the subject material. Overall, I think ECON 131 is a worthwhile class if you want to learn more about the motivations and logic behind real-life economics, but it can become an incredibly time-consuming class if you want to really master the material.",
    "Not unless necessary",
    "yes, useful econometrics skills",
    "I assume that if you're taking the class, it's because it's for the major. With that in mind, I'd say it was one of the more decent classes I've taken of the Econ core. Professor Ryan is great and really cares about students' progress, and I think that the material itself is interesting enough once you apply yourself. Lectures can get a little dry sometimes, and the exams were huge time crunches, but overall, a decent course.",
    "Take with Prof. Ryan! Definitely better than I expected and one of the more interesting and engaging econ classes I've taken. If you are a stats major thinking of taking a different kind of stats application do it ! If you're an econ major you have to take it anyway.",
    "Yes, interesting course.",
    "You will learn some useful skills. Everyone should know the basics of regression analysis. However, it's probably a better idea to try to do so in the context of another class. Professor Ryan, is clearly a nice guy, but is not a great teacher of the material. He basically just reads off the slides.",
    "No.",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "The course is skewed by the widespread access to previous problem set solutions keys that give a fraction of the class guaranteed 10\/10 problem set grades. Widespread academic dishonesty for this reason. Other than that, it is a fine lecture with a lot of material. Good to understand research papers and good to really see the meaning behind correlative arguments and their flaws.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this course to anyone. The class is too boring and the exams are not designed to test for understanding. You would be better off taking some other Econometrics class. Just my honest opinion!",
    "No",
    "Yes! I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of major, because it develops skills that are important for understanding all data and all studies.",
    "You need to take it; it's not very well organized, but if you are fine learning some stats on your own, you'll survive.",
    "I would recommend that EPE majors use this course to fulfill the statistics requirement, because this is more practical than basic statistics.",
    "yes",
    "Take it with Professor Ryan. He is a very clear lecturer, and he brings real life examples to class to make the material very interesting. The material is dry sometimes, but the real life relevance makes the class easier to follow. The skills and knowledge developed in the class is actually very useful, so don't just view it as a requirement of the econ major. You learn all basics of stats, which are essential to a lot of field, you learn Stata by struggling on your own (it's really not that hard), and you apply all of these to economic analysis. Professor Ryan also teaches econometric insight and interpretation of results really well, and he is always open for questions.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. It is extremely difficult, section is not really helpful and the whole course is just a huge struggle for everyone.",
    "Take this class only if you have to. Take AQA otherwise, much more interesting, applicable and thought so much better!"
