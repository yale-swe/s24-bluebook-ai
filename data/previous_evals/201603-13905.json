   "comments": [
    "it was a requirement and I was unable to place out of it based on medical school courses. unfortunately, I felt it did not add to my MPH coursework or experience. it was busy work to fulfill a requirement.",
    "the strengths of the course are located in the breadth of guest speakers that gave lectures throughout the semester. The weaknesses included: time of the day (8am) and the general pace of the course. Course materials were not available in ample time and placed on the course website. Quizzes were given to students even if they were 25 minutes late to class. The class, also, was heavily geared toward medical doctors, which made the 6 of us who were not doctors feel like we did not belong.",
    "I enjoyed the course- it was educational. However, some of the instructors, while interesting and engaging were unfocussed, and unclear on who they were lecturing to. The two lectures on respiratory issues (asthma, cancer) were near impossible. One lecturer worked through a case about a person exposed to Radon, asbestos etc.etc. and while it engaged most in the class, the take home message was unclear. There were no notes. I have no objection to not having a powerpoint, but I do think there ought have been at least a brief overview of the talk to bring the readings together. On the flip side the other lecturer had a lecture that had too many slides- they seemed to be recycling a talk that was meant for physicians perhaps. The instructor on Food workers was very sweet but that was a talk that seemed to be directed to high school students. Some of the talks were great.",
    "This class covers a lot of topics in environmental and occupational medicine. The broad range of topics was certainly interesting, though there wasn't really a flow between topics.",
    "Excelllent course",
    "I think the course was good for what it was. it didn't feel super relevant all the time but it was interesting and the instructors obviously cared about the information. I liked the speakers that cam and talked and i liked that the professors understood that this was a course that we were taking to get a specific skill set. they were very good about limiting the workload.",
    "Strengths- Field visit and getting oriented to a specialty in medicine was a unique experience as a physician",
    "Good course pattern and the field trip is very interesting",
    "Good introduction to Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Breadth of topics was good and lectures were enjoyable. Favorite aspect was definitely the site visit; it was a great way to actually see and apply concepts learned in class to a real work environment. Quizzes and assignments were all appropriate in terms of content and difficulty. Both instructors were great and I liked all the guest lecturers who were invited to speak to the class. My one critique is that I would have liked to explore the Environmental Medicine component a bit more (I felt like the course was heavily geared towards Occupational Medicine).",
    "Excellent introductory course for environmental and occupational health. A great strength are guest speakers for each lecture. Another plus are the field visits.",
    "Great",
    "It's a great course.",
    "Very good overview of occupational and environmental medicine, profiling many of the separate fields and topics within the larger topic. Essential to understanding what this area of health care and safety is.",
    "- guest lecturers were interesting - class time was too early - too many pop quizzes - site visits were good",
    "Highly relevant course for me so this evaluation is biased - in my opinion this course was fantastic Despite the background in internal medicine I have learned a lot about this field,",
    "strengths: Nice variation in lectures. Covered a wide breadth of topics in occ\/env health. weaknesses: could have had more hands on experience\/ site visits",
    "Strengths: guest speakers each week were different and very good. It is not a difficult class, however you get out of it what you put into it.",
    "Overall, I truly enjoyed this course. My only suggestion would be to do away with the random pop quizzes, especially since they were given at 8AM."
