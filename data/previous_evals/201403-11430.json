    "15. Would like it to be more management focused\/practical. I often felt lost at the end of class, and confused about what I had learned.",
    "This is a very important course for students interested in land management, but there wasn't as much of an emphasis on actual land management. I also think everyone should be required to read the textbook.",
    "We covered materials very fast in the course with little chance for reviewing or deepening knowledge. It seemed to be an assumption that we had greater prior knowledge of the subject matter than most people had. In general, problem sets or questions (similar to those on the exams) throughout the semester would have given a better opportunity for review and learning.",
    "At times, the material in this course felt like it was to be understood in the presence of a concurrent presentation of material, which is to say, students' independent pursuit of the \"standard\" mode of learning about soil science via the Brady and Weil text. We touched on a lot of material, but often skimmed the surface-- and I would highly recommend taking Physical Sciences and reading the suggested text to round out the discussion.",
    "Q10: I found that the first field trip was held too early in the term. It would have been more helpful if we had gone through more lectures 1st to be able to fully appreciate it on the ground rather than in retrospect.",
    "This was my first soils class, and I have to say I really enjoyed the perspective that Mark brings to soil science (focus on soil carbon, greenhouse gases, ecology, etc.) and brought in a lot of great primary literature that goes well beyond the basics of soil science. I felt like I got a lot out of this course having taken a lot of other science courses here at FES.",
    "Mark speaks very quickly, I could understand and keep up during class, but my retention was not great.",
    "My only comment on Mark is that he really needs to slow down when he is speaking",
    "I know it's an introductory course, but I saw a chapter in Brady & Weil about common agricultural soil problems and their remedies. Maybe a section next year about \"common soil issues land managers have to deal with.\" We had lots of practice engaging with contemporary debates on many topics, often with an emphasis on the \"how would you advise land managers\" question, but I don't feel confident that I could actually answer farmers'\/landowners' questions about what to do.",
    "12-13 Mark is very enthusiastic and happy to stop and answer questions in class. He speaks very quickly, so pay close attention! It is easy to miss something the first time around.",
    "I learned a great amount about soils from this class, but I come away not knowing exactly how I might use this knowledge within the context of forest management. There are several things that would have made this class more helpful: (1) More field trips. This class seems like one that is extremely conducive to field trips (there are soils everywhere), and yet, we only had two. The field trip to the Yale farm was definitely helpful, but the field trip to the Yale swale was much less helpful. (2) A greater emphasis on the properties of different soils (especially texture and water holding capacity) and what this means for managing forests, crops, etc. There is an excellent resource, the CT Agricultural Experiment Station, just a short drive from Yale FES. This is a great place to learn how to test soil and how to treat soils within this area. A field trip to this office would have been helpful. Also, the professor, Dr. Mark Bradford, is an amazing person. He is extremely personable and extremely knowledgable. That said, he speaks so quickly that it is very difficult to keep up with his lectures or to really identify the \"key messages\" that he tries to get across.",
    "The textbook for this course was option. Had I not read the textbook, I would not have learned anything. The pace of the class was too quick and lectures were unclear. Furthermore, when students asked Mark to clarify questions, he seemed surprised the questions were asked, demonstrating how out of touch he was with how his lessons were understood, and typically opted to move on without answering the questions. He generally seemed like a reluctant teacher.",
    "The text book was IMMENSELY helpful, particularly for those of us with little to no background in soils. I highly recommend making more use of it to build a basic understanding of soil properties.",
    "This course has the potential to be a lot more valuable than how it is taught and presented. Mark is really good at pushing the students to think of all the what ifs and big picture problems with the current models and understanding of soils. But, he does not teach or give us the tools needed to actually study soils practically, in the field. From my understanding of this course, if I need soil tested I might as well just send it to the lab and pay someone to do it. This course focuses a lot on climate change\/ global warming\/ soil carbon effects but hardly at all on management. I think I learned a lot, but overall was disappointed in how much I am walking away with. Additionally Mark is an extremely fast talker and though there are no pre reqs for this course, it is definitely accelerated. It was hard to keep up during lectures most of the time- and I am a native english speaker!",
    "While this class was very helpful in terms of getting a whirlwind tour of soil science, Mark speaks too quickly for material to sink in before moving on to another concept, and does not fully explain a topic before discussing all of the uncertainties around it, so it is difficult to gain a solid foundation on which to have a useful discussion.",
    "Question 8: There could have been more field trips and I think it would have aided the learning experience. Both field trips that were done towards the beginning of the semester were very helpful in gaining knowledge on how soil science concepts are applied in the field. Question 11: Professor Bradford was very hard to follow at times because he is a very fast speaker and the material at times was presented in a way that was confusing. Question 14: I gained a lot from the course but felt like I had to commit a lot of time outside of the classroom reteaching myself concepts that we grazed over in class. I felt the grading for the exams could have been more transparent through getting a graded version of the exam back."

   "comments": [
    "The course was a good broad introduction to soil science. Readings, reading forums, and readings discussions were well run and helpful. The professor was open to discussion.",
    "The best aspect was the group project.",
    "The course introduced me to new concepts about soils and helped me develop a better understanding of soil processes and management considerations",
    "The discussion sections were really helpful. I found the textbook also very useful. I liked the format of the exams as well - I learned a lot doing the exams.",
    "We covered a lot of material to have a basic proficiency in the main topics of soil conversations. Mark and Emily were generous with their time and very accessible",
    "Bradford's approach of a world-view world-implication to soils is highly relevant to real world situations.",
    "The content was relevant, useful and very interesting.",
    "Very important material. The tests were good at forcing students to learn the material. The combination of disucssion forum posts, the project, and the tests was good for homework.",
    "The primary literature, Mark's honest opinions about the science and his dark sense of humor.",
    "The course gave a strong overview of soil science and practical management applications, which was useful for those looking to understand soil ecology and management strategies.",
    "I actually appreciated the reading responses, as they helped me to process the information and formulate the next level of critical thinking on the topics.",
    "On top of learning concepts, I was able to learn more current understanding about them via papers and discussions.",
    "Mark did a great job of branching out from the traditional lecture style to incorporate discussions, field trips, and reverse classrooms, which I believe greatly enhanced the learning experience.",
    "Got in to many topics. I liked Mark's \"teaching the controversy.\"",
    "I enjoyed the hands-on learning and would have liked to take more trips\/ be outside.",
    "The discussions! There were about 4-5 discussion sections, where you had to read two scientific papers and write a brief summary of them and then discuss them in class. I understood\/remembered the concepts from the discussion lectures WAY better than the traditional lectures, plus we got practice reading the scientific literature, which is always a plus in my book (and I rarely do assigned reading unless forced, so I got more out of the class because of the lecture sections).",
    "In a way, I feel like I learned the most from the take-home exams (the midterm and the final), when I was forced to really understand what was going on in the class. Note-taking is key for this class, as the lectures whiz by so quickly that -- without notes -- it is difficult to make sense of all of the slides. The class was also helpful, in that the professor made a point to highlight different models and viewpoints regarding soil dynamics. I do think that Dr. Bradford did a nice job of helping us understand all of the complexities of soils. The science is still relatively new, and there is still a lot left for us to learn and figure out. The readings were also a strong point of this class. They were clear and to the point. I especially found it helpful when we were asked to comment on the readings in preparation for class discussions. This helped me to gain a better understanding of the material. Finally, I appreciate the timing of the midterm and finals, as well as the timing of the final presentations. The final project was completed by reading period, which allowed us to focus on other things during reading week.",
    "Take home exams - without it being open note and providing 24 hours, I wouldn't have been able to do it. Learned a lot - FROM THE BOOK - while studying for this exam.",
    "I appreciate that Mark pushed us to challenge current understanding of soil and its role in the future.",
    "Outside the box thinking, challenging perspectives and a chance to discuss problems with classmates.",
    "The material is very interesting, and Mark is a dynamic professor.",
    "The final project was really fun as I got to work with classmates on a project we were all interested in. The required comments on an online forum for readings helped keep us accountable for doing them and also helped us process and understand the readings better.",
    "The class really taught me how to critically assess scientific research. It helped me place different concepts of ecosystem ecology within a working framework and taught me how to understand and appreciate soils as a living system. The final group project allowed the flexibility to bring in your personal areas of interest which was really interesting to do. The outside readings of soil science publications were helpful for supplemental learning.",
    "The lectures were well organized and the topics flowed well from one subject to another. I really enjoyed using primary texts (original scientific articles) as the basis for discussion."

    "Perhaps the forum postings and discussions",
    "Some of the material felt too focused on individual case studies and research articles, made it feel like I was missing out on a broader understanding of the processes by the amount of time spent on \"discussion\" class periods.",

    "Mark speaks very quickly.",
    "The teaching is pretty rough- the professor speaks so quickly and is so deep into the academic soil world that the lectures are pretty worthless and impossible to understand. Prof. Bradford needs to speak about 1\/2 as fast and providing a linear explanation of how material connects would be really valuable.",
    "The readings should be assigned. I had no idea how valuable they were for the first half of the semester. The lectures were very informative with this background but confusing without it.",
    "The discussion board assignments perhaps need some revamping. Unfortunately it seemed like a large number of my classmates were somewhat lost with the primary literature\/ discussion exercises and sometimes the discussions were a little lackluster at times because of that. It also seemed that the class was really adverse to having conflicting opinions on the discussion board and limited the conversation to things like: \"great summary\" and \"I agree with your point on..\"which didn't lend itself to thoughtful reflection and critical thinking. I'd like to see more people disagreeing with each other and bringing in their unique perspectives to form an argument.",
    "I thought the class was a bit too conceptual. It's good to have new literature involved in the class, but the class relied a bit too heavily on it. I would advocate for skipping the two classes used for designing a new SOM model.",
    "Having a few problem sets or sample questions earlier in the semester might help students prepare for the type of questions that are on the exam.",
    "Although it was great to cover theoretical concepts to applications, I wished I can learn more basic concepts and principles more thoroughly so that I can gain capability to learn by myself after the course.",
    "The PowerPoint presentations would benefit from slightly clearer structure.",

    "I would have liked shorter, more frequent exams so that I could access my understanding of the material as we are moving forward through it.",
    "Overall I thought it was pretty good, it's just hard to follow what mark says sometimes because of his rapid speaking pace.",
    "The pace of the lecture simply needs to be a little slower. I would recommend more drawing on the board. When the professor slowed down and actually illustrated concepts on the board, this is when I felt like the lectures were the most beneficial. I have mixed feelings about the discussion sections. Most of the time, I don't feel like we were prepared enough to have a productive discussion without input from the professor (i.e. sometimes I ended up feeling more confused at the end of the discussion than I felt going in). But a couple of the discussions (especially the one about carbon use efficiency) were helpful.",

    "Lectures highlighted widely accepted major theories while discussions used scientific papers to provide opposing views of contentious research. I found the concept useful as it teaches me to be critical when reading papers but I also wish that there was a more solid debrief and summary of what was discussed as well as more guidance in the group discussions. Certain sessions ended with me feeling confused since time constraints did not allow Mark\/ Emily to run true what was discussed per group. Perhaps the framework can be re-looked? Like groups producing a summary of discussion points that mark and Emily can comment on.",

    "Discussion sessions that we had were pretty helpful but somewhat inefficient because of the depth of understanding for each student was various. I think before discussions, it would be helpful to make sure all students understood concepts being discussed. Also it would be good to talk about the paper together and specifically narrow down the points to be discussed. I know it could be like too undergraduate or highschool learning processes, but it needs to be done to embrace all students from different study backgrounds.",

    "N\/A",
    "The discussions were good but we never walked away with any answers. They could be focused more. A lab in which we actually go through the process of testing the soil would be helpful. .",

    "Soils are the basis of all ecosystems, so understanding soil types and processes are important for understanding\/managing forests and other ecosystems.",
    "I took this course to fulfill the physical sciences requirement of the MF degree, and with the hope of gaining a better understanding of soil properties, and their interactions with soil management decisions, especially regarding forests and forestry.",
    "Very important for understanding land management. Nutrient cycling in particular was very useful.",
    "Soil management is an essential part of effective forestry management.",
    "Soils have been interest of mine, content was great and was delivered in an engaging manner. I will be able to take these concepts and knowledge for application in my work.",
    "This is a very important class for forestry, although it would be nice if it were a bit more applied. An understanding of soil, and increasingly carbon, is central to both the academic and management aspects of a forestry degree.",
    "A basic understanding of soil science is",
    "A great course for my first introduction into soil science and an essential part of my MESc coursework. I wish I took it earlier, but it reinforced a lot of topics I was familiar with an gave me a stronger background in terrestrial ecosystems.",
    "As an M.F. student, I thought this class would be more relevant. It was hard to pull out tangible management techniques for managing soil in forests. That said, I do feel much more comfortable reading and talking about some of the basics, especially in regards to SOM.",
    "Soil ecology provides me with a foundation for understanding how soil health management intersects with agricultural techniques.",
    "I study Sustainable Land Use, Management, and Policy - and as a non-science specialist, this course gave a good foundation while being pretty challenging.",
    "Yes it is one of the most important courses in my program.",
    "It'll be foundational to the rest of my MF work.",
    "I'm an MESc and my research project involves a lot of soils analysis, so it was an important class for me to take.",
    "I was excited to take this class because of my interest in soil processes. And I do think that, overall, it was helpful to someone in the MF program. However, I would have appreciated more time dedicated to soil classification and to soil properties (e.g. texture and water holding capacity) -- tools that are more relevant to the immediate needs of foresters. Nevertheless, I gained an appreciation for the importance of microbes and for the complexities of soil processes in general.",
    "I wish this course had proven to be more applicable to my program- I want to actively manage land, and still dont know where to start when it comes to soils.",
    "The course fits well with my program to help in understanding how below ground and above ground ecosystem functioning affect one another."

    "Not quite.... I did learn some of the elements that I expected to learn about, but on some levels the course material was more scientific rather than practical for application as I had hoped...but I still did learn a lot and have a deeper understanding about soils compared to prior to being in this class. It also seemed like there was a challenge in the students coming into the class had a range of expertise, so some of the material that may have been over my head was on point for other students...",
    "Somewhat, I think more of an emphasis on land management. The final project allowed a bit for this, but more emphasis in class readings\/examples.",
    "In the end, yes, absolutely! Mostly due to the exams, that really helped me to put things in context and connect the various lectures to each other.",
    "This seemed to me like a sort of \"classic\" FES course-- we covered a lot of material, learned interesting new questions and conceptual models to pursue, and learned about how to address scientific questions in a thorough and appropriate way. We did not treat the material like a land-grant institution, but rather we were presented with some sample materials that show us alternative ways of managing soils. If we wanted to know amendment application rates and pros and cons of specific management techniques, we can go read the Cornell Extension factsheets. This was frustrating at times, but we also got a unique presentation of materials from a carbon balance and terrestrial ecologist view and-- we already had (and will continue to have) access to \"straight\" land grant recommendations and perspectives.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, but I also wish more on tropical and urban aspects of managing soils could have we been covered",

    "Advantages: we could support each other as a team and brainstorm together to come up with ideas Disadvantages: sometimes it was hard to find time to meet, or there were a few cases where we all couldn't agree on things",
    "Group work occurred in discussion periods and as the group project. It was helpful working with other students to be able to better express and address confusion, although sometimes it felt like the group was confused as a whole and didn't greatly contribute to overall understanding.",

    "Group work was good, helped me to digest course information and apply it to a topic of our choosing.",
    "Group presentations were useful to delve into a research topic and provided a good capstone to the course. It would be nice to have a little clearer expectation for what the research project should entail and a short time to discuss potential topics and form groups during class.",
    "I learned from their unique backgrounds and interests. I had a very positive experience - I liked that we could choose our groups and topics, as well. Everyone in our group was motivated, and it was probably the 'easiest' group project process I've experienced.",
    "It was a chance to do a larger scale project, which I appreciated.",
    "It was great to continue group activity through the semester with conducting a field research. But we spend a lot of time on weekly basis, which wasn't informed thoroughly at the begining, so we were kind of exhausted to continue the endless work.",
    "Whether short-term in class group work or long-term projects this class was benefited from group work.",

    "The group project was somewhat helpful, but it may have been more helpful to present independent projects (although I recognize that timing this may have been an issue...). My interests were somewhat aligned with my group's, but in order to develop a coherent topic for our presentation, I had to compromise somewhat on my primary interests. Nevertheless, there were some definite advantages to the group presentation. We were able to combine resources and share insights that allowed us to cover more ground than any of us would have been able to on our own. It also took a little bit of pressure off of the final presentation itself.",
    "Piecing together information with others is always helpful.",
    "Group work was enjoyable and I learned a lot by working with my group mates.",
    "The discussion break outs in groups were helpful in order to converse on concepts and help in our understanding. Many times, very interesting questions emerged from these discussions. We would also work on understanding parts of papers that were not clear with each other.",

    "It is a good introduction to soil science. If you've taken many related classes, you will still get a good deal of new knowledge out of it, or at least up to date information. If you're only going to take the class to farm soil, reconsider taking it.",
    "Definitely get the textbook and read it if you want to go deeper with the class material.",
    "Get the textbook and read it! Go meet with Mark or the TA one on one if you don't understand something.",
    "Get the textbook!",
    "Take the time to read the text in conjunction with lectures, and take Physical Sciences beforehand (if possible!)",
    "Be prepared to do presentations.",
    "Be diligent with the readings as it puts the lectures in context and you'll gain more from it.",
    "Buy the text book and use it a lot- you actually learn more from the textbook than from any other aspect of the class. Review after each lecture.",
    "Everyone at FES should take a soils course.",
    "If you did not take the prerequisite or if you do not have an understanding of soil concepts and chemistry, I would question taking this class as you will likely not gain as much as other students who can follow lectures and readings at a higher level.",
    "This is a literature heavy class with lots of theory. While it covers lots of ground, it's focus is more on soil microbes and carbon.",
    "This will be a thorough and fast-paced overview of soils.",
    "Come with some background, whether it is Physical Sciences or Ecosystem and Landscapes.",
    "Get the textbook!",
    "Get the book and take notes on the slides",
    "I would like to discourage taking this course if students do not have science bacgrounds.",
    "Do not hesitate to ask Mark to clarify what he means or say something again. He moves quickly through powerpoints and lectures, but will absolutely go back and cover any material that at first seemed unclear.",
    "Do the readings, obviously. Go to Emily's office hours even if you don't have a specific question.",
    "Buy the textbook and read it even though it is optional. It is extremely helpful for exams and well written to understand what you are learning.",
    "My best advice would be to take a lot of notes during class -- the professor moves at a quick pace, so you will thank yourself later! Secondly, I would emphasize the importance of asking questions. I think it took our class a while to feel comfortable asking relatively simple questions, and it would have benefitted us all to have started asking those questions earlier. Dr. Bradford is a very patient professor and is always willing to explain concepts again when the class doesn't understand. Take advantage of that!",
    "If you want to learn something, get the book and read along with the lectures.",
    "Without a prior background in soils, the textbook is essential for keeping up with class lectures and to an extent the discussions.",
    "Brush up on your chemistry. Follow up with the TA if there is something you dont understand. Don't expect to get your hands dirty.",
    "Mark speaks a little quickly, so sit near the front if you are worried about not hearing him. Take notes on your computer if you type quickly.",
    "I would recommend buying the text book at the beginning to aid in understanding of the context and details of the lectures. I would also form study groups to bounce concepts off each other before the exams.",
    "This is a great class to take if you need an solid basis in soil science. I felt it had a good focus on the science of soil systems, but if students are looking for a purely applied course (e.g., into how agricultural managers should approach soils), then this probably isn't the course for them)."
