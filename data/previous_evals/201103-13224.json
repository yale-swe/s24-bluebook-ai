   "comments": [
    "Strengths: powerpoints to introduce concepts and lots of examples to help drive the points home, having weekly homework kept us on top of the concepts and frequency \"quizzes\" forced us to study throughout the semester which is important because concepts build upon one another.",
    "Great introductory course.",
    "This is an excellent introductory course to epidemiology. Dr. Niccolai is incredibly well organized and this is reflected in her Powerpoint slides, her course materials, the structure of the TA sessions, and the overall course organization itself. I really appreciated the quizzes throughout the semester, rather than having two big exams. It allowed for much better synthesis of the materials. The TA sessions were extremely helpful and the homework assignments, while long at times, really brought what we learned in class to life.The only drawback to this course was having the hardest quiz of the semester right before the Thanksgiving break!",
    "This course taught me a lot of great info that will help me in the future. No real weaknesses.",
    "useful.",
    "excellent. Very systematic, and comprehensive! I learned a lot in this course!",
    "I think the class was organized well. The homeworks were helpful. The questions on the quizzes, I think were aimed at someone with a more intermediate knowledge of the concepts. I felt ill-equipped to answer them sometimes, if they were not something we had practiced. I felt like I had just grasped the concept, but wasn't able to answer a complex question about it.",
    "The course describes basic concepts of epidemiology, it is useful for beginners in this scientific area. It improves the understanding of the principals used in most epidemiological papers. At the same time it might sometimes be boring for those students who are familiar with the subject.",
    "an interesting course. strength: used many excellent published cases in class. weakness: some difficult concepts were not explained well : ie: confounding vs. bias. different types of bias...hard to differentiate.",
    "A great class for me, as an undergraduate, which piqued my interest for public health. The approach is different and very applied, but I found the material to be very interesting as a supplement to my more theoretical classes.",
    "This was an excellent course. The textbook coincided perfectly with the lecture, and the lectures not only introduced fundamental epidemiological concepts, but also delved slightly deeper in a manner that should prove useful for more advanced epidemiology classes.The grading system was clear and fair, the TAs were well-chosen, and the sections were very useful.I have previously taken this course at another university, and I found this class to be very enjoyable and enlightening.I can think of no weaknesses. Some students may complain about the length of the quizzes, but I feel that they were very fair. It is difficult to compress such a wide breadth of topics into short quizzes, and I appreciated that students were being held to a high standard.",
    "Ok",
    "The workload for this course is too much",
    "Great powerpoint slides- material well explained, quizzes were fair, homeworks were good learning tools",
    "I thought that it was great. The book is perfect.",
    "Enjoyable and useful class. Well organized",
    "useful",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The set-up of lectures and corresponding homework sets each week provided an excellent opportunity to learn the material.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and felt that I learned a great deal of very useful, practical information. The lectures were presented in a very understandable, accessible way.My only complaint is that I felt in some cases that I understood the information completely but missed points on a test because of the ambiguous way that a question was asked.",
    "Well organized and practical. I have no weaknesses.",
    "Some lectures contain a big load of information, and it is hard to digest during class.",
    "The course is well organized and structured. The connections among lecture, section, and homework were very clear and made for a great learning experience. I feel that of the first semester foundational courses, this gave me the most real-world-applicable knowledge (although I may be biased as a CDE student)I was a big fan of the structure (weekly homeworks, intermittent quizzes, and a final), which guided us in absorbing and internalizing information.",
    "I enjoyed the course and learn a great deal. I feel that the topics covered were relevant and important. The weekly homeworks were very helpful in ensuring that we continuously went over and understood the material. Though we complained about the homeworks and the frequent quizzes, they were very helpful in ensuring that we gained a thorough understanding of the material. The lectures were interesting especially when current aritcles were incorporated into the topics.",
    "great course, could learn many useful concept",
    "I loved this course and Dr. Niccolai is an excellent professor. The exams were tough. It wasn't that the course material wasn't covered well but the language on the exams was different from the homework\/practice problems.Also, the exams were a bit long. Shortening them by even 1 or 2 sections of a question or by a few t\/f questions would have made it a lot less rushed (aka avoidable mistakes).",
    "Epi is really, really interesting!It is impressive how quickly they get back tests.I liked having hw each week to keep us on track.The quizzes were adequately spaced so we could get good feedback and really hone in on specific concepts.Having articles to apply to the concepts we were learning was excellent.My favorite course thus far. I really enjoyed learning more about epi!",
    "The homework assignments are very lengthy and time-consuming - making them shorter would be helpful. Instructor and presentations are excellent. My TA was not great, but got the information accross.",
    "I walk out of this class confident that I've learned a lot about epidemiology, and that's pretty much all I can ask for. The course is probably the only one I've taken at YSPH where I can say that it's incredibly well-organized, and I cannot stress the significance of this enough. The material isn't hugely challenging, but there is a lot of material, and the class is structured in a way that makes sense and facilitates understanding of the material. Wish more courses were like this one.",
    "Great Course, highly recommend. Strength: Enthusiastic instructor, who is willing to go above and beyond. The instructor clearly puts a lot of preparation into the course. Like the way actual research was incorporated into the course for understanding.Weakness: Would recommend greater overview or sitting in on TA sessions.",
    "I thought this course was great. My favorite I think. The principles of epidemiology were well taught and explained thoroughly. My sole advice\/critique is for the teaching layout of confoudning and effect modification. For me, it would have been better to discuss effect modification first and then confounding instead of the other way around. It seemed more logical in the was we assess for them both that we begin with effect modification or at least bring up effect modifcation (this is what you get when the stratum values are different which we will talk about next class)...anything instead of not really knowing what to do....i think it would make those topics go more smoothly. Beyond that, I thought the class was excellent. It was great to have access to each TA's lab slides as everyone modified theirs a bit differently...being able to look at them helped to explain the homeworks\/principles\/theories more extensively",
    "Good class.",
    "This was an overall good introductory course.I think the biggest improvement that could be made was the logistics of quizzes in the larger context of class organization. It was challenging to have a class on Monday that covered new material (that we didn't need to know for the quiz that Friday), then have a review on Wednesday, then have the quiz on Friday. A potentially improved structure is proposed below (using Fall 2011 dates, but could be modified for other semesters):Wed. Aug. 31: Overview& IntroductionFri. Sep. 2: No sectionMon. Sep. 5: Labor Day - No classWed. Sep. 7: History of modern epidemiologyFri. Sep. 9: Introduction to sectionMon. Sep. 12: Descriptive EpidemiologyWed. Sep. 14: Measures of disease FrequencyFri. Sep. 16: HW 1 DueMon. Sep. 19: Absolute measures of association& standardizationWed. Sep. 21: Relative measures of associationFri. Sep. 23: HW 2 DueMon. Sep. 26: Review for Quiz #1Wed. Sep. 28: Quiz #1Fri. Sep. 30: Review Quiz #1 (in section)Mon. Oct. 3: Study design overview, cross-sectional, ecological....and so on.Basically, this scheme would make the Monday before a quiz be the review day,have the quiz on Wednesday, and review in sections on the Friday. This would hopefully help material flow a little better and also might be helpful for students who are too shy to ask questions during the review session.",
    "The course provided a good overview and did a great job in linking the theoretical concepts to practical examples. I feel prepared to engage on epidemiological questions and for further \"epi-courses\" to come.",
    "This was my favourite course.",
    "well-organized class, gives you an overall understanding of the concept of epidemiology which is helpful in reading relevant articles. it would be even better if the standarized answers could be provided online for each quiz\/ prequiz tests.",
    "This course has a lot of work. Homework is due every week and the material is fast-paced.",
    "Strengths: I loved the course",
    "Great introductory epidemiology course. Covers the basics and does a good job of connecting all the material.",
    "Like most other big lecture classes, I thought the discussion section was the more informative and interesting part of the class. I didn't particularly enjoy the lecture very much but I learned a lot from my TA during discussion each week.",
    "Introduction to Epidemiology is a very good course; set-up is easy to follow and homework assignments really helped to understand the material before sitting for a quiz\/exam. Learned a lot about measurement methods, validity issues, study design, etc. that is necessary for conducting my research project over the summer.",
    "The course is pretty dense, there is a lot of information that you need to understand on a relatively deep level within a short period of time. We had a lot of homework, which combined with weekly readings take up a lot of time. It was helpful to have the regular assignments, because it provided you the opportunity to apply the information to 'real' problems.I liked the textbook, I thought it was relevant and clear.",
    "This course provides a good overview of epidemiology. Although the assignments can be time-consuming, they are useful in understanding the material.",
    "The course was a very good introduction to epidemilogy.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, good course organization, helpful to have section.Weaknesses: section could be more useful.",
    "I disliked the structure of the class. Namely, there was one lecture before every quiz that was not on the subsequent quiz. Also, just call them 'tests', not the euphemism quiz. They are so long.",
    "The course was a very good introduction to epidemiologic science and methods. I appreciate the focus on broad topics, however I believe that this came at the expense of some more necessary details. This is to be expected in introductory courses though, so overall I was pleased with the content of the course.",
    "strengths- provided great basic knowledge of epidemiology that I was able to apply immediately to all other course materiallecture was helpful and followed the text book wellways to be improved- MORE PRACTICE PROBLEMS!",
    "Good, but a little too stuck on terminology. I think this is useful for research, but I think most students will not be in Epi nor be in research in Epi so I think it's the wrong audience to ingrain such a strict level of jargon and terminology",
    "The course was a good introduction to epidemiology. However, many of the testing questions were not clearly presented, which made it difficult to fully present our knowledge of the course material.",
    "Overall this was my least favorite course- though the topic was interesting at times I didn't find the way it was taught to be particularly engaging. The problem sets were too long, the quizzes too difficult (they shouldn't be called quizzes), and class sometimes awkward. I did, however, learn a lot about the basics of epidemiology. I just think it could have been done in a different manner.",
    "The lectures were both informative and entertaining. The slides were VERY useful, and I found myself printing every slide set to study from.",
    "The material in this class was great and provided a great foundation of epi for public health students. I enjoyed how the homeworks were not graded because it allowed for us to try our best but not have to freak out about getting them all right. We could put our knowledge and opinion on paper and see if it was correct during discussion without being penalized.",
    "It is a lot of information! But I learned a lot about epi. Great intro course.",
    "I enjoyed the course as well as its structure.I think having weekly homework and occasional quizzes really helped establish the material. While reviewing for the final I was pleasantly surprised how much of the material I retained.As someone with no public health or epidemiological background this is a testament to how well this course has been designed.",
    "This is the most practical course that I have taken at YSPH thus far. The course is well organized. The problem sets are good practices. The articles are relevant and show how epi studies are done in real world.",
    "Strengths: The power point notes were helpful in narrowing down the topics that we were expected to know and that we would be tested on. Although the homework questions were pretty long and time consuming, it was necessary for it made sure we understood the concepts and materials that were covered in class. Thus, going over the homework in Friday sections were beneficial.Weaknesses: The first quiz could have been designed better. It was too long for the allotted amount of time that we were given.",
    "I enjoyed the course and have learned a lot. However, the quizzes tended to have tricky questioning (which it is allowed to) but my performance on the quizzes were not stellar. I went to as many office hours and asked as many questions as I could during discussion.The assignments were often time consuming but very useful.",
    "By far, I learned the most in this class. It was really great to learn a concrete skill set in such little time- very important material for public health work.",
    "The lectures provided a great introduction to Epidemiology that managed to bring in concepts from most of the different areas of public health, but the quizzes were poorly written and difficult to understand.",
    "The class provided a basic overview of the fundamental concepts in Epidemiology. The lectures were overall enjoyable.",
    "It's a good initial overview of Epidemiology but kind of slow and simplistic.",
    "good",
    "Very helpful to understand the basic epidemiological concepts. Definitely helped a lot.",
    "-fair level of workload-covers fundamental topics",
    "I think it was a great introductory course to epidemiology. I think the quizzes were way too long and students could be assessed with shorter versions of the quiz.",
    "This course was my favorite of all of my classes. The lectures were very solid in introducing epidemiology concepts. The homework and discussion sections reinforced the course material and helped to apply the epidemiology methods. The only weakness I can think of is that the long tests unfairly evaluated slow test takers.",
    "I like it a lot, because I do learn a lot of epi knowledge from this class. It is a very useful introduction class.",
    "The subject matter isn't particularly thrilling, but I also found that the instruction was a little dry. The lecture format made it difficult to learn and the slides seemed a little disorganized at times. Sometimes the slides would pose questions that were not always answered by the lecture which made it difficult to review.",
    "I thought I would really enjoy this class but I do not think the instructor did a good job of helping us apply the material. The course was based on nuances and trick questions on the test, that while she felt were straightforward were not. It would have been much more enjoyable if taught in a similar format to BioStats - with the goal to help us grasp and understand the material. It was hard to enjoy the class with the laborious homeworks and no application of the material.",
    "The course was not terribly engaging but not bad. Overall, it was a solid introduction to epidemiology.",
    "Strengths: two lectures per week in addition to a small group discussion section; homework assignments are relevant to lecture and quiz material; lecture slides are posted in advance; readings are incorporated into lectures",
    "I wish the course had more intentional overlap with Epidemiology.",
    "Strengths:great introductory coursesubstantial backgroud knowledge provided for first year public health studentsinteractive lecture styleWeaknesses:small group discussions were not helpfulmore practice problems and review sessions necessary",
    "This was one of my favorite classes this term--the varied selection of journal articles acted as case studies for the epi concepts we encountered (an excellent teaching tool) and provided a broad survey of the types of work being conducted in the field. I always enjoyed lecture and at the end of term was surprised and rewarded by how much I had learned along the way (without the onslaught of information approach that some professors take).",
    "The lectures and powerpoints could be more clear and organized. It felt as if the powerpoints are copied from the textbook.",
    "PDFs should be made to ppts so the small slides can be readable.",
    "I learnt many new thing from this class. Content well structured, textbook is helpful.",
    "This is a solid introductory course in epi. It's low-frills, but the TA sessions ensure that the material presented sticks. Testing is fair and workload reasonable.",
    "Excellent!",
    "An interesting and information filled course that did not require too much effort but was incredibly helpful and taught me a lot. If anything, I might consider including more material and going through concepts a bit more quickly.",
    "The Course provided a good overview of epidemiology. Its weakness were that it was a bit monotonous and the exams were too long.",
    "This is a great intro epidemiology course and I feel like I have a good handle on the general epidemiology principles.",
    "Sections were not particularly useful as the time was just used to go over the answers to the weekly problem sets. The problem sets themselves were quite long as were the exams. Overall, however, the course did an effective job of teaching the basic tools of epidemiology.",
    "very thorough, organized presentation of material. hmework\/sections arrangement very effective. instructor excellent.",
    "The course was a wonderful introduction to epidemiology.",
    "This was a very interesting course. Lectures were easy to follow and very well organized. The textbook was very straightforward and engaging to read. I liked that we had thorough reviews before\/after each quiz.One weakness is the length of the homeworks and quizzes, they were very long.",
    "This was a fantastic course.Strengths: Dr Linda Niccolai (excellent professor; you can tell she put in so much effort into the lectures, questions on quizzes\/tests, HW); our TA was also great; great resources; fun and engaging lectures, prompt return of grades",
    "The course was good but her quizzes and exams are wayyy too long. I also think that weekly homeworks are not necessary."

Her quizzes and tests are intimidating but and she has high expectations of students but she also spends the time and effort so students can meet those expectations. She is a great asset to the program.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Helpful, structured the class well, provides important, useful examples.

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a good lecturer, and has designed a great course. Would say, however, that she seems to lack the ability to adequately respond to students' questions consistently: sometimes it has been because she doesn't understand the question and doesn't make enough effort to do so, and sometimes there is a sense that she isn't sure of the answer. However, the few times where it has been the latter, she has freely admitted this and consulted her colleagues, and I sincerely admire her candor in that regard. She understands that respect begets respect, and I very much appreciate the way she relates to students in and out of lecture. The amount of time she puts into making sure the course is up-to-date as well as organized makes her stand out in comparison to the other professors I've had this semester. I do think that her exam questions are not quite as clear as she thinks they are, and she might benefit from having one of her TFs interpret some of her questions so that she can better understand what we see in her language.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The absolute utmost respect and admiration for Dr. Niccolai. She clearly has invested time and effort into ensuring that the materials are up to date and clearly presented. Certainly not a honor student, but I felt that this was one of the courses I took away the most from.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was great, very thorough in her explanations, provided lots of examples to explain the principles. The homeworks and readings were readily applicable and helpful for both class and the tests. She was also readily available which was nice and refreshing. Very interactive with her students. Passionate\/enthusiastic about the subject.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai did a great job at helping us learn the principles of epidemiology. This course is likely very challenging to teach and she did a great job. She sometimes seemed unsure of herself and how we should be interpreting material, but she always did her best to explain concepts to us.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very good instructor. I really enjoyed her style of teaching and the course.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was a great instructor, and I really enjoyed the use of real and current examples to explain the concepts being taught.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccholai is really responsible and well-prepared for the class. She can explain the abstract concepts in epidemiology well and her office hour is rather helpful. Moreover, the way she teaches is humorous and fun.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was a great person however the material is definitely something to keep up with. She responds to emails fast, and cares about students.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The Instructor has put in a lot of effort with respect to homework or practice problems and finals. The lecture material could be improved since the material is complementary to what she speaks in class but not when you refer to it back at home.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is very passionate and educated on epi. She's a great lecturer and genuinely seems to care about the material and about her students.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was a good instructor, although she always seemed a bit frazzled and often didn't have good answers if a student would ask a question.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is very helpful, and ready to discuss student's questions, thoughts both in the classroom and during office hours. The only caveat was that some of the material presented was unclear (not to the point). In addition, quiz questions were often difficult to interpret, and could benefit from clarification in the future - i.e. if it was worded in a different way, most of us would have understood the main point of the question.Overall, Dr. Niccolai is a good instructor and set-up the lecture well..had students participate, ask questions, very relaxed atmosphere that was conducive to learning.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was an engaging lecturer and did a decent job of presenting the information. She wasn't always clear about some of the content, and would often sound nervous or unsure of some things.Her quizzes and exams were pretty dense. She asked a lot of questions in a short period of time. I think it would be better if she allowed up more equations to use during the quizzes and final, or reduce the number of questions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a great professor. She presents the material very clearly using well-organized PowerPoints.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was very enthusiastics, did a good job of keeping a very large class engaged.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Engaging instructor. Would like to see her lecture with more confidence. She is a great lecturer--engaging, informative, and humorous.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She sometimes gave scattered responses to questions; however, all in all she did a good job of presenting the material, and grading and quizzes were fair.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was charasmatic in lecture and always willing to answer questions to facilitate learning. However, she was unable to answer questions thoroughly sometimes - more times than I feel should have happened - and occasionally when the questions regarded basic details. Lectures were thorough.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr.Niccolai was a fantastic professor. She definitely knew the material well and explained the concepts well in class.However, sometimes Dr. Niccolai's knowledge\/responses were fickle and inconsistent. Students should have an opportunity to defend their responses on exams, as epidemiology is never absolute and sometimes more than one answer can be applicable depending on the wording and interpretation of the question.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think the teacher is great..she really sounds like she cares and she is very thorough.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0One on one Prof. Niccolai is very kind, sensitive, and supportive. However, in class she sometimes comes off as aggressive and condescending. It's often uncomfortable answering her questions in the larger classroom, especially after another student attempted the answer and was told they were wrong.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai loves her subject, and is able to provide interesting examples and clear descriptions of subject matter (for the most part).",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0At times some of the material was not presented 100% clear but overall Professor Niccolai was great and really was interested in the progress of her students.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very enthusiastic about the topic. Engaging and encouraged class participation.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai overall was a solid lecturer. Her strengths as a lecturer were due to her thorough knowledge of the subject but most important her passion for epidemiology.It was clear that for Dr. Niccolai, epidemiology is a living and ever changing subject. Her lectures often included studies that demonstrated this.Dr. Niccolai was also very approachable and was willing to work with students that needed help. I really have nothing negative to say and believe she has found a niche for introducing public health students to epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I can tell that Niccolai really cares about this class and the students she's teaching. She wants all her students to do well, and she tries hard to explain every concept in a coherent way. Sometimes, her questions are confusing due to wording, but overall they are comprehensible, just don't focus too much on the details.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: The professor was open to questions after lectures.Weaknesses: In lecture we would discuss concepts and theories and their applications to epidemiological studies, but rarely do we do practice problems like that assigned on the homework. Sometimes it is hard to approach problems on the homework because we have not been taught how to approach the problems; thus, we do not know how or where to start. Perhaps, setting time aside to solve some practice problems would be helpful before students approach their homework.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda Niccolai is a great instructor for the course and explained the material well.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was extremely organized and had clearly defined course objectives that she kept to throughout the course. She really structured the class so that the work was manageable and pertinent too. I enjoyed her class and how it was structured. On the other hand, she was very condescending at times and rude to students in class. I think this is the main thing she can work on.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai did an excellent job summarizing important concepts and providing adequate examples during lecture. She was easy to listen to, and most of the lectures were interesting and informative.However, the quizzes and homework assignments were a huge headache. They were not clearly worded, and I felt that I wasted a significant amount of time trying to understand the question, even if I completely understood the concept being tested.The final, however, was clear and much more appropriate that most of the other evaluations.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was a wonderful lecturer; she definitely made the class stimulating. However, she could have attempted to elicit more class discussion or reviewed current epidemiologic research papers in greater detail in order to prompt us to apply concepts learned in class. At times, she seemed unprepared to answer questions, but she always followed up with responses afterwards.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Generally competent at presenting course information, but occasionally failed to communicate and to be aware of students with questions. Additionally, some of the exam questions were quite poorly worded, leading to misunderstandings about expected responses and frustrations over missed points.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Excellent! Made epidemiology a lot of fun!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0-sometimes makes easy-to-understand concepts really convoluted and confusing in slides-lacks focus on gaining skills in interpreting articles-good layout of the class",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda has great pedagogical skills. She has clearly defined goals for each day and what we should take out of lecture. Her slides were very well thought and she was very organized. Her TAs were wonderful and there was great team work. If I could recommend something would be to seem more approachable towards students.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was a very well organized and well prepared lecturer. She cares a lot about the course which is refreshing and shows in her attitude and material. The homework assignments and test are thorough and thoughtful.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The teaching structure is very clear and systematic.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very good instructor, made the course enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Although Professor Niccolai means well, she tends to be very dry and can be a little hard to follow. Her train of thought does not always seems to move in a way that is conducive to learning, and it was often not clear which concepts we should focus on.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0While she tried very hard and you could tell was genuine about trying to teach the material, I felt that the course could have been taught more effectively. During lectures we would rush through slides and I had to resort to the book or reading through the lectures notes after class. Also, while the information and tests were not difficult, I don't feel they helped to apply the knowledge to practice. She taught the course more towards memorizing specific facts and nuances in Epi, opposed to applying it in a broade setting.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was pretty good. She could be confusing at times -- especially when things got mathematical. Making that stuff clearer would be helpful. Her reviews and practice problem sets were extremely useful.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The instructor was very engaging during class. She also was incredibly accommodating if students required extra help or extra credit.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The professor was readily available to meet with the students. She was very receptive to the students' varying abilities with Epidemiology. However, she did call out some students who tried to participate and put them on the spot. While this allowed the student to learn a new concept, I could feel that those students were quite uncomfortable. There is a time and place to place a student in the hot seat, but it is kind of unfortunate to put them in that seat in front of many people when the student attempted to answer a question with genuine enthusiasm.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0good teacher, loved her enthusiasm for the subject.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The instructor provided the overview of the epidemiology and was very interactive with students for clarification and questions. Her teaching style is excellent.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Niccolai was a bright, engaging lecturer and a true teacher. I really felt like you were excellent in every respect.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The professor is kind and very understanding of students. She tries to make sure that everyone learns the material well and is open to feedback.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Can offer more examples and practice problems.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Clear and patient.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is obviously very dedicated to get work and taught the class cogently and successfully.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Good, but gets easily confused.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Nicolai explained all my questions very well. I was able to follow her lectures in class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Niccolai was extremely engaging in lecture and extremely helpful outside of lecture. She took what is often considered very dry subject matter and made it very interesting to listen to, relevant with some great examples, and some of the best lecture powerpoints I have ever had.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Generally good.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was very clear in her teaching methods and gave ample examples to describe certain subject matters.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0see above",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was very enthusiastic and willing to help students outside of class time. Her only weakness lie in the ambiguous wording of a few homework\/quiz questions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is a very organized professor and always posted lectures beforehand. She is easily accessible for students\u00b4questions. Her classes were interesting, clear and engaging. I never got bored by listening to her lectures. One weakness was how she worded some of her quizzes. Some questions could be interpreted in many different ways and it was hard to identify which interpretation the professor wanted from some questions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was an excellent professor. I appreciate how much effort she placed in preparing the lectures, the tests and homework. Lectures were engaging and interesting and clear. I appreciated that Dr. Niccolai went through the nitty gritty of things but also gave the macro view. I was sitting in my final thinking \"this is an elegant test\". I felt I was being tested on things that I learned and was getting to apply them during the exam.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is nice and funny at times."

    "Bryan was good. He was very patient.",
    "My TA was great. He walked us through the homework assignments and clearly answered any questions that we had. He was also diplomatic in how he handled difficult students. I enjoyed walking through the homeworks together as a group, rather than working in smaller groups.",
    "Brian was an excellent TA. He was always prepared in section. His slides were very helpful too.",
    "Excellent",
    "Javier. Nice guy! Explain the questions very clearly.",
    "Sarah Hamid is a good TA, she understands our questions and gives explanations that were different from what we had already heard in order to accomodate different learning styles.",
    "bryan was amazing, clearly will be an epi prof in the near future.",
    "Bryan was a good TA this semester.",
    "Lesley ParkLesley was widely recognized by her students as the most helpful TA. She smiled constantly during sections, and on Friday mornings, this really made the difference. Her willingness to help was also reflected during her office hours and the preparation that she put into her sections. The class,though wonderful, would have been significantly diminished in value without Lesley Park.",
    "My TA, Kacie Seil, was well-prepared, responsive, thoughtful, and professional. She clearly spent time preparing for each section and was an excellent communicator.",
    "Ok",
    "My TA lesley is the best one I've ever had, we all like her!",
    "Lesley- she was excellent. Went above and beyond her TA duties to help us learn the material and prepare for quizzes. Great feedback. Section was very helpful.",
    "Lesley Park--Lesley was an amazing TA. She was always prepared and it was clear that she enjoyed teaching the section. She is the best TA I've had this semester. I also went to Javier's office hours and he was very helpful. In general, I think that it is much better to have PhD TAs than second year TAs. The second year (Kacie) seemed to lack confidence and she wasn't overly approachable.",
    "Lesley Park- Extremely helpful, friendly, and organized. Explains concepts very coherently. She did a fantastic job!",
    "good",
    "My Teaching Assistant for this course was Kacie Siel. She was approachable both in and outside of section, and provided understandable answers to the homework assignments. Although Kacie effectively reviewed homework sets in section, we never reviewed or discussed classroom material. This is an element of section that I would have appreciated greatly.When preparing for quizzes, I always used the PowerPoints prepared by Bryan and Leslie. My classmates enrolled in their sections gained a significant amount in their section in terms of understanding and integrating the material. This is an element that I think should be standardized across all sections and assistants.",
    "Kacie was my TA. Our section was ok, but I wish that Kacie had done a better job of managing the class. In particular there were a couple of people in the class who would start the class out by saying \"Can we just turn in our papers and leave?\" and then they would mutter under their breath every time someone asked a question and say things like \"Just shut up so we can leave.\" This made me feel like I couldn't use class time to ask my questions. Their behavior was obviously not Kacie's fault but I wish that she had addressed the issue more directly to create a better environment.",
    "Lesley Park is fantastic. Absolutely the best. She needs a prize. My quiz grades slowly improved and I know that's due to Lesley's thorough Friday reviews, pre-test reviews, and dedication to her section. I feel so lucky to have had her for a TA.",
    "Brian was an awesome TA. He was helpful, and knowledgeable.",
    "My TA is Bryan Bassiq.Bryan has been really helpful in the discussion section. It will be better if the section is conducted in a more flexible way.",
    "TA: Javier CepedaJavier was an organized and knowledgeable TA who conducted section efficiently. His instruction was very helpful and he was always able toanswer our questions.",
    "Bryan Bassing is one of the best TAs I have ever had. He did not simply go over the answers to the homework, but exaplined how the answeres were derived and the reasoning behind the solving of each problem. He always had excellent answers to all student questions. He really went above and beyond, and I definitely got a lot out of the weekly sessions with him. A lot of my friends who were in other sections used Bryan's powerpoints to study for quizzes and the final.",
    "Javier Cepedacool guy! careful and clear.",
    "Bryan is an amazing TA. He is very approachable, answers questions thoroughly and clearly and helped us connect many concepts to one another. I think the TA sessions really helped because he not only explained concepts, but also helped us draw connections between the lessons.",
    "Having the TA review sessions was helpful before exams.",
    "Bryan Bassig - knows the material but it took him some time to develop a presence in front of other students in the classroom. The discussion sections were primarily devoted to going over the homework, with little encouragement of \"discussion\" outside the prescribed answers, which made sections pretty boring. But the TA was very well organized knowlegeable on the subject matter, and generally helpful.",
    "Can't say enough about Lesley Park. Incredibly dedicated to our learning process, she comes to our Friday sessions well-prepared every week. She goes above and beyond in crafting her weekly powerpoints, helping us learn from our homework mistakes and prepare for monthly quizzes. She makes a serious effort to understand each question, and answer it adequately. I hope she intends to teach in some way during her career, because she has great teaching potential. Only suggestion would be to be more confident!",
    "Sarah H. Teh TA was clearly knowledgeable, but not sure she has the confidence to convey the information. Tends to back down and agree to wrong answers when information challenged by other students.",
    "Kacie. She was great. Had a solid understanding of the epi princples. She took time to explain any questions we had or if she did not know she would find out and get back to us. The lab sessions were very helpful to solidify the princples we learned in class. Furthermore, the other TA's were also very helpful (the phd students). Lesley in particular was great. Her lab lecture slides were very well explained and she had other questions that further explained and expanded principles we had learned which facilitated the learning process of those principles.",
    "She is hot.",
    "My TA was Sarah. She was fine.",
    "My TA was simply very good. I think the overall team did a great job and the epi course was one of the really convincing modules for me.",
    "My T.A. was really nice, and took a lot of time to explain difficult concepts.",
    "My TA Kacie is nice and helpful. The discussion sessions for epidemiology gives you a better understanding of the knowledge you learned in class and use it into solving practical problems. I really appreciate that she was willing to answer our extra questions before final via emails and personal appointment.",
    "The TA was Bryan. He was great. When I went to office hours he was always there to answer my questions. He definitely knows the material.",
    "Bryan Bassig: He was amazing! His material was really good and always ready to help. No weaknesses",
    "Kacie was very helpful at explaining the material and answering our questions. Great TA.",
    "My TA was Javier Cepeda. I thought he was really excellent, and as much as I hated doing the homework every week (which was very time-consuming), I learned a lot from doing it and from talking through it every Friday in his section. He was also very helpful during review sessions and office hours.",
    "Sarah Hamid - very good TA...willing to help answer questions, clarify material.",
    "My TA was Sarah Hamid- She was knowledgeable and helpful. She answered all of our questions and reviewed concepts that were tricky. She was great.",
    "Kacie is a great TA. She is very friendly and leads the discussions well.",
    "Bryan was outstanding, very organized and knowledgable.",
    "TA: Javier CepedaExcellent TA. I really enjoy his teaching style. He was always willing to answer questions. Always prepared for section--knows material well, prepared excellent Powerpoint slides. I do think the format of section could be more helpful--would like to see more concept review rather than mostly homework review.",
    "TA was okay. However, I did not feel that section was all that informative. They simply could have posted the answers to the HW, and I would have gotten just the same out of it.",
    "Kacie was my TA. I feel like she did a good job answering questions and facilitating learning, however her knowledge of the material was not as advanced as I would have expected. Often, certain nuances of points could not be adequately simplified, so questions persisted after our meetings. This may be a function of her own level of education, which is worth considering. Otherwise, I believe she made adequate presentations and helped enough with questions.",
    "LESLIE WAS AN AMAZING TA. She really took the time to make sure everyone in the class understood the material and genuinely wanted everyone to succeed. Even more importantly, when we took turns responding to homework questions in section, even if our response was not correct, she never made anyone feel incompetent-- instead she focused on the parts of the question\/concepts that the student did understand and guide him\/her towards the correct response.",
    "Lesley was great. I think she might know the EPI material better than the teacher.",
    "Sarah was great. She was very helpful and approachable and had a thorough understanding of the course material.",
    "Bryan was amazing- very helpful, incredibly knowledgeable, and helped make the course a \"safe\" place to learn and ask \"stupid\" questions. We did the majority of true learning during section. Huge thanks to Bryan- I think he was one of the best TAs (top two).",
    "My section TA was Javier Capeda. I have never had a better TA. He was very well-informed in the subject matter, respectful, kind, funny, and always willing to help. I very much enjoyed his section, and would recommend him highly to TA this course again.",
    "Bryan Bessing was an awesome TA! He provided us with extra material\/review material each week that helped supplement the lectures. He didn't just rush through the homework questions but really made sure we understood it. He was great!",
    "Javier Cepeda was a wonderful TA. He was very nice and polite about answering questions.",
    "Javier Cepeda is by far the best TA I've ever had.I can list a long list of ways he helped in my learning but there would be too much to list.To put it simply, I hope Javier eventually becomes a professor, he has a natural ability to teach and this talent will help so many students in the future.",
    "Lesley ParkI love my TA! She was very helpful and was able to explain all my questions. Her powerpoints were the best among all TAs; she took extra time each week to review the concept and go over extra practice problems. A+ for Lesley!",
    "Strengths: My TA is Bryan and he is great! He was helpful when one had questions about a problem or concept discussed in class.",
    "Bryan Bassig: Bryan explained the information during section however I felt like he could have reviewed material in a different manner. Other TAs oriented the material in such a way that I understood the concept better than with Bryan. However, Bryan's office hours were one of the few that I could attend on a regular basis and he is better one on one to explain material.",
    "Lesley Park is wonderful! She put a lot of effort into the class, was always accessible for help, andwas extremely nice. I wish she was my TA for every class - what a great teacher!",
    "Lesley was an excellent TA. Although going over homework was not always particularly helpful, her lecture summaries were SO helpful (many students from other sections used them to study), and she always had good answers to our questions.",
    "Javier CepedaJavier was a wonderful TA. He really encouraged class discussion and made the sections engaging. However, he could have attempted to use other tactics to challenge us to think beyond the confines of our homework problems.",
    "Sarah HamidAn average TA. She effectively ran us through the homework questions and correctly addressed some student questions but kind of failed on others, and did not provide anything additional.",

    "TA is very nice and responsible.",
    "Kacie SeilExcellent job running section. Kept things interesting and also covered the material. Looking over the slides from other TAs, it's possible they may have been more thorough.",
    "Sarah Hamid unfortunatly was not well suited to be a TA. I actually felt at a disadvantage having her compared to other TA's such as Lesley and Brian. When I attended review sessions with them or heard from other students in their courses, I was shocked by how unhelpful our TA was in comparison. If you compared grades across TA's (esp. Lesley) I would not be suprised if there was a difference. Having a TA who is invested in helping students and are confident in the material would have made a big difference. From my observation it appeared that Sarah was the outlier though.",
    "Kacie was great.",
    "Bryan was always very prepared and organized. He very clearly presented the homework solutions and promptly returned assignments.",
    "The TAs were very helpful and had great powerpoint slides!",
    "TA Kacie knew the subject matter very well and helped my understanding of epi through her explanations.",
    "TAs were excellent and very helpful.",
    "Javier was nice but not super helpful. He frequently misunderstood my and other students' questions and did not explain things well. Make sure TAs are better prepped and standardized across; apparently Leslie explained things really well, gave review lectures every week, and really prepared her students.",
    "Lesley Park is one of the best TAs I have ever had. She cares about students and makes sure that everyone learns the material well. She is always prepared, kindly answer everyone's question, and does her best to answer the question well.",
    "Leslie--very helpful, answers questions so that students can understand, useful diagrams and tables. Useful practice questions.",

    "Lesley Park was a really fantastic TA. Her powerpoints were always very thorough, her sections reviewed and summarized material very clearly without making section boring, and the section was always very focused, organized, and engaging.",
    "Good at answering any questions regarding the material and providing explanations.",
    "The TAs were very helpful in sections and gave back assignments in a timely manner. They were also very helpful with review for the quizzes.",
    "I did not find the discussion particularly helpful. Though the discussion section provided a unique opportunity to ask any questions, if I did not have any questions, the TA just went over the answers to the homework assignments; I checked off my answers and gained very little from the section. The TA, however, was wonderfully helpful and adept at providing answers to student-asked questions.",
    "Javier Cepeda was a wonderful TA. He seemed to enjoy his job and was very accessible for students. He seemed genuinely interested in our understanding of thematerial. He also is very solid in epidemiology.One thing he could improve is when checking our homeworks. He could provide more feedback on questions aside from only writing pass or fail.",
    "Kacie (Seil) was great TF. She was always available and accommodating. She would give us excellent tips and if we had questions she would always follow upon them. Our sections were fun and engaging.",

    "Highly recommend",
    "It provides a good base for the field of epidemiology. Most of the first year students have to take it anyway.",
    "The course is useful for beginners in this scientific area. It improves the understanding of the principals used in most epidemiological papers.It provides some kind of overview of recent epidemiological studies.",
    "difficult and takes a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend the course. I think I now have a strong sense of introductory epidemiology.",
    "Take this class. It is a nice survey of epidemiology and public health which can inform decisions about future careers and spark new interests as well.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in public health or statistics.",
    "Ok",
    "Again, it's a lot of work, but you'll find a way to make it...if you wanna do a phD, it's a MUST to learn.",
    "Great course- useful info presented in a clear and easy-to-understand format",
    "This is a great introduction to epi and public health!",
    "I'd recommend this course.",
    "It is intuitive. It brings a lot of concepts that will be used as a MPH student.",
    "I highly recommend this course. While it requires time input to do the homework and to study for the exams, the structure and expectations are clear, and if you follow the prescribed syllabus, you will learn a lot.",
    "It is a great course! You do a lot of work, but you gain a lot of very valuable knowledge from the work that you do.",
    "you have to take this, it is mandatory. and you will love it",
    "Great class! Tough but necessary.",
    "Overall, I learned a lot. I think this is a really well-organized class. Confirmed my thoughts\/desires on wanting to be involved with PH!",
    "A great introduction to epidemiology. It's required, but it's not a painful requirement and you'll learn a lot in the end. Readings, homework, quizzes and an exam. Pretty straight forward.",
    "The instructor (Dr. Niccolai) makes the course! Never thought I would like Epi, saw it as a mandatory class. Enjoyed the course and would certainly recommend. Workload is fair and appropriate. HW clearly evaluated by instructor and enhances learning.",
    "This is a great intro to epi course. It provides a solid foundation of epi principles that are key to move forward in publich health (espcially with research design or how to analzye studies). I would strongly encourage one to take the course.",
    "It's a good class.",
    "No hesitation to recommending the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "clear and useful. need to take to build up basic skill set to better understand public health.",
    "This course is about the determinants of health and how diseases are spread, various ways to measure this, etc. I would definitely recommend this course to another student as this is such a foundation in public health. It makes reading articles much easier as you can actually understand what they are referring towith specific terms.",
    "I loved the course overall!!!!!",
    "Good overview of the general concepts of epidemiology taught by a great professor. Lectures are comprehensive and make reading the assigned material easy to digest. Quizzes can seem like an endurance test but are fair and well written.",
    "It's a lot of work, thereis a homework assignment or quiz every single week which really sucks. Both the homeworks and quizzes are also extremely long and time-consuming, but in the end it's probably a decent way to learn the material. I just wish they could shorten the length of those assignments. The final exam took most people 3 hours to complete!",
    "Intro. to EPI is a very good course..required for MPH degree..learn a lot about study design, methods, etc. Need to put in a good amount of effort to fully understand material, but worth it when it comes time for the final exam and periodic quizzes. Definitely gain a technical understanding that is necessary for public health research.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a good introduction to Epi and covers a breadth of information. I would advise that it takes quite a bit of time to do the readings (textbook and articles) weekly homework assignments and prepare for quizzes.",
    "I recommend this course. It is a lot of work, but it will give you a thorough understanding of epidemiology.",
    "Yes, I would recomment this course.",
    "Great introduction to epidemiology. The course covers a lot of material, but it is essential for your MPH studies.",
    "Very useful course for the field of Public Health. I probably learned more in this class, then all of my other classes. I did have some problems with the structure of class, but all in all, good class.",
    "I enjoyed the course material. I believe the instruction was good, but not a particular strength. I was not dissatisfied with the course.",
    "I would take it if you are an EPI research major. Otherwise, I would look for a more survey in Epi type class for the casual learner.",
    "Good intro to epidemiology. Long problem sets and difficult quizzes, but overall you will learn what you need.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. It gave me an excellent foundation from which to build my epidemiology knowledge.",
    "I would recommend this course. It provided a great knowledge base to build off of.",
    "A lot of work! But it will definitely teach you a lot about epi. Keep up with the readings so that you are prepared for the quizzes. Also get use of the office and TA hours, which are really helpful.",
    "Yes, and go to Friday sections!",
    "You are required to take this course. Nothing to lose.",
    "This class is a must! Besides being a required class for a majority of MPH students, this class IS helpful in introducing the concepts and elements of epidemiology that are essential to all those who are in the field of public health.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. The course is very useful in the concepts learned as a future Epidemiologist or to critique epidemiological articles.",
    "Helpful, useful, worthwhile- take it!",
    "This class is very helpful and absolutely necessary for anyone in public health. However, because it is an introductory class, it is not as challenging as hoped.",
    "Good overview course.",
    "good",
    "Must for public health students! And also for anyone who might just be interested in knowing more about the field of epidemiology.",
    "I would greatly recommend it for anyone in medical fields wanting to pursue research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course even though it is required. The class provides a foundation in the basic epidemiology concepts and methods. Future students should read the book, go to lecture, and take the assignments seriously. I appreciate everything I learned from it.",
    "Yes, I will recommend.",
    "Good course with quite a bit of helpful material.",
    "It's a required course for the MPH program, but the subject matter isn't particularly interesting and the instruction with Niccolai was not stellar. The workload is manageable as long as you keep up with the lectures.",
    "Be prepared to study the nuances and your ability to try and think like Prof Niccolai in order to do well on tests. The homeworks are long and tedious. Also, ensure you have a good TA, and if not do what you can to switch sections.",
    "Well, it's required. If you get Professor Niccolai again expect solid but not necessarily riveting instruction.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I feel that it gave me a great overview of study design and some quantitative measures. It has enabled me to read journal articles with a much stronger understanding of the researchmethods and results.",
    "Good foundations course that requires a lot of reading and also demands that you stay on top of the material.",
    "loved it, found it to be well organized and informative.",
    "This is a good introductory course for epidemiology. I would highly recommend it to other students.",
    "It's a strong course and you'll learn a lot. Linda Niccolai is a pleasure to learn from.",
    "Useful for all aspects of public health.",
    "This is a solid introductory course in epi. It's low-frills, but the TA sessions ensure that the material presented sticks. Testing is fair and workload reasonable.",
    "yes. It is a fundamental class to take, and it is not too difficult.",
    "Epi is often known for being a dry course, but I really enjoyed this course a great deal. You'll learn a huge amount about the way epidemiological studies are developed, designed, conducted, and interpreted, all for a very very manageable work-load. Prof. Niccolai is fantastic - helpful and very engaging.",
    "This is a great general epidemiology course and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a solid background in general epidemiology principles.",
    "This course teaches the basic tools of epidemiology. It can be dry at times, but most of the concepts are necessary for understanding epidemiological research and literature.",
    "I would recommend this course as a solid foundation to the introduction of epidemiology.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. This is one of the foundations of public health. Aside from its professional importance, it is a genuinely interesting course.",
    "Principles of Epi I is an essential class. Dr. Niccolai was excellent and so were materials and resources for the class(from the lectures to the homeworks to the exams). Testing was very fair. Dr. Niccolai and the TFs were always available. One of my favorite classes!!",
    "Overall good course. Anyways you do not have a choice but to take it."
