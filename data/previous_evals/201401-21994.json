    "A really, really easy class. This was kind of a joke to be honest. There were about 8 problem sets, each 3 problems long, that could be submitted online as many times as you wanted until you got them all correct (you got feedback on your answers to see if they were right or not). The hardest pset took me about 15 min. There was also a midterm (again, you could submit it over and over until you got everything right) and a project (which you were guaranteed an A on if you submitted early enough to present it). So all in all, I will be receiving an A with a total of about 5 hours spent on the class this entire semester. It's great as a 5th class if you want to do absolutely no work. But don't expect to get anything out of it, except a GPA boost.",
    "This class made Mambo look like nuclear engineering.",
    "hoaxes is joaxes",
    "If you don't take this class you are a fool.",
    "This is a nice SUPER gut if you are in need of a QR credit. Other wise, do not take. Simply uninteresting.",
    "A great class if you need a QR. More interesting that I expected, and many opportunities to do well. I definitely recommend it if you are taking 5 classes and need something not time consuming.",
    "If this class is somehow allowed to continue existing in its current form, of course every student at Yale should take it.",
    "Take it! Barely any work, great 5th class. Weekly psets that don't take longer than 15-20 mins each. 1 final group project and that's all.",
    "If you don't take this class, you're doing it wrong buddy.",
    "Yes I would recommend.",
    "I never (I mean a total of zero times) went to class. That was cool.",
    "Biggest gut at Yale.",
    "If they offered it again, and you don't take it, you might as well drop out of Yale. End of the semester due dates for all assignments, which you can re-submit until you get an A. Same for the midterm - unlimited submissions. Project was pretty straightforward and I now know how to use a new program - gephi!",
    "The easiest class of all time. You'll do no work and they'll guarantee you an A",
    "yes",
    "MUST TAKE",
    "As much as you will hear about this being a gut, it is actually more work than you might think. There are weekly psets to do and a substantial final projects. That being said, the topics is actually interesting (machine learning, image processing, neural networks, etc). I loved the class!",
    "Must take.",
    "Unreal class.",
    "Good course, solid lectures, tough yet rewarding p-sets.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a course with little work.",
    "I would recommend the course, but please do not believe other people who say this is a gut class. It requires closely following the lectures to complete the homework assignments. The midterm examination was not easy, as well. The final project took some thorough network analysis and learning some concepts outside of the course. Overall, the course is personally satisfying if you put in the work and really work on a great project!",
    "If you want a super easy, no-work QR credit, take this class.",
    "The guttiest of all guts",
    "Take the class if you're interested in doing a project on networks. You won't learn much in the class itself, but the project is really fun if you put the effort into it.",
    "Take it, Easy A",
    "Yes. You learn some interesting (and hopefully useful) mathematical\/probability\/statical concepts and there is not too much work at all. More than manageable.",
    "Very little hard work, and I don't know if this course will ever be offered again but it was a nice introduction to applied math for someone (like me) who never in 1 million years would have thought they could take a college level math class.",
    "It is a good class to take for a QR. You will definitely learn about things you haven't in the past if you go to class, it's actually quite interesting and applicable to modern life in a variety of ways.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It's a great QR for non-math students. There is weekly graded homework, a take-home midterm, and a final project. All of this requires effort, but it is totally manageable if you put in the effort. Also, the final project was pretty interesting because you could choose any topic you found compelling.",
    "If it is ever offered again, take it yes",
    "If, by some divine miracle of God, this course is offered in the future, you would be making your biggest mistake at Yale not to enroll.",
    "so easy. i would be surprised if everybody in the class doesn't get an A.",
    "interesting class",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "It is hard to summarize this course because there were a lot of different topics taught that were not related, and the homeworks were all unrelated assignments. I probably would not recommend this course to another student simply because I do not think I got a lot out of it.",
    "I would be shocked if Yale ever offered this course again considering how ridiculous it was...but if you can take this class it is the ultimate gut.",
    "I mean, if you need a QR this is certainly an option - weekly ten-ish minute homework assignments and then a final project on which literally no one had a clue what he or she was doing. Going to class was entirely unnecessary - as long as you do the homeworks and project, I think you're pretty much guaranteed an A for doing pretty much nothing.",
    "A good lecture class that teaches you to use Gephi, uses game theory and probability, and shows you how everything is truly interrelated. Take this class.",
    "Just do your homework and the final project, and you will be absolutely fine! Everything is very manageable and not super time consuming.",
    "Incredible class, so easy and you can look at all the lecture online",
    "Interesting class that deals with a lot of different materials surrounding networks. Good class to take as there is not a huge time commitment.",
    "yep. great course!",
    "Would recommend it if you have no problem wasting an hour plus twice a week sitting in lecture and another hour or so doing pointless homeworks for an easy A\/A-",
    "Take it you want a super gut QR",
    "This class is a gut, but there is some interesting stuff to learn. It was not necessary to go to class, unfortunately.",
    "If you're looking for a simple, straight-forward QR credit, take this course. You are almost guaranteed to succeed if you so much as try to do the homework, and the course material itself is not difficult to grasp. There is one take-home midterm and a final project, making this course the best QR credit around for more humanities\/social science-oriented students. If you're a STEM person and are interested in truly digging deeply into Applied Mathematics, do not take this course, it simply is not for you. I would certainly recommend the course.",
    "It's not worth attending the lectures. Do the homework in advance, as well as the project!",
    "Take this class! You need the QR.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is an extra credit (that will likely result in an A) that you don't have to show up to class for.",
    "Best class at Yale!!",
    "I seriously doubt they ever offer this class again but if they do, TAKE IT.",
    "hardest class at yale. by far. lulz.",
    "yes.",
    "An absolutely stellar way to get a QR. If you do what you need to do you get a good grade.",
    "I don't think there is anyway that Yale or the professor will allow this class to be taught again in a similar style. But easy fifth class. There are online PSETs that you can submit more than once until you get it right, online midterm that you can submit more than once until you get it right. And a group project that if you just summarize someone else's research on structures becomes ridiculously easy. My only suggestion is that if you're bad at QR (which I am) this is kind of an annoying easy class. Cause everyone else will talk about how they finished the homework in an hour or less and each homework took me two or more hours. However, I got a perfect score on them so can I really complain?",
    "This was a great class to have as a fifth. It was low work, easy to do well, and still learn from it.",
    "Great class, especially if you go to lecture",
    "Writing this evaluation is the most work I had to do for this class. Need I say more?",
    "yes",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Take it.",
    "Don't take it Credit\/D",
    "Very straightforward assignments, I didn't know much about networks and their applications before taking this course, and I now understand all of the components that go into networks (statistics, math, probability, etc...) and how constructing them can be a very interesting way to present data and can reveal patterns that are valuable in data analysis Prof.Coifman is very understanding of the restrictions that students have, and very direct with assignments, expectations, and plans.",
    "This is a great class and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I really learned a lot and was exposed to something really different.",
    "I'd recommend if you need a very easy QR.",
    "Definitely take it. Fun and quick reading and light workload. A must if your schedule is otherwise packed.",
    "yes, take this class before they discontinue it. probably the easiest qr\/ class in general in all of yale. only don't take it if you have moral qualms about taking a serious gut.",
    "This class is a painless way to get a QR credit. Strengths: for someone who really hates math, it's a low-stress way to fulfill a distribution req. Weaknesses: I didn't feel invested at all in the class, and I don't really feel like I learned anything. Basically, if you're terrible at math and hate it, this is the QR class for you (and I'm grateful that such classes exist), but expect it also to feel like you're somewhat wasting a Yale credit.",
    "I would strongly recommend AMTH 160 to a fellow student as a supplement to other math courses, stats courses, or social science courses. I found myself using some of the material in other classes during the semester. It makes a fantastic 5th class.",
    "Great class. Take it.",
    "Yes take it. I mean it is pretty challenging so there is that difficulty but with work it is a very rewarding experience.",
    "this class is a gem. a must take for all Yale students who are not on track to getting 36 credits.",
    "Interesting subject and not very much work!",
    "Yes. Just take it. If you're even slight considering taking it, just take it.",
    "Great class - absolutely take it if you are INTERESTED in the topic.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It was very interesting and allowed me to see math from a different perspective.",
    "Super easy\/chill class, and pretty interesting, definitely take it!!",
    "Good class. Very interesting QR for students that aren't math majors. I highly recommend it as a fun QR course that isn't too difficult for non-math majors.",
    "Interesting topic",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Excellent class. 8 Homework Assignments - each about 2 or 3 questions, and they're all due at the end of the semester. A midterm after HW 5, consisting of about 6 or 7 questions, basically just taken from the HWs with numbers changed. No final exam, but there is a final project, which is more work than the homework. This has a reputation as a gut, and indeed it is - the best one out there. If you need a QR credit or an extra A, you can't pass this one up.",
    "You must take this course. Amazingly applicable material.",
    "Haha",
    "I would definitely recommend it",
    "Its a good class for people with no interest for math. Take as a 5th or 6th class.",
    "Easiest class I have ever taken",
    "A gut.",
    "Total gut. Very easy, very little work, but you're not going to learn very much so it's honestly probably not worth it.",
    "Take it if you want an easy A and don't want to have to go to lecture.",
    "Guttiest gut of all time. If you are looking for a guaranteed A with no more than 5 hours of cumulative work over the semester, I would recommend. If you are looking to learn anything, I would not.",
    "Engaging material",
    "Not real.",
    "Great class about networks! Easy class, but learn the material for your own benefit because it is super useful.",
    "Yes",
    "Interesting but not a gut class!",
    "This class is very fun and interesting. Although the course load is not dominating, the homework does take a while. I recommend this class to every student at Yale.",
    "There is no way this class will be offered the same way again; the workload was definitely not worthy of a Yale credit.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class, the material is actually interesting and if you do all the assignments you will get a good grade",
    "You know what this is. Take it if you want. Feel the slight erosion of your self respect. Revel in it.",
    "If you want an easy QR credit, this is the class to take. Extremely light workload. Could have been more interesting if everyone had taken it more seriously. But if you're expecting to learn something out of a fun class, this isn't it.",
    "Great class to learn and have fun.",
    "Huge class, many people took it because the word spread that it was a gut. Essentially you don't need to ever show up to class and there are no mechanisms to make you attend--all in all it's not exactly what you should be doing with your education...",
    "Cool and interesting class, I would recommend it.",
    "Take this class! A great way to learn about the power of networks and how they can help to model various groups and provide information about the groups.",
    "Easiest class at Yale. No tests, homework online, one group project. Very easy.",
    "Don't take it",
    "Take this class! I really enjoyed it, and I am strong in math. The information is relevant and useful. Weekly p-set, midterm, and final project. As long as you stay on top of your assignments you should be fine.",
    "AMTH 160 aka Structure of Networks aka \"If you were trying to design a gut you'd come up with a course harder than this one\" is hilarious and a complete joke. Sorry guys, but I don't see any way that this class will be offered in this ridiculous state for next year. Is there a reason that we have stupidly easy QRs but no equivalent WRs? I signed up for this class on the last day of shopping period never having gone to it. I left Yale yesterday and still have never been. In fact, I'm not even sure where lecture was. Go to class on the first day and see what the grading policy is like. If they still have electronic homework submission w\/ infinite retries + slides posted online, TAKE IT. I probably spent around 5 hours thinking about this class during the whole semester, most of that on the final project (which you don't have to present, just record your voice with a slideshow).",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "Easy QR class. Take it if you can.",
    "I was a big fan of the Structure of Networks. You go in, it's Applied Math, it's STEM, maybe you are a little intimidated. And the material, if you look through the PowerPoints, is actually quite challenging. But you are surrounded by helpful TFs and an ebullient professor and they make it all work. The PSets don't overdo it, they make sure you understand the nuts and bolts, and then you go on to the next challenge. Another good thing is that if you ever can't make the lectures you can watch the videos online. Loved the class, would take it again. It was also great to be in the class because it gave me something in common with about 10% of my classmates: a love of networks!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, and even take it again if I could!! This is a very interesting and challenging, yet extremely manageable class, and it is one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale.",
    "Very easy, minimal work and good grades",
    "Class was good. Easy to do well in. Stress free.",
    "A stimulating class that does not involve a huge workload.",
    "I would say take it.",
    "It's an easy class, but it's also actually pretty interesting. Coifman is good and his lectures are actually good. Most kids don't go, but I'd say it was worth it. Take it or at least shop it to see if the material will be interesting to you. The workload is very light.",
    "joke",
    "AMTH 160 was a very interesting course and one that explored topics outside of typical Yale courses. It had a pretty easy workload and was very manageable overall. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. It was a great applied math class that teaches about the networks that are present in every day life and what we can learn about these networks. It also teaches useful applied math concepts.",
    "This class did not require as much work as other Yale classes that I've taken. That being said, I feel that I got less out of it. Still, if your other classes are very demanding, taking this class is a good way to make your schedule less stressful. A large portion of our grade was the group project, and, as is frequently a problem with group projects, a few students ended up doing the majority of the work.",
    "If you need a fifth or sixth credit, take this. It's incredibly easy-going (see: all other evaluations, I assume) and you'll still learn a thing or two.",
    "You will do pretty much no work in this class, but you will also learn nothing.",
    "Great filler course",
    "Definitely. Take it.",
    "A must take class. Easy workload and everyone took it this year.",
    "Definitely take it! It was fun and pretty easy to follow.",
    "If you want an easy (REALLY easy) gut, then take this course. Weekly \"problem sets\" are about 2 problems submitted online with instant feedback so that you can redo the problems as many times as you want in order to get the questions correct. If you're looking to find an interesting class that teaches you a lot, then don't take this class. But if you want an easy A, then go for it.",
    "Weekly problem set, no final, take-home midterm",
    "this course is actually one of the more useful math courses you will take. it's not meant to be hard so actually do your work and the project and it can be a somewhat pleasant, low stress experience.",
    "Yes very easy.",
    "The Structure of Networks is an unremarkable course. Professor Coifman is a professor.",
    "TAKE IT. Especially as a fifth credit senior year.",
    "If you are trying to get a QR credit that is really easy, yes. If you want to learn something, no.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who is having a hard time filling a QR requirement.",
    "Legendary. I hope this review gets to future generations without the class getting cancelled, but take it if you can.",
    "Sure thing.",
    "Simple enough as long as you keep up with the work, which isn't very difficult at all.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Extremely easy class. I prolly got a 100 in the class with minimal work until the final project. Homework and midterm could be resubmitted as many times as you needed until you got an 100 on the assignment. Class honestly only required high school level knowledge of math.",
    "One of the most hassle-free QR courses ever. You still have to work for your grade, though, but at least you don't have to stress about memorizing for a final exam.",
    "Absolutely - take this class if you are a humanities major looking for a good QR.",
    "Must take, if you want to learn about networks.",
    "This is not a real class",
    "Extremely interesting",
    "G U T the subject matter is actually pretty interesting, but that isn't important when you're busy doing all your classes you actually care about.",
    "Good class. Attendance is optional",
    "This class was absurdly laid-back. Take it if you legitimately find networks interesting, in which case you may actually learn quite a bit. If you haven't a single care about the material, you will find yourself simply not going to class. It would be a waste. Don't take that path.",
    "Take it for the QR, don't take it if you want to learn something.",
    "A great class and recommended for people who need a QR credit.",
    "Online problem sets and a take home midterm, along with a final group project. Definitely not a lot of work. Good to take as a gut.",
    "Basic applied math course. The math was very easy -- nothing more advanced than 10th grade algebra.",
    "It's a pretty straightforward probability class. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good grade for minimal effort."
