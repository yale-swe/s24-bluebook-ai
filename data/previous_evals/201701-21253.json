    "I learnt to think outside the box when it comes to web design. Having freelanced and been a commercial designer it was a refreshing take on how to use the web in various different ways and to think of it as a medium of ART rather than pure information transfer.",
    "Learned basic HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. Learned a lot about interactive art, was exposed to a lot of great web and digital art, learned ways to talk about it.",
    "I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and theory on interactive design.",
    "I learned basic CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to create and design websites."

   "comments": [
    "Course was strong in presenting interesting and challenging problems to solve. It was weak (in my opinion) in really focusing in class on how boundaries could be pushed. We really ended up just looking at a bunch of ugly websites instead of discussing ideas. Also people in the class were just not engaged and not really fun.",
    "As an undergrad taking this class I found the workload a little intense- students are expected to put a lot of creative energy and time into their projects.",
    "This course was amazing. Laurel did a great job making it engaging and taught us a lot of useful skills.",
    "Very good course, but a lot of work is expected to be done outside of class. The same is expected for learning and perfecting the coding aspect of the class."

    "Absolutely",
    "Art 369 was an interesting course that I would recommend to people who are interested in the web as a medium of expression in addition to pure information.",
    "Yes!! If you get into it, take it. One of the most useful classes in my undergrad career so far. A fun way to be introduced to coding!",
    "I highly recommend this course. You learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and the background of interactive design. It's an incredibly interesting class and you learn very valuable skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend to anyone in the graphic design concentration, or in computer science, but who want to learn from experience rather than textbooks."
