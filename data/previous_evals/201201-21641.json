    "Yes. But Barry is a harsh grader.",
    "This class entailed reading a series of books set in London. Aside from that, the books seemed to have little to do with each other. That said, almost all of the books Prof McCrea selected were interesting and worth reading. I would recommend the class for the good books and the great professor, but don't necessarily expect to take away something greater about the idea of London in literature.",
    "London and the Literary Imagination took a look at novels spanning from the time of Charles Dickens to modern 21st century novels and analysed how the location of London and its suburbs functioned in the overall playing out of the plot. At first, it felt odd that I was reading \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Peter Pan\" for a Yale course, and in many instances I felt like we were pushing for themes that weren't really there. But especially being in London while taking these courses, I felt like some of the themes we hit on about the big city were pertinent and observable in my everyday life.",
    "With a revised syllabus, yes.",
    "You read lots of books set in London. It did not seem like a strong link between all the books though--in some, London loomed large in the story, but in others it was very far in the background. The fact of the setting just wasn't a strong enough link. One book wasn't even set in London (the professor hadn't read it before assigning it).Reading load wasn't too bad at one novel a week. Due to the nature of the YiL program, though, sometimes the schedule was such that we needed to read two a week, so it became excessive.",
    "London in the Literary Imagination was a bit of a scattered course. Some interesting texts, some not so interesting. If you're interested in the books on the syllabus, then I would recommend it. However, if you're more interested in the theme of the course than the texts themselves, I would not recommend it because the books were often only tangentially related to the theme.",
    "Yah, take the class, second half of it has some really good novels"
