    "Directed Studies Philosophy is certainly the strangest course in Directed Studies. It can be best described as the art of breaking down arguments, examining their validity and soundness. No doctrine, however crystal clear it may seem on paper, goes uncontested. The course is designed to challenge students' conceptions of the universe, and it certainly does that. The course material, however, is rather tedious to read. The ancient philosophers cared much more about ideas than good writing; thus, their texts often repeat themselves unnecessarily or are excessively wordy. Sentences can grow to absurd lengths, causing readers to lose track of the argument. One needs to read each text very closely, if not multiple times, in order to extract the full meaning. Papers are also very different, focusing purely on the clarity of the argument, rather than on literary value. One should approach this course with a different frame of mind than the other two. However, if one wants to think about the world in a decidedly different way, Directed Studies Philosophy is an excellent choice, especially if one is considering taking other courses related to these texts.",
    "DS Philosophy is pretty rough if you don't have any prior philosophy background, but the professors do a good job of easing you into how to write a proper philosophy paper. Whittle can be frustrating at times in section, he'll respond to almost any point anyone brings up by restating it incorrectly and then jumping off that to give a long explanation, but he's a generous grader and gives very helpful and enthusiastic feedback on papers.",
    "DS Philosophy does what it's supposed to do: it introduces you to Western philosophical thought. One occasionally wishes that it were more tightly integrated with the other classes, but it is rewarding nonetheless. Lots of time on Plato and Aristotle, which can be frustrating, but it provides a firm foundation.I think Bruno's section is very dependent on the students in it. Bruno is brilliant and engages well with the students' criticisms of the texts, but he is also very lenient when moderating discussion (if you have \"one of thosekids\" in your section, this can be an issue). If you don't put much effort into the class, discussions will be mediocre-- Bruno's class can be great, it can be subpar, and it mostly depends on the students.",
    "Philosophy is definitely the hardest of the fall DS courses, especially for someone like me who never did any philosophy in high school. Professor Whittle is great at helping you write your (possibly) first philosophy papers, and he always gave helpful comments and advice in terms of the paper. He was a generous grader and really cared about the class. He basically runs the class by having us offer explanations of the texts and then trying to explain it to us by drawing things out (we drew a lot in class) on the board. At times, this helped a lot to understand the texts, but there were many classes that left me very confused, especially when Professor Whittle didn't make it clear whether someone was right in their interpretation of the text. It was only after studying for a final that I began to get a complete sense of which author said what, so I'd definitely recommend not taking the easy way out and skimming the philosophy reading when avoidable.",
    "DS Philosophy is a sold survey of early philosophical thought. Whittle is a nice guy and makes section an enjoyable attempt to understand some of the confusing parts of the reading. He seemed slightly unwilling to correct students' misconceptions, however, so sometimes we didn't make as much progress towards clarity as we could have. I only understood several of the crucial points when I started studying for the final exam, and I think I might have done pretty poorly if I relied only upon what we'd figured out in section.",
    "Most DS students cite Philosophy as the most difficult course, simply due to the fact that philosophical analysis is so different than anything one might have done in high school. Professor Whittle greatly reduced many of those obstacles. His explanation of complex concepts was clear and often included helpful (and funny!) diagrams, and yet he always pushed us to wrestle with the arguments ourselves instead of simply taking his elucidations for granted. His comments on papers were extremely thorough and fair, always giving directions that one could take to improve on the next assignment. Yes, discussions sometimes became overly technical or diverged from the text, but in a course concerning these thinkers, isn't that to be expected? Professor Whittle ran a tight ship."
