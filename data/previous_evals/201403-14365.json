    "The Classics Departments' expertise in Roman satire is one of the reasons I came to study at Yale, and this was an extremely helpful course. We got a very in-depth overview of not only Horace's Satires, but also his Epistles. Discussion in class was very lively and encouraged me to sharpen my arguments further and further.",
