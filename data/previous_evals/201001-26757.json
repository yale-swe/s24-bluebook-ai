    "Yes. Fits in great with BP.",
    "It would be great if this course happened earlier, so that our design can take inspiration from our knowledge of materials and viable construction techniques.",
    "Yes. But it could have replaced Adam's lectures and Site and Climate, so we learn the material before BP design competition begins.",
    "this class was one of the best of the semester.",
    "I think it occurs in the proper sequence.",
    "This course occurred in proper sequense, and could perhaps even be offered in the first semester.",
    "If this course could somehow be part of the BP seminar, it would make more sense than as a freestanding half-semester course.",
    "Yes.",
    "This was probably my favorite course this year. Alan did an excellent job combininghistory, theory, and building technology into a cohesive and digestible lecture sequence. Fantastic class! Alan needs to teach this course again and it should perhaps last the entire semester, thereby replacing \"site + climate.\""

   "comments": [
    "The material covered in the class was really interesting and presented extremely well.",
    "Excellent. The lectures were fascinating and well done. The assignments were few (1), engaging, and rewarded by a well attended and insightful review.",
    "Alan's Building Technology is one of the best classes I've ever taken so far at Yale. Everybody walked out of his lectures completely mesmerized by his amazingly informative and visually compelling presentations. Alan isn't only an expert in this subject, he is also a great instructor who is capable of keeping his knowledge up-to-date and interesting to all of our students. We learn so much from just sitting back, looking at the exquisitely put-together slide shows and listening to him talk. We are absolutely in love with this class and would take it again.",
    "Good sequencing of material. Format of presentation was highly effective (case studies, several key precedents that came up in multiple lectures, lots of great visuals in the powerpoints). Material is fascinating and extremely useful. The one drawdel assignment at the end of the semester could be reconceived as a series of smaller assignments.",
    "the assignment was interesting, although it could have been more focused. the recommended scale was not actually large enough to deal with the questions that were expected to be answered.",
    "Alan is a very masterful teacher. My only lament is that there are not more Alans to go around.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures quite a bit and also got a lot out of them. I also thought that final assignment was the right amount of work.",
    "The information presented was very valuable, and helped us undertand the mechanics of the building envelope. This course goes hand-in-hand with the building project course, and could even be offered instead of building project or as part of that Monday-Tuesday sequence.",
    "I appreciated having just one assignment over the course of the half-semester, because Alan correctly anticipated that we would not have time to do busywork assignments during BP. Unfortunately, because of the busyness of the semester, the final project essentially got squeezed into the final night of the semester after 4 other final projects for other classes were due, because there really was no other time to devote to it.",
    "This class was fascinating and fit into the semester's sequence very well. I wish we'd had more of it!",
    "This was an excellent class that was not long enough. Alan's lectures were engaging and extremely well-presented. Even though I have taken classes on the same subject matter in the past, Alan brought a fresh and personal perspective to the topic of building technology that I really appreciated.",
    "The course was extremely well organized, visually very stimulating and engaging."

    "Had no expectations.",

    "There were no substantial expectations for this course. Seemingly, it was designed to repeat a lot of the information which we gained in the building project. However, Alan managed to make this course interesting, informative, and engaging for all of us. Any fuutre class would benefit from having more of this course, to allow the material to be discussed in greated detail.",

    "This class really helped me understand material logics and assembly techniques. This course really opened my eyes to the possibilities inherent in fabrication and assembly techniques.",
    "The lectures opened my eyes to a new level of complexity and new scale of design in architecture. I learned a lot that I didn't know about materials and where they come from. I appreciated also learning about the impact these materials have on the earth either via extraction or application.",
    "Please refer to question 4.",
    "it was great.",
    "The final project I did for this class was one of my favorite things I've done all semester. Thats depressing for me but speaks volumes to Alan's ability to excite.",
    "I thought it was great to gain some real, practical information about how to actually detail a building in an effective way.",
    "The course was very broad for half a semester. I don't know if what was taught really sunk in. In the final review, the visiting critics kept asking about where the water barriers were in the building and that kind of thing, but we didn't really cover that kind of information in the class. Neither this course nor the BP seminar really gave a straightforward explanation of typical building methods, and this class focused on exceptional design instead, so I still don't really know how to put a wall section together.",
    "I found this course to be very valuable, especially while working simultaneously on the building project."

    "Alan is an amazing professor. Lecturing is an art form that Alan has mastered. He knows his stuff and can prove it. Having Alan explain his work and telling us the ups and downs he went through was so gratifying. One of the only times that I have experienced a \"buzz\" around studio about a course. People have been talking about how much they love the class. Oh and Alan makes the class fun. He is funny and interesting and makes a 2 hour lecture fly by. I was upset when class was over. I wanted to sit there and have Alan tell us more.",
    "Very good.",
    "Please refer to question 4.",
    "Alan is extremely articulate, intelligent, well-prepared, and generous with his time. It was a pleasure!",
    "I thought the instructor was incredibly effective. All of the lectures were very clear and interesting.",
    "Alan is great! Learning from him was was a pleasure.",
    "Alan was a great instructor. He was enthusiastic, readily available, and extremely knowledgable. He was a very effective lecturer.",
    "As I mentioned previously, the information was extremely well organized and visually very stimulating, which I think was very effective in terms of conveying the information to the students.",
    "alan is great, wish we had this for a full semester."

    "Keep Alan as the professor.",
    "Turn it into a semester long lecture series in place of Urban Design, with even more real life case studies.",
    "This is my favorite class this semester! I learned so much from just sitting in class. I was very much inspired by all the images and projects you showed in class. Your class makes me know architecture is right for me. I wish more classes at Yale is like this. I wish this class can be expanded into a semester-long course. Field trips would make the class experience even more exciting! I look forward to them this summer!",
    "The course was enjoyable, but I don't see the need for the end of semester assignment. It would have been just as meaningful to have enjoyable lectures that didn't add on to our workload.",
    "The final assignment would benefit from having \"scale\" as one of the specific requirements, say 1\" = 1'-0\" or larger. In addition, if we were given examples of previous student work, or other forms of demonstration, we would have saved a lot of trouble by making a model that does not serve the purpose of the exercise.",
    "Lectures are great; out-of-class work could be redesigned so that the one drawdel assignment can become several smaller assignments that are more specific and focused.",
    "combine this class with adam's BP lectures to allow for a more streamlined approach to building technology issues.",
    "I think the course could possibly be combined with the first half of BP as much of the same type of information was covered there, just in different ways.",
    "I think it would make sense to have this course be more about building details, and have the semester assignment be about understanding a particular detail of limited scope, as long as the buildings assigned are all extremely well-documented and the documents are available in our library.",
    "This course presented similar material to the building project class, but in a much more engaging way. Because of this overlap, it felt like there was one too many courses in the semester schedule. This course could easily have been a full semester course.",
    "Perhaps the assignments could be more integrated with the studio \/ building project assignments."
