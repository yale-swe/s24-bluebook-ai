    "i specifically appreciated the practical.",
    "The practical hydraulics project was incredibly helpful in learning about hydraulic systems. That was the highlight of the course. As discussed in class following the completion of the project, It would have been nice if the components were already laid out in front of us. While it valuable to dig through trays of hydraulic fittings, I feel as if the specification of components on paper would be more than sufficient for our understand of fittings. The physical assembly of the components could be more straight forward and laid out in front of us."

Having taken the class, it has added to my understanding of hydraulic systems and the variety of hydraulic systems that exist beyond that of YRT."
