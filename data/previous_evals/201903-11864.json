    "I gained a significant amount of knowledge in the spanish language and grammar, which makes me feel like a much more confident spanish speaker.",
    "My grasp of Spanish grammar grew immensely in this class. I placed into L5 via the AP Spanish exam so I was a little nervous to jump right into a literature course, so this class was perfect. Definitely strengthened and added variety my writing as well as understanding when reading.",
    "We learned very specific, but useful, grammar topics.",
    "I reviewed concepts in Spanish grammar and studied others I had never formally studied before and expanded my vocabulary\/comprehension skills.",
    "por vs. para, ordering of adjectives, ser vs. estar, subjunctive",
    "My grammar and vocabulary improved from this course.",
    "My reading and writing in Spanish improved drastically because of this course. I learned so much new vocabulary and became more comfortable with grammar and structure.",
    "I greatly improved my ability to read, write and speak in Spanish and gained a better understanding of complex grammar concepts. I also learned about a few important authors who have written in the Spanish language, especially short story writers, and was introduced to a few important Spanish language films."

   "comments": [
    "Strength- you will learn a lot of grammar, Professor Asensio is amazing, so much fun, and keeps the class engaging. You will feel your Spanish significantly improving because of this class. Weakness- lot of busy work\/spanish grammar exercises. textbook is not good.",
    "Strengths: Wonderful professor, tons of feedback, great class size, I liked the conversation partners Weaknesses: The textbook doesn't always do the best at explaining (professor makes up for it though)",
    "The strengths of this course are that it provides useful \"finishing touches\" on gramatical proficiency for students who already know lots of Spanish and are fairly fluent. The instructor was wonderful and the topics are usually interesting. The course is also facilitated in a good way. The weakness, though, is that it doesn't do much for conversational fluency and is excessively time consuming and difficult.",
    "The course is well structured overall to improve your Spanish. It could benefit from a bit less \"busy work\" and maybe by switching out some of texts we read in class, but is a good course overall.",
    "strengths: size of course (14 students in my section), professor, pacing",
    "I wish we practiced speaking in Spanish a little more; however, this may have just been a characteristic of my class, which seemed especially quiet. The amount of homework was reasonable, and it provided good practice.",
    "This course was structured really well and enough time was spent on each subject. I think the textbook was very very useful. Also, I really liked how the assigned readings were not only good practice, but also informative about real world topics. Overall, this course was great and the only weakness is that it was focused on reading and writing rather than speaking. There were still opportunities to speak, but my written Spanish definitely improved more than my spoken Spanish.",
    "One strength of this course is the variety of exercises and mediums with which the material was taught and practiced. I felt that I was engaging with the lessons in a multidimensional way, which both made the class more enjoyable and helped me learn better. The professor's methods in class were very effective, and she did an excellent job of pacing the students and explaining difficult concepts without having to revert to English or simplified Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "Yes- but beware, the grading is insanely harsh. For instance 93.9 is an A-, 94.0 is an A. Seems unfair. But other than the grading, it's a great and fun class.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. Your writing will improve greatly and you will start to truly understand word and sentence construction and why you say things the way you say them.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who is not prepared to put countless hours into studying the material and preparing the assignments. I read these course reviews in August and told myself I could do it. I was wrong. I'm serious- if you're about to take this class, think twice about how much time you're actually prepared to put into it. It is a lot of work. And you have to do all of it. And the grading is harsh and strict. This is a class for serious Spanish learners only.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. I would recommend it to a student who wants to refine their Spanish skills and take their language ability to a higher level. I would also recommend to a student who wants to fulfill the Spanish certificate requirements.",
    "absolutely. i feel like this course gets a bad rap bc it's a lot of work but it's so worth it. it's a GREAT Cr\/D bc you get to brush up on your spanish without needing to worry about doing every homework assignment",
    "Yes! This was my favorite class and I think anyone serious about Spanish should take it. It was informative and a good overview of so many different aspects of grammar. Having taken this class, I feel like I would be more comfortable traveling to a Spanish speaking country.",
    "No, lots of work for very little reward",
    "Yes, this course is great for any student who has reached the L5 level and wants an overview of Spanish grammar before taking more advanced classes that assume a certain level of fluency in order to engage with complex concepts and works."
