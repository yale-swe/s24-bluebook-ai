    "The coursework was really helpful in understanding from the ground up genomics, technology, and current research. The TA was also really helpful in answering questions r\/g the homework assignments and putting the lectures to paper.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was very thorough and I felt I learned a great deal about genetics as it relates to public health work.",
    "Very useful, informative and could be the best course I've ever taken in the YSPH. I thought this course would be more like introduction to biology, however, to my surprise, it was far beyond that scale with much more focus on the studies in Epidemiology and public health. Also the context of the course was extremely important and practical for my current research.",
    "The professor is a great lecturer, I really enjoyed all the lectures. I like the fact that the slides do not contain a lot words. They were used only to illustrate the points raised by the professor, and sometimes show calculations. This forced me to concentrate during the lectures, which is a more efficient way to learn compared with reading slides after class."

    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0He is so personable and approachable with any question- no matter how elementary you may think it could be. Andy is a wealth of knowledge and has much experience from which he can share. He is an excellent teacher!",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan was very approachable and his slides were extremely informative. At times, lecture felt a little fast- it would be nice to have a break halfway through the lecture.",

He spent so much time helping all students to get through the assignments and really cared to make sure we understand the content- not just getting the \"right answer\". He responded so quickly to emails and was very thorough in his explanations. His help really made the course!",

    "This is a really great course which covers everything from basic genetics to current technologies. There is a fair bit of computational work required but this helps to build upon understanding the basis of genetics and is not solely focused on learning a software program- as so many genetic courses could be. It is a wonderful course and one I would recommend to all students.",
    "I would recommend this course. The lectures were very interesting and helped me gain a stronger understanding of genetics.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to the students who really want to know the molecular epidemiology or genetics in public health"
