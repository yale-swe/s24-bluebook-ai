    "In this course I learned how to write a paper through \"close reading,\" something I had never done before. I also wrote a research paper and a movie review.",
    "I learned a lot about structuring and breaking down writing for different styles of writin and different writing goals.",
    "The course provided an introduction into academic, college level writing including identifying a problem, forming a strong claim, and providing readers with a motive to consider the writer's point of view. I became stronger as a writer stylistically by improving my sentence structure and learning to choose more neutral qualifiers. I was also able to develop as a critical thinker."

   "comments": [
    "The professor did a great job in engaging the classroom with fun and exciting material that helped us not only to learn the material better, but also to keep us interested in returning to each and every class prepared for discussions. This class could have been improved if we had set workshop only classes in order to solidify the new grammar and writing techniques that we get taught.",
    "I really enjoyed being able to choose the theme of this course. It allowed me to write papers about a topic I was interested in.",
    "This class is engaging but the broad theme of the course allows for much interpretation in terms of what to study concretely. This resulted in readings and writing essays about subjects that were either very engaging or not at all based on your own interests.",
    "The course was engaging both in terms of the topic itself and the in-class discussions that resulted. Because there were few students, most felt comfortable contributing and the environment allowed for interesting conversation that went further than the text at times. Overall, classes were quite focused, and the instructor seemed to have a clear goal in mind. An area for improvement is making sure that the prompts for the first couple of papers especially, are clear, since many incoming students are not accustomed to the level of expectation. Also, at least with a class as small as this one, peer reviews were not as constructive becasue students were certainly afraid to offend others and were hesitant to provide much criticism."

   "comments": [
    "If a student coming to Yale feels like their writing needs a boost, or doesn't feel comfortable writing a collegiate paper, this is the course they should take.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course to any student unsure of how to write on the college level. If they already have experience writing in this way, it is probably not worth taking, since there are many drafts aside from the papers themselves, that may constitute unnecessary work for these students."
