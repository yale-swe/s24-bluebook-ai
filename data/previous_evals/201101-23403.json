    "I feel this course would benefit greatly from being split into two parts. One day a week for lecture on the statistical theory behind each section, and the second day strictly used for practicing the use of the R program.",
    "1. Gregoire too unspecific \u0093I look at this and I think\u0085\u0094 instead I look at A and it tells me B2. there should be more systematic way to teach the course",
    "Overall the course itself is about information that is useful to know. I've taken a few different statistics class and seeing as I don't personally have a huge interest in statistics, I've always found these classes to be a bit dry. This one was no exception, but the bottom line is that all the materials and R code are available for you to go over and learn at whatever pace you choose throughout the semester.",
    "This is an excellent class, and will deepen your understanding of both statistical mathematics and practice. Its biggest weakness in the year I took it was its comparatively slow start. I would suggest that students be gotten up to speed in R with independent programming-focused work {labs and\/or a first assignment, perhaps using concepts from previous statistics classes which they are likely familiar with}. Class time could then be spent on analysis rather than stepping through code.This approach, if it worked, would let the true strengths of the class--Professor Gregoire's experience with and insight into the subject--shine through.The R code could also be cleaner in some cases."

    "A constantly present TA would have been useful",
    "I believe a TA on campus would be helpful in this course. Additional either lab or special sessions to work through R syntax would be helpful- escpcially for people who have had no computer programming experience. It would also be good to have a special session or lesson on reading results of R and the wording used to describe the fit of a model.",
    "The TA must be in New Haven because R is complicated program that need constant help even though TA had very good disposition to help.",
    "textbook is horrible",
    "While I appreciated the fact that the assignments did not take so much time that I felt my time was wasted, I think that more frequent assignments that dealt specifically with the topics we were studying in a given week would have solidified my understanding of the topics as they came up, rather than rushing to understand them at the end. A little bit more of a defined course map at the beginning would have been helpful as well."
