    "If you have to take Spanish L3, take it with Sebastian. He's an absolute boss. Funny, easy to talk to, accessible, always smiling, spits out wisdom from time to time. Made the material bearable and even enjoyable. I can honestly say I looked forward to class every day. Homework is frustrating because it's graded on correctness, not completion; you can spend an hour on a worksheet and still get slammed with a 75. Homework should be a learning experience, not a punitive one, especially when it's being handed in every day. However, all in all, take the course. While it's mostly review, I feel like I have a much better handle on the material than before. My oral and writing skills have improved immensely. Vocabulary quizzes were incredibly unfair, but oh well, it's a shared experience.",
    "My Spanish definitely improved. Nightly homework and constant assignments could be annoying during busier parts of the semester. Highly recommend Sebastian Diaz.",
    "yes definitely... and definitely with sebastian he's incredible",
    "Spanish 130 is an intermediate class. The first half of the semester is a review of L1 and L2 before you move into some new stuff at the end. Get your stuff together early though because you don't want to have to fight back to get a good grade. Sebastian is the man. He doesn't speak any English, but that doesn't really matter. He's always there to help you, and it's fun when you see him around campus.",
    "I don't know, the department is terrible. If you want to start a new language maybe you should. I had an amazing professor, but even so I started to feel somewhat defeated by the end of this class. I love to speak spanish, but this course does not have a large enough focus on conversing in spanish, and it's easy to get bogged down in the grammar. I'm hoping L4 or L5 will be better.",
    "Ehhh...the Spanish department at Yale seems to operate on the assumption that it already has many students and doesn't need more. It makes the courses arbitrary and nitpicky in terms of grading in ways that really don't help you (-4 for a misspelled word), the textbook is terrible, and teachers vary a lot. You might have to take it or really want to learn Spanish but if it's a cursory interest, I'd avoid the class.That said, if you do take it, you get a nice review of Spanish and your speaking and writing skills really start to improve. Sebastian is a very nice guy, very personable and very funny and he tries hard to help students. He sometimes isn't the best at at explaining grammar concepts though, most likely due to his being a native speaker. Still an awesome guy though, and I'd take the class with him again if I had the choice.",
    "Be ready to work, but you'll definitely learn Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it if you have to take it for requirements. If you have a choice I wouldn't.",
    "An intermediate Spanish course, so it meets every day and has daily homework. Sebasti\u00e1n is a great teacher who encourages speaking in class and is always helpful and reachable by e-mail or in his office when needed. There are more tests and quizzes than most other classes, but if you are interested in improving your Spanish through lots of daily practice (or are fulfilling your language requirement), take it!"
