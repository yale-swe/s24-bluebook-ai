    "French 150 is a level 5 French class that requires doing a good amount of homework (such as orals and redactions), but helps one improve their French. The movies and books that one reads are all enjoyable and I was very happy to have taken this class. French 150 02 is a good balance between grammar and literature\/cinema teachings.",
    "French 150-yes. French 150-02 with Schneider, only for the best french students. Those in the middle of the pack won't do well.",
    "yes",
    "YES. Take it.",
    "Take it. It's a good way to solidify years of grammar and oral skills. It's also good because we learn more sophisticated grammar that isn't present in our AP French Language\/Literature grammar books.You will only get anything out of the class if you do the homework and readings. It's for your benefit not for the professor's.",
    "I would summarize French 150 as a great fundamental course in French. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it. The class consisted of a helpful and comprehensive review of certain points of French grammar and also featured readings by Ionesco and Maupassant, for example, and good films. Assessments included tests every other week, short essays, and two oral exams. Although the reading was interesting and the grammar review was helpful, I can see how the class might get slightly tedious without a dynamic professor at the chalkboard. Madame Schneider was just that. She always brought such a contagious energy and enthusiasm to the room. She was invested in our improvement, which was great, but it also meant that she would make sure we did our homework and comment if we did not. Having said this, she was also very understanding. I felt my speaking and writing skills vastly improve under her guidance over the course of the term. Take Schneider if you take this course.",
    "If you want to continue your French to fluency at Yale, I highly recommend 150 as your starting point."
