    "It's Old English from the ground up--grammar, pronunciation, and all. You begin with pronunciation, move to translating prose, and then to translating poetry. There are translation homeworks for each class, a presentation during the semester, and two exams (midterm and final). It's a great class and I would recommend it highly.",
    "An introduction to Old English that focuses on grammar for the first month and literature for the remainder of the semester.I would certainly recommend the course, but not to someone who didn't inherently like languages: part of the delight in studying Old English is learning about modern English through it."
