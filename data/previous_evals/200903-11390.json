   "comments": [
    "Be prepared to spend ten hours on a lot of the lab reports.",
    "This is a lab where you learn some basic Biology research techniques. There are lab reports due most weeks, that are pretty tedious but very straightforward.",
    "If you've taken other lab courses, this lab will be the easiest but most inane lab class you'll run into at Yale. The material isn't hard but there are quizzes and labs due every week. The class is made bearable by a good section group and an awesome TA.Really, you just need to realize that reading the lab manual before hand helps out, and typing up your lab report as soon as possible helps you avoid having to do both the quiz and the lab the night before. Labs, while numerous, are not that bad. Just remember that if its annoying for you to write a long lab report, imagine the TA who has to grade it. Conclusion: short lab reports are good for everyone.Another good thing is that the lab rarely goes on until 5:30...except the one day we left sometime after 6. I forget why that was.",
    "I definitely recommend this lab for anyone who wants to figure out whether or not they are really interested in biology. If you are, then you will love the topics covered by the lab and will be stimulated and interested the whole way through. If you aren't, then this is a good way to get that figured out and move on to another topic.",
    "Recommended. It has a bad rap for its pre-lab quizzes and extensively long lab reports per week, but both are doable. Just put in some time with this class, and you'll be rewarded.",
    "If you need a relatively stress free lab, and are taking MCDB 120, you should definitely take this lab. It wasn't bad at all.",
    "I've taken a lot of chemistry labs (gen. and orgo) and this lab was way better. I was really glad i took it because it was really interesting. We actually performed a fertilization in class and cross bred flies. Really cool stuff. It's not too much work either. The labs take a while but if you get them done ahead of time it's fine. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Some of the lab reports are convoluted and confusing. The labs themselves can take a lot of time to prepare. Make sure to start the labs in advance and go to the TAs for suggestions.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. It's quite a bit of time per week, both in the lab and outside.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students especially if they need it for their major or pre-med requirements. The work was fairly easy and we rarely ever stayed in lab past 4.",
    "This lab like every other one at Yale is pretty intensive. They ask for concise lab reports, but its pretty hard to fit everything they ask for into less than 8 pages. I'd say most of mine were more than that. With that said, you are probably only taking a lab because you are premed and don't really have a choice. My best advice: put your writing credit off for another semester.",
    "Not unless you need some bio labs",
    "This lab is a lot of work with 10-15 page lab reports that will take anywhere from 5 to 15 hours almost every week. That said, it is not exceedingly difficult. You will get to work with a lot of model organisms (Drosophila, C. elegans, Danio rerio, sea urchins, etc.) and learn important techniques (PCR, AGE, assays) so it is definitely a worthwhile class.",
    "It's a great lab. The time goes quickly, you usually get out before the full four hours, and the lab reports aren't too painful to write.",
    "It's a lot of work but if you put the effort in, it will be rewarding. There are lots of basic biology lab techniques that will be learned, but it can be enjoyable if you approach it the right way. Definitely take it if you need a lab credit.",
    "This is a good, solid, basic biology lab. Take it if you need to take one. The lab reports are a bit labor intensive, though for the most part, they're fundamentally straightforward \u0097 getting them done is just a matter of sitting down and typing. Many of the techniques you get to learn and practice are applicable elsewhere, and Prof. Moreno takes good advantage of all Yale's fancy-schmancy technological resources. Some people complain about the length of the class meetings, but the pace of each experiment is pretty leisurely (lots of waiting around for things to incubate, etc.), so I found it more enjoyable than, say, a chem lab course where you're constantly fretting about what the next step is.",
    "It's difficult, it's tough, and you may want to rip your hair out sometimes, but by the end of the semester you're generally used to the extra work and the small sections help create an environment that's fun in spite of the work required for the lab. It helps reinforce some of the material in lecture, and if you decide to take it don't let others discourage you... it's definitely doable if you stick with it, and it's a great feeling at the end of the semester when you realize you're done and the people who dropped out still have to take it.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to - it's a TON of work and not that interesting.",
    "I would take the class because it really gives you the opportunity to learn more about biological laboratory techniques that you will use throughout a career in research.One point of note: your grade can easily come down to your TA. Definitely shop around TAs...if you can (talk to friends, visit other lab sections) and find one that seems chill.The grade comes down to the TA. It's also nice just to have one that actually cares about you learning...so they help you out.",
    "Definitely. Great to take as a Biology lab.",
    "Take the class if you are taking MCDB 120 at the same time, and if you have never had exposure to research. Overall, not a difficult course at all. Just very time-consuming, including time spent in lab, and time spent on lab reports that sometimes did not make much sense to write up (such as with the zebra fish experiment).",
    "If you are not pre-med you should not take this course, because it was way more work than the 1\/2 credit given, but ifyou need to take a biology laboratory course for your major or pre-med (or both), this laboratory course is great introduction for how to write a biology laboratory report. You will also learn all of the biology techniques used today. This class also aided in understanding MCDB 120, the adjoining lecture course.",
    "Basic intro bio lab. It'll be tougher if you're not taking MCDB 120: the lab follows the lecture, and if you place out of 120 (as many people do) you don't have the benefit of having the material fresh in your head.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend it, unless you have not even taken a Biology lab course in high school, or you need this for your major. Otherwise, trust me, you've done everything already. I'd recommend taking a different lab for pre-med requirements. It is too much work for just a half credit.",
    "Bio lab is a lot of work for only half a credit but it's definitely less stressful than chem lab. Having a small section with a friendly TA makes the actual lab time enjoyable but the lab write ups are time consuming.",
    "Good course for teaching you how to write scientifically.",
    "ALWAYS DO THE QUIZZES. Sometimes they are suprisingly difficult even if you are looking at material. It is not that much work compared to other labs (Chem labs especially). The lab final was easy and realllu intersting. This may become a full credit course, in which case definitely take it!!!",
    "I recommend his course to a student who enjoys performing lab experiments and working with others. However, this happened to be one of the most time-consuming courses I took this semester.",
    "Take it at the same time as the lecture. The experiments you do complement the lecture really well, and the lab manuals are sometimes even clearer than the lecture itself.The lab experiments themselves are pretty chill and fun, but the lab reports are extremely long and tedious. Start them early. If you wait til the day before they're due, you'll be up all night.",
    "Get prepared for lots of frustrating lab write ups. They are long, and it is the worst when the experiment goes wrong because then you have to explain why it did. However, I definitely learned tons from this class, and it is definitely a case of you getout what you put in. Thihan is an outstanding TA, was extremely helpful throughout the term, and made lab enjoyable even though the reports were not. The grading is fair (prelab quizzes are usually pretty straightforward). I felt like I actually began to think like a scientist after this lab.",
    "I would reccomend the course it is very interesting, however the workload is pretty heavy.",
    "MCDB 121L is a good survey course of various techniques and model organisms used in a laboratory setting. The weekly labs were generally interesting. Try to get a good TA- this can make or break the class experience- as you'll have little to no contact with the professor. The weekly online quizzes are pretty nice and not nearly as stressful as in-lab quizzes.",
    "MCDB 121L is a basic intro bio lab course. The material is basic but engaging, and it complements the lecture course well. The techniques learned are all useful if you plan to work in a bio lab more later. The labs are sometimes pretty slow, but they're not too difficult. The reports are also long but not too difficult. If you've never worked in bio lab before, or if you need this course as a pre-req, then take it; if you place out of it, take a higher level course.",
    "Take it especially if you take MCDB 120. It complements the class material well.",
    "Take it if you have to, good intro lab that corresponds to the lecture pretty well.",
    "yes. take it. its a good easy lab. lab reports are long and take time though.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interesting in introductory biology or if they are a pre-medical student.",
    "Its a great intro lab to several basic techniques of biology and covers a wide range of subjects."
