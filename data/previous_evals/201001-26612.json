   "comments": [
    "The syllabus is tight. The readings, especially in the thematic sequence in which they are presented, are very compelling.",
    "Keller and the class are amazing. There should be more people like her and more courses like this at the school. The encouragement to think about alternative strategies within architecture may be the only way the profession can continue to survive in the future. Excellent, excellent class.",
    "From the first session I was very excited about the class. The topic closely parallels my personal interest, so I was thrilled to be able to participate. I felt the readings were good but perhaps a bit long. I think everyone would benefit by more concise readings. Additionally, it would be nice to have more current\/pop readings to serve as a good comparison or juxtaposition against the heavy theory pieces.",
    "The sequence and syllabus was fine.",
    "Conceptually, the subject matter seemed interesting and relevant in a contemporary setting. On a weekly basis we struggled with finding an 'active form' or even discovering spatial examples that displayed a certain disposition. What was most frustrating was our inability to discover these active forms and these spatial examples. I feel as though we never really understood what was meant by these terms.",
    "This course covered a lot of material, but the sequence was a little jumpy.",
    "The subject matter of this class is very important thinking material for all architects. It is a rare class that is refreshing and revealing (not just about architecture).",
    "great. Prof Easterling really pushed us to engage and go deeper into our interests. She really cares. A great teacher.",
    "All content presented in the class followed the syllabus. Yet,the readings were non-prescriptive and very open to each student's formulation of ideas and investigations.",
    "The material was interesting and unique, however had a hard time exploring the spatial aspects of the material.",
    "I think the body of material is very well gathered and presented. The difficult task of the studio is to marry extremely contemporary products of the media, the discipline, etc. with a core set of readings which is always evolving."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I expected this course to allow me to think in very different ways without sacrificing my initial impulses and principles. The course certainly met some of my expectations but generally it focused on means and for the most part disregarded the ends. It was less about the endgame and more about the game itself, which I found somewhat cynical.",
    "I greatly enjoyed the course but felt like we never came to the sort of agreement or conclusion I was hoping for. While I realize the subject matter is atypical and not what architects are used to, the course left many of my classmates and I a bit confused about what the big picture theme of the course was. That being said, I really appreciate Easterling teaching something so important to a group of people who are often clueless to the idea of lateral strategies.",
    "I expected to learn how lateral strategies were deployed in a spatial manner. I found the course disappointing in this regards as there were few and far between successful examples of actual architecture.",
    "As I like the professor\u0092s work, my expectations were rather high. I don\u0092t feel that I learned, however, anything further than what she writes about.",
    "I feel that I have learned a set of new vocabulary with which to practice.",
    "Great",
    "I had set myself to work hard from the very beginning, knowing that beyond writing the paper, the discussions were going to be very demanding.After constant attempts to grasp some of the subjects, I finally felt comfortable with most of them and I feel I was able to produce the paper I wanted to. I also believe that my participation in the discussion sessions turned to be more active and constant for the second half of the semester, meeting all requirements to pass the course in a satisfactory way.",
    "I expected more engagement with spatial practices.",
    "The course started a bit rocky, but over time became the vibrant and innovative type of intensive discussion I was looking for in this course. Keller does a great job of re-stating the ambitions of the course and trying to make a vast array of difficult and elusive material digestible for us."

   "comments": [
    "Incredibly valueable, has permanently changed my perception of architecture and its relationship to power systems\/",
    "The course was definitely valuable, but I think some clarification and slight changes could make the course extremely valuable. The link between spatial ideas and the philosophy pieces were ofter blurry (which I sometimes appreciated), but others left me confused. I feel like in general that when Keller lectured or spoke I had a good idea about the direction we were heading, but having other students speak often led to lackluster coverage of certain topics.",
    "I was very excited about this course initially but was disappointed with the outcome. I did not learn nearly as much as I had hoped, but putting together the final project was interesting.",
    "This course definitely had aspects that were valuable to exploring my interests. Activism as a form of achieving architectural form is a fascinating topic, but remains slightly vague in my mind. Professor Easterling has done an incredible amount of work that is fascinating and I think the course would benefit from the incredible structure that is apparent in her work outside of class. She is an interesting person that has so much to offer to this class, and perhaps concrete examples would be of benefit all the students.",
    "The value of this course is high to me.",
    "This is one of those courses which I may not have fully grasped, but will be in the back of my mind for a long time.",
    "Important for personal exploration of defining my own agenda within architecture. a valuable course!",
    "This course will always have great importance to me because of the many strategies and new perspectives I was exposed to throughout the semester, all seeking to take the fullest advantage of apparently disadvantageous positions.",
    "Good discussion, could have been better but that is partially a lack of impetus on the students' part (studio takes up too much time), and partially a bit of vagueness on Keller's part early on, in my opinion.",
    "my only beef with this course is that keller thinks it is more complicated than it is....we do understand and are relatively intelligent (if harried) people."

   "comments": [
    "Keller is elusive, which is both an asset and a liability in a course like this. Her elusiveness reflects the philosophy of the course and the material that it examines. In that sense, her teaching methods constitute an full-on immersion. At the same time, though, they make it difficult for the students to grapple with material that is already not very well defined.",
    "Emmett was great.",
    "Keller was effective but probably could have more effective by defining her goals and ways of reaching them in the seminar. Topics remained vagueand stayed that way for the entirety of the semester.",
    "Keller is a great teacher but maybe needs to be more direct\/clear. She often showed images without any explanation and we are not nearly as well versed in the subject matter as she is.",
    "I wish the teaching was done more by the teacher and less by the students.",
    "Keller is extremely knowledgeable, and engaging. I wish she had set a clearer agenda for the class from the beginning and that she would have spoken a bit more at the beginning of the semester. The class seemed to fumble around in the dark for most of the semester, trying to figure out how to engage the reading and what its spatial and architectural applications were.",
    "Keller Easterling is a tremendously clear, direct and knowledgeable person, who has been always available for mentoring and advice. I feel glad I was able to be exposed to her during my first year at Yale.",
    "Keller was very engaged and committed to the course. She encouraged wide exploration of material; however, had a hard time targeting the architectural side of her research\/the course. That aside, the class remained interesting and produced lively discussions."

    "Usually I find myself recommending that seminars focus on a closer reading of the assigned texts. But in this case the seminar would benefit from a more lively discussion of the overarching issues through the lens of but not entirely bound by the logic of the weekly readings.",
    "The Pecha Kucha was greatLess\/different student presentationsOverall, quite goodThanks!",
    "Increase clarity. Increase spatial - architectural - examples.",
    "Turn the seminar format into more of a lecture and discussion.",
    "The reading material was often impenetrable and seemed to require a previous knowledge of that author's writing.Maybe a few less texts and more focus onto spatial practices would have clarified a lot of questions.",
    "Thre should be more courses like in this in the School of Architecture.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and am glad that there is a class on architecture and activism at Yale. I felt the subject of lateral strategies was a very interesting one that is exceedingly relevant, but its significance was sometimes lost in the examples presented. In some ways, the themes were presented too abstractly, and would have benefited from more concrete examples in the built environment. I also felt that at times the course was overly cynical about community-based design, which was not always constructive."
