    "I really loved this course. I gained so much from the material and from the lectures and classroom discussions. I thought it was the perfect balance between challenging and thought provoking and also a safe, collegial space in which to engage in philosophical questioning. I thought the selection of materials was great, and I really enjoyed the exchange with my classmates. I learned a lot."

    "I was especially interested in (and wrote my final paper on) the Saul Kripke material from Naming and Necessity. I hadn't anticipated how much this material would inform my primary dissertation work (which is actually on the philosophical foundations of law). But, I now see this work on the theory of reference as an essential component of my work on the philosophical foundations of law. I'm very exciting about continuing this project."
