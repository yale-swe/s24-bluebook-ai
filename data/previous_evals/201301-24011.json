    "This is a survey course in organizational theory which covers some of the core schools within economic sociology including organizational ecology, neo-Institutionalism, Identity, the sociology of markets and Entrepreneurship.I would recommend this course to anyone studying or specializing in organizational behavior, whether within Public Health, Management, or Sociology.",
    "Overview of organizational theories on firm behavior. Recommended for anyone interested in firm behavior\/management theory\/management applications. Would also recommend taking some course in economics either as a prerequisite or concurrent with this course (many of our discussionsincluded economics, which would be hard to follow without any background in the subject).",
    "I would recommend the class. It engages people from a diversity of backgrounds. The class brought together people with backgrounds in psychology, economics, public health, and sociology. The readings and discussion were illuminating for all involved. Plus the mix of backgrounds brought forth different perspectives that contributed to my understanding of the readings. If a student wants an organized and engaging overview of Org Theory, this is the class!",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who is looking for a good PhD-level introduction to organization theory or macro-OB.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in organization theory, or organizations in general. The course provides a great overview of the seminal readings in the discipline and practice critically evaluating theories and empirical approaches."
