    "The class gave me a substantial grounding in poetry with which I was not familiar, and did not neglect lesser-known works. I can't imagine getting a better grasp of the later Romantics in the time available, and for that the class was invaluable.",
    "Absolutely - it is rare to get the chance to study the collected works of three significant poets in one semester. Paul Fry really knows his stuff, and gave good recommendations for biographies and criticism."
