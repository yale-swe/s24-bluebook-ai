    "I would tepidly recommend the course to another student. The subject and the readings are great, but the class itself didn't meet my expectations. The lecture format really detracted from the experience. Worth it, but barely.",
    "It's a great class but then again I'm a psych major. If you want to be a lawyer this class helps give you tips and tricks that can help win cases but the vast majority of the class is about psychology and not legal proceedings",
    "Really interesting. Not a lot of work, and the work that needs to be done is interesting.",
    "Great material, not a ton of work. Lecture can get a little tedious though. But Prof Lockhart is really nice--take it if you can get in!",
    "It's a really interesting, not too difficult, course that I encourage pre-law and psych majors to take.",
    "Really interesting material and Prof Lockhart is a sweetheart. The lectures are kind of jumbled sometimes but the topics are all really interesting. The work is a one page reading response a week plus a 5 page paper and a final. I went to observe a trial at the new haven courthouse for the class which was really cool too.",
    "TAKE IT!! Not much work and interesting i.e. you'll remember class material later on.",
    "This class was terrible, the worst I took at Yale. It was absurdly biased and it was hard to take anything the professor said seriously. The good thing is its very easy and the work was quite minimal.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interesting in law and learning a bunch of pretty specific psycho studies.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Professor Lockhart is a dynamic lecturer. The readings, while sometimes lengthy, are quite interesting, and the amount of knowledge that you gain by the end of the course is really impressive. Professor Lockhart makes the class engaging by conducting fun social experiments with the class or by polling students during class to see if they align with the expected psychological response. There are weekly reading responses, a final paper (which involves going to the court or interviewing someone in the criminal justice system) and a final, for which you get a pool of potential questions beforehand. Definitely a manageable class and one of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Solid class--interesting material, quite a bit of readings.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The lectures are engaging, and the material is fascinating. It can be a hard class to get into, but if you can, take it!",
    "It's a pretty fine psychology class. The material was really interested, but often not very well presented. There were far more readings than I was willing to keep up with, but the readings that I did do were interesting. This was more of a filler class than anything else, but i do think it's a good idea to have some idea of what's going on in the justice system just for life awareness. If you're a psych major, take it because it's different. If you're just looking for a random class, I'd pass this one up.",
    "Fair amount of work. I never felt over worked! Great class overall!",
    "Fantastic course!!",
    "Take it if you are interesting in the subject at all, or looking at law from a psychological perspective. Not too much work, just weekly reading responses, an almost take-home final, and a paper.",
    "Stay away. It's not what you're hoping it to be. When the professor is asked a question that challenges one of her assertions, she often closes up and gives a cop-out response. The lectures consist of the professor racing through study after study after study. It's boring. And at the end of the course, I can't say I know anything that I couldn't learn after 10 minutes of googling.Weekly response papers single spaced 1 pageEssay due on the last day of class (this is the one good part of the class. You get to go to the courthouse or interview someone in the criminal justice system)And a final exam that requires a ton of memorization",
    "I would definitely recommend class. It is very interesting an informative.",
    "I would describe Psych 330 as very interesting introduction to the intersection between psychology and law. Do not expect your mind to be blown; you won't learn many things beyond what you might have expected. Butwith that said, what you do learn is still interesting, and you wouldn't have been able to tie specific psychological research to your hunches about the legal system before taking this class. Professor Lockhart, I think, is the best part of this class. She super smart, very funny, a supremely competent lecturer, and also cares very much about her students, to boot. I would definitely recommend this class if you find the material interesting and are looking for a class with an average amount of work. To precautionary notes: 1) The project is fun, but it's not a huge part of the class. 2) This year the class was capped, so do not plan to necessarily be able to take this class (it ended up being completely limited to psych majors). 3) Like I said, it's interesting, but not mind-blowing. I think the words \"psychology\" and \"law\" when paired together generate a huge amount of excitement, but I don't think this class is of universal interest.",
    "This class provides an overview of the many intersections between psychology and the law. Many different interesting topics are discussed, and professor Lockhart makes it a good time, so id recommend it.",
    "Take. This. Class.",
    "It's an amazing class, take it if you get in. To take the most out of it do all the readings (they're not that much and are pretty fun) and try going out on the field by yourself to gain even more from the class.",
    "Take it",
    "This is a really laid back class. You'll learn, but most of the learning happens at the very end when you're writing the paper (4-5 pages double spaced on a court hearing or interview with a judicial official) and studying for the final exam (in-class, but the cases are given to you ahead of time so you can prepare your answers). The material is very interesting. However, Lockhart breezes through it in a slightly boring manner during class, so not many people are paying attention to her lectures. And yes, the format is lecturing (even though it's a smaller lecture - about 30 people). Very low workload though - one, 1-page reading response per week (you can skip three), a final paper, and a final exam."
