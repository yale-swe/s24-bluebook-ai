    "I really appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of this class, which drew together questions in media studies, art history, performance theory, and musicology in readings and discussions. I thought that the syllabus did a good job holding together key texts in media studies and in opera. I especially liked some of the historical readings (Ridout, Ossi). Overall, I found that the course filled in gaps in my historical knowledge (for example, thinking about set design alongside eighteenth and nineteenth century painting) as well as clarified some concepts (such as media archaeology) that I have struggled with in other classes.",

   "comments": [
    "There was a great deal of flexibility in the syllabus, which worked well in some cases, especially as Gundula cut readings to make our weekly work more manageable and added an additional week of presentations to accommodate everyone. Nevertheless, once or twice I struggled with keeping up with the weekly changes and found that I had the wrong readings with me, so I would have appreciated a bit more stasis at a certain point.",
    "There was a good mixture of theoretical foundations and practical applications; there were really no weaknesses to speak of.",
    "I would have liked fewer readings about digital technologies and a bit more about historical opera technologies. While we did look at Meyerbeer and Wagner, I felt we didn't have enough time to explore them properly and fix their context in relation not only to each other, but to 20th century works. (The Wagner section felt a bit bogged down in primary source material, which might have been part of the problem. We didn't have enough time to connect his theories to his works.)"
