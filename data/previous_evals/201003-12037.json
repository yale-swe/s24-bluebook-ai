    "It's Harold Bloom. He's hilarious and amazing. Good luck getting in, but if you do, it's worth it. Who knows how long he'll be around. I love you Professor Bloom!",
    "An incredible seminar with an incredible man, scholar, and mind. This isn't a seminar where the student should expect riveting discussion; this is more of an opportunity to listen to a master talk passionately about his life's work. It was an honor to be in Professor Bloom's seminar.",
    "Definitely take this class. A wonderful new way to understand Shakespearian character through comparisons of four of the greatest.",
    "Take it."
