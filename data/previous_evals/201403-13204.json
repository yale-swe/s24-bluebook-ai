    "Loads of fun. Must take.",
    "ENGL 416 does a wonderful job of incorporating the study of contemporary British fiction within the larger context of British history. Alongside discussing the texts, Professor Phillips also discussed what was going on in Britain at the time so that we could better understand what events were influencing the author. Professor Phillips assigned each of us an author, so every week a different student presented on a different author. I felt like this gave the work more meaning because you could see touches of the author's life woven within their writing. I found the texts to be an interesting mixture of plays and fictional stories that made each week new and exciting. I never felt bored. The paper at the end of the semester may be challenging for those who have never written a paper of that magnitude before, but Professor Phillips helps you along the way.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It is one of my favorite courses I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Take this class! The workload is totally reasonable, and the reading is fantastic. Caz is excellent and hilarious. If you're at all interested in the course description, apply and take the class.",
    "The reading list for this course is fantastic. It's a great class because in addition to just reading wonderful novels, plays, and poetry, you develop a much better understanding of the culture of contemporary Britain. Professor Phillips is also brilliant and I would have taken this course just for the chance to listen to him speak. The final paper is rough. I would start it earlier than the syllabus demands.",
    "Contemporary British Fiction is a lot of work, but if you enjoy the material and are prepared to speak up in class, go for it! If you are taking a heavy workload, definitely credit\/d it.",
    "I would never recommend Caryl Phillips' class to a friend. He was disengaged and even hostile in class. Stay away."
