    "A necessary req, but a tough one because there is so much new material. The option to drop one midterm and quiz was much appreciated. I would highly recommend taking it with Professor Ellman.",
    "The course moves very rapidly and it is difficult to keep up with the workload. The course material is much more interesting than that of general chemistry. Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult to keep up to pace with the work. I would only recommend taking this class if you need to take it or if you are extremely interested in the topic because it is a lot of work and it is an intro science class.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you love the material. If you fall into the latter category, take it with Ellman if at all possible, it will make you love it even more.",
    "Very difficult, but not impossible.",
    "I really enjoyed organic chemistry. Professor Ellman is one of the best teachers I've ever had, and his teaching style is very clear and well-organized. He is effective at explaining concepts in an understandable way. He is willing to help you if you don't understand the material and is really nice in general. The material is interesting, and though it can be challenging, there are enough resources to be able to help you learn well. Tests and quizzes are very reasonable. Go to lecture because its helpful and actually enjoyable if you follow.",
    "Honestly, Orgo is one of those classes as a pre-med student you just have to stick out. It's a really tough course but Prof Ellman makes it as close to bearable as possible.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone possibly interested in organic chemistry. Professor Ellman is an excellent professor, and I learned so much. The material is inherently difficult, but you'll have a good time learning it.",
    "Take it with Professor Ellman. He breaks down the material well and I've heard teaches much better than the professor in the fall. You can drop on midterm score (of three) and one quiz score (of four). Just make sure you have time to keep up with all the readings.",
    "Yes. Especially with professor Ellman, who covers the material so simply and logically. You learn a lot.",
    "Orgo can be challenging if you do not stay on top of the work, but it is not a impossible course. It is nice that you get to drop one quiz and one test grade. The most challenging part is making sure to do all the reading. The practice problems are often helpful in understanding the concepts but are usually quite different in form from test questions. Prof. Ellman gives great notes and the practice tests he posts are extremely helpful.",
    "It's a really good class that you should definitely get exposed to some harder course material. I would definitely recommend it, but you have to do your work and keep up.",
    "it's what you expect",
    "Premeds abound.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "If you have to take the class, then you have to take the class. Otherwise, don't take the class.",
    "Professor Elman is probably one of the best organic chemistry professors you will ever have. His teaching style is extremely organized and easy to follow. You should definitely take the chance to take his class if you ever need to take orgo.",
    "A good course, taught by a great professor. I learned quite a bit and would recommend it - be sure to keep on top of the material as the problem sets are not graded.",
    "If you have to take orgo, DEFINITELY take it with Ellman. He is a very structured and great lecturer, and you will be prepared for the exams which are fair. Orgo is not as hard as people make it out to be, but I think that's because Ellman is a serious lecturer, albeit not the most interesting professor (I'm looking at CHEM 118 MAJ) but WAY organized and writes everything down on the board so you have very very good notes to study from (which is definitely not the case for 118). The problem sets aren't collected, so you're going to have to do the work on your own and pace yourself, and there's a LOT of work, but it's possible to not do a lot of the problem sets and do fine on the exams, since the practice exams are really key. The textbook is really helpful, and Ellman's notes follow the book pretty closely, which is very helpful. There are four quizzes which don't count for much and for some reason are on the worst days ever, but what matter more are the exams. The material is actually really interesting, especially trying to figure out reaction mechanisms, but I would even go so far as to skip fall orgo if you know Ellman will be teaching in the spring. Just try to get him as a professor and orgo will not be that bad. You probably have to take it, so I definitely recommend taking it with Ellman.",
    "If you like science, then take this class. If you keep up with the material, and if professor Ellman is teaching the course, then it'll be a super straightforward class from which you learn a ton. The difficulty of a class often relies more on the administration than the material, and Professor Ellman knows how to make the class very manageable. A very cool class!",
    "Take Orgo 1with Ellman!",
    "Orgo chem is hard because of the sheer amount of things you need to memorize and understand. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO THE PSETS ON TIME EVEN THOUGH THEY AREN'T DUE!!! I wish I did that. It would have made studying for midterms and finals a lot easier. Professor Ellman is a great professor and is very approachable. He knows what he is doing and has really neat handwriting and notes.",
    "CHEM 220 is really interesting, and if you take it to actually learn organic chemistry and not as only a pre-req, it will be enjoyable.",
    "Taking Organic Chemistry with Jonathan Ellman is a good choice! He is a great professor. Organic chemistry as a discipline is hard, but he makes it more manageable. There were no problem sets for the class which made it hard sometimes to keep caught up, which was not great. Otherwise I would definitely recommend this class with Ellman.",
    "I would recommend it for all students going into chemistry because it helps develop useful problem solving skills.",
    "If you study, this class is pretty straight forward. The expectations about what you need to know and what isgoing to be tested are very clear from class and the practice exams and Professor Ellman is good at teaching the concepts. Make sure to do well on the first final though because even though one grade is dropped, the average for the first test is always much much higher than the second two.",
    "Most people hate it, but I actually liked orgo I because by learning different mechanisms and stuff like that, you get to understand exactly why and how reactions work. Lecture can be pretty boring at times, especially if you have no idea what's going on, but I found it useful to go and copy down whatever Ellman puts on the blackboard cause it really helps later on.",
    "If you *have* to take Orgo, you should take it with Professor Ellman. He provides you with all the tools you need to succeed. If you attend class, do the reading, and study the practice mid-terms, you should do reasonably well in the course. I didn't feel at all \"tricked\" during this class--all expectations were communicated really well and everything was out in the open. The practice mid-terms were about the same in format and content as the actual mid-terms. Same goes with the final. Although I found the four quizzes throughout the course of the class to be really annoying, they did serve to ensure that I caught up with the material before the exams.All that said, even with a great professor and a strong class structure, Orgo is an incredibly challenging and demanding course. I wouldn't advise taking it with another course that requires a lot of attention. Also, it seemed that most of the other students taking this course were freshmen coming right out of Chem 118, which meant that the curve wasn't as generous as it probably could've been. Keep that in mind when you're debating taking the course with Ziegler in the fall or another prof in the spring.",
    "This course is an introduction to the principles of Organic Chemistry, with a lot of emphasis on the Sn1, Sn2, E1, and E2 mechanisms. It is an intro course, but when taught by a good professor (Professor Ellman in my case), it is comprehensible and fair.",
    "Organic Chemistry is hard--there's no way around it. It's a lot of new material, and moves at a very quick pace that can be easy to get lost in if you don't keep up. That being said, Professor Ellman presents the material in an organized clear manner that makes it easier to follow along, and if you actually put work in, it's not that bad. Take it with Ellman if you can--he is good about telling you exactly what is expected and what isn't. Also, the practice exams are a good indication of the types of questions you will be tested on, so definitely do them!",
    "-Lectures were great.-Loved the textbook.-Quizzes and exams were very fair. Practice exams and review sessions were EXTREMELY helpful. This course could have been very stressful, but the professor and TAs helped make it manageable.-I would definitely recommend this course. If you are willing to put in a decent amount of effort, orgo isn't nearly as difficult as it's made out to be. Definitely take it with Professor Ellman.",
    "This class will make you think and apply concepts. Memorization will only get you so far. You really need to learn and understand the mechanisms to do well. A solid background of physical chemistry (specifically acid-base chemistry)will be helpful. Don't get bogged down by the homework; there is a point in the semester at which point people simply stop trying to do every problem assigned because it's simply unreasonable. The tests are fair and you will come out having learned a significant amount of chemistry.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to work.",
    "Ellman does a very good job making Organic Chemistry accessible. There is a lot of work and the tests tend to be very involved, but it is worth it.",
    "Take this with Ellman, NOT Ziegler. Jonathan Ellman is an amazing lecturer and professor. Organized, fair, and easy to understand. Orgo with him as a professor isn\u0092t that bad - I actually enjoyed it.",
    "Yes, you have to take this course if you're a pre-med or a science major, but you're crazy if you take it otherwise. Ellman has a disposition unexpectedly lighthearted for an Orgo professor, but then you get screwed over on the midterms. I did good in Chem 118 and I thought I knew what I was getting into. The first midterm is easy, but the second and third are nightmares. I took it spring semester, maybe fall is better, but I don't know. All the tests had at least one mechanism that was not covered in the textbook or in lecture, and it was obviously intended to lower grades, nothing less, nothing more. I knew this was going to be a tough pre-med class, but I honestly didn't expect it to be this bad. I think it would have been easier if I hadn't taken such a tough courseload of 5.5 credits, but didn't think the grading would be this bad. Hopefully the final goes well and boosts my grade, but otherwise it's really hard to gage how you're doing in the class. Very frustrating, even though I had a firm grasp on the material it was impossible to do well on the midterms.",
    "I would recommend Chem 220 with Ellman to another student. Ellman is a great, organized professor who is willing to help students who ask! It is a lot of work, but it's not too hard.",
    "I'm guessing most of the people only took the class because they had to (which was also the case for me even though I'm not pre-med), but if you're on the fence take it with Professor Ellman! I came into orgo having heard how horrible it is, but I actually really enjoyed the work (even though there aren't any psets be prepared to work a TON to stay caught up). Professor Ellman was also a fantastic lecturer and I thought the class was very organized. It was nice being able to drop the lowest test and quiz grade as well.",
    "The class was awesome, and I would definitely recommend it. I really like Professor Ellman, and the subject itself is really interesting.",
    "Take Orgo I with Ellman. It will be tough, but you will understand orgo, and learn to appreciate it. Ellman is a fabulous professor, and his tests are for the most part predictable (except the third midterm, which the average was a whopping 55...but your lowest midterm grade gets dropped, so this was not really a major problem). I wish professors were more transparent about their curve, but overall this is a great course.",
    "It's a lot of work. If you put in the time and don't shy away from the workload, it will be bearable. I wouldn't really take it just for fun or anything...take it if you're committed to the material and need it for a requirement.",
    "It will demand a disproportionate amount of your time, but if you put the work in, it's actually a piece of cake. If you don't, you won't understand a thing that's being said about three or four weeks in.",
    "Orgo's not that bad. Just make sure you keep up with your work consistently throughout the year so you're not swamped for the final.",
    "Professor Ellman is AMAZING. Take orgo with him. You will not regret it. I actually came out of the class really really liking orgo!",
    "Don't take it unless you have a very strong chemistry background. Obviously if you're taking it, you're pre-med\/some major relating to chem. It's tough, but if you keep with the reading and practice problems, it's doable.",
    "Lots of memorization...not too difficult, though beware of mobs of annoying pre-med freshmen that will spend 10 minutes arguing for 1 point. Homework isn't graded, but so much of it is assigned that eventually you'll just copy down the answers from the key.",
    "it is an interesting class but it's not easy at all.",
    "This class requires a lot of vigorous studying. If you don't like teaching yourself material and drilling over and over on your own time (there are no mandatory problem sets) then this class isn't for you.",
    "It's a lot of work and I wouldn't recommend you taking it for fun. If you have to take it try to get Ellman.",
    "Even though I took this course as a pre-med requirement, I really enjoyed it -- particularly because I feel like I learned so much. Everyone says this is the killer college class, but Professor Ellman makes it seem extremely manageable. There is a lot of work involved (homework is not mandatory, but if you don't do it you'll have a fun time studying for the exams), but it's worth it if it's well-taught.",
    "Not as hard as I had been lead to believe, but once it got to reactions and reaction mechanisms, you really have to keep up with the material and practice with it because the reactions and mechanisms build on each other and you will get swamped quickly if you don't.Ellman is a wonderful and enthusiastic lecturer as well. I enjoyed this class boatloads more than CHEM 115.",
    "It is definitely a very difficult course. I would not recommend anyone take it unless he or she plans on dedicating a lot of time to the course. Professor Ellman, however, does a great job of presenting the material in a clear and understandable way.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHEM 220 to anyone. Iam not a chem major or pre-med and did not find the material overly challenging if you take it with Ellman. It's best to put about 4-6 hours per week into the class (doing the ALL the hw assignments) to not fall behind and really understand the material. Besides that, there is not that much work. The material is not difficult if you keep up with it, but if you fall behind, it is difficult to catch up. It's best to do well on the first midterm as the rest get significantly harder. The practice midterms are also representative of the actual tests.Ellman is an amazing professor and teaches organic chemistry in a very clear and organized way. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes Ellman is unreal.",
    "Organic Chemistry is very bearable with Ellman - interesting even. While some of the material was difficult to grasp and the midterms and quizzes throughout the semester were sometimes scheduled to close together, Professor Ellman definitely was helpful and clear in his teaching. I would definitely recommend this course if Professor Ellman is teaching it. It will still be hard work but you will feel that you have actually learned something.",
    "Organic Chemistry with Professor Ellman was a great experience. Professor Ellman gives superb, clear lectures with wonderful notes. Problem sets are not graded (but doing them anyway is highly advisable), and the quizzes and exams were fair. If you're thinking of taking Organic Chemistry, I definitely recommend taking it with Professor Ellman even if that means you have to wait until spring semester to start.",
    "This course provides the basic foundations for study into organic chemistry. The workload is reasonable as long as one keeps up with the assignments. Assignments are optional but highly recommended.",
    "CHEM 220 is a well-taught first-semester organic chemistry course. Professor Ellman presents topics and mechanisms in a very organized fashion.",
    "I would recommend this class with professor ellman. At least you feel like you're learning chemistry, and you know what to expect on the exams",
    "It is a very interesting class. But it does require a lot of work.",
    "Take it. Ellman's explanations of mechanisms and reactions are pretty clear and easy to follow, and he makes it interesting (at least if you are interested in chemistry), but it is fairly easy to fall behind in the class if you don't stay on top of the work. Do the optional problem sets, or at least some of them.",
    "Follow the reading schedule! Trying to read three chapters the night before the exam just doesn't work. And while the lectures are fairly comprehensive of all the material you'll be tested on, the book helps fill in the wholes. Also a must, office hours before the exam. Even if you don't have any questions, you might get some tips on how to solve problems faster from other peoples' questions if you go.",
    "Chemistry 220 is a very challenging class with a heavy course load. However, if one is willing to invest the time and resources needed to do well in the class, then they will succeed. It is vital to keep up with the homework assignments to understand the material, as well as do well on the tests and quizzes. If you fall behind, it can be very difficult to catch up. Nevertheless, if you invest a great deal into the class, you will get a great deal out of it.",
    "If you need to take orgo, take it with Ellman. He's a great professor, very clear and enthusiastic, and has wonderful chalk. It was a difficult class, but there are plenty of resources to help you (office hours, review sessions and practice tests are really helpful). Still, it's orgo and it was an insane amount of work if you keep up with the homework problems. and you still might do terribly on the exams.",
    "Great course! Some of the material is hard to learn, but it's rewarding and eventually fun. Ellman makes the material much less daunting and the lack of problem sets makes the schedule a little more flexible. Take it!",
    "If you need to take the class, than I recommend it. IT is a fascinating subject and is definitely needed for those interested in medicine.",
    "If you want\/need to take Orgo, take this class. Professor Ellman is great at explaining the material, and the class is very well organized. The expectations are clear from the beginning, so if you put in the time you should do well. The class really speeds up near the end, so start studying from the beginning but don't get complacent if you do well on the first few tests. Be prepared to spend a lot more time studying the second half of the semester.",
    "Organic Chemistry was a lot more interesting and more challenging than general chemistry, but the bad rep orgo gets for being a super hard class is definitely over-exaggerated. First of all, Professor Ellman is such a great professor - he's articulate and organized and genuinely wants you to do well. But his role as a professor can only go so far so it's super important to stay on top of the readings and the problem sets. I highly recommend taking this class as long as Ellman is teaching it.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was difficult because there were a lot of mechanisms to learn but other than that it wasn't terribly hard. However, I'd be prepared to work hard and not slack off if one were to take this class.",
    "Great. If you're going to take orgo, take it in the spring with Ellman for sure.",
    "Take orgo 1at with Ellman -is you might find yourself even enjoying it!",
    "The class is a lot of work, but if you have the time to commit to it, it really isn't that bad. I would definitely recommend taking the class with Professor Ellman if possible. His lectures were very well organized, and he was kind and approachable. The material is tedious, but Ellman was definitely the best science professor I have had at Yale.",
    "Chemistry with Professor Ellman was far better than with Ziegler. Ellman is thorough, clear, and helpful. The way he touched concepts was more reasonable as well -- he conveyed them in ways that were more accessible to those who weren't necessarily so great at spatial reasoning, deeper chemistry concepts, etc. It was tough, for sure -- but not impossible. There were no psets, though,which don't help in tempering your grade if the tests are a struggle for you.",
    "I would recommend this course if you need to learn Organic Chemistry.",
    "Orgo is not easy, but I think that a lot of students often exaggerate how hard it actually is. Like any other class, you need to stay on top of the work and pay attention in class. You have to memorize a bit, and some of the concepts are a bit confusing. But you have to do the same in any QR or Science class. Do yourself a favor and go in with a positive mindset, and don\u0092t try and justify your poor performance by saying that it\u0092s a hard class and useess to study. Most likely, you haven\u0092t put in the time or effort that you could have. Go to class, do you work, and you\u0092ll be fine. Plus, Ellman is great and you\u0092re lucky to have him."
