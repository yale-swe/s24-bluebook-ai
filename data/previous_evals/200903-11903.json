   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend ARBC 150 to another student in its current form. I did not feel that my Arabic was helped, and I felt that the resources we used for the class hurt the Arabic skills that I use outside of class in a practical manner (reading Arabic news, talking to Arabs in a mix of colloquial\/Modern Standard, listening to Arabic music, listening to Arabic talk radio, etc.)",
    "Don't take it--it's emblematic of the problem with Arabic language classes generally--far too removed from how actual people speak, and what actual people read. You don't really get a sense of Arabic as it's actually used in the Arab world.",
    "The syllabus is very much changed this year, so definitely take a look at it when considering this class. All the work is doable but there is really no accountability in terms of what we learned in class (there were no quizzes or any other form of exam to test us and Bayn al-Qasrayn was just something everyone did but didn't really understand or care about). I also really like Aziz as a professor.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless the curriculum changes. The material is inadequate and yet time consuming. Professor Aziz and Yasmin Khattab, however, were excellent.",
    "It depends. You really need to have more than just Yale-Arabic under your belt. I've been consistently in the top third of my elementary and intermediate classes, but without substantial exposure to native speakers ARBC 150 was nearly impossible",
    "This course was actually very very well taught. I think there could have been a few improvements with the listening compnent, in terms of audio quality. Everything else though, from najib mahfouz readings to the presentations, to especially the memorizations, were extremely conducive to learning. I think that more exams would have motivated us a bit more to really preserve the large amount of vocabulary we learned in the class. Other than that, i found the presentations and the memorizations useful because they enhanced our speaking abilities and our pronunciation respectively. I would definitely recommend Aziz's class because he really cares to encourage his class.",
    "This class is necessary for anyone who wants to take modern standard through L5. Unfortunately, the kinks in the curriculum are still being worked out, so this semester ended up being a lot of work (difficult readings, lots of busy work such as recitations) without much to show for it in terms of increased vocabulary or fluency. Professor Aziz continues to be a very nice man who is not the most adept professor.",
    "Needs A LOT of restructuring. I found the Mahfouz novel very cumbersome, absurdly difficult, and generally depressing due to its difficulty. Honestly every student stopped reading it, and just read the English and tried to subsist off of that.The memorizations were really very cumbersome and unwieldy at crunch time (due at hte same time as the essays). They take a great deal of your time, with very little return, I feel. I really felt they came from left field, and gave an advadntage to the Muslim students who have alreadybeen trained in memorizing the Qur'an or those who were gifted in that sort of thing.We had papers to write, one 5-page and one 10-page. I admit it was very, very difficult for me to do, but I feel this was one of the better parts of hte course, just if the writing had been broken up, graded, and returned to us regulrarly, I feel I would have learned so much more from it. Still, I learned a lot from it.The listening was a good idea, but many of the clips were of very bad quality, so I wouldn't have been able to understand the speakers if they had been speaking English.The one part of this class that really stood out, made me think the most in and about Arabic, and really gave me solid new vocab, grammatic concepts, and idiomatic phrases was the translations from the blue book weekly. The essays are solid Arabic, and still very difficult for me, but they are not impossible like the Mahfouz, and there are notes to help with unwieldy idioms, which is so helpful (and it feels really good when you translate an idiom, guess its meaning, and turn the page to find you got it right!). The blue book is a solid piece of work, and I think any future L5 course should be centered around this, rather than the absurd Mahfouz. I know he's brilliant, and his Arabic is top calibre, but we really aren't there yet. Make no mistake, I found reading the blue-book articles (not just brute-forcing the translation) particularly difficult, but not impossible -- a strong challange, but not completely impossible -- i.e. after 5 hours of work, I have finished with understanding many new things and the content of the essay, with many new pages of vocab, and a feeling of accomplishment. I think this is what they saught with the Mahfouz, but it's just way too difficult, and I'm not the sort of person to give up like that, but the same 5 hours spent on the Mahfouz won't even get you one tenth of the way through the reading (well if you want to understand what's happening, otherwise you could practice sounding out a bunch of Arabic words that you don't know).Ultimately, take this if you want to keep your Arabic up and learn a bit, but if you just came back from overseas or had good classes beforehand -- unless the structure of this class is changed -- one must not expect too much from this course, and be prepard for some hardship.Aziz is great though, he's really good at explaining vocab and guiding you along, if the curriculum were different, I think he would ahve been able to teach us much more.",
    "I would not recommend it, if the course continues to focus on reading naguib mahfouz and exercises from the ramuny book."
