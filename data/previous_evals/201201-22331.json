    "A good introduction to music from a theoretical point of view. Much difference from a performance perspective, but also very simple for anyone who has a functioning knowledge of an instrument. Would definitely recommend for anyone interested in learning more about music.",
    "Do not take if you have no music experience! This class is meant for students with no music experience but the class was actually full of them. There was one student with at least 8 years of flute experience. It made things very difficult for beginners because of the fast pace nature of the class. Also, the homework assignments take hours and hours for those with no experience. Professor Davis was great and very effective at teaching music though. The only negative thing about her that I would say is that she should have done a better job weeding out the students who had music experience. And the tests and quizzes were a bit difficult. But aside from that, she is very friendly, approachable and knowledgeable and I learned a lot because of that. She also brought snacks on occasion. This class was engaging and fun. There was a ton of information covered, which was a bit overwhelming at times. Aside from that, very informative class!",
    "Fabulous. Awesome. Take this class with this instructor. You will improve very quickly, make new friends and be more attractive. Okay maybe not the last thing, but this was one of my best experiences at Yale and I do not regret taking Music 110 in the least. You should shop around the sections and find an instructor whose right for you (because basically everything is up to him\/her).",
    "Take it if you have music knowledge and it should be great. If you don't, be prepared to struggle a LOT because it moves very fast.",
    "Yes, it's a great humanities credit.",
    "Excellent intro to music theory class. yes"
