    "Well organized course for anyone at the right level.",
    "This is not a class that focuses on conversation. This class is all about reading short stories and watching movies and writing short essays. There are about 2 250 word essays every week, and every three weeks or so is a 4 page essay, but there is an opportuntiy to correct the longer essays. This class takes up more time than French 140.",
    "Yes take it. A lot of work, at times a little too much, but if you are interested in learning french definitely take it and take it with Katrien Wynant<--- amazing teacher and will push you but at the same time be very understanding about extensions and conflicting obligations.",
    "highly recommended if you want to further improve your French",
    "This was a good, comprehensive overview of high level French grammar. The books and stories we read were interesting. It can seem like a lot of work, but it's kind of necessary for the pace of the class.",
    "This class is much, much better than 140, and covers mostly modern pieces. Working on grammar alone can be a bit daunting, but it's overall a solid, not-too-difficult course. It helps a lot with reading and writing in French.",
    "It is a good course with a lot of work. I would suggest this to a student who truly enjoys french and i would say do not take it if it is just to fulfill a requirement because of the workload."
