   "comments": [
    "Take this class! If you are not awesome at math, this is the Econ section for you. The beginning of the course features math basics to get everyone up to the same level. The course is a great balance between mathematical econ and the social principles of econ. No reading or heavy homework--problem sets are done in groups. The seminar is interactive and fun. There really is no downside to taking this course.",
    "I don't think this class is substantially easier than the regular intro micro class. The big difference is that the seminar format and the different assignments (fewer psets and a final paper) make it easier if you're not good at math.",
    "Econ 108 is a small, math-focused seminar alternative to the massive Intro Econ lecture. I would absolutely recommend that you take Econ in a small setting; it forces you to learn the material better, and makes it much easier to ask questions as you go through the lessons. Tolga Koker is absolutely the best, don't take it with anyone else. This class is perfect if you have a bit of math anxiety or just want a smoother introduction to the subject.",
    "Yes, definitely take it! It's fun and necessary to be an informed citizen. There is not a huge amount of work and class is enjoyable.",
    "take it",
    "Take it if you can get Tolga! He is so passionate about teaching and really makes an extra effort to make sure you understand the material...even if it means sitting with you after class or holding extra office hours. If you can get it, skip the lecture, take TOLGA!",
    "Take it.",
    "Definitely",
    "This course is perfect for you if you are not that confident about your mathematical skills. Tolga is great and the course overall was well organized",
    "TOLGA TOLGA",
    "This course is a great introduction to microeconomics. Tolga is a great instructor, always funny and dynamic. He made what can be a dry subject into a really interesting one. Sometimes, I felt like I was memorizing material and not actually learning, but that happens in most econ classes. But it is a good overview of a subject which I would not have otherwise taken. I would really recommend it for anyone who is looking to learn econ and not struggle through it.",
    "The best taught introductory economic class in college. It is extremely well taught. If you work hard you are assured of an excellent grade.",
    "Yes, but its not a gut, you have to study for it."
