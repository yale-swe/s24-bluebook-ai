   "comments": [
    "I think this class made me seriously consider changing my major to literature. If you're not someone who likes to think about cultural production and analysis you probably wouldn't avoid this course.",
    "I learned how to approach and analyze historical films (those made in the past and those made about the past), and use them to develop a more complex understanding of historical events.",
    "I have learned a tremendous amount as Professor Syrimis would not only talk about the current topic in class, but bring up many other forms of media and literature that really opened up my eyes. By taking this class, I have also developed film analyzing techniques and a new way to look at films that I never had before.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze films.",
    "I had never analyzed film as a historical source before (honestly, I'd never analyzed film at all before... I rarely watched movies before this class). This class has shaped the way I watch movies and the way I understand the relationship between politics and film. Writing historical papers about films was big challenge for me, but it's a new skill that I look forward to using in the future. Finally, I thought I knew European history well, but I really only understood Western European history. The focus on Greece, Cyprus, East Germany, and the Balkans was a new way of looking at the Cold War.",
    "I learned about culture and media during the Cold War in countries on the periphery of the conflict.",
    "What I believe was the greatest skill I gained from this class was the ability to analyze, discuss, and understand film as a literary and historical work. I developed this skill with a specific focus on the Cold War, but I believe that this skill is extremely helpful in almost any academic or other setting and will heighten my ability to critically think and analyze information I am given."

   "comments": [
    "This class is not well-organized. It's unclear how one week's material ties in to the next. The movies are completely different from each other, and there is little background reading that we are assigned to make sense of any of the movies. The few readings that we did have to do were far too complex and did not help understand what we were studying. Each week a student gives a presentation and it's clear no one is exactly sure what we are speaking of in this class and it ended up all being sort of nonsensical discussion for most of the time. This is NOT a class for history majors, unless you have a heavy background on sociology, film studies or literature. He made crazy references all the time to literature and it was impossible to follow along. That being said, Professor Syrimis is a blast. He's so nice and always so willing to meet and help you. He's got one of the most interesting stories -- but that did not always translate into a helpful class. I would examine the syllabus carefully to see if it is something that interests you before taking the class.",
    "I wish the syllabus were more organized, because oftentimes my friends and I would come to class having read different things and would be confused about what we were supposed to talk about. However, because there was so much good material on the syllabus, I don't think this necessarily hindered my learning.",
    "The syllabus is packed with stimulating works of art. Still, the course often felt scattered and it is hard to tell how much was actually learned about the culture that these works are supposed to reveal.",
    "The course is well-organized and has an interesting range of material. It had no particular weaknesses.",
    "I think I wanted this to be a history course through the lens of film, but it was actually a film course that touched on history. Many of the seminar discussions were very uninteresting to me, and I thought that they did not focus nearly enough on analyzing the culture of the era. Prof. Symiris had a limited number of questions about art he was interested in talking about, that did not really align with my own interests. I also thought he was very bad to meet with for office hours. I felt that he talked over me a lot, and did not let me articulate the ideas I had come to run by him.",
    "I don't think the course makes a whole lot of sense. It's more of a film class than a history class, and we often ended up talking about everything but the Cold War. That's not necessarily a bad thing. But you won't get what's advertised.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, cultural history was a new and fascinating methodology for me and it gave me a different perspective on the Cold War. Having us write responses was really helpful in teaching me how to analyze film. Our discussions were always really interesting and well-conducted. The workload was reasonable and I enjoyed the secondary readings. I think the course could be improved if a work of film criticism were assigned early in the semester. Reading Catalychos's analysis helped me understand how to write film criticism and made it a lot easier to write my final paper, and it would have been useful to have something similar before the midterm paper.",
    "This course had interesting content and Syrimis was an energetic professor. It was, however, poorly organized and seemed to meander in terms of its focus often.",
    "I wish there was more class time. The longer seminar was great as it enabled the discussion to progress farther and really develop some ideas brought up in class. Nevertheless after every class I left with more questions and felt that I would have been good to have another discussion section so that there might be some time to process and think about information and then talk about it again. Also the film screenings that we had in the beginning of the semester were great and I wish we could have continued them or even have talked about the film a little bit immediately following the viewing."

   "comments": [
    "Do not come into this course expecting a history course. As the professor himself told me, he includes just enough material in the syllabus to have it approved as a history seminar but it is NOT one. The class centered mostly on literature and sociology themes rather than history. As a history major, I was lost most of the time. It is an interesting class, but not one I felt I had the sufficient background knowledge to take, and it did not teach me much about the Cold War. Additionally, the professor is from Cyprus and situates at least two of the lectures around events there which no one had much of a background on. Overall, it's not a super well organized class but if you like interesting discussions on the themes, take it. I will say that if you are someone who likes to know how you are doing grade-wise throughout the class, avoid this one. Our only assignments were a presentation (never graded), a midterm paper (that was graded at least 5 weeks after turned in only at the very end of November) and a final paper that we have no guidelines on.",
    "Yes, I would. Not to every student though -- check out the syllabus and make sure you're interested in the material. This is not a standard cold war overview, and may be really confusing for most history majors.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if you're interested in watching historical films that relate to the Cold War and learning how to pick them apart.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as it is very organized in that a student presents for each class on the current film and supplementary readings. You learn so much from not only Professor Syrimis but from the students in class as well. You will develop an open mind and gain an introduction to the cold war even without knowing much about the cold war.",
    "I do not think most history majors would find this course interesting. I can't speak to people more interested in the aesthetics of film, but I really doubt it. I can pinpoint only a handful of days the discussion was great, and most of the time neither the presentations nor Prof. Symiris' discussions questions really went anywhere productive.",
    "Yes, a really great class. Interesting films, exciting discussions, great professor.",
    "Ultimately, I think I probably would recommend this courts. It is VERY little work just one film a week, and a lot of optional reading. I really enjoy watching films, so the work was a nice break from everything else.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Not only do you get to watch wonderful movies, but the discussions are fascinating and rigorous. The workload is very manageable, but you'll have to learn to make interesting arguments about films as historical texts. Professor Syrimis holds you to high standards and gives you tons of feedback on your papers. Most importantly, this is not the same Cold War history that was in your high school history textbook. You'll learn a lot about Greece, the Balkans, and East Germany, places that often get neglected in traditional Cold War history. Finally, as someone who doesn't watch a ton of movies, I learned to watch movies attentively and critically in this class, especially with an eye to their historical\/political symbolism. I think that's a skill I'll appreciate long after graduation.",
    "Yes.",
    "A good Friday class with good books and movies.",
    "I wish it had been a little better organized - it was difficult to understand what the exact purpose of the course was, since we covered a breadth of different things but it was difficult to find a thread linking the materials. The theme of the Cold War itself was very little discussed as well, which I wish has been made more clear towards the beginning of the course.",
    "This was a really excellent course, it was enjoyable, I learned a lot, and I feel that the course challenged me to break new ground in my own intellectual development. It is quite a bit of challenging work, but the work is worth doing."
