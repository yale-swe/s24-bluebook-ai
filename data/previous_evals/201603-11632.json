   "comments": [
    "I knew nothing about Digital Humanities (or the Avant Gardes, really) coming into the course. We engaged deeply with the issues and opportunities associated with DH. I got my first exposure to many 20th century Russian poets and considered their unique positionalities as emigres. Probably most helpful for me in a broader sense was Marijeta's review of poetic meter. I haven't worked with poetry since high school, so this was an invaluable way to spend time in the class. The final project allowed me to really delve into digital humanities and poetry with my group, which proved to be a very rewarding and (dare I say) fun experience!",
    "A lot of information about digital humanities, as well as the actual course content; learning about how to use digital tools to interact with philosophical\/literary texts.",
    "This was my first exposure to Russian formalism and reading poetry in its original Russian. It was perfectly introductory for people like me, while still maintaining the proper level of sophistication for those who are more advanced in their studies. I also got a lot of insight into what other Slavists are up to - and how much it differs from my own work! This was tremendously insightful and helped me think about my own work in new ways.",
    "I learned a fair amount about literary theory, especially on the Russian\/East-European side. I learned about various avant-garde movements and am much more familiar with such legends as Mayakovsky, Nabokov, Tsvetaeva, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about possibilities for DH in the humanities in this course. The avant-garde and emigre portions of the course definitely deserve a lot more attention (and perhaps a separate course). Though this might be difficult, given how new DH is for many students of the class, it might make sense to begin the group projects earlier in the semester. The short time frame to work out a DH project was my only frustration in the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Perhaps it would make sense to engage with some of the theory alongside the poetry, rather than having a large chunk of theory at the beginning of the course. It was nice to have a strong theoretical foundation, but I think working with the poetry a bit earlier on would be productive as well, especially as people are designing final projects that may engage with specific authors or texts. I also felt that throughout the course I didn't really know where I stood in terms of grading and assessment. The nature of the final project makes the grading scheme very \"end of the semester heavy.\"",
    "It's very... lefty, for lack of a better word. The word \"problematic\" was used nine times a class, and the beginning of the class was great when working on Soviet formalism, but moving into the contemporary period was overtly political in what felt like a kind of unnecessary way for a class not actually about critical theory.",
    "This is a fun course but I actually think it might help if the enrollment were limited. It also needs to be marketed more to computer science students. I would say definitely let computer science students in without the language requirement -- they won't need it, and it will improve the quality of final projects significantly. There was a little too much reading for a course that meets twice a week.",
    "A great introductory course into the possibilities for DH in Slavic. The only weakness I would point to is how ambitious the course is -- mixing study of Soviet emigres, the Russian avant-garde and DH methodology all into one semester. Perhaps splitting it in two, or sufficiently treating the theoretical background of avant-gardes or emigres in a separate course might be best."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah, it was generally cool.",
    "Yes! While it might not be the most interesting class for students with extensive non-literary work in the digital humanities, it is perfect for learning about how literature interacts with DH in prevailing discussions, and asks you to intervene on them - either by joining or resisting.",
    "I would recommend this to my peers, with the caveat that you'd better be interested in this stuff. Look at the syllabus beforehand.",
    "An ambitious course that combines a theoretical study of Soviet avant-garde movements and poetry, study of emigre literature, and practices of Digital Humanities in Slavic Studies. Its only weakness is that it attempts to cover too much in a short period: so if your main interest is in emigre literature or avant-garde movements, perhaps it might more sense to take a more theoretical course (or at least in addition). I suggest coming to the course with a little bit of background (either technical or theoretical) so it's not too overwhelming, and getting an earlier start on the group project. Great course!"
