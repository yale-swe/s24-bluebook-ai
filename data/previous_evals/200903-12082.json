    "If I had my time again, I would probably try to get into one of the seminars. Being in a large lecture is not bad per se, but I suspect the quality of education may be better elsewhere. If you do take this course, which is understandable given how important economics is, then make sure you keep pace with the lecture. Use external resources - the textbook, the internet, your economist friends - to make sure you understand everything that the lecture is meant to have covered. Study hard for the midterm, because if you drop even a few careless marks the curve will punish you severely.",
    "This class covers essential concepts such as perfect competition and the conclusions derived there from (including an analysis from both the consumer and the supply side), long run and short run decision making, imperfect competition types, game theory and Nash equilibrium, and ending with finance and risk decisions on a personal level. If you want to learn about these perspective changing topics, take this class. You could also do worse to use this class to strictly fulfill distribution requirements. However, if you don't like Econ or aren't logically minded, you will not enjoy this class.",
    "I would recommend this class; as Berry notes, everyone who plans on voting should have taken basic economics.",
    "Not the horror story you hear about from upperclassmen. The material is dry and boring for the most part, but if you're interested in econ you have to take this, and Berry's class does about as good a job as one can with this material.",
    "I would recommend micro to students. The principles that you learn are so rudimentary and useful for so much out in the real world. More than that though, I found it to be extremely interesting and hands down the best class I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "I liked it during shopping period, but it dragged in the middle of the year, and got better towards the end of the year",
    "great intro to economics principles, not very hard",
    "It's the best intro micro class you could have...if you have a solid math background, this class will be easy; if math (like algebra) is something you struggle with, go into this class prepared to go to section. But definitely take this class...it gives a great, straightforward perspective on some real-world issues, and encourages you to think in a similarly straightforward way, which is nice.",
    "It was your standard intro econ course. I recommend taking it credit\/D though if possible...will take a lot of pressure off of you. And go to class...a lot of the answers for the problem sets come straight from class. I'd recommend it.",
    "This class is a JOKE for work. One 20-30 minute problem set a week, and nothing more. It felt like a waste of time because I had AP last year- if you can place into intermediate, I'd recommend doing that unless you want a gut class as a freshman to balance hard classes. Steve Berry was pretty good.",
    "Good intro. Really interesting and useful even if you're a non-major. The material is stuff everyone should know, and Berry does a good job of giving relatable (if really transparently conservative) glosses of how the concepts relate to current events.",
    "Would definitely recommend - a great introduction to economics that sparked my personal interest in the economy. The workload is reasonable and also reasonably challenging, but what one takes away from the class is certainly dependent upon the amount of work invested.",
    "I would recommend the class to students interested in economics",
    "It is a great class for teaching you, theoretically, how money works and I would recommend it to any other student.",
    "Econ 115 certainly does a great job of making such a large lecture course feel not so overwhelming. The TA's are very accessible and Professor Berry certainly makes the class memorable! This class is also muchmore palatable and manageable than the micro-econ seminars, which I hear move along quite quickly.",
    "Great intro econ class that can benefit a person who doesn't intend on becoming an econ major. I would suggest it.",
    "Take it if you want to be an econ major, steven berry is fun but by the end of the semseter you will want to be over with it.",
    "It's one of those classes that might not be the most entertaining, but if you want to study the more interesting parts of economics, you need to take it. The difficulty and time commitment are not that great, and if Berry is teaching it again, be sure to take it.",
    "Get a good T.A. or you're pretty much done. Also, if you want to stay awake, try eating those atomic fireball candies. Those definitely help. Not even joking.",
    "take it with berry to get a good background in microecon",
    "With this professor, a good introductory course. Does what it sets out to do--gives the student a foundation in economics.",
    "Yes. Especially if taught by Berry. This course will give you some context in which to think and talk about political and economic issues you see and hear and read about every day. It is not a difficult course if you keep up with it. The textbook is hardly necessary, so I recommend getting a used one. Every lecture was a good experience. Two thumbs up.",
    "If you want to major in Econ you should probably start with this. If you are a mathy person and want to take a course with minimal work, take this also.",
    "I'm an IS major so I needed it. I guess if anything, at least I can have a sustained conversation about Economics outside the classroom which is more than I ever expected.",
    "You should take this only if you need it for a requirement.",
    "Prof. Berry is a good lecturer. Unclear topics in lecture could be easily cleared up in section.",
    "I would recommend this to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. It provides a good intoduction to the principles of microeconomics, the instructor is funny and interesting, and the work load is rather light.",
    "Take ECON115 if you can't get into the seminar. Berry is great and does his best to make the material interesting. The class is a bit hard if you're taking it just for a QR and the curve is a little steep. However, you get out of it what you put into it. The exams are fair and the problem sets are pretty standard. Some TAs grade the problem sets much harder than others though, so beware.",
    "Econ115 is an introductory class and for me, was an experimental one also. I had never taken econ before so I really wanted to see what it's like. This particular class served those purposes well.",
    "I would recommend it to all students. This class is easier than the econ seminars.",
    "if you're good at math, you'll do fine",
    "So...this class is WONDERFUL. honestly, this is HOW an intro micro class should be taught. enough theory, enough applications. very clear explanations of EVERYTHING. prof berry is so great. ugh i actually loved this class.",
    "I would say that it is an introduction to microeconomics. I would definitely recommend it, I feel a little more informed about the world now. And I would say take it with Steven Berry.",
    "Great class, esp for a lecture class,",
    "Introduction to how perfectly competitive markets work, how decisions of consumers and firms influence the market, methods of regulation.Yes because it helps you understand basic concepts about our economy and expands your reasoning skills. But since the class goes rather fast, you should expect to study a lot to firmly grasp the concepts.",
    "If you're looking for a QR, and you think Econ will be a useful one, change your mind. I thought so too, and found it to be the least interesting class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I took this course as a Poli-Sci major, hoping to satisfy a QR with some application to my interests. Though the course is not organized extremely well and seems a bit dry at times, I am very glad to have taken it.",
    "This class is a good intro to microeconomics, but doesn't go into most of the math behind it (which is good for some, but more math could be helpful for others). Steve Berry moves pretty slowly and reviews the material from the past lecture at the beginning of each class. Be sure to take this class with others who you can work with; if you don't pay attention in lecture, it's pretty much all self-taught.",
    "Definitely take this class with Berry if you're going to take it at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend the lecture over the seminar if you have taken any econ before.",
    "This is a great course to take if you feel you'll never take another Economics class. For those who have taken Econ before and are considering the possibility of majoring in it, this course would be a good start, especially if your high school Econ class did not involve much math.",
    "Good introductory class, good amount of work, but not too much",
    "If you are looking for a QR that won't ruin your entire semester this is definitely a good choice. Berry is a good teacher, the material is definitely worth knowing and the tests pretty much only cover stuff you did in the problem sets meaning making it pretty straightforward and not that stressful.",
    "Fair overview of Economics - I learned a lot. The curve is tough though.",
    "Great class if you love econ...but If you love econ, you're probably gonna be bored because you already know the material. If you're like me, taking it on a whim, and a science major, you might consider Credit\/D\/Fail or the seminar.",
    "No I don't think this is a good class unless you plan to major in Econ.",
    "Economics 115 was very much theory based and used only the most basic of math. For a beginner in econ its perfect, unless you have taken calculus and would like to apply that toward econ.",
    "If you have any interest in market theory, in how the \"invisible hand\" is theoretically supposed to work, take this course. Some say it's just about supply and demand; it's a lot more. Sure, it's not true to the real world, but it lets you see the reasoning (or lack of it) behind a lot of real world decisions, both good and bad. And Steven Berry is wonderful: funny, interesting, and clear. Problem sets aren't bad at all; only one or two caused problems for me. If you have any interest in how economists and businesses think, take it.",
    "You should take this class, if only so that you're literate in economics. Even if you're worried about the grading (which you probably shouldn't be), take it Credit\/D.",
    "It's fine if you like econ (I knew many people who took it and decided to be econ majors because it helped them see the world differently). However, don't take it just to take it. It's not hard, but if you hate the topic, it's dull.",
    "Definitely take it!Berry is a great lecturer. I took it for a social science, but none of the math is too tough and the material is interesting enough. The problem sets aren't too bad, maybe an hour a week.",
    "If you are going to take Mirco, take it with Berry. The subject is not that great and lecture can be a bit dull at time, but professor berry is engaging overall and tries hard to give good examples of the concepts and makes the subject as interesting as it can be. The midterm and final were both fair, and it is not that much work.",
    "I would summarize Economics 115 as an interesting lecture class. I would also recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn to follow current events.",
    "Take this class it's great and fun if you know basic mathematics.",
    "Econ 115 is a tough class and I don't think you should take it just for your QR requirement. Unless you're very naturally gifted at Econ, or have taken it in high school, you will be put to work in this class. I would recommend the lecture over the seminar though. Less calculus is used in the lecture and the concepts are easier to understand, from what I've heard.",
    "if interested in economic major take this class",
    "I would only recommend this course to prospective economics majors. Do not take it just for fun, it will not be.",
    "I would recomend it because I think that the basic concepts of economics is something that everyone should know. Also, it was a fairly straightforward course with a resonable work load.",
    "I thought this class was very interesting. Berry does a fantastic job; I can see how a worse teacher could make the course very boring. The work load is very small in the lecture, you'll probably learn a bit more in the seminar.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT.",
    "Econ 115 is a generally poor class. The material is extremely easy, but it's relatively boring. The class is graded on a harsh curve, and since the material is so easy, test and problem sets become a matter of simply not messing anything up, which is frustrating.Econ 115 generally requires very little work. Perhaps half an hour per week outside of class and section. In return, the professor and TAs do very little work. There's only 2 tests, midterm and final, and the problem sets are quickly scanned and given check\/check-plus\/check-minus.If you're looking for an A, this is probably a difficult class to get it in simply because of the harsh curve. You need to be rather flawless. However, if you're looking for a class that takes up almost no time and no work, then this is a good class to choose.Econ 115 is the standard introductory microeconomics course. There's a seminar which (I've heard) is simply harder, has worse professors than Berry, and is even tougher to get a good grade in.",
    "Econ 115 is a good class to take to introduce oneself to microeconomics. The class is comprehensive and covers a lot of material. The material is very dry though, so lectures can be boring.",
    "YES, IT IS A MUST DO",
    "The strengths of the course are that Professor Berry does a good job lecturing. He covers concepts thoroughly, often reinforcing ideas graphically, conceptually, and algebraically. He also reviews the content of the previous lecture at the beginning of the next lecture, which is good for reinforcing the information. The textbook is also extremely helpful in that it explains concepts well. The problem sets were all fair in that they covered concepts that we had learned in class, and the examinations were likewise fair.I wish that the class had been more math-based and had used calculus. I was particularly frustrated often during problem sets of tests when the questions were extremely broad and concept-based rather than specific and numbers-based. Additionally, the syllabus itself did not correspond to what we were covering in class, which made it hard to follow along. The fact that the class was so big was hard, but it was still interesting.",
    "This is a good course. Steven Berry is a good lecturer.",
    "i would recommend people this course to everyone because it was very helpful and interesting.",
    "Econ 115 is a good intro economics course. Steven Berry is a great lecturer and makes the material interesting. However, it is a very large lecture and thus it can be difficult to pay attention in class. I would take it if you are interested in economics. The workload is not too bad and midterm and final were reasonable.",
    "good class-explanations of topics by Berry were very clear for the most part but don't rely on the TAs to help you very much. mine actually explained some concepts incorrectly and had to go back and correct himself later. berry is an engaging lecturer and brings in current events that illustrate concepts which is both interesting and helpful. don't have to do the reading, everything's in the lecture, though the text book is helpful for reference and definitions. problems sets aren't too challenging and don't take too long but this course does require some time and effort.",
    "Take this class! It is a very reasonable way to fulfill a QR requirement and learn something useful and interesting. Professor Berry was an excellent lecturer and covered the relevant course material very thoroughly (having the textbook is almost completely unnecessary - you will not open it and the problem sets and tests come entirely from the lecture notes). The problem sets were fair and prepared us well for the midterm and final, both of which were quite reasonable. I highly recommend this course; it became one of my favorite classes during the semester.",
    "If you're at all interested in intro econ, take this. Fantastic professor. Very little work - you can do the problem sets in the 30 min before class - and a great introduction to economics. The one problem: the material is wayyyy too easy, and you move through it at a snail's pace. Don't worry - this won't challenge you.",
    "Take this course for two reasons. First, it is not as hard as people tell you it is. You don't need to worry about it kicking your ass. Second, it gives you a really good understanding of how the world works that you will not otherwise get.",
    "An econ lecture. Take it if you want to know about microeconomics!",
    "Its Microeconomics. It will be a bit boring at times, but its worth it.",
    "Yes.I hadn't taken Econ in high school, so I was a bit worried...but the course itself is very manageable (if you spend some time catching up with the pace).",
    "Like many freshmen, I faced the choice between this course and the seminar format. Both have pluses and minuses. This course was helpful for me as a relaxed introduction to the field of economics. The engagement that students experience in the seminar is greater, but if you aren't yet sure of your interest in economics, I would recommend this class. Plus, taking the largest class at Yale is a worthwhile experience and Berry is as good an economics lecturer as you'll find.",
    "Intro econ.",
    "An introduction to microeconomics.",
    "This is a great course to take for supplementary knowledge. Because the work load is small, it is easy to learn a lot from the class without feeling consumed by it.",
    "Econ 115 is a good survey course to figure out if you want to pursue economics. For me, the class made me realize I didn't want to pursue economics. The material was pretty dry, and not hard to follow, but there is a lot of material that needs to be memorized for the midterm and final. Take this course if you think you might be interested in econ, but don't expect something really exciting. Prof. Berry was a great lecturer and really made the information as interesting as possible.",
    "A great class to take regardless of whether you plan to major in Econ or not. Professor Berry is very engaging and will make you want to attend class even when the most boring subjects are being covered!",
    "I would recommend this class as I feel economics is something that is pretty useful to know. Professor Berry does a really good job conveying the information as his lectures are clear. Exams are fair; do your problem sets and you will be ready. The TA's in section and the review sessions are also very helpful, so definitely go to those if you can. Even if you've taken AP economics in high school, this class really solidifies that knowledge and introduces a good many new concepts.",
    "A solid introductory econ class. Steven Berry is a great professor and makes the class as interesting as he can, even though the material can be very dry at times. A lot of people in the class have taken AP econ though which can be a little frustrating at times if you haven't, especially because the class is graded on a curve.",
    "ECON 115 is a good introduction to economics, giving you a introductory view to Microeconomics",
    "Yes, I would. I feel like I gained a reasonably good grasp of what's going on in micro econ from this class. Pray you get Jorge as your TA. He is by far the most helpful!! Don't read the textbook...it is an absolutely waste of money. Save yourself 200 bucks and completely forgo the purchase. If you're dedicated to studying what Prof. Berry writes down, you will be much better off. For your own sake, please please please use the past exams the TAs and Berry post on classesV2. There are definite patterns that they use to write each midterm and final, and if you can recognize these, you will most likely score well on both tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to other students, it's not a hard QR and it's a really interesting life skill.",
    "This course is a MUST in liberal arts education. There is no way you are going to graduate from Yale without taking an Economics course. ECON 115 will help you develop very useful skills, since it is mostly conceptual, and does not focus on math.",
    "I would say that I had a love\/hate relationship with econ. At times, I would fall asleep in lecture and be thoroughly bored and upset that I ever signed up for this class in the first place. Other times, though, I found it to be very interesting and loved Professor Berry (If you do take it, take it with him- he's hilarious). I think it got better as the semester moved on. Overall though, I think it is a great way to fulfill your QR in a way that is much more interesting than straight math. Plus, it's a good thing to learn at least a little about at some point in your life",
    "Amazing course and so enjoyable for a QR if you are looking for one. Really applicable to your every day life and fascinating in general.",
    "Absolutely. Berry is as good a lecturer as you can get. If you are a prospective econ major, this class is a must take. The seminar is iffy and harder. Don't be fooled by other comments; this class is pretty easy. Just study the practice midterms and finals. Problem sets are fine. Make sure you get a good TA; bad TAs seem abundant. Try to get Muthoni Ngata.",
    "Basic intro econ course. Take it if you have to for the major. Don't recommend this as a QR credit.",
    "I would not recommend this course, because I think the material is largely unimportant and somewhat boring. However, Steven Berry is a great lecturer, so if he's teaching it and you want an easy class that has an enjoyable professor to listen to, go ahead.",
    "Worth taking. Steven Berry is a good lecturer and the material is good to know on a basic level because of its importance in decision and policymaking.",
    "It's a good course for everyone to take, since it enables you to understand basic economic concepts that govern society. You have to take it as a pre-req for many classes.",
    "Huge lecture, and can get dull, but it's stuff you ought to know and Prof. Berry does everything in his power to make it interesting.",
    "Definitely worth taking. Professor Berry is very engaging and good at explaining things. I had no exposure to econ before starting this class, and it really changed the way I look at markets and decision-making.Lecture is not always the most interesting, but it is definitely worth attending and taking notes during. There is nothing on the tests that is not throughly covered in lecture.The exams seemed very fair. The problem sets were generally easy and took very little time.",
    "This is a good econ class, and Steven Berry is an engaging lecturer. Shop around for a good TA-- section can be really helpful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it--but be aware that it's not an easy class. I didn't have the opportunity to take any econ classes in high school and I'm really glad that I took this course.",
    "Econ 115 is a great introductory class, and definitely easier than the seminar version in terms of content. However, there is more problem sets, which is kind of annoying. Berry is a stud though, so dont let the big lecture format scare you.",
    "Take it.",
    "Microecon, except for a select few, is generally a chore. It's not all that difficult for the most part, but not particularly exciting at this level.Prof. Berry is a great lecturer, but don't be tempted to sit far away so that you can sleep- some of the concepts can seem easy at first glance but become much more clearer with his explanation.",
    "If you are not naturally math-inclined, this course could be challenging for you. Don't be fooled by the \"Introductory\" moniker. Since it is a large lecture course, it is easy to get behind and not realize it until the midterm or final. However, knowledge of basic economics is important, and this course is a necessary evil for many students.",
    "Honestly, I would say don't take it unless you are very good at math concepts. It was frutrating to me becuase it was all very theoretical, and it you don't undrestand what the letters mean, well. You don't understand what the letters mean.",
    "This is an objectively horrible course. Do not take it. No matter what you think, it will not be worth your time in the end.",
    "Boring, Boring, boring. The material itself,while I was cramming for the final, I found interesting. Berry tries hard. A different strategy might make it more interesting, but I would avoid this if I were you. ESPECIALLY if you are just trying to get a QR credit like I was.",
    "Econ 115 can be a little challenging at times but most of the material is easy to understand because it's pretty much all common sense. I would recommend this course to another student; it's a great introductory class and has made me want to take many more Economics courses.",
    "Really boring, but an easy QR. You will fall asleep in lecture, so grab a seat in the back. Problem sets\/midterm\/final are all fairly easy. If you put in a bit of effort you'll do really well.",
    "Economics 115 was challenging and students in the future should take it if they are good with quantative reasoning or plan on being and Economics major",
    "I would recommend it. Econ is something that everyone should have at least some basic knowledge of, and Berry does a great job of tying things together in Intro Micro.",
    "It's a good class, but it's not very interesting, unless you really want to major in econ, for whatever reason. If you've taken AP econ in high school, this will not be worth your time.",
    "Unless you are very interested in the subject, I would not recommend this class.",
    "This is a great intro micro course if you can't get into any of the econ seminars. HUGE class so there's less personal attention (and section is optional), but Berry is an extremely engaging lecturer and there are always TAs and econ tutors to give you the extra help if you needit. One problem set per week, which was very reasonable, and there was plenty of material (ie: old finals and midterms posted online) to help you prepare for the midterm and final.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would describe it as the baseline info you need to know for higher level econ. I wouldnt recommend this course unless you are trying to fill a math requirement or are interested in econ as a major. The information is not practical enough to take it otherwise",
    "Econ 115 is a great introduction to economics. You will learn many basic concepts and knowledge that is important to know as a citizen. I would recommend this class to anyone, especially the lecture with Professor Berry.",
    "Econ 115 is just one of those classes that you have to take, if you're in a situation that you have to take it. If you don't want to learn about the stars, then this fits your QR credit just fine.",
    "If interested in econ, this is definately the starter course for you.",
    "Yes. A great introduction to Economics. I hated this course in high school, but Steven Berry made me really like and appreciate it. It was a very fairly taught course (test\/ps) and there are no tricks, just study and do well! Should be a required course for all!",
    "Just what it says - an outline of basic microeconomics in a lecture format. Nothing too flashy, but it is definitely knowledge worth acquiring.",
    "I would definitely recommend Economics 115 to other students, with the caveat that the course can get slow at times. In the end, however, I learned quite a bit from the course and I think the greater understanding I acquired about the allocations of resources in market economies is very practical and helpful (while obviously this course provides only an introductory look into those allocations). I might also add that I took this course concurrently with cognitive science, and there was a lot of interesting overlap between the two that I found especially edifying. I think behavioral economics is becoming more and more fundamental to the economics field as a whole, and I might recommend taking the two courses together (either concurrently or at different times) to get the most out of this course.",
    "I would recommend it. It gives a great background of microeconomics and it does so in a captivating way.",
    "A survey of the main concepts in neoclassical economics (modern mainstream economics.) If you want to learn how the world actually works, this is not the field for you; if you want to have a foundation for talking with economists, not a bad choice, but unless you want it on your transcript it would probably be more time-efficient to just sit down with a good intro book and possibly an econ buddy to help you with some of the less intuitive concepts. If you decide to take it, Berry is the guy to do it with.",
    "Yes, but it is tough.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 for other students, because it was a good lecture course and Professor Berry was very engaging. I would summarize it as a course on Microeconomics with weekly problem sets, one midterm, and a final. Overall, it was a fairly interesting course and well-taught, although the material tended to be challenging, and on topics that I hadn't learned in high school.",
    "Take the freshman seminar! If not, I just wouldn't.",
    "It's a great class but tends to be boring. This is not a GUT class and you have a problem set every week.",
    "It's pretty much what you'd expect from an introductory economics course. Berry's lectures are relatively good.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. It takes studying and hard work, but it is very interesting and rewarding.",
    "Definitely tests and weeds out those who shouldn't be econ majors. Interesting, well structured, and enjoyable course. The midterm and final are easy if you study enough, go to lecture, and reviewreviewreview. Professor Berry is a delight!",
    "Yes! I took it because I had to, and it was painless. Its your basic lecture, QR, class, but you learn some real-world stuff that in the long run is actually useful in life!",
    "I definitely recommend Intro Microecon to any student at Yale. The class isn't too difficult and is really easy for a QR since only algebra is needed. Prof. Berry was a great lecturer who clearly explains concepts and then ties them to real world examples - he also makes a lot of quick-witted jokes. The lecture is boring at times due to the nature of the content, not the lecturer; Prof. Berry is doing the best he can with intro material. Everyone should take this class, regardless of their major, to better understand the influence of economics in individual decision making.",
    "I would because to have at least this level of rudimentary economics is important.",
    "Engaging material presented in a fun, relaxed, and straightforward way. Minimal work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Econ 115. It is much better than the seminars, Prof Berry is awesome, the workload is pretty easy, the tests are not that bad, and the curve helps a ton.",
    "yes",
    "For most people, it is a foregone conclusion that they will take this class, just know that it is not enjoyable in the least, simply necessary to be in IS or to be an Econ major.",
    "Its a really solid introduction. Professor Berry makes the dullest parts as interesting as possible, and you'll leave with a stronger understanding of a variety of real-world problems, and a new angle on political debates as well.",
    "I think this is a fine way to get a QR out of the way or learn a little about economics.",
    "It is not always the most interesting class but Professor Berry is great. I would recommend it, especially if you are considering economics as a major.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think that knowing some econ is very useful. Before taking this course, I was told that, being a lecture, it wasn't a good class. Maybe the smaller classes are better, but I actually enjoyed taking ECON 115 as opposed to one of the seminars. Prof Berry is a good professor, even funny at times. It's not one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, but it's not one of the worst. I've heard some people complain about the math involved in this course. If you feel comfortable with manipulating algebraic equations and drawing graphs, then you should be fine. Overall, a solid introduction to introductory microeconomics.",
    "I think every student should at one point or another take Econ 115 since it gives you a basic idea of how the economy works and puts much modern news into context. There is a midterm worth 30%, a final worth 50% and weekly problem sets worth 20%.",
    "Yes, it's a great course. It teaches you to look at problems in a new and simplified way. It changed the way I thought about public policy, foreign affairs and even time management.The only difficulty is that many people have taken it before and they already understand the material really well. so you have to do extra work to keep up with them.",
    "Econ 115 is the first choice of any econ beginner, as far as I can tell.",
    "I would recommend this class for any student looking either to fulfill a QR credit or to investigate what economics deal with. It requires no prior understanding of economic policy and gives a better understanding of what goes on in the world today in terms of money. This class is mainly weekly problem sets and lectures. The reading is completely unhelpful, but lectures are very informative and give you all the material you need for testing and problem sets. The class is entertaining, the professor is engaging, and the large lecture hall is daunting but a good experience of what college is like. The class makes you feel like you have just enough economic knowledge to understand policy, and it's a good time. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in a general understanding of microeconomic concepts. Although I think that Macro is a better summary of how our economy works, I think that it is an enjoyable Quantitative Reasoning course. You just have to be a self-motivated student who will attend and pay attention in a large lecture.",
    "I would recommend it only because its a pre-requisite for certain majors and its an easy QR credit but other than that i woudln't",
    "It's a pretty decent course. Not too difficult, and you get a decent introduction to basic microeconomic principles, but don't expect anything too applicable in the real world.",
    "Yes, and take it with Steve Berry.",
    "?The Idea of Economics 115\u0094 ; Not much math, not much economics. Just a review of basic assumptions. Berry makes it better than expected, but there\u0092s no need to take this class unless you want to get to the class beyond it. Even in that case you could probably do well reading an econ book over the summer.",
    "I would recommend economics 115 01 to a fellow student for several reasons. First, economics is a good topic to have some knowledge about. Second, where better to take economics than Yale and Steven Berry is a great teacher. Third, its a large class and therefore a great way to meet and bond with other students.",
    "Econ 115 is just ok. It's the biggest (or one of the biggest) lectures at Yale, so your expectations shouldn't be that high. Professor Berry is pretty good, but don't expect this course to be riveting.",
    "I would not recommend this course if you're looking for an easy QR. You have to do the problem sets, and even if you do the p-sets as a group, you're on your own for the midterm and final, and they are difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. Especially in these hard economic times it is nice to know what is going on behind the scenes. Well taught and reasonably interesting.",
    "This course is a good introduction to microeconomics. Steven Berry is a great professor, and he makes the class a bit more interesting with the occasional humorous comment. The class is based off of weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final. The tests are pretty fair.Attendance at a weekly section is optional, but can be helpful if you have any questions.Otherwise, if you have a general grasp of the material and have no questions, it may be a waste of time.I would recommend taking this class. It teaches you the important basics of microeconomics that every educated person should know.",
    "It's one of those classes that everyone takes because they have to. That said, I would recommend it. It's not that bad, just a good class that has basics underlying many other disciplines. Take it with Steven Berry; I cannot imagine surviving it otherwise.",
    "Yes, because it's a prerequisite to a lot of other courses. I'd definitely recommend it iftaught by Steven Berry.I'd also mention that they won't need the textbook if they plan to attend lecture. And that section is pretty much worthless.",
    "Basic microeconomics course, taught from an (easy) intermediate micro textbook. Very, very large class, so try to stay awake! Make sure you understand how to do the problem sets and do the practice exams. I would recommend the course to any undergraduate (as long as Berry's teaching it!). Berry shows you the importance of an understanding of economics, and how a lot of the world's problems stem from a lack of that understanding.",
    "Microecon covers a few basic models of microeconomics. From supply and demand to monopolies to risk taking and investments, you get a great basis for organizing your own life as a consumer and also if you were to start your own small firm. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "I took the course because I thought it would be good for me to have a background in the basics of microeconomics. I would recommend the class to another student for the same reason.",
    "My recommendation for the course depends on the professor, because I think that makes a big difference. Steven Berry was great. I really think economics is important to understand, so from that level I recommend the course, but it's definitely one to shop to see how lectures are. Section is optional, but you will go if you want to do well, unless you, like, read the book or something.#1 overall recommendation? Don't go it alone. If you don't have friends in the class, make them. Not hard in a lecture that enrolls 1\/8 of Yale at a time.",
    "ECON 115 is a good introduction to the basic principles of microeconomics. It covers the major topics well, though it definitely could have been sped up in some places. The problem sets were fair, the midterm was not too hard, the final was harder (though still not terribly difficult). Curve is decent for an intro class, so if you care AT ALL about what you get in the class, take the lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because of the useful information that it teaches, but I would careful with the curve.",
    "Everyone should take an intro econ class, so suck it up and take this one. The psets aren't that hard, it counts for a QR and the lectures are relatively interesting-- recommended.",
    "This was a good introductory level Economics course. It covers the basic topics of Microeconomics. The topic itself is pretty dry, but the concepts can be pretty interesting. It was very well taught, even as a very large lecture class. I would definitely recommend taking this class. It teaches a lot of basics that are essential to many majors and being an informed citizen.",
    "Econ 115 is a very interesting class that will help one better understand current economic issues. I would recommend the lecture with Steven Berry, as he does a great job lecturing and TAs are available to answer questions. The class presents many fundamental theories of microeconomics in a manner that someone without any background in economics, but with a little background in calculus, can clearly understand.",
    "I would suggest for another student to shop this class. This class is in no way particularly easy but there is a huge class to help you through it when you are struggling. I am really on either side of the fence about economics but if you are interested in it, try shopping it",
    "It is hard if you have never taken Economics and pay attention in lecture to what he says not only the slides.",
    "I would recommend it if you're going to be an Economics major or if you have a real passion for the subject, otherwise, find an easier QR to take. I felt like Econ was a class you should take no matter what major you are but really it's not. You work very hard and in the end I still don't feel like I have an incredible grasp on the material.",
    "I would recommend Berry's course to another student.",
    "Yes I would definitely reccomend the class because it is extremely interesting, well taught, manageable, and doesn't make you fall asleep.",
    "Absolutely not. Unless you have taken AP Econ and want an easy A, take it. Actually don't: you won't learn anything and you'll continue the trend of people thinking this is a reasonable course.",
    "I would recommend taking this course, especially with Berry.",
    "I would recommend they take the course if they felt Econ could be a strength of theirs. otherwise, it is a really hard course.",
    "This is an interesting introduction to economics, useful for people who have little or no background in economics. I would recommend this course to both people who think they might be interested in majoring in something to do with economics and people who just want one class in the subject.",
    "I would recommend the lecture if you can learn in a large class and don't want to to feel under pressure the whole time. Professor Berry is really great and you should take it with him. The book is not very helpful and the workload is not too bad. Do the problem sets and do them well, the midterm and final are pretty fair. Come to class, because everything you need to learn is told during lecture. The TA's vary but Myrto K is really great! Study your notes weekly for an hour and you will be fine! I would recommend the class to everyone, since we should all know about economics.",
    "A great class with a fantastic lecturer (Steven Berry). But a few words of warning - the class is huge. There is no one to keep you awake. If you do not force yourself awake, you can and will fall asleep. For the most part, this is okay. But make sure you have a few friends who you can run information by, to get the parts of the lecture you may have missed.",
    "I found this course very difficult to follow particularly because the lectures were so big and impersonal.",
    "If you are interested in Econ, yes!I got 5s in AP Economics Micro\/Macro in high school and this course was still relatively interesting; it has a lot more algebra than at the high school level.",
    "Definitely take it. Great knowledge base and very well taught.",
    "ECON 115 provides an introduction to supply and demand curves and to the theory of how consumers and firms make decisions before the midterm. Topics after the midterm include entry and exit of firms, monopoly and oligopoly, externalities, and savings, insurance, and risk. Prof. Berry has a sense of humor and there seems to be a funny moment in every lecture, but it is not exciting material. If you are taking it only because you feel it is knowledge you should have, maybe you shouldn't take it, but if you are thinking about an econ major or a career where you think this knowledge will be useful, then you'll find the material clearly presented and well organized.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student, but they must know it is a difficult class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student who wishes or is thinking about pursuing economics in college.",
    "This is a good basic intro to microeconomics. The problem sets are pretty easy and you only have one midterm and a final, and both only cover material learned in class. Professor Berry does a good job of making a potentially boring lecture class interesting.",
    "It's a good way to learn micro in a not hugely competitive or stressed environment, but you'll have to rely on your own studying and your friends to get through it. Take the course, but don't do the reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for students, for though it will probably not make your top-ten courses list, a basic understanding of economics is imperative for modern life. That is what this course apportions to those who take it.",
    "Econ 115 is a good introduction to economics. Steven Berry is a pretty good lecturer and makes a sometimes dull subject more bearable. If you are going to take Intro Micro, take it with him. The problem sets aren't too difficult - they usually take about two hours to complete. So many people take this class that it's easy to find somebody to help you out on a problem.",
    "Great class. Take it even if you aren't considering the major. Every congressmen and informed voter needs to hear what Berry has to say.",
    "Funny and charming professor. Lots of in-class jokes. Lots of graphs. No reading. Two hours of homework. Concepts that will make you think about economics--like, why is this can of potatoes so expensive?--even months after class.",
    "An introduction to the basic concepts of supply and demand, taxes, firms, pure public goods, and insurance: how and why they work. These concepts are crucial to being a good citizen. I recommend the course, but if you aren't intending to major in Econ, I suggest taking it Credit\/D. It's much easier to just learn something about economics if you aren't worrying about your grade, and just learning something seems to be a solid goal for this course.",
    "I would recommend this course only to potential economics major (to test the waters) and those who have a strong disposition towards these concepts (or know what they're getting themselves into). I found the material unsatisfying, and the concepts I learned were of questionable significance to my life. A less theoretical approach with a broader focus on comprehending financial transactions and perhaps even a little bit about navigating markets\/investments would have been preferred.",
    "It is a big class with 300+ students. So, it is important to make sure that you seek help outside class if you have difficulty understanding concepts in one-way lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class as it touches on the major points needed to pursue a basic education in microeconomics, but the fact that this course dodges the fact that calculus exists and is often useful in discussing rates of change galled me to no end. Overall, the workload was never particularly onerous, and both the TFs and the professor were very effective. Do not expect to need the \"assigned\" textbook though; after it confused me in the first week, i never opened it again and did well in the course.",
    "Only take it if you are looking at majoring in Econ or need it as a pre-req. Didn't enjoy it.",
    "If you go to class\/section, the problem sets will be a breeze, and you will do fine. If you don't, you'll struggle.",
    "Econ 115 is a lecture introduction to the principles of microeconomics. It can be boring, but it does give you a framework for understanding many hot economic issues; I use it as a foundation for reading the news and evaluating policy now. During the course, I wouldn't have recommended it, butlooking back, I think it is valuable to anyone interested in policy or other human activity.",
    "Yes I think this course has knowledge that every college student should know. At least having this introductory background in economics is very important.",
    "I recommend this course to any student considering taking an economics course. The work load is manageable and Steven Berry does a great job explaining things.",
    "It's a great intro class and I would definitely. Steve Berry is a great professor and the material isn't that hard either. The only thing you have to notice is that the curve is pretty hard, so have to do well on the exams if you don't want to end up with a B.",
    "It is a good class to take if you think you are interested in the subject of economics and in order to have basic knowledge about economics, but class at times can be a little boring or move a little slowly.",
    "Pretty hard, and very few chances to prove yourself (1 midterm, 1 final). However, if you like the material take the class.",
    "I wouldn't say that I always enjoyed the class, but I'm glad I took it especially since I knew almost nothing about economics before. It takes you through the basics of basic microeconomic concepts in a relatively painless manner.",
    "I will recommend the course to those who have some interest in economics. I don't think it is the best choice as an easy QR course.",
    "Econ 115 is an introductory class that gives you a basic understanding of microeconomics without using calculus. I would recommend this class to another student, because I think it is a good way to start economics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was an excellent introduction to microeconomics.",
    "Take it! You don't know if you like or dislike Economics until you take a course, and this course is the first in the sequence. The way the course is taught is a reason to take it, but if you have even the remotest interest in business, you should definitely look into it.",
    "Berry was an incredibly dynamic lecturer, and made the somewhat longer (hour-and-fifteen minute) lectures pretty enjoyable. He taught the material pretty straightforwardly, and overall there wasn't much work (a relatively easy problemset a week and a midterm and a final). My one word of advice is DON'T buy the textbook. I only used it essentially to look up definitions for the problems sets and to clarify three or four concepts, all of which could have been done online. Overall, however, it was an INCREDIBLE waste of money and not worth it.",
    "It's basically AP Microeconomics taught at Yale, and consequently, if you've taken it in high school, the class will be a cakewalk. I only took Macro, and was able to survive the first six weeks without really paying attention; I'm sure someone who took Micro could do so for the entire semester. Berry is a good professor (though his inflection is kind of annoying at times), the sections are minimal and easy, the problem sets and tests are simplistic, and the curve is less punishing than it used to be. It's essentially a run of the mill introductory course- not good, not bad, but a bland vehicle for introducing the topic. I guess you should take it if you are interested in economics or need an easy QR; otherwise, it isn't a particularly engaging course to take on a whim."
