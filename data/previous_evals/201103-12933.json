   "comments": [
    "Take this class! Awesome teacher and you get to learn some interesting stuff. not hard, great for non-science majors.",
    "A good basic science to take for non-science majors. Not too much work and pretty enjoyable even for a non science lover.",
    "A good class, I would recommend it.",
    "A fantastic course. Highly recommended!",
    "Take it. Its interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to non science majors.",
    "If you're looking for an easy SC with not too much work and interesting lectures, take this course! You've probablyheard about a lot of the material in high school or being covered in the media, so you'll have some awareness of what the course is about.",
    "Not a gut, but a great way to fulfill science credit.",
    "Definitely take it. It's kind of boring but it's really easy and interesting if you're into Astronomy and stuff like that. I found it really boring but I got an A and it wasn't hard compared to my other classes at Yale. But its actually pretty hard to get an A in this class. Very easy to get an A-... Pretty interesting stuff though if you like outer space and crap like that.",
    "Take it! I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed learning about the material and simply coming to the lectures. Plus, the guest speakers were usually incredible to listen to!",
    "This is a great class. I stumbled upon this class just looking to get a science credit, but I ended up loving it. The material is interesting and cutting edge, and the professor is fun, engaging, and curious professor. She switches up lecture formats to keep us interested and brought in a lot of really cool guest lecturers who are top researchers in their fields. I would absolutely tell everyone I know looking for a science credit to take this course. While I wouldn't say it's a gut, it's not my hardest class; I definitely worked hard, and that has paid off.",
    "This class is on the easy side. Many consider it to be a gut. However, if you choose to put in extra effort, you'll get extra learning out of it. Professor Fischer is incredibly nice and understanding, and the speakers she brings in (on a weekly basis) are consistently at the top of their fields.",
    "Definitely take it. I wouldn't say a total gut (though somewhat, I guess) - you have to get a 96 to get an A, which in a memorization-based class isn't easy. Prof. Fischer is incredible and doing pioneering work in the exoplanet field. You'll cover all sorts of interesting topics along the way. Highly recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this course. If you are not a science major this class is great because you learn a lot but it is not as tedius as alot of the other science classes at Yale.",
    "I highly recommend this class for science and non-science majors alike.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 130 to all students who are either non-science majors looking for a science credit or students who are interested in majoring in astronomy.The workload is very manageable and the material taught is more interesting than other astronomy courses. There are two exams, a 3-5 page paper, in class discussion questions and 5-7 homework assignments. Make sure you attend class however because attendance is mandatory and counts for about 16% of the final grade. Professor Fischer also invites other famous astronomers from SETI and the writers of the two coursebooks for guest lectures. Students can even sign up to have lunch with them. Overall its a great course!",
    "topics in the search for extraterrestrial life. it's very basic and you need to memorize a lot of things - worse than high school",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Astronomy but not an major.",
    "yes. interesting introductory course.",
    "Great course. Take it if your interested in astronomy at all and you need the sci credit. It's not really that much work.",
    "I would recommend astronomy 130 to another student because it is interesting, yet not too difficult.",
    "If they want to learn about the universe definitely. It depends on what they want to learn.",
    "yes, unreal course",
    "A good course for the satisfaction of the science requirement. Space is awesome.",
    "This is the ideal science class for those looking to fulfill the Sc distribution requirement. Interesting and engaging, this lecture course mixes astronomy and biology in a way that appeals to a large number of students. Professor Fischer is great, too.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. It is a really fun class, in my opinion. As a non-major, it is not too easy, not too hard. It's just at the right difficulty level where you can learn without being too stressed. And if you really put some effort into it, you can actually learn a lot."
