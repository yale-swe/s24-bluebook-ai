    "Professor Avilez is the absolute best. Do know that students often end up leading class discussion due to the group project portion--I wish I got to have more of him leading. There are a lot of readings--too much, really, and they do seem a bit repetitive. That being said, I got a reasonable amount out of it, and it can definitely be a fun course. May be a lot of overlap if you've already taken a ton of AfAm\/WGSS type courses.",
    "Take this! Everybody in the class loved it!",
    "Absolutely take this class! The thrust of the course is a unique one in the English department and attracts students from all disciplines. We covered a lot of very important sociopolitical topics of relevance in today's world but from the perhaps atypical lens of literature. Each week's topic was narrow enough to allow for enjoyable, focused discussion. And Prof. Avilez is wonderful! He's so supportive of everything people say in class. He'll never shoot down anyone's comments, but rather will audibly voice support. He's a real gem that Yale is fortunate to have. Also, the workload is great! Just one 6-8 page paper on basically anything you want, a group presentation (which entails a paper), and a 6-8 page final pr\u00c3\u00a9cis on any critical text you've read that somehow relates to the class. (You could also do a project or research project for the final.) This relatively light workload allowed students to be able to really engage with the weekly readings and prepare for seminar discussion without having to divert some of that effort to multiple papers. Overall, a fantastic class.",
    "This is a wonderful class, especially if you're interested in the radical movements of the 1960s and 70s. Avilez is great, but what you get out of this seminar really depends on the other students. When I took it, a lot of students were not so well-versed in queer and feminist theory, which made the discussions about feminist and queer texts frustrating. All in all, though, a great class.",
    "American Literary Nationalisms is surprisingly comprehensive and rich course with a huge variety of topics concerning social movements, activism, and identity politics. It's a decent-to-heavy amount of reading (a novel + 1-3 articles a week), but it's good reading and you can still participate even if you don't finish all of it. The students who take the course tend to be pretty self-selecting, so discussion is always really excellent. Would definitely recommend if you have an interest in organizing or the 60s, 70s, and 80s.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course: This course is a fantastic discussion course. The work load is manageable and you will learn a lot about different movements and people groups. Its strengths include insightful discussion, a broad spectrum of reading material, and liberal writing assignments.",
    "This class is wonderful. Professor Avilez makes each class a fresh and enjoyable experience. If the syllabus interests you, you will have a great time discussing the large amount of material that the course covers. There is a good bit of reading to do in order to stay up to date, but there is little work beyond that. Definitely take this course if you think its themes are worth discussing - they are.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. It deals with the queer, Chicano, American Indian, etc. nationalist movements of the mid to late 20th century. The readings and subject matter were super interesting, and it was an important class for me because I had never had the chance to cover most of these movements in a class before. Avilez is one of the best English professors at Yale, so don't pass up the chance to take a class with him. He even took us out for lunch at Thali Too for our last meeting. Even though the class was 2 hours long, it often felt too short because of the great conversations we would have. I thought the workload was pretty chill for a writing credit: about a novel a week (though the amount of reading just depends on the week), one 5 page analytical paper, one 6-8 page book summary, and a group project that involves leading the discussion for the week and writing a 5 page summary of the presentation. Basically, the class was great.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot about American history, particularly about minority movements and the way in which they intersect. Avilez covers a lot of topics in this course that I feel every every educated person should know about.",
    "The course material and reading list for AmLitNat is amazing and Professor Avilez is simply astounding! If you enjoy the material you'll adore the course. If youget in, I'd highly recommend that you consider taking it. As with most seminars, however, your experience will be shaped largely by your classmates and their contributions. Because the class is cross-listed as an English course, keep this in mind if you don't like English jerks.",
    "Take this course. It's so much more than an English class--you will leave each week feeling like you've enhanced your knowledge of American history, pop culture, and cultural narratives (whether in the form of novels or personal essays or films). Professor Avilez is incredibly knowledgeable and keeps the class focused and lively. The way he synthesizes texts from different genres and perspectives each week is enlightening and so interesting. You'll analyze music videos and poemsalongside novels or hefty nonfiction pieces. The reading for this class is heavy, but most of it is so interesting that you'll feel motivated to do it. You'll have just three major writing assignments\/projects over the course of the semester, so that will balance the workload. Professor Avilez is really encouraging of your ideas, so you can more or less turn each assignment into something meaningful to you and get a lot out of it. If you're looking for an American lit req or just a fun literature course, take this one.",
    "ENGL 339 is a course that surveys the many American social movements that have taken place from the sixties onward. Work includes a group project, extensive class participation, weekly readings, film viewings, and papers. I highly recommend this course (even for students outside of the listed majors).",
    "I am a graduate student in a field that does not directly relate to the class, and so it would really depend on my peer's individual goals\/interests.",
    "I would recommend this class for its sheer breadth. It covers very important social movements and encourages lateral thinking."
