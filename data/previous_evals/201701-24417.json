   "comments": [
    "Great class, super big time commitment sometimes too much, unexpected levels of involvement were needed.",
    "Perhaps do not make the quizzes for a grade, just for practice. I like that the course revolves around a textbook, as it makes it easier to go back and review the grammar we have learned. That being said, I think sometimes the textbooks can be confusingly formatted (such that we end up learning similar concepts spread out over several chapters) and it can be hard to tie everything together. One example of this consists of the various time constructions. In addition, I think it would be helpful if there was more actual drilling of the endings in class.",
    "I enjoyed Russian this semester, and I really feel that I'm starting to get a grasp on the language. I found it especially rewarding when we would review a certain sentence model (such as an \"if-then-because\" sentence), and then orally work through all of its variations in class. These types of exercises really helped me develop an understanding of the specific grammatical tool we were learning that day. However, as with last semester, I found the emphasis on memorization and acting to tedious, time consuming, and stressful for little benefit. Personally, I don't find memorizing poems to be a particularly effective way of learning a language when actual spontaneous dialogue serves a similar function while being far more practical."
