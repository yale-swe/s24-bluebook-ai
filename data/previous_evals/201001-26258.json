   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I thoroughly enjoyed having a variety of teaching media, e.g. film, discussion, lecture, power point, and group assignments, both of which were very effective. I also really appreciated the flexibility of the last paper and I had a blast researching and writing it!Weakeness: The first few lectures were a bit dry and I think more class discussion could be incorporated. It felt a bit like we were just providing a list of the concepts we read about in the books; I think a more detailed discussion of the concepts would have been more effective.",
    "Strengths: Diverse readings and assignments enabled us to employ the skills we had learnt in multiple ways.Weakness: Too few reflections; more would have been helpful. Also, it would have been helpful to disperse some of the more heavily weighted assignments throughout the semester.",
    "I liked the course in that it served as an interesting forum to bring students together from different academic backgrounds to study development issues. I enjoyed the sessions on Sen and the working with my group on the Ficticia project. I felt that the classes structured around the video sessions were not as fruitful as they could have been because we did not discuss issues outside of strictly the content of the video. It would have been interesting to also study some current views on development (ie. Sachs). Finally, it would have been better to incorporate more of the readings into class discussions to bring out the themes (this would not apply to the first few class sessions).",
    "Strengths: insightful analysis of health systems and their relation to human developmentWeaknesses: most of the semester, the class lacked analytical depth.The course can be improved by avoiding repetition in class of what has been read in home assignments and watched in class through videos. Instead, further expansion of the implications, shortcomings and applicability of the lessons learnt can be more useful to the students.",
    "I was unsatisfied with this course. Though some assignments were interesting and several of the readings were engaging I felt in general that the class was simplistic, unchallenging and poorly implemented.Strengths:1) The Globalization Panel activity was interesting and a welcomed change of pace from previous classes2) My classmates were interesting and involved-I regret that we weren't allowed to engage in more conversation\/discussion in classWeaknesses:1) The worst part of the class was the 3 full weeks spent watching a series of out of date, simplistic documentaries on development and economic growth. After watching the video we would spend the remainder of class regurgitating exactly what we had just viewed-there was no encouragement of critical analysis or broader discussion. Any attempts by students to enrich the conversation with questions that didn't specifically pertain to the information in the videos was discouraged. Those 3 weeks were by far the lowest point of the semester. Potentially, these videos can be made available online, or at the library so that students can watch them at home, and we can have some discussion about them in class-though the discussion should be about drawing out major themes, or raising critiques-and not a full plot summary.2) Most class discussions were limiting due to the teacher's insistence that we cover a very specific list of points. Again, there was very little constructive discussion or theoretical debate-and a lot of regurgitation. I felt that the interesting ideas and experiences of my classmates were not utilized nor encouraged, and therefore wasted."

    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0I can't really think of a weakness for Professor Ruger. She is a great instructor.The way she organized the class was very encouraging to participate in the class, and she was always providing satisfying answers for questions.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0She is a very dynamic professor with a lot of passion for her work, as well as a lot of expertise and experience to share with the class.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0I enjoyed how Jennifer brought her experiences to the classroom and used a variety of assignments to ensure students were able to employ what they had learnt in different ways.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0I felt that the instructor was a good lecturer and knowledgeable about the topics discussed during the course.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Professor Ruger is approachable and knowledgeable. However, she should provide a more challenging intellectual environment to students. Arguments in class were generally kept at a very basic level, particularly taking into account most students were graduates.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0I was disappointed by Prof. Ruger's handling of the class. I feel that she failed to engage the class effectively. The readings and caliber of students might have enabled exciting and thoughtful discussion, unfortunately I believe that the opportunity\/facilitation for such discussions was not there.I wish she had challenged us more to think critically, as opposed to re-hashing what we read in a book or saw in a video.I did appreciate her interest and passion for what she discussed-her commitment to these issues is evident."

   "comments": [
    "I would definately recommend this course. It gives a very multidimensional approach to development with a focus on health and with the class readings, discussions and exercises you learn a lot while you also enjoy it.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who have at least a basic epidemiology background (I saw a lot of blank stares from some of the Yale College students when lectures turned \"epi heavy\").You have to to be self-motivated to absorb a lot of the material and work to find unique ways to apply the new information.Overall, a very enjoyable and challenging course!",
    "Take this course if you want to develop a strong theoretical background for the social, economic and political aspects of development.",
    "I would recommend the course to students interested in global development issues.",
    "This course covers a range of themes relating to development-primarily with a focus on poverty. The class curriculum combines lecture style classes, with discussion, video screenings, and group project work\/presentations.I would not recommend this class. The format of the discussions does not suit my interest in more nuanced, critical discussion and the 3 weeks of video watching felt like a waste of limited class time."
