    "I really enjoyed this class and I really learned a lot from it. However I would have liked it more if we had more lectures from the instructor because she obviously knows a lot about her subject and I would have liked to learn more from her. I also feel like the class lost its direction a bit once the emphasis switched to student presentations. I really enjoyed working on my research but I think the class would be more coherent if there were some restrictions on the research material since at times I felt like what I am researching was not that important or valuable to my class mates because it was too personal.",
    "The sequence of readings was a bit unclear, but as a body of texts they make for an interesting read, and one that is not just pertinent to former Yugoslavia.",
    "work was comprehensive, and well conveyed through the lectures as well as student discussions. a well rounded and different kind of course.",
    "The content was an interesting mix of methodological inquiries and specific subject topics. All and all the strengths of the class lie in the ability of allowing each student to investigate their own interests. Nevertheless the rigor involved in searching for a method to conduct the research still remains the main challenge. How does one bring a creative approach to a seminar style class?",
    "This course did an amazing job of making connections between the core set of readings and content and many other areas of tension or interest today in architecture, and the interests of each student. Great course! I really enjoyed every session.",
    "The subject of the course was very clearly presented in the beginning of the class. I very much appreciated the focused nature of the material that was conveyed throughout the semester: situating the study of Yugoslav social, cultural and political ideas through the XX century."

   "comments": [
    "The course offered me a platform to pursue a subject which I have not yet had the opportunity to study. The readings, and the method of interpretation, along with visual material helped me greatly in formulating an argument.",
    "My expectations for this class were exceeded. The lectures were fantastic and discussions of the readings were always lively. Ljiljana encouraged us to explore topics beyond just those we were studying as a class; this was wonderful and something that I had been longing to see at Yale and had not encountered it yet.",
    "I had no expectations for this course as I had no ideas about what the subject matter would cover. In that case, my expectations were well covered as the course was liberating in content.",
    "My expectations were exceeded because I felt like an outsider to much of the material. However, as stated, the course and the professor transitioned well into a productive environment for us to field our own ideas and develop our research skills. This seminar was the close to the ideal seminar in terms of the way it challenged us and presented a body of material.",
    "I entered the course with the hope that I would develop a clearer understanding of the complexities of cultural and socio-political production in the Yugoslav context in the XX century. Since the material presented by Prof. Blagojevic strictly focused in the presentation of these themes, I believe that I was able to fulfill my initial expectations."

    "This course was educational in terms of Yugoslav history, politics, art and architecture. It was fabulously taught and always engaging. Ljiljana\u0092s encouragement to see these very same subject matters in architecture and cultures beyond Yugoslavia was absolutely wonderful. It was so relieving (and inspiring!) to have a professor who took what she knew, taught it so beautifully, and then inspired students to go out and apply it to one of their interests. This is the way that all classes at Yale should be taught. The school is really losing a gem in Ljiljana\u0092s departure. I am so glad to have taken this course.",
    "The value for this course was in its difference from the rest of the schools curriculum. It was great to see a class that was at times seemingly random and yet productive in this manner.",
    "This course was incredibly valuable in shedding some light on the topic of Yugoslav Architecture and more importantly allowing me to entertain a new subject with very careful eyes. The research approach was an enlightening experience that opened up a completely new set of vantage points and resources. Very few classes have had this level of inspiration - a mix of creative potentials and analytical rigors."

   "comments": [
    "The discussion and range of materials (theory, historical texts, architectural projects, films, art) presented was really nice to see. I think the way the class was framed as an analytical study of the 20th century was both unusual and interesting. 20th century is most often talked about in the context of the 2 world wars + the cultural revolution, while Eastern Europe is hardly ever talked about until 1989. This course was effective in seeing an alternative history of the 20th century, not disengaged from the one commonly talked about, but one responding to it in an alternative way.",
    "Prof. Blagojevic was always very prepared to discuss the material she presented in class. Her knowledge was naturally representative of a deep understanding of the Yugoslav cultural context, most importantly a very thorough knowledge of the architecture of Yugoslavia through the XX century. I very much appreciated the care and intensity she shared her own research with the class and her professional expertise on the subject matter."

    "There seemed to be some confusion as to the order of readings; I would recommend for the TA to scan the texts and put them in weekly order in the classes folder.",
    "I really enjoyed this course; however, I felt the class needed more direction and structure. Although it was refreshing to be able to work on my own research, the fact that we were not required to work on a project related to Modernism in Yugoslavia made it more difficult to absorb and retain the information from the readings and lectures. I think the class has to either be more general to allow for an array of research topics (i.e. modernism in the socialist world, the post-socialist city, etc) or require students to focus their research on something that relates to Yugoslavia, even if it's a loose connection.",
    "Ljiljana is extremely insightful and a great speaker. She has genuine passion in the subject matter which drew out my interest and created a space for some great work to be done in the course. I enjoyed this course and it pushed me as a researcher and thinker.",
    "Perhaps the nature of research encouraged in the class should have been more focused on the Yugoslav theme."
