    "I would recommend Math 115 to other students because it is a great class for math fundamentals. I feel like I covered an incredible amount of valuable material in this semester. Though it was my most difficult class by far, it was interesting and rewarding.",
    "International students should start with Maths 112. This course might seem a little difficult since you also need to know your material before you go to class. So revise the topic before you go to class and you might be fine.",
    "I took AB in high school and didn't expect this to be difficult. At first, it wasn't, but then it got really hard! So don't expect this to be a super easy course. You will learn a lot though and hopefully you'll get a great teacher who offers lots of office hours!",
    "If you are decided on taking Math115 Yu-Wen is the instructor you should look for.",
    "If a friend had to take 115 for degree requirement, I would definitely recommend them to take it with Yu-Wen.",
    "Many of the teachers, except Yu-Wen (who is phenomenal), I heard from other students, were not the best at all. Or very patient. Miriam is really great too though (she didn't teach this semester but just held problem solvin sessions). Math is hard. Math is even harder at Yale. I took some calc in high school, was in 120 originally, and dropped down to 115 only to discover that 115 was probably harder than 120. read the 120 book first and see if it's manageable before making sure that you want to take 115. this math is much more thorough than high school math.if you end up taking 115 after all, go to office hours (if your professor isn't good, I'm sorry; going to a better professor's office hours while being discreet is not the worst idea). READ THE BOOK helps! if you have to, look up power series online to understand what they actually are in layman's terms. even if your professor is good, go to problem solving sessions; they reinforce your calculus understanding\/thinking through problems, which come in handy. also, despite what's been said about professors, give your professor the benefit of the doubt first. professors grow and change just as you do. and a good professor for you might not be good for another. shop classes and petition to get into a class with a good professor, even if the stupid lottery doesn't give you a place. there are waitlists and some people drop out. good luck! hard course (and i breezed through calc in high school).lastly, my blurb about our teacher because she is so great:Professor Hsu is a great and experienced professor. Moreover, she is one of the kindest people I have ever met. If I could evaluate this course based only on her performance, I would give it an excellent! She explained the material so clearly in class and we all loved and appreciated how happy and energetic she was (even at 9 in the morning or even when she had a slight cold). We loved seeing her because she loved seeing us. She must have clocked in at least 7 hours every week just for office hours. When we requested more, she never said no. I think she had office hours every day (especially for the final exam, which was tremendously helpful) before each of the exams. She wanted us to understand the material and see it from all sides and through many examples. She gave us a few quizzes and that added pressure at least for me, but I don't think I would know the material as well as I do without her help or without the dread of failing the quizzes. It made me a more disciplined learner, which problem sets don't really do since people can just gets answers from others. Returning to Professor Hsu, she really cares and she really cares that we see how great and powerful Math is.PLEASE give her a place in the Math department because she is a keeper.",
    "Really depends on your teacher when it comes to math. My teacher made it very worthwhile to wake up at 8:30 every other morning for her 9 am class. You'll learn a lot from the course. But don't except the tests to be easy.",
    "I took BC Calc in high school, and did pretty well (I got a 4, and an A in the class). And I did NOT think Math115 was too easy. The material is all about the same as the BC Calc material (it actually leaves out a few BC Calc topics), but the problems in 115 are much, much harder. They're not simple pattern-recognition, straightforward problems. You really have to do some mathematical gymnastics and think on your feet. I thought this class was a lot of fun, and perfect for my abilities. From what I've heard from friends, going straight from BC Calc to Multivariable is really difficult; you have to know the BC Calc material like the back of your hand. I did not, coming into math115; now I feel prepared to take math120.",
    "Mathematics 115, Section 06 helped me review several concepts that I had previously covered in AP Calculus AB, although it taught me many new ones as well. It felt productive to review some chapters such as integration by substitution and volumes of rotated solids, but the true gem of the course lies in the ease with which new concepts are presented. Prior to taking the class, I had never before covered improper integrals, series, sequences, or surface areas of solids before, yet those concepts and more were taught in an easy and oftentimes enjoyable manner. I highly recommend this course to anyone with a previous background in Calculus who is seeking to either review previously learned material or looking to progress further in the field of mathematics.",
    "Yes, I mean, as far as Mathematics classes go, the material is practically the same. Its all in the instructor. There isn't an overwhelming amount of work in this class, but putting effort and time into it will pay off.",
    "Very helpful if you have taken calc BC before.",
    "I only took Calc AB during high school, and it seemed that most of my class had taken BC which might have added to the difficulty of the class. However, everyone thought the class was challenging. If you're looking for a QR credit, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. But if you need this for pre-med as I did, good luck!",
    "I took Calculus AB in senior year of high school, and I was a little nervous about taking MATH 115 with people who had taken BC in high school. While the course can be challenging, though, even if you're seeing the material for the first time, it's definitely do-able. The textbook is pretty well-suited for self-teaching, and Yu-Wen also does a good job in class. I found that the Psets were typically harder than the exams, except for the final. Also, it's a good idea to go the problem-solving sessions if you can make them, but it's also possible to do well if you can't. Finally, definitely take the class with Yu-Wen Hsu if you get the chance. Not only does she teach fairly well, but she also has TONS of flexible office hours.",
    "MATH 115 was a difficult course. Even if a student comes in with a thorough familiarity with algebra and earlier calculus, the new methods of problem solving can be challenging to master. I would recommend MATH 115 to another student if they can get into Yu-Wen's section. The very flexible office hours Yu-Wen offered were what kept me and many other students afloat.",
    "Basic intro math class. Most people taking it have to take it, but it can be made entertaining with a fun TA.",
    "Continuation of Calculus 1... Take it as a prereq to get to the more interesting mathematics.",
    "MATH 115 covered Integration and various integration methods, volume of solids of revolution, and series. There are other miscellaneous things thrown in there too. There are weekly psets, two midterms, and one final. If you're shopping this course because you need a QR credit, then I wouldn't recommend it unless you like math, and even then I wouldn't really recommend it unless you're good at math. Otherwise, you're required to take it, so take it. It's relatively easy if you follow the material, ask questions, and I recommend doing the practice problems to make sure you know the material."
