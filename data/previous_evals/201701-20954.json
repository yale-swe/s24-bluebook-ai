   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write effectively in Arabic.",
    "I got a lot better at conversing and writing in Arabic. Sarab is amazing at feedback. She would personally read all of our work.",
    "By taking this class my writing improved a lot, and I gained a better understanding of forms of Arabic cinema. It's better to think of this class more as an advanced language class with the theme of film, rather than a film class in Arabic, as the focus was definitely language acquisition over studying the industry. Great class though!",
    "This course provided a fantastic opportunity to develop and enhance high level writing skills in Arabic. Importantly, students were asked to write across different registers, from more informal discussion question prompts, to creative writing, to researching and writing more academic papers. This forced us to rely on more than one skillset to engage with the materials. It was also wonderful for exposure to Arabic cinema to be part of the pedagogical toolset.",
    "I learned a lot of new vocabulary from the coursework and my classmates. I improved my listening comprehension through the films and learned about various issues in contemporary Arab society.",
    "Throughout the course, I learned how to analyze movies, discuss them with peers, and then write about them creatively.",
    "Not only did I improve my writing\/reading comprehension skills - I also had the opportunity to explore with creative writing!",
    "By taking this course, I made very significant progress in my Arabic language skills, particularly in writing and speaking. Also, because this course focused on Arab films, I learned a good deal about the Arab film industry as well as the subject of matter of some of the films, such as Bedouin society in the early 20th century and the Lebanese Civil War.",
    "I got to watch a lot of fun Arabic movies, and I learned new vocabulary about how to discuss them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of HW, which is good because it improves Arabic, but Its very hard to do well while writing essays in a language you are learning.",
    "Way too many students in the class to be productive.",
    "The main weakness of this course was the workload. Too much work that had diminishing gains. I feel that an easier pace with more input by students to choose their assignments would have made for a healthier learning environment.",
    "Definite strength was the amount of conversation in the class. My writing improved a lot because we did multiple drafts of paper, so we actually looked at errors and learned what to fix. Weakness was it wasn't always decided in advance what would be due the next week; a more detailed syllabus would have been nice.",
    "The writing demands were significant. It might be helpful to give each topic\/creative writing assignment a longer arc (e.g. three to four weeks instead of two), increasing the amount of research\/film review that goes into each module, but lowering the amount of high-demand work like (e.g. short story writing) that is expected of students. Within that four week arc, students might watch two films on the same topic instead of one (perhaps one documentary and one drama) and be required to answer small prompts on each one, but only required to write a short story or research paper at the conclusion of the module. This would lower the stress on students significantly without sacrificing language contact and engagement.",
    "Great course in that it was seminar style. I didn't like that the weekly assignment was creative writing, personally. Overall my favorite Arabic course at Yale.",
    "The movies professor Sarab were very different, and so we were exposed to many different cultures through film.",
    "I wish that we had watched a movie every week instead of every other week. I also wish that we had read film criticism and movie reviews, instead of only reading informational texts. It also would have been nice to get vocabulary lists of words and expressions to listen for in the films to help our listening comprehension. Overall though, a very enjoyable class.",
    "A great course for reading and writing - I do wish that the talking parts of the class could be more interactive\/instructive as to allow students to have more opportunities to speak.",
    "This was an excellent Arabic class. The primary and most important strength of the class was that it allowed students to speak a lot, which is crucial to developing effective Arabic conversation skills. This course and the Levantine Arabic course (also taught by Professor Sarab Al Ani) are the only Arabic courses that really give students a good venue to speak in class. Also, another strength of the class was the high caliber of students in it. Some of the students had been studying Arabic for yearssome long before they go to collegeand they were an excellent asset in class because just by speaking, they taught words and phrases to the other students in the class who did not have as much experience. One small weakness for this class is that, by the end of the semester, the assignments got pretty repetitive. While I understand the instructors decision to maintain the same assignment structure throughout the whole semester (because they were all very effective at developing Arabic language skills), I think a bit of variation would have been nice (and there actually was some variation at the very end of the semester). Also, it would be nice if the class could watch more movies.",
    "I think that the course overall wasn't very challenging. The weekly written responses were helpful because they forced us to synthesize opinions and information in short paragraphs, but I thought the in class discussion wasn't at a very high level and didn't require much of us."

    "Yes! Take this to learn Arabic.",
    "yes; though only if you have a lot of time",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a serious Arabic language student.",
    "Yes, if you want to keep up your Arabic. However, you get out what you put in, and so at this level it is hard to make meaningful progress towards fluency in just one semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all Arabic learners at Yale!",
    "A fun class. We watched a range of films, including short film, documentary, and drama. We didn't watch as many movies as I would have liked, but they were all enjoyable. The assignments are reasonable - canvas discussions and creative writing assignments. We didn't read a lot of film criticism or analyze the films super deeply, but that might change in the future because Sarab is always working to improve her courses and cares about student feedback, which is great.",
    "Would recommend for students of all levels, each one has a place in the class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, provided that student has at minimum intermediate-level Arabic language skills. The speaking and writing experience that students get in this class make the class essential for any student trying to development advanced Arabic language skills by the time they graduate.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's pretty fun to watch and discuss films, and this can be a good step in learning Arabic. This was definitely the least challenging of the Arabic content courses I've taken at Yale, so if you are at an advanced level it won't challenge you that much, but it's still a good class."
