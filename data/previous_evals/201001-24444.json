    "This is a fun course about Early Modern Theater, with a good mixture of Shakespearean and other contemporary plays.",
    "Fun class. You read some quirky plays and the premise of inquiry is fascinating. Prof. Nicholson is adorable and a great mentor. Weekly reading response, read a play a week, one in-class presentation and 3 papers increasing in length and topic choice. Manageable - great seminar learning experience.",
    "Yes. You'll work, you'll learn. Just go into it with an actual education in mind, and let the competitive vibe and grade drama roll off your back.",
    "A survey of early modern English dramas with focuses on \"otherness,\" foreign locales, exploration and contamination.",
    "Absolutely take it! This was my favorite class this semester. The class deals with otherness --what it is to be a Jew or a Moor or a Turk or a woman--in these early modern plays, which is a really interesting focus for analysis. The plays are all awesome (with the possible exception of A Christian Turn'd Turk), and Professor Nicholson is really helpful and energetic.",
    "Yes! Take a class with Prof. Nicholson - you will not regret it! In addition, this is a pretty interesting way to knock out a third of that pre-1800 requirement. Everyone knows Shakespeare, but there are so many contemporaries of that time period!",
    "As far as pre-1800s go, this one is pretty ideal in terms of workload and interestingness of the material.As someone who is interested in early modern theater specifically I found the focus on otherness a bit tiresome, although the course is also interested in systems of economy, religious conversion, etc.Overall, as with all seminars, be sure you have a good group.",
    "This course presents a way to approach several early modern plays that may not be commonly associated in another course on Shakespeare, Marlowe or Jonson. Nevertheless, the course was always engaging. You cover a play a week, so there is always stuff to talk about.",
    "The syllabus is really good. Professor Nicholson is also very very knowledgeable and very available to help students outside of class. Send her emails.",
    "A play a week. A presentation. Three papers Weekly posts to a forum (informal, but still a little stressful.) All in all, though, a totally manageable workload.",
    "I took it for the pre-1800 credit. I don't particularly love things of this time, but it was interesting enough."
