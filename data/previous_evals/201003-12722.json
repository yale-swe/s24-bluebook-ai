   "comments": [
    "I would, it's a straightforward class with no tricks, surprises, or extremes.",
    "This class is disorganized, and incoherent at times. Without Doug Rae, the curriculum is a mish-mash of information, and you won't learn anything critical about urban studies. I don't recommend this to anyone who is thinking about taking it for the sociological aspects. It definitely shouldn't be listed under many of the departments that it is. After a semester of attending almost every lecture and skimming most readings, I haven't really learned anything substantial.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject who is looking for a real, classic lecture course. It is less work for a lot of knowledge. I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "I thought this would be a great interdisciplinary class, but it's not really that interdisciplinary. If you don't like architecture, you're going to be bored. If you want to learn about urban studies as a whole instead of New Haven, you'll probably be disappointed but won't do too badly. The lectures are interesting but the reading is disconnected (and there's a lot of it) and the power points are just compilations of images with no names or explanations. Also, some of the assignments are unnecessarily frustrating, like requiring technology that computers don't really have. MAKE USE OF OFFICE HOURS, Rubin is very interesting and always willing to help.",
    "Manageable workload and really interesting class. Basically sums up how American cities were created in the 20th century.",
    "interesting class not very much work. pretty easy grading.",
    "I would recommend ARCH 385 to students looking for an introductory course to urban planning. Professors Rubin and Plattus do an excellent job of explaining and showing the organization\/development\/evolution of cities ranging from New Haven to Phoenix to London. Despite being an art history major, I still found the course extremely valuable--it has made me view the environment we live in in a completely new way. That might sound dramatic but really only reinforces how important it is to be aware and appreciative of our surroundings. The final section of the course on green architecture and sustainability was particularly interesting.",
    "Yes. Definitely. Interesting topic for anyone who has lived in an American city. Not a lot of work and lecture isn't bad.",
    "Nope. I thought it was a horrible class that taught next to nothing: I have a better grasp of New Haven or American urban history, but that was from the first week or two of the course. The rest was a waste of time.",
    "it is a nice course, there are some cool themes- mainly just a bunch of overly academic looks at society and urban spaces. I mean no one really has a grasp on urban planning, so they just guess at it and use vague words. not a ton of work, but you have to speak the language of overly academic if you want to relate. Cr\/D and you will love it.",
    "The lectures weren't the greatest, and having two professors meant that nothing ever seemed continuous. I suspect the fact that it's cross-listed in so many departments was part of the problem. It's not hard at all, but it's not a gut. Attendance is helpful unless you're doing Community-Based Learning--in which case the lecture\/section\/reading are entirely pointless. Since I was doing CBL, I didn't actually do the readings or take the final, so I don't know how necessary they were. Either way, there seemed to be a lot of reading--way more than you would expect for a history lecture.",
    "Pretty relevant class. Provides an interesting lens on the state of society. A good 4th or 5th class.",
    "Great course if you are interested in Architecture and its influence in the development of cities.",
    "Take this class! It's incredibly interesting. You learn so much about the evolution of cities across America, and you think about a variety of topics in a new way.",
    "A qualitative approach to the development of American cities, first charting the eras of city growth and the philosophies and politics of city development, then looking at topics in the post-industrial city. If you'd like a better grounding in New Haven history and some light reading in urban studies lit, it's a good option. If you're looking for incisive criticism of modern urban planning or seminars in which students think about New Haven beyond College, Chapel, and Howe, take a higher-level urban studies course.",
    "It is a great course that covers a variety of topics that have affected cities in the past two centuries. It has some focus on New Haven in the early half of the course, then covers a lot of other cities.",
    "No. The course is very poorly taught. The readings are things you might've read just in passing; there's nothing in this course that you could not have learned by reading the newspaper or some wikipedia articles.If the course were structured better and the lectures had more guidance, then this course has the potential to be great.",
    "A good overview of urbanism in the US over the last few hundred years. Just 2 short papers (4 and 6-8 pages) and a final. A lot of reading which isn't necessary to do all of",
    "Awesome class with 2 great professors.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have interest in New Haven, or the development of cities. It was interesting most of the time, and the readings were pretty fun.",
    "It's a great way not only to learn about how cities work, but also to think about the use of space in a new way. The projects are interesting, too!",
    "ARCH 385 is an interesting class about the history and development of New Haven as an American city. It starts will the laying out of the 9-square grid and brings us all the way to the present and future. I enjoyed learning about the city in which I live and, for that reason, would recommend this course to another student. However, if you are deciding between this and another class you really love, this course could be skipped.",
    "It's not so bad. Take it if you want a class that's not too much of a commitment. You can either put in consistent small amounts of work or just do bursts for the midterm and final.. not a big deal. It's interesting material but not always interesting in the way it's taught.",
    "This course was extremely informative and well structured. It gave a comprehensive history of New Haven and other cities around the world, yet also had students step back and judge the learned material rather than simply accepting it as truth.Highly recommend it.",
    "It was a good class, but it has been hyped up to be more than it currently is (no more Douglas Rae). Sociology is not a big focus of the class; it is cross-listed in too many things to really be focused on anything, actually.",
    "Take this class. It's one of the most applicable courses you can take - honestly, anyone who lives in a city should take this class. It's very low-key in terms of the work load, but it's SO interesting. Definitely a wonderful introduction to urban studies.",
    "Yes, Plattus and Rubin are a dream team. Just be aware that both professors come from an Urban Studies\/Architecture background, so the lectures heavily draw from those subjects. Talk about whatever you like in section, though.",
    "I was a little disappointed in this class, which had gotten incredible reviews and seemed good at the beginning. If Doug Rae is one of the professors next time, I would probably recommend it. Without him the other two seemed a bit lost and got overly repetitive and focused on architecture, not really branching out in terms of topics or perspectives. Attendance at lectures declined steadily throughout the semester. I do have a better understanding some general themes and urban trends and can look at streets differently, which I definitely appreciate, but am not sure it was worth it.",
    "This course is full of incredibly interesting material and it has so much potential. However, despite working in a somewhat chronological fashion, it feels disjointed and that is VERY confusing as a student. I really wanted to love this course, and while I loved a lot of the material, I found the course to be an overall disappointment.",
    "I would definitely recommend New Haven the American City to any student who wants to gain a better understanding of Northeast history. As a Californian, I found the topics fascinating and novel. We also learned some interesting case examples about New York and New Haven, especially in terms of sustainability, Yale history, and green space.",
    "Yes - if you are interested in the history of urban planning and really want to learn about the history of New Haven",
    "Take it. Its not a lot of work, the lectures are interesting, and the assignments are pretty fun to do. Some of the material feels a bit repetitive in the second half of the course, but you learn a lot, and its not hard to do well.",
    "Great course. Almost no work& interesting lectures.",
    "Yes take it the class is easy and interesting. It's pretty cool to get to learn about New Haven.",
    "Fantastic lecture, straightforward, but making explicit issues that we all deal with every day. Assignments are easy and enjoyable, and you can spend more or less time on them depending on your interest.",
    "More work than I originally thought. Still a good class.",
    "New Haven and the American City is an interesting course spanning the entirety of New Haven history and providing brief glimpses into the development of other cities in the US (and sometimes beyond). Each course was packed with information and image slides...to the extent that both professors regularly went over the time allotted for lecture. The readings are sometimes excessive (2 or 3 readings, 60+ pages each per night plus a couple of 40+ chapters in the course book) and almost impossible to read in a timelymanner. However, lecture covers the main points of the readings and more pretty well. There are two papers\/projects requiring you to dive into city projects and use a variety of resources. The final is a series of ID's and essay questions.",
    "Take it.",
    "Take it! Great intro to urban studies and you get to learn a ton about New Haven. Also not much work at all",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to everyone! The nature of the course is that it tackles the broad subject of urban studies from so many perspectives that it would be interesting and helpful to a student of any major.",
    "Yes! Lectures were always interesting although readings got a bit dry. I really feel like I learned a lot about the city that I didn't think about\/notice before.",
    "Yes. It is a very interesting class and you will learn a lot about the city that you live in. It can get repetitive later in the course though.",
    "YES. It's great to learn more about where you live, and cities in general.",
    "Absolutely I would recommend it because it will forever impact your approach to the city.",
    "New Haven and the American City is a good history of American urbanism, and a good overview of where we are now, and what is going on now. it's not at all rigorous, there isn't much asked of you in the class, and the assessment of things can seem really cursory. I would say it's a good introduction to urban studies, but unfortunately all of Yale's urban studies coursework is just a broad overview like this, and in that way the course really turned me off of urban studies. Its trajectory mirrors all the urban studies courses - but it may have the best perspective. So take one, and take this one. It's informative, interesting, fun, and not a lot of work.",
    "Definitely a good class, that covers some very interesting topics.",
    "Even for an urban studies student, I would not recommend this class. Read Doug Rae's book and think about New Haven in the context of themes you've learned in other classes. Do not spend a semester scratching your head about the relevance of New Haven and the American City. The class has a lot of the raw material, but not enough effort was put into organization. The students are the ones who suffer for this.",
    "This is a course I think most Yale students should take. It is very informative of the city, its culture, its politics and its history. Going through this course has helped me understand a lot more about new haven and the different areas of it. No one should go 4 years at yale without knowing some of this information.",
    "Great course, definitely take it.",
    "Great. Super, super easy if you have taken any other classes in urban history\/planning at Yale.",
    "This is a gut. I took it credit\/D and tried really hard to get like a C, but I kept getting A-'s on everything. yuck. I learned some interesting things and it may affect the way I interact with New Haven in the future. The subject matter is fascinating even though the lectures were a mixed bag (Rubin was quite good, Plattus not so much).Great 5th credit, easy and pretty interesting SO credit. Only take it credit\/d if you literally are going to do no work for it, because even then you'll still get like a b or b+.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's very image-focused and has encouraged me to consider physical space and the reasons for buildings more than I ever had before. You get a survey of New Haven's history, urban planning history, and sustainable\/green design all in one.",
    "I would recommend this class. This course was interesting and taught me A LOT about New Haven and cities in general. I think it is extremely valuable to understand this city that we're living in for four years. The course really brought to mind some things about urban development I've never considered before. It got a bit repetitive by the end though. Overall, not too much work.",
    "okay if you are interested in the material",
    "Great course that really informs your knowledge and perception of the built environment around you at Yale and in cities at large. Should take this class regardless of what your major is.",
    "Take it if you're looking for an interesting lecture class about the growth and lives of cities.",
    "Yes",
    "Great survey course on urban studies. Easy 5th class. Fun. Everyone should take it.",
    "I recommend this class because of its interesting, interdisciplinary nature. It's not quite a \"gut class,\" but it's a great class to sit back, listen to the lecturer, and just learn.",
    "New Haven is a must for every Yale student. I've learned so much about our city and even our school. It has really changed my interpretation New Haven, Yale, and their shared history.",
    "This was an enjoyable and laid back course. Overall, the workload was very manageable. The lectures can be a little cryptic, but I think that this is a result of the ever evolving field of urban studies. To be honest, during the course, I didn\u0092t think that I was learning that much. But when it came to the exam, I realized that I did have a decent grasp of how American urbanism has functioned.",
    "Go sit in on the first 6 or 7 lectures about New Haven and read the Rae book, but the rest is redundant if you read the New York Times.",
    "The lectures are individually always very interesting, even if the relationship among them is at times hard to follow. The readings are always interesting and quirky and something you'd be interested in reading even if it wasn't required for class. I read every single one, but that actually turned out to be entirely unnecessary. I would say the one that's really key that perhaps a lot didn't get through is the Rae book. They ask you to read through the whole thing in something like three nights, which was incredibly time-consuming, so plan ahead and make sure you get through it, everything important that you learn from the course is thoroughly clarified and expounded upon in that book. Seriously. It's perfect as a fifth class. There's one short paper (4) and one a bit longer (6-8) and a finally that's really not much of a challenge at all, not to mention the paper topics are SO interesting. You'll actually feel good doing them. If you're looking for an interesting, yet easy class to tag onto your schedule, do not hesitate, this is the one!",
    "Boring gut class. You go in thinking that you'll learn so much about the city you're in, but you don't need to bother attending class beyond the 3rd week. You cover everything you need to within the first few classes, and the rest it spent just talking about it. It's all really intuitive stuff too. Easy class though.",
    "A great survey class of urban design and planning with a focus on New Haven.",
    "Interesting class worth taking since we live here.",
    "I recommend this course, particularly if you are interested in any of the departments it is cross listed under. It gave me a great understanding of cities, including (but not limited too) New Haven. The two papers are pretty straight forward, the first is easier than the second only because the topic is much more clear cut. The readings are really interesting but not essential unless your section focuses on them.",
    "New Haven and the American City was definitely a worthwhile experience. We covered such a wide variety of topics that I got a good sense of so many important aspects of cities and how they work. Be warned, though, that because we cover so many topics, you can't really go in depth into any of them too much. The papers were interesting, especially the first one where we got to look at old maps, and I did community based learning instead of the final exam, which I really enjoyed- though I still have no clue how I'll be graded on this. SEction was also a lot of fun- if Tiffany is still T.A'ing, do everything you can to be in her section because she was simply amazing. All in all, a very interesting class to explore a wide variety of issues and maybe find some things you're passionate about and want to learn about further",
    "I'd definitely recommend it for an interesting look at New Haven and other developments in American cities.",
    "A survey, not of the history of American cities, but of the confused and principle-less discipline of urban studies. This confusion is delicious if you approach it with the right attitude, and immensely frustrating if you don't. If you're looking for answers or directive, don't look here. If you're looking for a brief introduction to some key ideas (Urban Renewal, industrialism, European urbanism, urban sustainability...) then hit it up.",
    "A very interesting, very easy course. I took this to fulfill my soc. requirement, and any upperclassman science major will find this brutally easy. It is fascinating and requires almost no work at all. Learned a lot, spent very little time on it. I would definitely recommend it to all students - it you want it to be more challenging, you can definitely put your heart into it and spent more time. Lots of fun.",
    "This was a great class! The lectures were so interesting and the sections were actually thought provoking and insightful. Also, the work was really, really manageable. I do feel like the lectures were a bit disorganized in that they had very little structure to them. Sometimes I felt that we only focused on random, interesting case studies and it took the professor having to remind me of the common theme between them all to realize that there actually was one. But overall, wonderful class! Must take!",
    "I would recommend it. It can be eye-opening at best and at least interesting at its worst. The reading load varied from medium to very heavy (for one or two of the weeks). I suppose the reading isn't absolutely necessary but it really added to my experience in the class. The two papers were pretty easy and I actually learned a little bit about my topics from writing them. Lectures were nice, although I would have enjoyed the class much better had I gotten a different TA. I would encourage people to meet a couple different ones before settling on a section!",
    "The material is interesting and relevant, but I felt that the lectures were a little disjointed and often repetitive. The readings could get repetitive as well, but the small projects were kind of fun to do and not as tedious as papers\/tests. Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "I highly recommend this course. New Haven and the American City is a very good introduction to the history of urbanism, viewed particularly through the lens of New Haven. You learn so much about the history and current issues of American cities, but perhaps most importantly, those of the one you're living in right now. The lectures are very interesting, though some veer towards the abstract (particularly Rubin's later in the semester). The two professor set-up works great. Many of the readings are fascinating (and most are not very long) even if they are only tangentially related to what was presented in lecture.This course is heavily cross-listed, but it is really at its heart a history course. Those interested in a hard-core architecture or sociology class should look elsewhere. That being said, if you're interested in the history of American cities at all, and why they find themselves in the situations they're in today, this course provides a great starting point.",
    "I would recommend SOCY 149 to another student. It's an interesting, not very difficult course, and it fulfills almost any distributional requirement you can imagine - within the social sciences. There are only two assignments and a final exam. However, the final can be replaced by a Community Based Learning project - which you can come up with or they give you options. I highly recommend taking the class and doing the project. Not only do you get class credit, but you get involved with an organization or a project in the city of New Haven, and if it goes well, you can establish a relationship and keep working on that project or with that organization in the future during your time at Yale. Personally, I love talking and learning about cities and the different aspects of city life, so I enjoyed going to each lecture. The professors were also engaging. There is a section, but it's interesting and I looked forward to going each week (probably because the material was interesting and my TF was amazing).",
    "Take this class if you want to know more about New Haven or the history of American cities.",
    "At the beginning of the year, I was really fired up by the concept of the class, and the obvious passion of the professors. I thought it was exciting, fresh, and really topical, as well as a fascinating case study for conceptualizing modern America in general--not just in terms of the city. For the most part, the class did fulfill that promising start, but by the end, I felt that it began to be a retread of the previous class over and over. Instead of going beyond New Urbanism, I felt we got stuck in the mode of returning to it again and again, and instead of broadening my view of it or layering the knowledge, it felt like we were stuck in neutral, just continually going over what we had already discussed. That was my main problem with the course: instead of getting that topical, broad view, I felt that each lecture went over pretty much the same ideas in slightly different ways.That said, there were some great parts of the course. The readings were really applicable, and the opportunity to do a community-based learning project in lieu of the final was incredible. I took the class for fun, basically--not for requirements or my major--and so I was coming at it basically for the awesome lectures. Those get progressively less exciting as the semester wears on, but I hope that in the future of the class, the second half can be brought to the same level of novelty and innovation that it starts with. I'd recommend the class if you're interested in urban planning, but be aware it's really not a poli sci class, even though it's cross-listed about a million times. I'd call it mostly an Am Stud class (basically the one major it's NOT cross-listed in), but as both of the profs are architects, you'll definitely get that perspective pounded in, so be ready.",
    "Take it. It's not hard, the readings are interesting, and the topic is an important one. That said, I don't know why it's crosslisted in many of the departments: as I understand polisci (being a prospective architecture major), this is not it, and it talks about history but isn't at all historically rigorous in any way I've ever encountered. Those aren't points against it, just warnings that if you expect to have to deal with data, dates, or papers, you won't.",
    "Not a lot of work. An hour of reading and you were set to get a good section grade. I never went to lecture and was able to be active in section. But lecture attendance would have helped me a lot. It's interesting too. It's about interesting topics, and it covers a lot of New Haven's history which is cool to know when you're going to school there.",
    "This class is mostly an architecture class, even though it is cross-listed under many different subjects. Do not take it if you are looking for sociology, history, or political science since this is an urban studies class about architecture and won't interest you if you are looking for a more historical, political, or social perspective on the city. The workload is not bad - 2 short papers and 1 final - but I would recommend Credit\/D",
    "Gut gut gut. It's a shame actually because the subject of the class is so promising. But the essay prompts and final exam were so general and common sense that it really would have been possible to ace the class without doing any reading, studying, or showing up to lecture. Unless you're really lucky, expect to have discussion sections full of checked-out hockey players and baseball players playing facebook the whole time.Plattus is aware of this, I'm sure (he mentioned at some point in the semester that he was making the final exam harder than in past years because the class was too easy) but if that final was supposed to be difficult, I don'teven know what the old final could have been like.In short, take it and you might learn a bit about New Haven and waste a lot of time.",
    "Take it!",
    "It's a pretty easy class that's also interesting. I definitely learned a lot with pretty minimal effort -- basically, an ideal 5th class.",
    "Great course- provides an overview of the phases of urban growth and development, with more specific info re: New Haven. Lectures are interesting and time passes quickly in class. Both professors Plattus and Rubin are wonderful and approachable. They are also involved in the community and will let you know about meetings in the city related to course material. Course should always be supplemented with walks around New Haven! Get to know your city! It's such an interesting place.",
    "New Haven& the American City is a good introductory class to the history of cities in America and urban planning. Lectures were usually pretty interesting, usually focusing on New Haven and various other cities but the reading often focused on examples from specific cities. It can get tedious sometimes, but the work isn't too bad, and you get to learn the history of New Haven outside of the Yale bubble.",
    "A lot of the reviews of this course that I read were gushing about the profundity of the lectures, and I didn't see that. Some of them really stretch the way you see cities, and are good at giving you visual tools for imagining how a city works. Some of them repeat the same slides you've seen 5 times over and over again, and are really underwhelming. There is really no accountability for reading the readings, because the final is easy and the only assignment before that is two essays unrelated to the lectures or readings. This course might be a good intro to urban studies but for an older student it might be better to stick with a more in-depth course.",
    "It would be a shame to live in New Haven for four years and never take this course.",
    "The course \"New Haven and the American City\" has two halves: the first reviews the history of New Haven as a paradigm for the history of other American cities, the second draws out urbanist themes from this history, analyzing them across moments of time and applying them to confront future planning challenges for cities. This extensive survey is not always satisfying. It is at once too broad, and too narrow. Too many topics mean that none is treated with much depth. Yet given that the course covers the themes in the history, and then in the thematic analysis, it feels redundant. And furthermore, most of these themes are treated from a planning or aesthetic perspective, and much less from a social scientific or strictly economic perspective. That said, the course may be worth taking as an introduction to New Haven and to these topics if you are a freshman or first-semester sophomore and can discipline yourself to do all of the readings, which are excellent.",
    "It is a fun class in which you will definitely learn new things.",
    "lectures were enjoyable but sort of all over the place. Not a lot of coherence for someone without background in the area; a fun, entertaining huge lecture to take with your friends.",
    "Easy class, but the lectures were unfocused and fell short of expectations. The topics were interesting, but information was conveyed poorly.",
    "Take it. This course isn't that much work, and the work that you do is fun and allows you a lot of individual choice.",
    "Good survey course with good professors who still need to figure out how to fill the big hole that Professor Rae left when he retired. Basically, the material is interesting, but Plattus and Rubin focus heavily on architecture and planning--there isn't a great deal about the economics of cities. If you find the first couple of lectures frustrating, don't despair--they get better. That said, the content needs streamlining, as does nearly every individual lecture (because there were quite a few that we never got through entirely due to time constraints). Enjoyable, though. I'd recommend taking it CR\/D\/Fail.",
    "Very interesting subject matter. The American city isn't something most people get to study in high school, so it is definitely worth taking. Lectures were sometimes very repetitive, but intriguing nonetheless.",
    "yes - covers all distributions, is interesting, always went to class even when you really didnt have to",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other Yalies. You should not graduate from Yale without having taken this course. The lectures are extremely interesting and the readings are also interesting and not overwhelming in number. The papers are fun to research and write, and the final exam is very easy if you have gone to lecture. Take this class!",
    "Fairly easy, but really interesting class. I'd recommend it!",
    "There isn't too much work and the material is at times very interesting, but the lectures could be improved. Having two professors giving alternating lectures leads to repetition.",
    "A good course on the myriad issues that affect New Haven and other cities, and that remain extremely relevant today (including education, sustainability, etc). The course is interesting, and does not have a taxing workload.I definitely recommend this to other students. We should know New Haven, since it's our place of residence for four years. Taking this course is one step towards understanding of the town and Yale's relationship to it.",
    "Life-changing!",
    "It's a fine class. There was too much reading assigned and no incentive to read it. The lectures were pretty interesting, though they got very repetitive quickly. It's a good 5th class.",
    "A good class. It can be frustrating because it's a little scattered and sometimes hard to come away with clear points from the lecture. However, I'm glad I took it because it got me engaging more meaningfully with my surroundings and was great food for thought.",
    "Excellent excellent course that EVERY YALIE SHOULD TAKE. Seriously. Most of us will live in cities some time in our lives (other than New Haven, I mean), and it's really interesting to have a sense of how cities came to be, and what contributes to the state that they're currently in. It gave me a completely different perspective on New Haven and cities in general. If you're super involved in urban studies already, you'll probably be bored, but if you're a newbie, CHECK IT OUT.",
    "This is a really neat course for someone with little exposure to architecture\/urban studies. Sometimes I felt the lectures didn't link with each together either thematically or chronologically, which was sometimes frustrating but not a huge detriment. Both Alan Platus and Elihu Rubin are great lecturers and have slightly different perspectives and areas of expertise. You come away with some neat insights into urban planning, styling, etc as a result.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course on some conditions. I would not take it if you have already taken a wide range of Urban Studies courses at Yale, especially Study of the City and Civic Art (how many more times can you learn about the Columbian Exposition of 1893, right?). Otherwise, it is a great introduction to the history of urbanism and New Haven that would be useful for all New Haven residents. There is a lot of freedom with the projects - don't be afraid to get creative!",
    "I thought New Haven and the American City was a fascinating course, and I learned a lot both about New Haven and the trajectory of American urban life throughout history. Workload is minimal (one assignment, one 7-9 page paper, and a final exam) and you don't really have to do all the reading (but I would recommend reading the Rae book). The professors are engaging and lectures kept me interested.I did think the course was a bit disorganized\/not particularly cohesive, but I suppose that is the nature of a survey course on urban studies that covers everything from architecture, to social history, to public policy, to environmental sustainability. Personally, I wanted to learn more about the policy aspect of urban studies - as the course was listed first under Political Science - and I thought the class focused more on the architectural aspects than I expected (probably because both professors are architecture professors). Additionally, although the material was byno means hard to understand, because the assignments were so open-ended I had some difficulty knowing what the professors\/TFs expected and how they would grade our work. Overall, though, the class was an incredibly interesting window into urbanism and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in American history, political science, architecture or environmental studies.",
    "New Haven and the American City was a fascinating but sometimes frustrating class that provides interesting perspectives on urban planning and urban history. Being cross-listed in five departments and having two professors, lectures can be wonderful some days and dry and repetitive on others. While rather disjointed the class covers the history of American cities with a particular focus on the urban renewal efforts of the 60s and 70s. It also focuses on current trends in urban planning and architecture. Be warned there is a very strong focus on New Haven (which is arguably not representative of the trajectory of the average American City). Thus for people wanting to learn more about New Haven it is a great fifth class. For those with a decent knowledge of the city I would hesitate to recommend it.",
    "Very interesting survey of cities that will enhance the way you look at cities all over the world--including your own. Assignments were fun and interesting, and the lectures were always enjoyable. Great class!",
    "Good class if you're into urban studies and architecture. The lectures can sometimes wander a bit, but they are interesting. The workload is very manageable, overall good class to take if you get the chance."
