    "This is a phenomenal survey of the Edo Period. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about Japan or just seeking an excellent course. Professor Drixler is an excellent, gripping lecturer who possesses a remarkable understanding of the material and scholarly work on this fascinating period of Japanese history.The readings are interesting and engaging, sections are led well, and it is clear that the teaching staff really care about the students and that they get the most out of the course. If you go to lecture (like having someone read you a great novel), do the readings and participate in section, you will do well in this class!",
    "This course is a wonderful survey of the Edo period. You will leave with a sharp general sense of all the period's issues as well as with resources that will help you into these topics more deeply.",
    "Take. This. Course. Enjoyable lectures, good readings, very evenly divided grading (so nothing is too high pressure). It's a good bit of work, especially if you do all the reading, but it's worth it and was one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend History 307 w\/ Prof. Drixler. It's a small lecture, which means you have the benefit of really getting to know an expert in this field. Also Japanese history in general is awesome. After taking this class, I feel like I definitely know how the Tokugawa period fits into the context of world history and I'm considering majoring in History and East Asian Studies. This course is especially good for those who have some connection to Japan (family there, traveling there, studying Japanese, etc.), because it provides a really solid historical and cultural foundation for understanding some fundamental things about Japanese society today.",
    "Yes, take it. Fun class.",
    "Yes, I'd highly recommend the class.",
    "This class was really great; Professor Drixler is a good lecturer but, more importantly, is very invested in his students. It was a small lecture so that contributed to a good class environment and sometimes we would have a bit of discussion\/questions in lecture. The class gives a very good look at the origins of the Tokugawa period and then an excellent look at culture and themes of the period. Professor Drixler is very interested in ecological history and demographics so we spent some time on those; that could have been boring but he kept it interesting. The class doesn't focus much on political history and it definitely does not do justice to the decline of the Tokugawa order and the 1800s in Japanese history. But I would definitely recommend it!",
    "This course influenced me tremendously to decide to add history as a double major. I did not have prior knowledge about Japaneses history, other than a historical fiction novel about samurai and early Japanese trade. The course was outstanding and my favorite of my semester!!! It was very well structured. The lectures were very engaging as they covered a wide array of information and subjects that are not conventionally taught in history. If you have even a slight interest in anything related to Japanese history, you must take this class, regardless of your major!",
    "If you have ever had any interest in Japanese history, or in the history of sustainability of the environment, I would suggest this course.",
    "----Highly Recommend----Reading and assignments, slightly more intensive than the average history lecture, but nothing unmanageable or unreasonable.----2 writing assignments (there was the option of not writing the second one for a higher weight on the final), Midterm, and Final.",
    "It was such a great experience to take this class. One of the best lectures in the History department.",
    "Yes, take it. Even if you know nothing about Japan. It's great. I strongly recommend this to all history majors (as the best ROTW I've taken) and to the Yale population in general.",
    "Take this class if you can. The subject matter is fascinating, and the way it is taught really encourages a deep understanding of the period. Also, Drixler is an awesome professor who is worth speaking to outside of the class. He's very friendly and willing to talk about just about anything with you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The professor and TFs are very strong and helpful. Be warned, though, that you should already have some interest in Japanese history or culture or Japan itself or else you might find some of the material boring. The reading is somewhat heavy at times but not always necessary to do. The assignments, midterm, and final are very fair. Oh, and the other students that took this course with me were all very into this class, which made discussions and lectures engaging. I'm guessing that this is because pre-modern Japanese history is quite an academic niche that only some students, particularly passionate ones, will enjoy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to everyone and anyone. To history majors or Japanese history specialists, this class is indispensable. It will make you think about Japan and the world in new and insightful ways. But the class, I think, would be endlessly interesting to anyone of any academic background. Professor Drixler teaches in a way that is challenging but also readily accessible to everyone, and he makes it clear in a subtle and very incisive way how the things we learn in class have broader ramifications in all sorts of fields of learning. The class made me learn about Japan, but more important, it also made me think and taught me to think better. This is precisely the sort of class you dream of when coming to a place like Yale.",
    "If you took Japan's Modern Revolution by Professor Botsman, I strongly recommend you take Japan's Great Peace. The material is fascinating, and Professor Drixler is awesome."
