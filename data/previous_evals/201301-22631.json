   "comments": [
    "Political Parties in the Developing World is a seminar where you read three-four rather technical political science papers each week, usually grouped around a theme prevalent in the study of third-world democracies. Coming into the class with no political science background, I didn't expect the class to be so technical \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it really isn't the typical gut poli sci seminar you hear about. During class, Tariq grills you on the details of the readings, so make sure you actually read them and understand the logical flow of the arguments. That said, it's an interesting class, even if I do wish we had spent more time on applications to foreign democracies and less on theoretical models. The workload in terms of things you actually have to turn in is very easy (three 5-page papers); the work is more in applying yourself to the readings every week.",
    "A reading intense seminar on what a political party is, what they do in developingn countries and the future for democracies in these countries as a result. Great teaching and you'll learn a lot from the reading response papers you write- be prepared to do a lot of the reading though and contribute during class.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class, and I thought Professor Thachil was great. The readings were very interesting, and the three response papers throughout the course were verymanageable and also allowed you to interact with the readings throughout the course of the semester, rather than just having one paper at the end.",
    "This class was a real winner. Although it didn't look great during Shopping Period, it really was great once it started. Good readings and good discussion.",
    "Good class. It's really very theoretical, bit tariq is a great teacher most of the time. Onlyyhree short papers,and tariq takes the time to give great feedback."
