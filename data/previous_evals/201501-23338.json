    "Strengths: Wonderful seminar-like course that covered a broad range of topics pertaining to health disparities; the class is small so allows for lots of interesting discussion. We also had a book club which was so great! It's the perfect opportunity to read a piece of work of our own interest and share with the class our thoughts. Weaknesses: none",
    "Interesting topics, but at times it felt unfocused. Health disparities is a huge topic, so perhaps it would make sense to have a more focused list to disparities to cover in the course. The lectures occasionally felt unfocused, and there were often broad statements made without data to back them up. There were also times when someone would ask a question no one knew the answer to, and then we moved on (when it would have been easy to look up the answer then in class).",
    "More open ended discussion. Maybe some articles that were not research articles and focus on current events",
    "Having students lead discussion was helpful for encouraging student engagement.",
    "Health disparities was a great course exploring the various mechanisms and possible solutions to health disparities across the life course. There is a lot of reading for the course, but it is very interesting and gives a breadth of understanding of the many aspects of health disparities. I appreciated the opportunity to have a seminar style course in which i could engage in more discussion and learn from my peers.",
    "The seminar style of the class was great for weekly discussions!",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester. I think the content was exactly what a lot of us in SBS\/CDE really find interesting. I enjoyed the systematic and regular nature of the course. All of the readings seemed valuable and were discussed, and class conversations were always engaging. Student led discussions allowed us to master some content areas, and the final projects\/presentations were interesting!"

    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Dr. Jones is great! She is so warm and really accommodating to our needs and suggestions for the course. She makes all of her students feel really comfortable expressing our thoughts and feelings, which is important because many of the topics we discuss are sensitive. She is really knowledgeable about health disparities and I'm so grateful that she offers this course!",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Awesome! Such a fun class with lots of discussion",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth makes students feel cared for and goes the extra mile to make everyone feel welcome and valued.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth is great. She is really open to feedback and creates an environment conducive to good discussions of the various facets of health disparities. She was very open about her perspective on health disparities and encouraged us to acknowledge our own biases throughout the course. I appreciated her insight based upon her own research and experience about the evolution of disparities in public health and the various programs that have tried to address them.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Dr. Jones truly cares about her students and is always open to discussing course topics.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth was great! I wish more professors taught like her. She has clearly mastered class concepts and always facilitated interesting discussions. She kept content current while focusing on well-established principles. You could tell that Beth wanted all of her students to do well, and I really think this course embodies the \"learn-first\/explore different ideas\" model that YSPH promotes. Beth's interests are well-rounded, and her incorporation of book club into the course was nice, especially for those of us who have had their fill of journal articles. Beth was always open to different ideas, and her beautiful printouts made following along in class easy. Beth was also very generous with food\/snacks, the importance of which cannot be understated! :) I really enjoyed learning from Beth!"

    "One of my favorite courses at YSPH! Health disparities has become one of the most important public health issues today, and this class is a great option for students interested in learning more about the concepts and discussing critical issues in a safe and intimate space. Definitely recommend.",
    "Great intro to health disparities",
    "This course is a great intro into health disparities. In this course, you learn about disparities across the life course in a way that allows you to form your own opinions and strategies for elimination. The class is informative without being finger-pointy, and it is a very comprehensive class in terms of addressing the social factors that contribute to population health."
