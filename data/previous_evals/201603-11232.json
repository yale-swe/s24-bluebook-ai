   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Curriculum makes sense Weaknesses: Did not like the flipped classroom or use of Coursera, problem set problems were more difficult than anything covered in class",
    "The reversed classroom structure was less than ideal and very inefficient. We pay tuition to Yale to be taught by good teachers and not online videos. The videos were not in-depth at all and had poor explanations. They often did not match the quiz questions at the end, which were also a poor gauge of understanding.",
    "Despite us being asked to do the coursera videos and quizzes before classes, this was rarely (or never) used in class in order to evaluate where our weaknesses were. Also, the teaching in class was fairly weak where sometimes it was unclear what we were supposed to be learning for that particular class.",
    "The strengths of the course lies in the teaching methods of the individual TAs and the good Prep videos. I learned very well under Kalina's teaching style, and found her to be incredibly organized and clear when it came to teaching us the calculus and walking us through problem-solving techniques that would prove to be valuable on tests. However, I found the teaching methods and use of class time to vary wildly when other TA's subbed in, and I could see how my level of understanding could have decreased dramatically had I been in another section. The reverse classroom actually worked quite well, I believe, as I found it so helpful to teach myself and work through the basic concepts before doing practice problems on the home works and in class.",
    "Method of teaching was not satisfactory. The videos were not helpful in that they were lengthy for only covering one question. Also, there were some questions that arose in class that couldn't be answered by the professor.",
    "This course would be a lot better if all the students in the course had placed into it. It was very frustrating to find that all of my classmates had taken an equivalent course in high school and never showed up to section. The flipped classroom could be done better. Some instructors really liked using technical mathematical terminology on the board when it was unnecessary, for example.",
    "It was a fantastic course. It covered a lot of material and was really interesting. I liked the recorded videos and the prep problems, they were clear and effective. I also liked participation and attendance not being part of the final grade. And the fact that we did not have a super heavy workload like some other courses here. The course's weaknesses or what I did not like, is that there was a lot of students in the same room during the tests and having a loud noise outside SSS was really disturbing when taking the tests. Also the fact that the tests were at 7 pm was not that convenient.",
    "The topics were often rushed, especially in classes that met 2 a week."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Classroom instruction was sub-par and the flipped classroom setup was not conducive to a good understanding or mastery of the subject material.",
    "Absolutely not. Don't take it unless you have to as a prerequisite (most of you will need to). I'd recommend trying to place into 112 or 120 just to avoid this course.",
    "Only take it if you must. It's a bad course with bad teaching.",
    "Unless the student has to take the course as a pre-requisite for the major, I would not recommend it because the class was not particularly well taught. I did not have to take the class as a pre-req for my major but took it because I enjoy math and thought the class would be well-taught\/ would introduce me to an interesting way of looking at math. However, while I learnt more in terms of integration techniques etc. I don't think it really furthered my appreciation of math as the focus of the class was more on simply solving the questions than understanding and appreciating math.",
    "If you are going to take this class, make sure you are fully committed to working through the new math concepts on your own before class time. Choose your TA wisely as they vary wildly in how well they teach. The homeworks are incredibly manageable and the prep problems are not at all time consuming. The tests are challenging but the plethora of practice tests prepare you well for them. Overall, I would definitely suggest this course if you need it for a pre-req. Otherwise, don't bother.",
    "No.",
    "Yes definitely, it was a great course. If a student is looking for an amazing math course MATH115 is certainly it.",
    "no",
    "I would not recommend it unless it is a preque or you enjoy math, there is really nothing stimulating or fun about this class."
