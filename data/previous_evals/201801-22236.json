    "I learned an enormous amount about tensions over language and translation in Renaissance Europe, from questions of Latin's fixity or fluidity, questions of inborn qualities or styles in ancient languages, to the question of whether the past is close to us or far away which motivates so much Renaissance thinking. I think I gained a lot of insight into what motivates translation as an enterprise, and I gained skills I never knew I had in doing my own translations."

   "comments": [
    "I think the strengths of this course were in how it was at once broad and focused, covering a couple hundred years of writing but always with a pointed focus on our question of translation. It opened so many doors and told a number of different stories without expecting expertise in every area, because all the students came with different interests and backgrounds. I think this responsiveness to student interest also made the course very successful."

    "Absolutely! I think anyone with any interest in translation or in the Renaissance would enjoy this course, and Jane did such a wonderful job responding the diversity of interests in the class that I would recommend it to anyone."
