    "I thought that there was a good balance of speakers and provider lead courses. The PPTs were a little too long for the classes and we rarely got through the whole thing without rushing.",
    "It was apparent that this course has been taught for some time. Things were well organized, and the course content was very interesting.",
    "This was an interesting class that did not overlap with much other material in YSPH. The professors are also great. The part of class I got the least out of was the final project and paper; it just seemed like an isolated exercise that was one more box to check.",
    "I greatly enjoyed this class. I thought the topics were well and thoughtfully chosen, the content thorough and far reaching in the topic from emergency response, to the day to day anti-microbial resistance. I learned a great deal and would definitely recommend this class. The work asked that we engage with the topic in a variety of ways from homework, to position pieces, both presentation and essay. If I were to recommend anything, it would likely just be an opportunity to go through more of the case studies at the end of class.",
    "Enjoyed the homework assignments a lot. Liked the room for creativity\/challenges that the assignments gave. Thought the choice of guest lecturers were great and felt I was exposed to a wide variety of topics without many repeats. The final exam (multiple choice) was a little confusing and felt like there were multiple right answers for some of the questions but other than that, enjoyed the course a lot. One thing is that I wish the course workload had been more spread out. I felt like there was a lot of assignments towards the second half of the semester but not as much in the first half."

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Great professor. Really cares about students. Could work on not cutting off the other professor or speakers when they are trying to answer a question. It seems like she always has to have the \"last word\" on a question even if it was addressed to someone else",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry has been a very helpful and knowledgeable guide through this course. Her experiences in the field and real-life examples make the course very relevant and current for us as future public health professionals. Her use of interactive assignments challenge us to think of the actual health implications of issues in infection control in the real world.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry did a good job presenting course content and was a very knowledgable instructor. She was able to incorporate her own experiences into the way course content was presented, and this really enhanced the course.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry is really interesting and knowledgeable. I would love to take another course taught by her.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Both Dr. Dembry and Dr. Banach were very prompt with the grading and great lecturers."

    "Great introduction to hospital epi as applied to hospitals.",
    "The healthcare epidemiology course is an excellent and unique elective for students who are interested in having a more thorough understanding on how epidemiology is used as a tool for patient safety and infection control in hospitals. Guests from various fields are invited to present on different topics, providing insight into important current issues in healthcare epidemiology.",
    "This course is a good overview of the issues in healthcare epidemiology. Students interested in how hospitals and other healthcare institutions track and mitigate infectious disease risk would find this course interesting.",
    "This is an interesting class with a low workload, new perspectives, and increasingly important topic in our field. It's set up as weekly lectures with three homework assignments, a final project\/paper, and take-home exam. The course surveys general topics in healthcare-associated epidemiology (and there is actually no mathematical epidemiology involved), but exposes you to really interesting guest speakers.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course, although I think it is optimal for EMD students and particularly for students interested in working in hospitals."
