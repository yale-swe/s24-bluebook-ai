   "comments": [
    "I learned to be a better close reader.",
    "DS Literature has made me a better writer. It has given me concrete writing skills that I can always have going forward.",
    "Too much to really fit into a survey question, but far and above all the other (already great) classes in Yale this class has probably moulded my life most directly. In part the subject matter of literature lends itself to evaluating the human condition and the self most directly, but in other parts the way this course was taught and the books that were chosen and their thematic concerns lent themselves to reflection very well. Class discussions were always overflowingly robust; essays were given a lot of help and I have certainly learnt how to challenge myself in writing more.",
    "Critical writing skills, themes of Western literature, close reading and discussion skills",
    "DS Lit definitely helps you become a better reader of literature, especially in seeing a throughline between novels, plays, poetry, and epics.",
    "This course helped me develop an understanding of the relation and interaction between some major works of literature of the Western canon. I also learned to do close readings of portions of the texts we read and use them to improve my understanding of the work as a whole, and I improved my writing skills as well.",
    "I developed my ability to notice and interpret details (especially ambiguities) in various texts, construct a deliberately organized paper (especially the introduction paragraph), and express my interpretations and opinions coherently both in section and in my papers."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think connections between the works or overarching themes of the semester could be discussed more in class.",
    "The readings are sometimes unmanageable, especially in the second semester of DS lit. That being said, the class discussions are very inclusive relative to other DS sections.",
    "Near no weaknesses. Would happily take this course again every semester for the rest of my college career and am so glad I did it. I might suggest finding ways to ensure that students are keeping up with their reading, like reading responses, though of course this might be too much of a demand on the time of students. Oh and put war and peace back on the syllabus!",
    "Heavy reading load in certain periods is tough to manage, but iverall the breadth is excellent for covering western literature.",
    "The strength of this course is its focus on analyzing the connections between the different works we study and understanding the value of the works as they interact with one another, as well as the teaching format that combines seminar and lecture. One weakness is that the small amount of time spent on each text makes the discussion of its themes limited and sometimes superficial.",
    "Strengths of Directed Studies Literature include the richness and diversity of the selected texts, the opportunity to express detailed interpretations in papers, and the intimate seminar setting where students can learn from listening to each other and spontaneously defining and refining their own opinions. The texts were sometimes difficult to complete within the allotted time. The course could perhaps be improved by slightly reducing the number of readings and spending more time on each text."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "DS lit is a great course. Make sure to do most of the reading. It is impossible to do it all if you want to remain sane, but do as much as you can so that you feel a sense of accomplishment.",
    "Yes!!! I wish everyone could take this class. It's just tremendously well taught and the syllabus is wonderful. All the books are exciting in different ways, you get to cover a lot of the important texts of the past couple of centuries, and talk about them as if you actually have something valuable to offer (and sometimes you actually might!)",
    "Incredible selection of books. The course improves your ability to read passages closely and make arguments relevant to the work as a whole.",
    "Absolutely continue with DS if you enjoyed the first semester gut feel iffy about the work. Worth it to finish the sequence.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in gaining a foundation in major works of the Western canon and learning to write and argue coherently, but also did not mind sacrificing an in-depth reading of the works for an overall grasp of themes in Western literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to destabilize and consequently expand his or her understanding of literature."
