   "comments": [
    "The class covers leadership, management and entrepreneurship. The professor really encourages and helps with starting own ventures. Would definitely recommend to a friend.",
    "It will not be taught again, so it doesn't really matter what I say. But, no, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Yes, a good class on business and management.",
    "I would recommend it, you learn a lot about business and leadership and it is important for almost any person.",
    "Take it if you can get in! Great perspective on the real entrepreneuship deal. Guest speakers every class are great, you learn from the real experts.",
    "I would recommend this course! Just be prepared to deal with some organizational snafus. I think the material and the speakers make it worth it.",
    "Cool class with great guest speakers. Some of the focus on leadership\/corporate strategy is a bit later stage than is currently applicable (especially for folks looking to do tech startups). Overall, though, I recommend. Professor is incredibly nice and really cares about each student. Amazing guest speakers who have started incredible companies were the best part of the course.",
    "Great intro into what it takes to be an entrepreneur.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This was a fantastic class with amazing guest speakers and a well-designed syllabus. I wish, however, more feedback was given throughout the course and that the syallabus was designed earlier to give students the opportunity to work ahead of schedule. I also wished that the class time were a bit more consistent in terms of ending time. I like the case analysis approach, but in the beginning of the semester, it became a bit repetitive.The CEO of Procter and Gamble came to speak to us, and so did the founder of Nantucket Nectars. This class is unlike any other at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in starting their own business. The course is a lot of work and you should expect to be held accountable for all readings in class."
