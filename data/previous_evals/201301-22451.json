    "A very strong course that opens up a broad variety of fields. Applicable to many different engineering disciplines. Would recommend. Be sure always to go to class and ask questions whenever something is unclear, even if you have to stop the Professor. He likes to know people are paying attention. This year's TA was also very good (George), and I would say go to all his office hours if you can.There is a car problem \/ mini-project that doesn't make much sense at the beginning of the semester but by the final iteration of it I was able to do it with no problem. Ask for help using Simulink.",
    "Yes! I think it's a great class for majors if you are interested in signals and systems.",
    "Good continuation of EE 202. Narendra is a great professor who cares about his students more than most professors. Problem sets are long but not numerous. Use a textbook to accompany the class because narendra a notes can be difficult to follow. Important EE class.",
    "A great signals and systems course. Highly recommended: You will learn a lot and Prof. Narendra is great.",
    "The material is pretty dry but Narendra is a great professor and he is worth getting to know.",
    "This class does not cover much more than what you learn in EENG 203. I would recommend against taking it if you feel somewhat comfortable with Laplace and Fourier Transforms and Series. Only thing new that you learn about is feedback and this can easily be covered in other classes. The lectures are very dry and Professor Narendra often seems like he is just talking to the board. That being said, he is very open to questions and you can walk into his office whenever you need help. He loves talking to students whenever possible. TA's office hours were also very useful for homeworks."
