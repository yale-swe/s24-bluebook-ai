    "This is such a good course! It's fun, it's engaging, and Maria Kaliambou is actually a phenomenal genius.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS. You will NOT regret it, I promise.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in cultural studies or popular culture of all eras. You can get out of this class whatever you want to, depending on the work you put in -- it can be very rewarding academically and intellectually, but you have to make the effort to make it so.",
    "I really liked this class! The stories were very interesting to read and the work load was totally manageable. The paper topics were super flexible so I felt free to write about subjects I was actually interested\/invested in. I would just like to point out that I was pretty lost when it came to history but it was fine because somehow all of my classmates just knew all these things about history of literature and culture so I was ok with them just leading the discussions and then I could add input on my opinion or the tales themselves.",
    "This was a very interesting class that covers that proves that something as ordinary or seemingly unimportant as the fairy tale actually has a rich history and a large impact on societies past and modern-day."
