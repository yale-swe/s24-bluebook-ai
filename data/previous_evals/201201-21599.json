    "I definitely recommend it! I had tons of fun and plan on taking it again next year.",
    "do it do it do it. If you have any interest in psych research and\/or need a half credit it is totally worth it. Lab work is SO FUN, and the only difficult part is writing the research paper at the end (but it's a good practice so it's worth it). If graduate school is on your radar AT ALL then do it.",
    "Interesting lecture series on child development and social policy. Some lecturers are better than others, but the workload is very chill, which is nice.",
    "Great experience that cannot be filled anywhere else inside or outside of Yale.",
    "Take it! The research experience is really useful and you have fun running actual psychology experiments instead of just learning about them.",
    "This course varies a lot depending on whom you're working with but it's great research experience and I would definitely recommend it to all psychology majors.",
    "Current Work in Child Development and Social Policy (PSYC 711) was a great course that I would highly recommend to other students. Each week is a lecture on a different topic, but they really come together towards the end.",
    "Yes!! One of the only half-credit opportunities. Does not require much commitment, and is a great learning experience!",
    "Yes. John's lab is fascinating and always on the cusp of breakthroughs in the field",
    "I would definitely recommend the Cap Lab to another student. That said, one must love working with monkeys and having to spend a good amount of time with them each week.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is a great way to get involved in psychology research, and the monkeys are fantastic, even if they do not always cooperate.",
    "yes, interesting, though at times the topics are really obscure",
    "It's just an independent study -- do it if you're a psych major \/ like psych research.",
    "A great way to get half a credit and get\/stay invovled with a lab during senior year. Take it if you can!",
    "Yes! Chance to get immediate experience in laboratory that gives you a very real sense of what psychology research is.",
    "Do this for research experience",
    "Great course. Covers a wide range of topics related to early childhood. Strengths: variety of speakers, chance to personally meet speakers. Would definitely recommend this class to other students.",
    "Nice 0.5 course credit. It's just going to lab meetings.",
    "Definitely take research for credit!",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone who wants to start with a lab",
    "Yes! Work in a lab! They are really fun and give you a different perspective from which to look at psychology. And to work with grad students!",
    "Do it! A great way to earn a credit or 1\/2 credit and learn a lot."
