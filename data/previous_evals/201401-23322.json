   "comments": [
    "This is a good class to take if you like literary analysis and feeling lucky that you go to a place like Yale where you are surrounded by so many intelligent individuals.",
    "Yes. This was my first english course at Yale and am excited to take more now.",
    "Take 127! Pretty much all the readings are enjoyable, the discussions are really interesting, and you get a lot out of the class.",
    "The course requires a good deal of reading and effort, but if you are interested in truly understanding American literature, it is a good class to take. I do not excel in English, and this is probably the last English class I will take at Yale, but I took the course because I was interested in American literature. While I definitely had to put in a good deal of work without getting an A, the class is worth it because you get to familiarize yourself with some classics of American literature.",
    "Yes, fascinating course, but depends on the professor since the texts can only come alive when a student is engaged with the class.",
    "This class was amazing. I would definitely recommend the class to everyone, even if some books were read in high school. This is a totally different experience. Even for someone who thought she didn't like poetry (me), every meeting of this class was enjoyable and insightful.",
    "English 127 is a survey of American literature, which allows for some flourishes based on the interests of the teacher. The course deals with issues and themes that are important in American literature and American culture. In my experience, the class was fairly balanced between reading and writing for a literature course, with heavily weighted but manageable writing assignments. I would absolutely recommend English 127 to any student, humanities oriented or not. It is incredibly rich and interesting subject matter, and helpful in developing analytical and writing skills that can benefit anyone.",
    "I would recommend this class. Although this course can be reading intensive at times, the texts are usually good reads. Discussions are always interesting. The time put in is well worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone who plans on living in America at any point in time.",
    "This is not a bad class to take for a writing credit! We had 2 midterm papers and 1 8-10 page final paper. The only drawback is probably the final exam. I would recommend the course if you have space for a decent workload."
