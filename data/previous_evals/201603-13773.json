   "comments": [
    "Funny, a way to learn a wide range of art history, storytelling from a wide range of lecturers.. good course to have an experience \"out of our business nest\"",
    "It's awesome! The professor brings different topics every class to tell stories. It's impressive to hear so many great insights from so many guests invited by the professor. The most impressive class for me is Snake Dance. Very special and enjoyable!",
    "each class covered different topics. my favorite was the color class and when speakers were brought in to discuss their specific specialization. very diverse topic range and interesting topics.",
    "This is a wonderful class that is so different from my major courses in SOM. It gives me an opportunity to learn from each other of other schools.",
    "The class was unique from a business student's point of view. Every piece of art, film, picture and music had a story behind. And by visual story telling, I can reflect to my own life. The format of the class was good, especially the final. Every student were fully engaged and performed in their own way. I felt so good that I could present my part during the class.",
    "Wendall invited some compelling guest lecturers to the course and it was interesting to hear how artists in very different sectors used visual storytelling in their craft. I enjoyed the week in which we left the classroom to do some improv and would have enjoyed more \"out of the classroom\" experiences. The set design class and our guest lecturer from Turkey were my favorites in which we studied actual applications of storytelling used on the stage and in art. They were also the most open to answering a broad set of questions from the class.",
    "It was one of the best classes I ever had in Yale. Professor invited artists from different fields and locations to demonstrate their Visual Storytelling skills. As a business student, it was a good opportunity to make new friends in the class as well.",
    "I loved all the lectures - so interesting and valuable to think about.",
    "Awesome.",
    "speakers from different background and interests really broaden the horizon of the students.",
    "Help me to admire art and think in a different way.",
    "The range of topics and different vantage points were great. It was a good mix and just enough to inspire curiosity without giving definitives.",
    "The plethora of guest speakers in this class kept things very fresh and informative. I love hearing from everyone about their specific discipline.",
    "I enjoyed the diversity of speakers.",
    "I felt like i got a lot of inspiration from the topics that where taught in class!",
    "I enjoyed the tempo of different lectures and offerings. Never a dull moment, lots to be taken in. Ann McCoy was particularly fun, not just because she brought her irreverent take on politics and her cookies to keep us awake, but because she offered an interesting synthesis of art historical trends that often don't get linked together in other class room contexts. I also confess gratitude for a class that required our attentive engagement with the subject matter presented but only a few assignments. With a crammed schedule, it's useful to have interludes where we are just able to engage with other people's creative work, but not be required to offer more of our own. Thank you for that."

   "comments": [
    "MAybe to use a syllabus to know in advance what is going to be lectured and home material to read before class will strengthen the experience.",
    "More video involved",
    "too many art history lectures thought the class would focus more on how to make us as students and professional better visual storytellers (need more concrete techniques) VERY european centric, which i think is a disservice to the art world which is not this monolithic. There are so many other cultures who have contributed to art throughout history and i think it is slightly irresponsible to not acknowledge this at all.",
    "I really like one course that has dancing section. I hope it can involve more classes in that way which each of us can engage in a lot.",
    "The class was great. I don't have improvements suggestion. Maybe prolong half a hour and add a break in between.",
    "Because the course was 100% guest lecturers, the quality of the presentations was pretty variable and didn't always tie in to the overall theme of the course. While I picked up some interesting ideas, I did not come away with any cohesive understanding of Visual Storytelling as a concept. Even just a short summary at the end of each class bringing it back to the subject would have been really helpful. Or if we could have had a introductory session with frameworks or templates for \"traditional\" stories that we could use as a frame when considering later presentations on story telling in a visual context. There was also far too much art history in the beginning of the semester, given the brevity of the semester, I would have preferred to jump right into the other guest lecturers because the art history side did not seem particularly relevant to what we covered later. Also, the whole course would have been better served with a discussion based element to it - there were a lot of interesting students in our class and I would have liked to learn more about their opinions and thoughts on some of the issues we covered in the class.",
    "Maybe we can organize some outdoor activities, if allowed.",
    "It really sucked as a second-year costume design having to take this class this year. With productions, it felt like we were so overbooked with classes that I barely had enough time for making my show and spending time on my critique classes. Maybe if this had fit into third year it would have been better.",
    "None.",
    "There class was overcrowded to the point of being dangerous. Seats blocked aisles and doors. And the overcapacity made the class very uncomfortable and it was much harder to learn and focus.",
    "Less students! I see the value in having a mix of different schools, but there were so many that there wasn't an actual ability to connect across disciplines. The value of having a music or business student there can only exist if you can actually interact with them.",
    "There are a few things that I would suggest. For one, however topical it is, I would suggest having this class in a larger and more comfortable room. It was always far too warm for me to focus and I found myself really struggling to concentrate on the various speakers with sweat pouring down my face. I also felt that the room was way too crowded and I felt very uneasy with blocking the aisles with more bodies and chairs when all the seats were already taken. I would also suggest a stricter time limit on peoples projects. I, for one, was unable to present our final project because my understanding was that the presentations were intended to be 3-5 minutes long. Rather, many people presented for upwards of double that time leaving many people rushed or unable to present.",
    "I didn't always feel like every speaker fully understood what they were supposed to talk about in the class. Some seemed super prepared with a lecture and other times I felt they weren't fully aware of what the class was.",
    "Some of the topics where more helpful for future reference like Ann's history class. Others where interesting anecdotes (like the class on color or chairs) that I'm not sure I will use in my projects but they where nonetheless very interesting.",
    "I assume the guest lecturers change every semester. Variety in the selection is great and I would encourage continued boldness in who is presented."

    "overall good course but wished it were slightly more practical",
    "As a non drama student, I would say if add some courses that taught by Prof. Harrington herself would be great. Because the words she gave to us in the last class was really meaningful, I really want to get more insight from her.",
    "I'm not sure the final presentations from other students added a lot to my understanding of the class. I would have preferred this were just one week of presentations - maybe in the future students could pair up to present.",
    "We love Wendall!",
    "I love the professor's insight into the course.",
    "I thought Riccardo's class was very inspiring! I enjoyed it very much!!"
