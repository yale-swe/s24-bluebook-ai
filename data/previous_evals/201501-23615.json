    "This is the most valuable sound class I have taken thus far. I realize this is vague but I have nothing further to say than that",
    "Charles Coes was very organized and informative on the subject matter her presented. He had handouts on all information that was excellent. Charles was available for questions during the class and could explain things very well.",
    "It was a chance to have an expert in the room to ask technical questions about important issues in sound engineering. A lot of the content I would not be able to learn on my own, or would even know where to start."

    "This was a good continuation of the engineering bootcamp. I still have many questions but as almost all the content was new to me I feel like it was a good introduction."
