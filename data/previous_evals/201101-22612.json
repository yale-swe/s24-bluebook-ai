    "French 140 is not a rather depressing class. Most of the readings involve some sort of depression, murder, or suicide. Overall, this class is not that interesting, but if you are only looking to fulfill your languagerequirement, this class is a pretty easy way to do this.",
    "French 140 is a challenging, but very rewarding class. You will definitely see significant improvement in your French skills. If you are looking to master the language, this course is a great stepping stone.",
    "I would highly recommend it- you become a lot more comfortable with French grammar and the emphasis on analysis of texts so it helps with speaking skills.",
    "This course is good solid preparation for L5 that meets every day. There is no need to worry, as one's French will thus automatically improve. The reading does get a little hefty towards the end of the course, though, so be prepared for that."
