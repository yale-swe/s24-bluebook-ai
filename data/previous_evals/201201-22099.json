    "This is a great class that brings together so many important topics for future research and lab work. I would suggest this to anyone studying biology, microbes, etc. because you will learn such valuable skills. In addition, the lectures are thorough, yet not overwhelming. Few assignments and two exams.",
    "G&G255 is a great way to learn the basics of a bunch of microbiology procedures if you're interested in the field or even just want to be able to better understand the literature coming out of the field. However, though Dr. Blake is very nice and very approachable, at least this year the class was very disorganized. Though we were always aware of what was due the specifics of the test or assignment wouldn't be explained until very close to the due date. For example, though we performed the labs all the way through the year, we didn't get specific guidelines on the write up until the half way through reading week and didn't get information on how to perform some of the calculations until two days before the labs were due. This meant that though there was almost no work during the semester, there was a ton of it at the end of term. This lack of information made the class pretty high stress, though I also learned a fair amount and found the information interesting.",
    "This is by far the most disorganized class I've taken at Yale, which was pretty frustrating all semester. I didn't really feel like I learned a lot about biology either. However, our TF was extremely helpful. I wouldn't recommend this class unless it's required. The nice was that it wasn't too much work.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student if it is still taught by Ruth Blake. Because the lab is during class time, I took it thinking I could kill two birds with one stone, but that was a mistake. There was simply not enough time and therefore we were never able to have a decent lecture or finish a lab. We took parts of each when we could get them, often running quickly through slides that were simple copied from thebook, in the middle of labs when we had to wait for something to incubate, etc. It was very confusing what we were supposed to learn from or gain from this class and it pretty much seemed like AP Bio, but not actually taught to you. She expected that we all knew AP Bio very well still and could follow the jargon in detailed descriptions of the processes. However, in conjunction with this expectation, she also did not explain things and said we only needed to know very basic things because there was not enough time to go into things in detail. Then she tested us on random facts that were not explained or even mentioned as something we would need to know."
