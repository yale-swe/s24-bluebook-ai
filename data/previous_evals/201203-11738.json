   "comments": [
    "I think this is a fine class to take if you are seriously interested in learning about music or are a music major. It is a good survey of various techniques of approaching music.",
    "Mainly covers counterpoint to four part writing early on, and then discusses Classical-era form.",
    "Take it if you are interested in music theory. You spend a lot of time working on assignments, but you come out of it confident in your theory skills.",
    "Similar to 205 but with more composition, which made it more fun.",
    "I would recommend the class to any student interested in the theory and analysis of specifically Classical-era music (in the style of Mozart, Haydn, etc.) Composers looking for practical compositional techniques: look elsewhere.",
    "This class is definitely one I would recommend. That said, I think its definitely more relevant to students who are interested in the music major at Yale. It is extremely worthwhile and really contextualized any understanding of music, however I think that at this level, theory becomes more focused on model compositions and understanding broader musical frameworks. Challenging, but definitely a great class.",
    "You'll learn basic concepts in classical period theory and get practice writing counterpoint, voice-leading, and small model compositions. Towards the end of the course you'll start to talk about larger structures, like sonata form. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in music and music theory\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's a solid way to build or reinforce your foundation!"
