    "I really got a lot out of this course and feel like it was very well structured. Professor Camacho is a joy to work with, her enthusiasm and knowledge made every class a lot of fun - despite the 9.20am start time! I feel like the small size of our group left us at a disadvantage at times; the best classes were the ones where everyone engaged with the discussion and took part, but that wasn't guaranteed every week with only eight of us. Overall, I'm glad that I took this course. I learnt a lot and felt like I was given ample opportunity to engage with the material in vaious ways.",
