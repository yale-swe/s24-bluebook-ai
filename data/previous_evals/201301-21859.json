    "This was an excellent, meat-and-potatoes intensive introduction to German. For anybody looking to learn the German language seriously, with a heavy emphasis on mastering the grammar in order to speak, read, and write well, this is the class to take. You will not forget how to read and speak German after this course, and I especially recommend it because of how rare it is these days to find a modern language class that takes a more systematic and thorough approach to learning the language. My past experience has been that spoken language classes are filled with frustrating and unhelpful projects and exercises and that my classmates seem to prefer to \"do something fun\" than to learn the subject. If you want a great intro German course from an excellent instructor, take this.",
    "If you started with German 125, please do yourself a favor and continue on with 145. This second semester will do wonders for your German. I'd be lying to myself if I said that I still see grammar and pedagogy (and learning in general) in the same light that I did prior to having Herr Stern for two semesters. I'm going to miss laughing so much every morning."
