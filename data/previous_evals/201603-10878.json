   "comments": [
    "I think my grammar and vocabulary both improved and expanded respectively. I thought the course did a good job integrating relevant vocabulary into the syllabus by having us read\/watch films where such vocabulary appeared a lot\/proved relevant for understanding the story. The texts themselves I found a bit strange, but I thought Mme spoke to them well and structured good class discussion. More than anything, I am happy to walk away with this course feeling like my French expression, both in writing and orally, has improved greatly.",
    "I learned a lot about French grammar!",
    "We read a lot in this class, so I learned how to read and comprehend French texts well. I also learned how to write fluently, as we wrote essays quite frequently. Most importantly, though, I learned how to speak French and hold a conversation in French with my professor and classmates. I think being able to speak conversationally is probably the most valuable skill I learned in the class. Overall, I also gained a greater appreciation for the French language!",
    "French 150 is a great intro to a vareity of interesting French literature and movie all the while fortifying basic grammar structures.",
    "I developed a larger, more diverse general vocabulary of terms, as well as a better sense of confidence during in class discussions. I realized that learning a language was both about the language itself and a tool by which to express other knowledge I already had. For instance, I found the \"texts\" (different sources) which varied in medium rather engaging and thought provoking. They led to some writing that I'm actually quite proud of. The grammatical subjects covered were very comprehensive as well, which I appreciated.",
    "This course improves both your written and oral French through different assignments, and also has a really interesting range of French literature that were fun to read and discuss.",
    "I strengthened my spoken and written French."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Grammar and vocabulary are certainly its strong points and the course is great for a student in French who wants to improve his understanding in those respects. Again, in terms of a literature\/film course, I think the class analysis proved a bit dull and unexciting, but at the same time, I recognize that FREN 150 is not primarily a literature course. The mechanical literary and oral skills I learned I think are most valuable.",
    "Strengths: effective way for students to improve their French. Weaknesses: requires a lot of work.",
    "This is a challenging course with a lot of reading, writing, and speaking, so it won't be wonderful for someone who isn't prepared to do this work. If you are, though, this is a wonderful course. I think of the biggest strengths of this course is that it forces you out of your comfort zone. You have to come to class everyday prepared to talk about the books you're reading, and this naturally makes you a better French speaker. Also, we read really good works in this class--\"Rhinoceros\" was my favorite!",
    "The strength of this class is the vast range of material that it covers, which goes from modern plays and historical fictions.",
    "One of the strengths (and simultaneous weaknesses) of the course was the constant responsibility to speak and participate in class from the get-go. It is extremely helpful as it forces one to think on the spot, utilize vocabulary, and engage with the material, but it can also be very challenging and scary at times; whether this aspect is a testament to the severity of the course or the resolve of the student is up for debate. I think the constant speaking\/participation should be retained, though maybe focused even more. I did feel we were a bit too thrown into the wild on this one without as much guidance. One way this might be improved would be to have a few more oral exams than before, but with less work required for them and with direct feedback from the instructor in the first few.",
    "This course is very fast-paced, which can be viewed as either a weakness or a strength, and it definitely requires a well-developed foundation of French both oral and written. It involves a lot of interaction with classmates and class discussions, but depending on your professor, can seem repetitive in terms of how every class is structured.",
    "The class is great in that it reviews grammar in the context of dialogues and literature, which I think is a useful preparation for students who want to continue French by taking 160 or 170."

   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course for an advanced French student primarily interested in improving grammar and vocabulary. I think these goals are accomplished namely through lots of reading and oral assignments. I also enjoyed watching the films on the syllabus; I think they contributed a lot to my listening comprehension and would recommend this course for students who would also like to improve in that vein.",
    "Yes, would 100% recommend this course to students looking to improve their French speaking and writing. It is very helpful, though the workload is a bit tough.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course! It's a lot of work, but your French will undoubtedly improve and you'll appreciate the French language much more!",
    "Highly recommend to others, especially those who just finished L4. It is a great way to solidify what you've learned about French before.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially one passionate and involved with learning French and one who isn't afraid to speak in class and struggle in the process. While the class is challenging, one ultimately succeeds best through their self-discipline and willingness to work hard out of class. It's also important to note that this class really tests the difference between intelligence and smartness; the distinction between knowing information (like memorizing vocabulary) and applying it (articulating oneself well in class). To truly learn in this class, it takes dedicated delving into the latter approach.",
    "I thought this course really improved my French and took me out of my comfort zone - I would recommend this course to anyone looking to further improve their level of French, but it's definitely a challenging class.",
    "Definitely! The class covers an extensive review of French grammar and a lot of practice in spoken and written French. It is great for anyone who needs some brushing up on grammar."
