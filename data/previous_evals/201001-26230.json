    "It's well delivered and I like the part of discussion on the real study design. We can thus learn how to put class knowledge into practical work.",
    "This was an excellent course where I really learned a lot. The instructor was great, and I found the course very helpful and informative.",
    "Good information and useful methodologies",
    "It was good. Could use a little more interactive dialogue amongst students and teacher.",
    "very interesting class",
    "The lectures were very interesting but could have benefited from more discussion.",
    "Very good. Helpful for learning methodology.",
    "Very interesting subject matter. The course covered a lot of issues.",
    "I very much enjoyed this course--it gave me a great introduction to environmental endocrine disruptors, as well as further training in the epidemiology that is required to design and analyze studies to investigate these chemicals that require much more research.",
    "I enjoyed this course and I really enjoyed the content. I think the topic is really important and many people outside of EHS took the class because of this. Dr. Zhang is very knowledgeable and provided a wide range of topics for the class. I really enjoyed her choice of assignments for the midterm and final as they are good preparation for future manuscript and grand submissions."

    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0She did an excellent job. She was well organized, and did a great job getting her concepts across.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Zhang knows the material well, but could use more liveliness in lectures",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Very accessible, knowledgeable and friendly. Some of the best pp slides I have seen. The tofu lecture and the floating babies were great.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang was a great lecturer and was always well prepared and ready for questions and suggestions. She was also very approachable for extra help.",

    "Useful information and much to pick up",
    "Unfortunately, this class is a little redundant. It is very similar to the other EHS elective courses. It is hard to recommend it over another course.",
    "Very interesting class, she puts a few too many article up for the weeely reading, but not all need to be done",
    "Valuable and helpful.",
    "Interesting subject, I'd recommend the course.",
    "This course will give you an overview of environmental endocrine disruptors--you will learn primarily through lectures, critiquing research designs\/methods and designing your own research study. I recommend this class."
