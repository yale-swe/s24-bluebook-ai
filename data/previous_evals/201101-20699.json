    "its mandatory",
    "ENAS508 is a required course as of 2011, but I would still recommend it to other students even if it were not required. It is a great opportunity to learn about the social context of science and engineering. It forces students to think and contemplate issues that lie outside of their technical expertise and it is a healthy exercise for all scientists and engineers.",
    "Yes I will",
    "Wouldn't recommend it due to time constraints, but definitely can see the value of the course",
    "I would recommend this class because of its ability to draw me into something I considered an afterthoughtat first. While the idea of scientific ethics class seemed to me nothing more than a requirement, it brings up A LOT of issues that are relevant on a nearly daily basis. Further, this brought to the surface a fascination for ethics and policy in science that I clearly had not realized I had before, but that I will try to pursue.",
    "The class teaches about engineering ethics. This was taken as an NIH requirement. I think the material was covered in depth in the short time span of the course. I would recommend this course.",
    "Though I learned something from this class, I don't think it worth the time it takes.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to every incoming student, as it is easy and painless, but the material is crucial to anyone doing research."

   "comments": [
    "The course does not directly contribute to the dissertation or research, but goes a long way in training students to become professionals. The course exposes many forms of research misconduct and steers students away from committing critical mistakes in their careers as graduate students (and beyond)!",
    "It taught me certain fundamental things related to research that will be helpful for my entire life.",
    "not applicable (yet)",
    "I may or may not have already answered this before, but the concepts that were touched upon in the class will surely be tested in my career as a scientist, there's no doubt about that.",
    "Ethics are important.",
    "It helps me avoid possible mistakes that I would make during the research.",
    "I hope to apply what I have internalized from this course to my future dissertation research."
