   "comments": [
    "Mandatory course. 10 page take home midterm and 15 page final. Really early in the morning.",
    "It is a requirement. Gets more interesting towards the end when relates class to more modern day phenomenon",
    "If you like social theory and want a great environment to discuss it, I highly recommend this seminar. Granted, I am a sociology major and I love theory, but this class offered some of the most intriguing and thought-provoking theoretical and philosophical debate I've encountered at Yale. Professor Stamatov is excellent at prompting discussion and encouraging us to really engage with the texts. Most of what you'll get out of this class depends on how willing your classmates are to participate, and this semester offered a great mix of perspectives and opinions.",
    "This is an excellent course, one of my favorites at Yale. It really does help you understand social theory by presenting it in an accessible way and guiding you to make sense of it both internally and in context. Amazingly, I actually find myself using the ideas I learned in everyday life. How many courses have *that* going for them? Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to understand society and human interaction.",
    "Good class to take if you are interested in the topic and usually understand theory fairly well on your own. Great to take with a friend so you can talk through the theory together. Don't take it if you don't want to take initiative to learn the material without the professor's help if Stamatov is teaching it. Still a good class though.",
    "This course was okay overall. There could have been less reading and livelier lectures. Most of the course was discussion-oriented, but the introductions of the topics could still have been a bit more interesting. The course load consisted of a number of weekly readings, a 10 page take-home midterm, and a 10-15 page final paper. In addition, each student had to present one week\u0092s readings in seminar. This course is a requirement for the sociology major. I would not recommend taking it unless you are a sociology major or you really enjoy theory.",
    "This wasn't a favorite class of mine, but it is a good introduction to contemporary theory, and the work of some big theorists is thoroughly treated. This class is a great supplement to other sociology classes, and I found it applicable across all fields. The dynamics of the seminar itself are utterly dependent on the roster of students. In this case, I was fortunate enough to have a group of dedicated sociology majors willingto speak up and push the envelope a little. Not every class will have this."
