    "It is a really great class. One learns a lot about guns and gun culture.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It's a little self-selecting in nature, given that the students in the class ranged from military veterans to NRA sharpshooters to Yale pistol team members, but I think that that only added to the discussion. Very often, students are forced to talk about a specific subject they either have no knowledge on or do not care highly for. However, this class was just the opposite. The topic of firearms in the United States spans so many different avenues that these individuals - and others - were able to provide a specific viewpoint that contributed to the overall understanding of how guns are used and abused. The topic will both inspire you and depress you, given that there are so many hurdles to face but so little concrete data or consensus to work with. But if you have any desire to know more about the history of guns and gun control in American society, this is the class to turn to.",
    "This is an incredible class, and Professors Papachristos and Meares are great teachers. Their lectures are usually highly interactive and often operate like a seminar. The class focuses heavily on social science research (criminology, public health research, etc.).",
    "Yeah - it was the only class I've taken at Yale where we grappled with every side of an issue and then took steps to come up with tangible policy proposals. Yale should do more of this.",
    "Take it. The material is engaging and relevant. Papachristos and Meares are hilarious and very interesting. Don't let their intimidating spiel at the beginning scare you off.",
    "Take it. I was relatively inexperienced in the gun world, and it helped me to shape a lot of thoughts around gun issues. It's a great combination of sociology and law. Professor Meares and Papachristos work together extremely well. I had some friends who thought the 8:45 am timeslot was too early, but it worked out pretty well. The class is very interesting and goes by very quickly because of it.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking. However, be prepared to listen to a of debate, sometimes between a few members of the class, and no always on the issues that are most important to you. A true reflection of a controversial, complex topic! The readings are usually extremely interesting and serve as a great introduction to the gun debate.",
    "The course is really good, but it doesn't live up to its potential. The syllabus has great readings, but you don't keep to it. There were days when we left class not having discussed any of that week's readings, which was frustrating.All of this said, if you want to understand American gun policy on a deep, research-based level, this is a great course. You read a ton of research, discuss the policy implications of various findings, and look at the efficacy of different policies. I walked out with very different opinions on gun policy than those I had when the course began. Professor Papachristos is a delight to be around; he's able to distill complicated concepts into simple and digestible tidbits. He's also phenomenally funny.",
    "SOCY 208 is sociology meets law. You will explore both sides when approaching any topic. Professor Meares expects students to come prepared and she will call on you out of the blue. Stay alert all class and be prepared to speak and cite sources. Professor Papachristos will also expect you to have sources when you answer a question in class. It helps to highlight the readings and make short summaries before coming to class. That said, the graded assignments were manageable and often enjoyable.",
    "I definitely would recommend the course. It's just the right amount of work, and you'll get much more out of it than you would get out of about 95% of Yale lectures, where you can easily fall out of the loop and end up skipping class. Class always flew by and was enjoyable. Also, the guest speakers were all amazing--even had someone from the Aurora shooting in to speak, as well as various gun\/crime experts.",
    "A must take if you have any ideas, feelings, or curiosities about the Great American Gun Debate. Terrific instructors. Fabulous. Take it."
