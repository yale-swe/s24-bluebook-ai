    "You have to take it since it's the second half of the field techniques course. It's pretty straightforward, since you mostly work to research independently and write your part of the site report.",
    "Greatest class of all time. First team All-Class selection.",
    "I learned a lot about materials and methods in archaeology, and it was really cool to see that you can date a site and level by corroborating data generated independently by a group of students.It was a sporadic kind of class.You get what you put in (in terms of time, but also in the satisfaction you get out it).I liked learning the technical analytical procedures. I feel like I gained an actual skill.",
    "It's a fun class, you learn a lot about archaeological field techniques and laboratory analysis.",
    "A great course and one completely different from almost every other class at Yale. Offers a hands on chance to explore the full process of archaeological fieldwork from the digging to the analysis. Although the first semester is ordered due to the fact that students go out to the field, the second semester is largely self-motivated (a potential hazard if one underestimates his or her project)."
