   "comments": [
    "Absolutely do not take this course. I can honestly say that I wish that I had dropped this course because it was such a waste of a semester. The information that you learn is merely superficial, and the lectures aren't engaging at all. The tests and quizzes emphasize information that isn't emphasized in lectures. The TA's are unhelpful and are more than willing to make you feel inferior.",
    "Great class! Very interesting material and Professor Kundel is great. The class has an interactive component to it, which is nice for a lecture, and Professor Kundel is very approachable. Tests take some time to study for though so be prepared.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are a non-science major looking for a science credit. It is not a gut class, but it is not terribly hard either. If you come to lecture and study for the tests, it will be okay and you will learn a great deal about the human body.",
    "Yes. This is not a gut science class, but you will learn a lot of material that is not over your head for a non-science major. Great class overall.",
    "The course is perfect for non-science majors who are interested in biology. It was not too much work and it Professor Kundel is wonderful.",
    "This is a great course and you learn a lot of practical knowledge on how the body works. Lectures can get very boring, but Professor Kundel is extremely nice and makes him very available to students. The TAs for the class were pretty good too (although Dong was pretty condescending). This is a good science course for nonscience majors and requires little work for each class, but be prepared to study a lot for each exam and to have to work hard if you want to get a good grade.",
    "A great science credit whether you are science or a non science person. You basically learned the most interesting things about human body. I would strongly recommend this course to another students.",
    "Human Bio has really boring lectures but the professor is so nice that it's semi-bearable. There's not any written homework, just studying before the tests and written responses for 3 sections. But this class made me sooooo sleeeepy partially because it was at 2.30 and also because it was so boring. This class is frustrating because the professor skims over topics and tells you you don't need to know details, just the major structures and functions but then the TAs grade you expecting to know everything.Tests aren't terrible but it's unclear how\/what to study. I don't know if I'd recommend it. It's not the hardest way to get your science credit out of the way, but prepare to be bored.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. The class load is not as heavy as other science courses and the material is very interesting.",
    "really great format with three tests and some quizzes. cool, interactive approach to class, really emphasizes critical thinking. interesting material - moved a little slowly at times in class. professor kundel is great.",
    "Take it! It's great and interesting!",
    "NOT A GUT. there is ALOT to study and tests are hard. Professor is a very nice guy but the class is boring.",
    "I would recommend the class for non-science majors.",
    "Take if for an easish science credit. You will need to do a lot of work for the tests though, since you are required to know the material much more thoroughly than what presented in class.",
    "Great science for non majors that not many people know about. Take this class!",
    "Great science course for non-majors! Lectures were very interesting and the professor is amazing too! We only had to go to three sections, and all quizes and the three tests were non-cumulative. They even drop the lowest quiz score!",
    "I have a love-hate relationship with this course. The material was interesting, and I really liked Prof. Kundel. He was always making nice little jokes in class and seemed like a sweet guy. However, all of his tests kicked my ass! This is supposed to be a class for non-science majors, and it definitely did not reflect that, at least for me. I think the tests should have been easier. The writing assignments were fine, although preparing for and going to section three times during the semester in the evening was kind of a drag. One thing I liked was how easy it was to participate in class. That part wasn't intimidating. Prof. Kundel himself was very accessible and sweet, when I started having trouble with my grades I met with him several times and he helped make me feel better\/point out what I should work on. In retrospect, I should have been studying balls to the wall from day one. Definitely way harder than I expected, and I had two years of high school bio.",
    "I recommend this class because everyone should know basic anatomy. This class does go very in-depth with certain topics but its certainly good to know. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and memorizing for the class, though. There isn't much work besides just reading the chapters of the textbook, paying attention in class and regurgitating information. Paying attention in class is key if you don't just want to forget everything you memorize but understand the information and apply it to real life.",
    "Take this class! It's awesome! The coursework is manageable, and the amount you learn is truly astounding. Plus, there's no lab.",
    "Good course, informative and fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is not particularly science-oriented. If you can remember names and facts, you can succeed in this class. It wasn't the most fascinating course imaginable, but I definitely got something out of it.",
    "Human Biology offers a very comprehensive and in-depth view of human anatomy and physiology at different levels of biological organization (molecules, cells, tissues, organs). I believe the course provides right amount of difficulty for non-science majors. The work is very manageable and engaging. The PowerPoint lectures are very clear and concise as they greatly clarify and focus the material from the textbook. In addition to the lectures are TA discussion sections, which delved more into the topics learned about in class. There are three quizzes and three tests, all challenging with concept based questions, rather than the simple route memorization of facts. Overall, it is the perfect science credit for non-science majors.",
    "It's a great course if you want to learn the basics of human biology without major stress of an intensive bio course. If you do the work, there is no reason for it to be a difficult course, but it definitely requires you to learn the material. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "If you are looking for a good science for non-science majors course, this is it. I would highly recommend it as a fifth class, for example, because it is not too time-intensive. You will come out having learned quite a bit about human biology (or re-learned, as the case may be) and with a science credit!",
    "Wonderful. A rather easy course load and ver interesting. Take it if you're looking for a good science credit and don't want to be completely bored. Three tests are non cumulative. A few discussion sections. Mostly essay writing. Prof Kundel is very kind and helpful.",
    "i would recommend it. low homework load with multiple tests and quizzes",
    "Pretty straightforward course on human biology. Certainly not a \"gut\" -- the material goes pretty in-depth into certain topics (not necessarily AP level, but more like selective AP level). There are probably easier science credits, but this class is straightforward so if you do the work then you'll do fine in the class. If you're not interested in science at all, then I would probably recommend that you take a different class."
