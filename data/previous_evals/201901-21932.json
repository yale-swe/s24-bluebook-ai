    "Increased vocabulary, many new grammatical structures, and introductory literary Chinese.",
    "I learned so much in this course about writing formal Chinese and improved my listening and reading skills immensely. Because we were able to grapple with many conventional issues in this course in the Chinese language, I found myself thinking in Chinese for whole class periods for the first time ever. By the end of this course, I would look at things I wrote in Chinese and feel genuinely impressed with my language growth skills.",
    "This course helped me improve my formal written and spoken Chinese. I learned more formal grammar and vocabulary, wrote lengthier essays, and learned how to discuss complicated topics like democracy and cross-strait relationships.",
    "I learned sentence structure, Chinese culture, and how to write essays. We also learned how to cook Chinese food!",
    "I not only enhanced my Mandarin abilities in taking this course, but I also learned more about relevant topics regarding today's China. By the end of this course, I more proficient in both Mandarin as a language and as a broader field encompassing culture and politics."

   "comments": [
    "The strength of this class lies with the professor. Zhou is an incredible teacher, and cares genuinely about each student's progress. He goes out of his way to make each class engaging. The greatest weakness of this course is its textbook, which is sometimes outdated and dry.",
    "This course is really strong at helping students develop an upper linguistic register, thus allowing them to express complex ideas more accurately and completely as well as better equipping students with the vocabulary and sentence structures to have more understanding of contemporary texts. This course's assignments and tests were quite fair, and I really felt that I learned A LOT in this course without ever really feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Zhou Laoshi's pedagogy in designing the course was thorough, and it was easy to find purpose in all of our assignment. Nothing in this class felt like mindless busy work. This course did not however markedly improve my speaking fluency nor did it help me maintain my ability to write\/draw characters, although its emphasis on students' learning to recognize traditional characters was very useful.",
    "This course is really well done. It is demanding but the Professor is fair and makes a big effort to help all his students succeed. I think all of the assignments were useful and I do not have many ideas for improvement.",
    "Zhou Laoshi is an amazing teacher. His class is extremely organized, easy to follow, and I feel like I learn something new every class. I do not think there are any weaknesses to this course!",
    "The course is very well organized and the workload is perfect. The only improvement could be making details of the course more clear in the syllabus."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's a great way to expand on your knowledge of Chinese from a relatively high level.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who has serious interest in improving his\/her Chinese language skills. However, if a student is not looking to put in a lot of time to interact deeply with the subject matter, it may be a waste of his\/her time. Each night we had quizlet practice that was helpful in memorizing content. A student could easily cut corners and take the quizlet tests with the textbook open or some other aid, but that would detract from his\/her overall interaction with the material.",
    "Take this class! It is less stressful than previous years of Chinese but you will still learn a lot. Professor Zhou is a very fair teacher and he will work with you to help you succeed as long as you are willing to put in the effort. We have lots of creative assignments like making food and also have a lot of oral presentations that helped improve my speaking abilities. I felt that the class was very engaging and I was extremely glad I took it.",
    "I would highly recommend Zhou laoshi's class to any prospective student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in becoming more proficient in Mandarin. The class is exciting, the topics are engaging, and the professor is very adept at clearly explaining subtle differences between characters."
