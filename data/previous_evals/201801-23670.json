    "Personally Nothing very notable, I have learned Spanish outside of a classroom, and this course felt like a structured grammar review, rather then exposre to a new concept\/language. I feel the placement test did not accurately place me.",
    "You get better at spanish, albeit academic Spanish and not necessarily the most practically useful.",
    "I learned new verb tenses and vocabulary. But more importantly, I gained conversational speaking experience from constant talking and listening in Spanish.",
    "I learned Spanish",
    "Spanish language ability",
    "I bettered my ability to speak, read, and write the Spanish language,",
    "In this class, we developed conversational Spanish skills as well as knowledge about Hispanic cultures throughout the world.",

   "comments": [
    "One strength of this course is the emphasis on speaking and using Spanish in and outside the classroom, which I feel is truly the ONLY way to fully learn a language. Weaknesses however lie in the rigidity of this course, Yale has award-winning world-renowned professors, but they are often limited in their curriculum to not expand into teaching material that they want to. Additionally, this course--I feel-- could be taught exactly the same at any University, or even, any High School. The course depends entirely on the textbook, which looks and feels identical to my High chool textbook, and the VHL Supersite, which is the same URL I used in High school. Additionally, this course is not forgiving in the realm of review opportunities, and seems very harsh to stopping and asking for clarification, so I know there were weeks where I would go a while without fully understanding a concept, because I was too busy focusing on the Flash Cultura\/Obra\/etc. due that Friday.",
    "I was excited to come to class with Lorena everyday. A strength of this class is that it was fun and engaging, and it was a great start to my day everyday. The only weakness of this course was that I felt we sometimes did not spend enough time going over the new topics we learned - we often skipped many of the examples that we were supposed to do in class, which made it harder to prepare for the exams.",
    "Less focus on grammar, more focus on speaking",
    "Strengths: class was small and overall enjoyable to go to class Weaknesses: class lacked ample practice excercises for tests. The class lacked structure and overall it didn't appear that the Spanish department took as much interest in the students well being and learning as they should have. My tutor was a necessary substitute to learn much of the material",
    "The strength of the class was the amazing professor. The weakness of the class was the poor leadership and management of the overall course by the course director."

   "comments": [
    "Tentatively, Not unless required to access higher language studies, I fear because the demand for Spanish in collegiate institutions has increased, the quality across the whole of the department's introductory classes has been watered down to accommodate the entirety of the student body (Some of which appear apathetic to the language: In my experience, Spanish as a language is often perceived as a default choice: most high schools in America offer Spanish as their foreign language. As a default, a sense of apathy develops among many students of the language; the culture and ideas become mundane and routine, the words slurred and the identity blurred. Though not through the fault of any person, Spanish in academia is no longer about gaining a form of communication, but instead gaining credit for graduation.) I would like that to change ideally, because this course has a LOT of potential, it just isn't always executed to that extreme.",
    "No. Way too much work",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! I have really enjoyed this class and I feel like I'm actually learning spanish. Nightly homework is annoying but reasonable. All of the spanish language faculty I've encountered have been friendly, engaged, and motivating.",
    "It's a requirement",
    "I would recommend a student to take Spanish only because of its usefulness in the world, not because of the quality of the Yale program, especially when commenting on this level.",
    "Yes. The daily course can help us learn better this language"
