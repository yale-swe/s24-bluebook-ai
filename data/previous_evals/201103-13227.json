   "comments": [
    "I didn't feel that a midterm exam was as useful of a learning tool as actually writing the plans and conducting critiques. It was more geared towards memorization rather than thoughtful analysis.Overall though I learned a lot and found the course incredibly valuable.",
    "The best part of this course is by far working with the individual organizations you choose to write an evaluation plan - it's such a rewarding experience, and the best way to learn the material. The course material itself was fairly intuitive, so the lectures were not as interesting as other courses I've taken, but still an overall great class.",
    "This is a very practical course that provides students with a skillset that can be used in the public health community. As such it is different from most courses at YSPH and a very useful course.",
    "More feedback from the instructor on final projects would have been helpful. Also, gearing exams and assignments towards the final evaluation projects would have helped me get more out of the project (and provide a better final project to the organization).",
    "Excellent course and extremely practical. You pick an organization you have a vested interest in and develop an evaluation plan for them. No hypothetical scenarios (unless you specifically chose to do one) and you physically hand the evaluation protocol to the organization.",
    "Great class! Covers various aspects of programs that are essential to understanding and even developing your own program. It is a lot of material to cover. I would've liked to spend more time learning from the sample evaluation plan to understand how to apply certain factors\/points to my own evaluation plan.",
    "The practical applicability of the lessons learned is a strength of this class.",
    "Strengths: this course offers a very unique skill set that some employers ask about. I think developing a plan for an actual organization is a great opporunity to put your work to a real-world application.Weaknesses: the class was too big",
    "Strengths: Very practical and hands on. Useful and insightful information. Professor has great deadlines, etc. to keep you on track with the final program evaluation paper.Weaknesses: There's a lot about program eval. to cover in one semester so some of the information seemed glossed over; when writing the final paper it was hard to apply some of the material.",
    "Strengths:Very practical knowledgeGreat opportunity to engage with real organizationsLots of learning from other studentsWeaknesses:Lectures are not very excitingReading does not augment ability to complete workWeekly homework would have been good - to complete previous week's section of the plan, perhaps.",
    "Limit the number of students. Or make everyone work in groups. The ppt presentations were not constructive or enjoyable as a result of the large class size.Hypothetical vs. Real evaluation proposals-- those who choose the latter are greatly disadvantaged because proposing a design for measuring real life is much more difficult than making up things (e.g. comparison group, external vars, etc.)Program evaluation is important and this course made that very clear.Also, the beginning slides on ethics were probably the most people in this program have had to learn about ethics. That class on ethics was well presented and needed.",
    "It is a great overview of the evaluation process and did so with an even balance between lecture on theory, practical application, and real life examples."

    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Professor Stevens has a lot of personal experience with evaluation, and spends most of her job doing this on a regular basis, so she has a lot of great tips and points from working in the profession for so long. She's also great about meeting students on a one-on-one basis outside of class as needed, and is a huge help in putting together the final evaluation plans.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Dr. Stevens is an excellent instructor--extremely supportive, excellent feedback. A big asset to YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Dr. Stevens is enthusiastic and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Very enthusiastic, very well spoken and always willing to listen to your ideas\/proposals. Goes out of her way to make time for you.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Dr. Stevens is a great instructor. She engages the class and gives very clear and informative lectures (that do not even feel like lectures).",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0The instructor was always willing and available to provide helpful feedback to our projects.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Dr. Stevens is a great professor and shares very interesting experiences in program evaluation. She is very passionate about the subject and wants us to succeed in learning about it. I thought Dr. Fenton was extremely helpful in providing direct and quick feedback to specific students' projects. It was nice to have two instructors with so much experience avaiable to give feedback due to the large size of the class.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0She is very knowledgeable on the topic and eager to help her students. Might be helpful to hold at least one mandatory one-on-one meeting to talk about the program evaluation.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise was great at being available to discuss projects and providing practical advice on how to move forward. It was clear she has an amazing amount of experience with evaluation. However, her lectures were not very exciting.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0It was at times frustrating that in order to get feedback for the drafts of our projects it was necessary to set up private appointments with the instructors outside of class, because no feedback or grade was ever given.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0I heard the instructor was amazing and that the course load would be worth taking because of her; the size of the course perhaps overburdened her and took away from the attention she could provide students.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise Stevens does an incredible job. She is obviously a leader in her field and has had incredible experience. Dr. Brenda Fenton did an amazing job at supplementing the course and providing additional insight."

   "comments": [
    "Skills\/practice-based course that allows you to work on one project from start to finish throughout the semester. A really crucial course introducing students to an overlooked aspect of public health programming. I would 100% recommend this to other students.",
    "This is a very practical course, which is unlike a lot of the theoretical material we've learned at the school of public health. I would recommend taking this class or one like it before you leave Yale, and it's an easy, rewarding way to understand the material.",
    "This course is great way to learn about program evaluation. If you already have a community health organization or public health program in mind that you'd like to work with, this course would provide a great opportunity to create a useful, thorough evaluation plan.",
    "Well worth the time if you are looking for a practical course to apply to jobs",
    "Great class to take and a must if you would like to learn about evaluation and how programs work.",
    "In this course, you will learn the basics to program evaluation through readings, slides presented by Dr. Stevens, and a midterm exam. However, the crux of the course lies in your final program evaluation plan that you develop throughout the semester as you learn about the different components of program evaluation. Although Dr. Stevens&Fenton were great, I would only recommend this course to another student if he\/she has a specific connection to an organization or a strategic plan to contact a group the he\/she wants to work with throughout the semester. Without reliable people working at the site, the chances of creating a detailed and accurate plan that will actually be used are very slim. It helps if you have previous connections, internship experiences, New Haven ties, etc. to the organization (I, unfortunately, did not have any of these and my plan suffered).",
    "If you're interested in program evaluation, this is the course for you. However, if you don't feel as though that's something you'd want as a tool for later on, the class might not be suitable for you. Need to have the time and communication skills to contact outside program for the final program evaluation paper.",
    "This course is not a lot of work, but if a great introduction to evaluation techniques and styles. It will really help you to think about how programs are evaluated and how important it is to do it right! The lectures are a little slow and there is a lot of unnecessary reading, but overall I highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend it if the class size was smaller.",
    "It is a practical course focusing on program evaluation. It gives great insight, step-by-step instruction on how to best develop a fitting evaluation."
