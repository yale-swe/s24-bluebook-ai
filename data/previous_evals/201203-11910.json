    "A perfect class to fill a science credit for someone who enjoys bio and just enjoys learning. One of my favorite classes I've taken thus far at Yale.",
    "Phenomenal, phenomenal, do it. I am terrified of Science classes (far more than QRs) and this was very accessible to me! I sucked at biology in high school, but in this class I learned a ton while not feeling like I had to work terribly hard. Work is straightforward and very manageable. Kaury is a wonderful woman, extremely sensitive to the needs of undergrads. 5 stars.",
    "This course is awesome! If you are interested in science but not too keen on the meticulous details of it all, this class is perfect for you. I left the class with an outstanding knowledge of the endocrine system and learned a lot about the scientific process in general. The assignments are doable and allow you to write about hormones that interest you. The grading is also generous if you work hard. This is a must take class at Yale.",
    "This may be the absolute best class I have taken at yale. Professor Kucera might actually be an actual angel. She presented the material so clearly. She made science wonderful. She also ended her lecturers with these very engaging case studies. She might be the most caring professor I have ever had. She, unlike almost ever other teacher I have ever had, was aware that we had other things to do outside of her class...especially since her class was not for our major. This is notto say her course was easy at all. Her tests questions were hands down the best crafted questions I had ever seen. They required you to think, not regurgitate information. In an odd way, it was kind of fun to take her tests and quizzes because it was a measurement of not just how well you understood the material but how well you could think through these processes and how they might otherwise apply in other aspects of the body. I was throughly impressed. Additionally, the material is extremely interesting. I understand the human body so much more and am actually interested in science. Not only am I interested, but I actually get it. Before this class, I basically couldn't understand much beyond, I don't know, Bill Nye. Now, I can read a scientific paper and not just understand it but dissect it and critique problems with it. You do have these weely quizzes. At first, they are super annoying but then you realize they make studying for the test so much easier because you aren't trying to cram 8 weeks of material into your head at 2AM. After this class, I almost want to be a scientist...almost. In short, SUCH A GREAT CLASS TAKE IT. TAKE IT NOW.",
    "A science class for non-science majors. Professor Kucera really breaks down the material well for us. The book is rather difficult to understand, but the class lectures are all you really need to know to do well in the class and grasp the basic material. The grading is very fair and is based on a large number of assignments.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It's the best way to get a science credit at Yale. It's so much fun and so interesting and Professor Kucera is INCREDIBLE. The workload is absolutely manageable and you will learn a ton. If you can get in, take it. DEFINITELY.",
    "This is an introduction to the human endocrine system. Meets twice a week - once is a lecture the other is a discussion. Weekly painless quizzes, a couple short writing assignments, and an in-class midterm and take-home final.Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Professor Kucera is the best, nicest, most dedicated, and most understanding professor I have ever had. Her lectures are fantastic - everything we covered was incredibly interesting and I never would have been exposed to it in another capacity. She does a great job of explaining all things technical, and applies each lecture to a medical problem or interesting phenomenon which makes everything more tangible.",
    "BY ALL MEANS, YES, TAKE THIS COURSE. It is the best science credit for non-science majors at Yale. Kaury makes the material manageable, infinitely interesting, and applicable to real life. I constantly find myself dropping fun hormones facts to my friends. It was always a pleasure, never a chore, to come to lecture\/section.",
    "Absolutely -- it is one of the best classes I've ever taken. Excellent. You learn so much and the professor is kind and the workload is not bad at all.Professor Kucera is probably the kindest, most dedicated, most talented professor I've ever met. Her passion for the subject is so extremely contagious, and her knowledge is just so great. She has a particular talent for engendering discussion and interest in the sciences even in non-science majors. If I were the Yale administration, I would do anything in my power to make her stay here. She is one of the biggest assets to this university.",
    "I WOULD 100 PERCENT RECOMMEND THIS COURSE TO ANOTHER STUDENT. If this course is being offered by Professor Kucera you should definitely take it. It has been my favorite course at Yale.",
    "A low stress way for a student interested in biology (non major) to get a science credit. You'll be interested in at least something the class covers, the information is applicable to any student's life. Absolutely recommended.",
    "It's a fairly easy Sc if you put in the work, but that's not what sells the class. The material is all real-world applicable, papers and experiments are designed to get you to think about what goes on around you, and Prof. Kucera is one of the best people you will ever take aclass from at Yale. If you need an Sc, and even if you don't, definitely try to take this class. There's nothing bad about it, and you'll learn a lot of cool stuff. I absolutely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it. Engaging, well taught, and actually fun, without being a burden. It never felt difficult, but I always felt like I was learning. Very little work, but it still didn't feel like a gut because I didn't feel condescended to or like I was wasting my time. Andthe professor is really helpful, fun, and understanding. A great science credit for non-majors.",
    "It's a great class with not too much work where you will actually learn a lot of facts about hormones. Not a class to take if you are a science buff, though. Great SC credit for those less scientifically inclined!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I think it's the best science for non-science majors one could find. Work is light and always a delight. We had lecture one day per week and in-class discussion the other. Instead of homework Kaury gives weekly (short) quizzes on the lecture material--nearly every student preferred this over weekly take-home assignments. Work is generally very light--two papers, a midterm, and a take-home final. I didn't find the material to be as engaging as did some of my classmates, but it was undoubtedly interesting. Kaury is absolutely wonderful.I have never had another professor who cares so much about her students. She encourages constant feedback on what's working and isn't working, and is always up for altering assignments or teaching methods to best fit the needs of her class. She encourages constant discussion, and really emphasizes application over memorization. She's great, this class is great, take it if you get in!",
    "TAKE. IT."
