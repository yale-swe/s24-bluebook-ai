    "I was incredibly excited to see a semester-long course on Goethe's Faust being offered this semester. Ever since our brief journey through Part One in Directed Studies, I had hoped to do a much closer reading of the work. The set-up of the course was perfect for such in-depth analysis, even for us non-German speakers.",
    "This course helped me develop my ability to talk and write about complex literature. I learned how to make connections with different works and incorporate them into a paper, how to present a topic to a class and lead a discussion, and how to participate in a discussion at a high level."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Wetters organized the seminars in a very free-form manner. The liberty in our discussions allowed us to pose interesting questions and make intellectually stimulating side-tracks. That said, I often felt like our discourses lacked direction; people threw their thoughts down on the table without really knowing how to respond to one another. Perhaps having an online forum for discussions and thematic outlines for each seminar might help make the meetings more fruitful and collaborative.",
    "This course was very effective in providing a thorough first-reading of the Faust while encouraging different interpetations of the text as velid keys to the reading process. I very much appreciated that the purpose of the course was not to reach one \"definitive\" reading, but to encourage students to find an individual interprative route into the text, often times a very personal one. I would only have liked slightly more time to give the text a deeper reading, especially towards Faust II."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this work has changed my life, both inside and outside of class! It is worth your time to study it in detail, and you will never run out of things to talk about.",
    "Yes. This class was hands-down one of the best I've ever taken. It was a small course (so there was time for a lot of individual attention, and every student had a chance to present their paper topic to the class and lead a discussion), focused on a coherent topic, and largely guided by its members. The course worked for students of all levels, and Prof. Wetters was a superb teacher. I cannot recommend this course enough.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to most any student at Yale, mostly because the students I was in class with had very different interests which each had applications to the Faust in ways which I had not considered and which were an aid to my own reading."
