   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about marxism, and it changed my views on capitalism. The readings were very helpful in giving insights on many different topics. We learned so many different things throughout this course.",
    "I learned so much. Capitalism, neoliberalism, gender performativity and its weaknesses, the complexity os sexual assault policy. My family is annoyed that every time I call home I manage to bring this class up into the conversation, but it is only because I learned so much, and my world view has been shook.",
    "I really enjoyed reading and discussion texts that many other humanities majors were familiar with whereas it was my first time seeing them outside of my STEM classes. I enjoyed the topics and also the relations we made to compare our conversations to today's world.",
    "how to engage with political economy and economic philosophy and concepts through modern day feminist critiques and implications",
    "I learned a lot of new frameworks for critique. I learned new ways of reading and looking at culture, politics, news, etc.",
    "This was a solid introductory course to gender theory, economic philosophy, and political economy. The most I got out of this course came from the excellent reading list (Butler, Althusser, Foucault) among other philosophers and thinkers who I had never gotten the chance to read before.",
    "I learned how to think critically about the texts we read for the class and the news events happening around me.",
    "I developed an appreciation for feminist readings of both classic political economic texts and more modern ethnographies. More generally, I learned the vocabulary of talking about systems of power.",
    "knowledge about various debates in feminist political economy, sex trafficking and sexual violence, and the methods and insights of feminist scholarship on political economy and culture - super interesting!",
    "This was a great course!",
    "I learned to use multiple readings from different perspectives to write arguments that focused on gender and sexualized and wealth."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: many of the readings were extremely interesting. I loved learning about Professor Fischel's research and his writing. It was the most interesting when we were learning about the professor's own research and what they were interested in. Weaknesses: the course often breezed past topics that really could have taken a whole semester to cover. The whole course was based upon our readings, and we almost exclusively just went over them in class instead of taking them to learn and understand other things. I often felt like discussion section was a waste of time because I was never learning more about a topic, rather, hearing other people's opinions on it that may or may not be relevant. I disliked learning about the cyborg manifesto and attending the symposium. Although it was interesting hearing Haraway herself talk, I only felt like it was worth learning about one other speaker's research for this course.",
    "The professors and TFs were all absolutely wonderful. They cared ultimately about student learning and left a lot of room for students to engage with the material however they would like. I understood the logic of a exam on the last day to mitigate student stress, but honestly, I was really disappointed that I did not get to write a term paper in this course. I learned so much that I would have loved to write about. My only feedback for improvement would be to make the final assignment something more creative-- either an essay, presentation, group project, etc.",
    "I think that it had a lot of interesting and long readings that I didn't always get to finish during midterms\/busier weeks which was unfortunate, but I understand that there was a lot of information that you wanted us to learn in the short amount of weeks. I didn't always understand how the lectures related super well to the reading and some of the readings, I would liked to have more explanation on than the small discussions we had.",
    "The lectures are mind blowing, wonderfully put together, well thought out, and helpful. The reading selection is super interesting and engaging. The writing assignments were also fair and never too stressful. Section was helpful for conceptualizing difficult theories and topics. Overall great and well organized course.",
    "The strengths of the course included the readings, the professors, the new ideas we were exposed to. Weaknesses included the distribution of lecture time and how fast and overwhelming lectures sometimes were.",
    "This course benefited a lot from being co-taught-- both professors brought really amazing insights on one another's lectures, and brought different bodies of knowledge into the classroom.",
    "I think the course could be improved with fewer texts, but a more in-depth treatment and analysis of each text. Lectures could be more challenging if less time were devoted to the biographies of each author, and more towards interpreting the text directly (especially in the case of Butler, Fanon, and Foucault). While the reading list was fantastic, I feel like each lecture only skimmed the surface of many very complicated pieces in a generalized and overly simplistic way.",
    "Sections could be a little more lively. Since many of the topics are so abstract, it's hard to get students to engage directly with each other at the same level of specificity. We're all learning the language of this type of academic discussion, which makes it difficult to communicate (much like in an L1 foreign language class). Perhaps the TAs could push harder to make people articulate themselves more concretely.",
    "strengths: fascinating subject matter, brilliant professors, incorporating professors' scholarship, cool\/relevant concept of including political economy in identity politics department, compelling lectures, good out of class lecture\/conference weaknesses: not too much development of my writing, sometimes lectures felt a bit vague or unfocused, would have liked one or two more larger-scale data applications (like the ted talk)",
    "I really enjoyed the engagement of Professor Grewal and Fischel. I could tell they were both truly excited to teach the class and brought positivity every time. I would push for more in class discussions."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a friend for sure - it was very interesting to learn about capitalism in a feminist context; the class was just different than I thought it would be. If I were to give advice for this course, it would be to take notes on all of the readings as you're going through and reading them for class because the midterm and final were both open note! It would save you a lot of work at the end.",
    "This should be required of every Yale student IMHO.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale and the reason I declared as a WGSS major. Even if you are not totally sure about this class, take it credit\/d and just sit in on lectures and sections. The team of professors and TFs is brilliant and you will learn so much from them and just absorbing the class.",
    "Yes! I think that especially for STEM students that are looking for a good course to explore new texts and learn through the eyes of a humanities student, they would really enjoy it.",
    "Definitely!!",
    "Absolutely. This is the kind of course that affects the way you engage with all the other courses you're taking, and that you'll take with you in all future intellectual pursuits. This course should be a requirement.",
    "110% yes! I wish I had taken this earlier in my time at Yale.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who, like me, is interested in thinking about WGSS themes (including imperialism\/colonialism etc.) and how to put these in conversation with political philosophy. I came away from every lecture feeling like I'd learned something new and relevant. Fischel and Grewal are amazing co-teachers and they complemented each other really well.",
    "I would recommend this course for a freshman or sophomore who is interested in gender theory and political economy and lacks exposure to these fields of inquiry.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student because it has taught to think about ideas that permeate society and the logic behind certain ideologies.",
    "For those who have previous experience with discussing political economy at an abstract level, this course offers some rich new perspectives. For those just passing by (looking for a Cr\/D\/F course, for instance), be warned - there is a strong focus on the philosophical underpinnings of social contract theory, with some very heady texts. This is not a course where you sit around and talk Trump. Even the \"sex\" part of \"Sex, Knowledge, Power\" takes a backseat until the very end of the course, when we get to some of the juiciest topics on the syllabus. For the most part, expect many notes on the structures of political and economic power, viewed through a light feminist lens.",
    "yes, fascinating subject matter and survey of feminist scholarship integrated with sources from liberal\/classical economics disciplines to trace major arguments and feminists interventions",
    "Yes, this course is important no matter what you are majoring in.",
    "I would recommend this course because we explore topics everyone should be aware of in today's climate."
