   "comments": [
    "The most significant thing that I got out of this class was the practice of reading and writing a lot of \"first whacks\" at fiction, which helped me think about my writing a lot. I also feel like I know more about the tools of successful fiction, and how to recognize them in my own and others' writing.",
    "I improved as a fiction writer, learned more about story structure and archetypes, and honed my ability to analyze other creative writing.",
    "This class definitely helped me to work on revising work and look at different ways to approach a story structure and point of view. It also introduced me to the workshop process, and inspired me to want to take more courses like this.",
    "I learned more about my own writing, my strengths and weaknesses, and what it takes to apply myself to improve.",
    "The class was very good at addressing strengths and weaknesses for each person's individual style.",
    "Obviously, writing was the focus, with particular emphasis on things like plot structure and development and general story shape. Also: Giving useful feedback , revising stories based on feedback, and discussing feedback in a workshop setting"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure exactly how to address this, but I think that workshop discussions would have been more fruitful if 1) everybody had to submit feedback beforehand, like at the beginning of the semester, and 2) more pieces had been finished. Maybe setting up those guidelines would help.",
    "If anything, I would have loved to do some more smaller writing exercises to get some practice. The bulk of my writing was the three major pieces that go towards my grade.",
    "I really enjoyed the workshop process, and found the feedback really helpful. The only thing I would change would be to have the stories due a little earlier, because I had trouble reading some of the pieces on time because they were submitted only a few hours before class.",
    "Overall the course is great. The workshops ran smoothly and I felt like my work was taken very seriously. I did feel like some of the vocabulary terms we learned weren't super important, and it might have been better to read more examples of the terms in use. Still, I liked them pretty well, so I don't have any huge critiques of the course.",
    "Strengths: - learned a lot about the structure of fiction, so a good balance between lecture and free workshopping - cultivated a good environment",
    "Honestly, the one thing I thought was less-than-stellar in this course was the vocab quiz at the end. If we'd mostly been putting the terms into practice, I could see the use, but as it was it didn't feel useful and more like a waste of time. Other than that though, I really appreciated Prof. Crowley's feedback and lessons at the beginning of the class, and truly enjoyed the workshop setting. Fantastic course!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they were really interested in workshopping fiction, but maybe not if they wanted to do a lot of reading.",
    "If you can get in, take it. This is a class for people who are committed to writing and committed to improvement. Great semester of work.",
    "Yes definitely. It was really engaging and really inspired me.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn more about yourself as a fiction writer (and read some truly awesome stuff from your peers), absolutely take it.",
    "Definitely. It's one thing to write on your own, but another to have your peers and an eminent writer read and critique your work. After a couple of classes, everyone becomes familiar with each other's style, so critiquing becomes easier.",
    "This is an excellent course, particularly if you already know what sort of things you want to write. Crowley mostly doesn't do exercises or prompts, so you basically get to write whatever, which can be liberating. Crowley's feedback is very useful and he fostered a fun and welcoming workshop environment. I feel we all got to know each other well by the end which, when you're putting your work forward for criticism, is beneficial."
