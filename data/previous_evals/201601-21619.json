    "If you want to continue your Chinese studies before stepping into literature or business Chinese, this is the course for you. It is designed to build up your abilities in everything - reading, writing, speaking, listening, translation, knowledge of culture -- and does its job as expected.",
    "This class is great with Su Lao Shi. It is more work than CHNS, but formatting in the same way and a continuation of the same textbook. There is more vocabulary and you learn more about modern chinese history and current controversies that the country faces today. The kewen topics include bribery within chinese government, economic plight of agricultural labors and china's environmental problems. There is a paper or presentation due every other week and dictation every other week. A lot of the class consists of going through the textbook exercises, but one of the most valuable parts of the class was being able to have discussions about the topics and practicing speaking and using the high level vocabulary. I would definitely recommend taking this class even if you aren't looking to fulfill language requirements because it serves as a chinese class but also a history course.",
    "Incredible class. Best Chinese class I've ever taken. Best class this semester. I always look forward to interacting with sulaoshi. He really cares about Chinese and it shows. He's really chill and you can often get an extension on your work. He knows there is a lot of work for the class so he's never strict about deadlines. I've learned so much Chinese and it didn't even feel like I was working too hard.",
    "Wonderful class. This is basically a continuation of CHNS 162 with the exact same format, but the lessons cover material that is much more difficult, nuanced, and relevant to understanding contemporary China (for example, we talked extensively about the rural\/urban divide, corruption, and pollution in this class). Su Laoshi never fails to entertain with personal anecdotes and other tidbits of wisdom, and I loved the dynamic of the class. Take 163 if you want to improve your Chinese while also gaining a better understanding of an incredibly colorful and multifaceted nation."
