    "Tons of work, very rewarding. Long class periods. Class supplies very very expensive.",
    "Art 114 is a great class to take but it only helps if you are willing to put in the effort and do ur own research and practice. You will learn a lots of ur classmates as well as from the teacher. Prepared to spend some (significant) amount of money on buying material and supplies though. I spent 100+ on papers and pens and stuffs so if you are on a budget you might need to reconsider or buy the material in advance from some more affordable sources (Hull's art store is ridiculously overpriced but most of the time people get stuffs from it out of convenience and urgent need)",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who cares about art. This won't be an easy class to satisfy a requirement, but you don't need to be an art major or excellent at art to enjoy this class.",
    "This class is a prerequisite for more advanced art classes. You get a great introduction to different media and techniques, and a lot of time to practice image-making on your own. The instructor is extremely attentive to what each student needs, and helps the entire time. It is, however, quite a LOT of work. I mean, a LOT. This is no easy class--you'll be practicing what you learn until your fingers bleed. However, with that it is correctly implied that this class is mostly studio-based. If you want more about the history of drawing, or you want instruction on how to frame your ideas pictorially,you won't find it here. This is probably due to the introductory nature of the course, but even so, much can be worked into technical demonstrations\/lessons, but wasn't.",
    "I would highly recommend this class but would say to only take it if you have time to do all of the artwork assigned fully and not rush through the projects.",
    "Yes, good class, grading is a bit ambiguous though"
