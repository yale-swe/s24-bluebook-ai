   "comments": [
    "I absolutely and enthusiastically recommend this seminar to fellow students. The class discussion is interesting, informative, and lively. The professor is attentive, knowledgable, and helpful. The workload is not too heavy. You do read a novel every week and a half, on average, but the reading is genuinely fun and beautifully written. The big assignments are two essays. They are interesting and not too demanding.",
    "As you're aware, the entire course is a reading of works by Jane Austen. Don't take the class unless you like her as a writer!",
    "I definitely recommend the course to anyone looking for a good freshman seminar, a place to talk about Jane Austen, or a manageable writing credit!",
    "Take this class!! Austen is one of the few authors you can read EVERY work for, and it was so interesting to trace her development as a writer through her works. You definitely don't need to have read all her works coming in (I had only read Pride and Prejudice and loved it) and this course was a fantastic way to be introduced to her other works. As far as workload, it's not too bad; it's about a novel every 1.5 weeks, and I just did most of my readings over the weekend. (Reading Austen shouldn't be a chore anyways!) There are 1-page reading responses to every novel, and 5-7 page midterm paper and a 10-12 page final paper. Very reasonable workload, fantastic class, fantastic professor! (Also! Don't be afraid to be a guy and take this course--although I was the only guy in the approximately 15-person class, it was still a wonderful experience.)",
    "A class both for Austen lovers and people willing to experience something different, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "If you love Jane Austen and are prepared to handle a lot of reading, then I would definitely recommend this course to you.",
    "If you are interested in reading Austen, or even if you have read all of her books and would like to know more about them, definitely take this class. Even though the readings were long (a book a week) they were always enjoyable and fun to discuss.",
    "I would recommend it for those who are ready to work on their English skill",
    "Take it if you really love Jane Austen and are willing to work very, very hard on your essays. This class is interesting and fun but you end up getting a bad grade because the teacher has very high standards for a perfect essay.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student who is willing to read a lot of material, can speak up in discussion with a seminar-style class, and can appreciate the works of Jane Austen. If you don't like Austen, you will hate this course. If you love Austen, you will love this course, because the readings won't feel like work.",
    "I would recommend it to any Austen enthusiast. It is quite intense for someone who is only mildly interested.",
    "This course is amazing. I always looked forward to going to class. I would recommend this course to students who already love Jane Austen or have read and enjoyed at least one of her novels. Obviously, if you've never read Austen and end up not liking her books, then you're going to have a hard time.",
    "If you can get into this class, you should definitely take it! It was a lot of fun. There is a lot of reading (~100 pages per class), but it's all Jane Austen, so it goes quickly and I enjoyed it. I always ended up using the reading from this class to procrastinate on my other classes. Besides the reading, there's just one midterm paper and one final paper, plus ungraded reading responses.",
    "English 010 Jane Austen is an in-depth study of the works of Jane Austen. If you like Miss Austen or have never read anything she wrote, you will love this class. It has a strong focus on how the courtship plot and bildungsroman influence and drive each other. A lot of writing is involved but it is pleasurable. I would strongly suggest this class."
