    "I learned that game theory is a very interesting field. Unfortunately, this course gave virtually no knowledge, skills, or insights.",
    "Learned the theoretical foundations behind game theory, along with applicable games and how they pertain to real life. Also learned about the many assumptions and contradictions involved in game theory.",
    "A pretty thorough introduction to game theory, taught at a relatively sophisticated level.",
    "A very difficult course that combines topics in analysis and computer science (algorithms). You definitely get a lot out of it because all the material is incredibly interesting, but be warned - the course and its concepts are VERY HARD.",
    "This was an alright introduction to mathematical game theory concepts. The theory was there but it felt somewhat lacking and not fully developed. Games were interesting, though, and it was nice to learn how to navigate different types.",
    "Through this course, we gained a theoretical foundation in game theory. We learned various models of how people interact in competitive games and saw the proofs underlying how assumptions about behavior lead to certain outcomes. We also learned by actually solving for the various equilibria of simplified games."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We had exactly three problem sets, all given in the first few weeks of the term. Without effective exercises, actually learning the material is incredibly challenging. Since the class had no official textbook and instead provided four \"optional\" texts (but was not organized with regard to any of them), our only option to learn the material was in class lecture. But when dealing with topics as complex as these, it is often impossible to know what you don't understand when you only have one opportunity to hear something explained. This class could benefit hugely from regularly assigned problem sets, better organization, and an official text to follow.",
    "Strengths: course was a huge intellectual challenge, and while my grade may not come out of this course looking super stellar, I definitely learned something new. Office hours were helpful. Slides, when posted, were key to understanding the lectures better. Can tell professor did care about students understanding the material. Weaknesses: Very, very few problem sets. As in three problem sets before the midterm, and no problem sets after the midterm. You can't do well in game theory if you don't have any practice problems. (According to the syllabus, we were supposed to have weekly problem sets. Although students may prefer not to have weekly problem sets, we much prefer having too much practice over having no practice.) Practice problems for the final were released less than 24 hours before the final itself. In addition, professor frequently assumed concepts were obvious when they were not quite that obvious. Not entirely his fault - class didn't speak up nearly enough - but still an issue.",
    "strengths - very challenging material weaknesses - goes way too fast. nowhere near the correct amount of preparatory material available.",
    "Having taken a class with Eduardo before, I personally find him very helpful and fairly clear in lecture, and even more so in office hours. I think this course had some identity issues, in the form of level of rigor and material; it seemed to me like a lot of it was taken out of Fudenburg and Tirole, which is a graduate text and a bit dense to get through even for someone with a pretty decent math background. Eduardo posted pretty good lecture notes the first half, but then none the second half, so it would have been nice at the least for him to provide explicit references (i.e. textbooks) that he had lifted the material from. It probably would have been nice to have more problem sets (only 3, all in the first month!). The midterm and final seemed pretty fair to me, so that's good. Eduardo did a good job illustrating examples in class, but ultimately it is a bit hard to study the abstract concepts and proofs in game theory, then only be asked essentially to apply them on specific games in assessments. Nonetheless, Eduardo is a strong plus for the course.",
    "There were not enough problem sets for us to test our knowledge, but overall the course was well taught with detailed lecture notes.",
    "I think more whiteboard based learning could have been easier to follow - the slides got a little confusing and hard to follow since the Professor tends to go faster when the material is up on slides. Lectures which were purely whiteboard based were much easier to follow. I also think there should have been more problem sets - the ones that were handed out in the first half of the semester were extremely helpful. I certainly wish that there were problem sets in the later half as well.",
    "More problem sets would have been helpful.",
    "Game theory is an extraordinarily interesting subject. This material was an excellent complement to ECON 350 General Equilibrium Theory that is the first part of this sequence, and explains things that general equilibrium cannot. This relationship and the interesting nature of the material form the core strengths of this class. The primary weaknesses resulted from the lack of practice opportunities and poor organization of the course. Game theory can be extremely confusing and there was vastly inadequate infrastructure in the class to support students. There were no problem sets assigned after the midterm, which vastly reduced the workload of the course, but left students unprepared for the final. This problem was magnified by the fact that in the second half of the course, Professor Faingold did not post lecture notes, nor did he follow the textbook that closely, so there were very few ways to practice the difficult material in order to learn it.",
    "The material was very interesting and the overall content selection was solid. However, the course was extremely disorganized such that it was difficult to actually learn. Lectures lacked coherence, we would sometimes skip around topics, and it was hard to see how all the pieces actually fit together. We only had 3 problem sets throughout the entire class, with the last set of problems assigned in early February. That made the weekly workload very low, but it also meant that I had absolutely no idea what to expect for the midterm and the final (which covered material that we had literally seen no material on). We did not get practice problems for either the midterm or the final until literally less than 24 hours before the tests, which made study and preparation very difficult. At the end of the class, I'm not sure I could really apply many of the content that we learned, just because there were so few opportunities to try our hand at actually applying the things we learned in class. That's extremely disappointing to me, because honestly it seemed like the material had the potential to be super super interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely not. This is hands down the most frustrating class I've ever taken at Yale. I've done my best to learn the material, but have been given no opportunities to do so.",
    "You know if you need to take this. You will gain a beautiful understanding of game theory from the course (or at least see what might make game theory so beautiful if you actually understood the subject), but like all good things in life, that understanding will come at a price. (As in a price involving your grade and workload.) Very few problem sets issued. You might think that's a good thing, but trust me - it most definitely is not.",
    "Be careful here. Eduardo does not help much (at all) if you fall behind because there is no textbook, notes are very unclear, he goes way too fast, and does not give problem sets. He gave us just 3 before the midterm, then the final was on material after the midterm but he gave ZERO AFTER THE MIDTERM. This to me is inexcusable. You probably have to take it because you are EconMath, but if you can avoid it or take it later, please do so and try and take it with a professor who will at least give you the tools you need to succeed.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. It's required for Math-Econ, so I guess you probably have to take this anyway, but keep in mind this class will probably be pretty hard if you're more on the \"Econ\" side of Math-Econ. The upshot is, the more math you've taken in life, the better. Eduardo is pretty good and definitely go to office hours. Very few problem sets, but that will probably change in future terms, either because Eduardo writes more or Horner goes back to teaching it. Midterm was slightly tough, if only because of the time crunch, and the final seemed alright (fingers crossed!). Definitely take it if you have any sort of interest in the mathematical analysis of strategic games; even if the games are a bit contrived, they are quite interesting, and the math behind it even more so.",
    "If you want to learn how to apply mathematics in Economics, this is a great course. It is a fun learning challenge and an important experience if you are planning to apply to grad school.",
    "Absolutely do not take this course unless you have to. This was Faingold's first year teaching the course, and honestly it was the worst thing I've ever taken at Yale. His teaching was often confounded by tons of unnecessarily complicated notation, which is fine since this is a mathematical\/theory course, except that he taught pretty fast and also stopped posting notes online after a while. I honestly think he was just so brilliant this seemed really dumb to him, so he didn't really see it necessary to go through things slowly despite genuinely intending to care that we were all understanding the material (which we weren't). There was no good textbook that he really followed, so you couldn't teach yourself. This class was full of really smart people, and it seemed like most of us barely limped through the course. (The text by Osborne is somewhat useful though-something I didn't discover until the last few days of reading period.) The final exam wasn't cumulative, which sounds amazing, except after the midterm he posted zero notes online and also assigned ZERO problem sets. I would've rather slaved over psets for 20 hours a week than have had no work and learned nothing and been screwed for the final. The stuff we learned was by no means simple, and to not really have any way to apply or practice what we learned was really not conducive to our learning. Then he promised us a lot of juicy practice problems for the final, which we all reveled at, but he waited until 6:30pm the night before the final (which was at 2pm the next day) to post eight pages (!!!) of problems. At least the TA Chiara was around to save our asses, but I hear she won't be around next year. Tears.",
    "This is a real math class, not economics. Just be careful.",
    "Honestly, if this course does not change, I cannot recommend it to another student. Obviously, you might be taking this course because you need it for the Econ & Math major, so in that case, just be prepared for a difficult and poorly organized course. The material is actually very interesting, but it requires a good deal of support and practice to wrap your head around. Unfortunately, this semester, it did not feel like there was at all enough of this, as both lecture and section were confusing and there were few practice opportunities provided."
