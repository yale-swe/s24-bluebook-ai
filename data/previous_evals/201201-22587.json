   "comments": [
    "Very good class; Stever and Maruyama sensei are great. The assigned reading material is interesting and relevant, but the true value of the class is in all the random stuff you learn in class about Japan and Japanese.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. You might feel that the progress of the class is slow (especially if you're coming back from a summer program), but by the end of the class, you realize you've picked up more material that you thought (especially kanji). Also, I thought the readings were more interesting than the first semester part of this course.",
    "A great way to continue Japanese: provides opportunity to improve reading, speaking and listening. To work on speaking you really have to participate and sometimes it depends on what the class's dynamic is like.",
    "In Japn 151, you complete readings from the course packet and discuss them each class. Along with each reading, you will be exposed to the corresponding grammar, kanji, and vocabulary. Overall very similar to 150 and as always the Japanese sensei's are wonderful.",
    "It's a good class to continue your Japanese. However, it's heavy on reading and writing. There's some speaking practice, but it's not like the earlier Japanese classes.",
    "Yes.It is effective and efficient."
