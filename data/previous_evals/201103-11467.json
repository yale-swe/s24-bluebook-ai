    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's the second part of a two semester class. The second semester focuses on presenting your research and helps you become more confident. The papers are more or less interesting. I really enjoyed the papers chosen by students because they brought more variety in terms of topics to the class. The instructors are easy-going and you learn to engage in conversation with the top thinkers in the field. Take it!",
    "Highly recommended! The professors are extremely nice and so knowledgeable in the field. There is quite a bit of reading each week but it's definitely manageable and most of it was really interesting. Class only meets on thursdays if there is a guest speaker (so it's essentially once a week on tuesdays). I would caution though that if you're not really interested in the topics that it's not a class you should take since the readings and discussion delve pretty deep.",
    "THE BEST SCIENCE COURSE AT YALE. Every person who is interested in sciences must take this course.Let me elaborate: 1) Brilliant professors and plenty of them; 2) It's a science seminar - an endangered breed nowadays; 3) Reasonable workload; 4) SUMMER research - they set you up and fund it too!; 5) Guest lecturers - they swoop in every few weeks, young researchers at the cutting edge of their field, and then you get to eat with them on the class, you feel like colleagues by the end; 6) the material is incredibly relevant - evolutionary medicine is about to make the big show - don't be surprised to see more and more classes on this topicacross the country in coming years.",
    "Take it if you love it because the class feeds off of the interest level of the students :)"
