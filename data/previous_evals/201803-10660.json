Overall I have a better grasp of the bigger picture of epic and lyric poetry and learned through this course how to synthesize the big picture with the little details.",

    "The greatest strength of this course is that we get through a significant amount of Greek in a very short time. One thing that could help is if we more systematically tackled the background information for each poet (perhaps grouping each poet by date or by genre\/style\/content for the lyric poets would help).",
