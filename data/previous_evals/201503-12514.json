    "Definitely recommend if you love spanish and are not intimidated by creativity and imagination as well as a healthy load of homework and writing. I would add this is very popular among native speakers so if you are not native can be super intimidating. Do not take this if you do not want to lose confidence in your grammatical abilities.",
    "A really fun way to express creative freedom in your second language! Not too much work, just some readings and a piece a week, and anyway I thought it was so fun that I looked forward to doing it. For anyone who doesn't need much more work in grammar or vocabulary in Spanish, this course is a great way to test your skills, learn more about Latin American literature, and enjoy an artistic outlet.",
    "It's a course about Spanish and Latin American literature (poetry, short stories, very short stories, fables) and techniques authors use to write. Great class.",
    "There's a lot of reading and writing in Spanish, so definitely take the class if you want to explore and\/or improve in those areas. The professor is fantastic, and the class is actually a lot of fun - one that you'll look forward to every day!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! I would tell them that it wasn't easy, but that it was a fantastic and super fun class to take. You get to practice creative writing in another language--how cool!",
    "This is a class I recommend for everyone who wished to take an L5 course and have fun doing so. It is a great opportunity to practice Spanish a lot and to be surrounded by great topics and by a great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The course balances readings and analysis with shorter exercises and longer (often workshopped) assignments. In addition, the small class size is very conducive to encouraging regular participation and engagement.",
    "This class is a needle in the haystack in the spanish department. For someone who didn't want to take a grammar or lit class, this was basically the only one offered during the semester. It ended up being a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be! Profesora Jordan was caring and very helpful throughout the semester. There are daily readings\/assignments in the class, and a couple of assessments throughout the semester. If you get in, take it!"
