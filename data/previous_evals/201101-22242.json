   "comments": [
    "Pretty good course and great because it gives you such a scope of different authors. It introduced me to authors I otherwise would not have come by and so it was fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who can take it",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Interesting, educational, fun.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in reading some of the best Italian literature out there, from the most famous (Macchiavelli, Boccaccio) to the lesser known writers. You do not have to be an Italian major to really get a lot out of this class.",
    "This class is unmissable. The readings are all very interesting, and they are drawn from the major canon of Italian literature. Prof. Sodi does a wonderful job, and she ensures that the class discussions are always very interesting and complex.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for another student. The literature covered was a perfect overview of the most influential and important Italian works.",
    "If you are interested in reading and discussing Italian classics such as The Prince and Il Gattopardo this class is definitely for you. However if you do not have time to be reading a lot a of novels you might want to try a different class because this course is definitely reading intensive. There are a few small presentations throughout the semester, 2 short essays and 1 long final essay as well as a final presentation and a final exam but all in all the work load is that of any other yale course."
