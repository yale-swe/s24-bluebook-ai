    "Great discussion and topics. Ne and exciting material outside of undergraduate economics courses.",
    "I knew very little about the financial system, central banking, and what REALLY happened in 2008 going into this course. I think I am much better prepared now to talk about the causes and echoes of the GFC after this class, as well as a growing interest in central banking. Obviously, we will never know for sure what happened in 2008 and why it went down the way it did, but I am much more comfortable talking about what might have happened and backing that up with facts. Also, having to write 3 memos throughout the class was a really great way to try my hand at quickly understanding something I had never been exposed to before and creating my own thoughts on the topic. A great skill for the future regardless of what you do.",
    "I actually started to understand how finance works, and I learned how inaccurate the narrative of the crisis is in popular opinion.",
    "You learn literally everything about the 2008 Financial Crisis and the different opinions about why it happened.",
    "I learned about the major factors involved in the financial crisis of 2008, its major causes and consequences, and the policy responses that followed.",
    "Everything you could want to know about the Global Financial Crisis, and pretty decent amount about the history of crises in general.",
    "Great class! Incredible insights from Metrick and Geithner.",
    "Solid understanding of financial crises and lens to view financial stability."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Metrick is a great and interesting lecturer. Timothy Geithner is as well, but his lectures were a bit boring.",
    "Strengths: Really liked the flipped structure of the class, very flexible, decent workload (although beware people who are not used to writing lots: the class was 3- 4 page memos, 2- 6 pages response papers, and 1 12 page final research paper) Weakness: Without a strong foundation in talking about the financial system, I felt like I was out of my depth at times. I know Prof Metrick makes the class so that you don't really need a foundation in finance to be able to get through this class, but I do think it would have been very conducive to understanding the material on a deeper level",
    "Great course overall, but the curve for undergraduates is harsh. I also would make TAs more available to students, and have them comment the assignments more thoroughly.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is Andrew Metrick. He is by far the greatest lecturer I have ever been taught by at Yale or elsewhere. His speech is incredibly clear, and when it is unclear, he is conscious of it and will provide additional background\/details in order to clarify it. The material is also just very interesting, so it is not difficult to be engaged with the course. I don't think the backwards classroom aspect is necessarily a weakness of the course, but it isn't very conducive to having undergraduates come to class. The Q\/A sessions after the modules are often repetitive, and simply do not need to go on for 80 minutes. Filling this classtime with a case study or a lecture focused on one of the modules (ie. a full lecture of AIG or Merrill Lynch during the crisis) would be much more helpful than answering questions. There's a lot of interesting material that isn't covered fully in the modules that would be better to use classtime for.",
    "Strengths - great to have so much time for questions, two professors with different styles complemented each other Weaknesses - a few more lectures would have been a nice combination with Q&A",
    "Strengths: This class was one of the most \"polished\" classes I've seen at my time at Yale. I somehow wrote 36 pages, read two books, watched 20ish hours of online lectures, answered a dozen quizzes, on top of attending class without ever feeling particularly overwhelmed. Professor Metrick is AMAZING and the structure of the class is fantastic (flipped classroom). Weaknesses: This should clearly be a Writing Credit!!! Also the TFs' grading is somewhat suspicious. I'm not a huge fan of having 6 page papers being graded on a 10 point scale. This is probably just a \"me problem,\" but it happened twice that I submitted a paper and realized I had a major flaw in my reasoning that represented a serious misunderstanding and got back a 10\/10 with just the comment \"Great work.\"",
    "Could use more small groups",
    "Professor Metrick is a fantastic lecturer; the material is interesting and very relevant to understanding what goes on in financial markets in general and particularly during crises"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! I think it is really interesting in that it bridges SOM, Yale College, and Law students. You have to go in and kind of not care about your grade, but you will learn a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course!! It's a front-loaded, so you'll enjoy it if you make sure you do a lot of work to understand the terms in the beginning. Metrick is an amazing teacher; Geithner isn't the most eloquent public speaker but it's amazing to have the opportunity to ask him questions about the crisis. I recommend it not only to people interest in finance\/econ, but to anyone who wants to understand the facts behind an incredibly important and misrepresented event (bonus point: you really don't need an econ background, and there are no exams)",
    "Probably the best econ elective out there. Andrew Metrick is my favorite lecturer I've encountered at Yale; he's incredibly clear and engaging. The classes taught by Geithner were actually very boring and he doesn't bring a lot to the class. The workload sounds like a lot but is actually very manageable. The only difficult parts were the 2 6-page response papers and 12-page final paper, all at the end of the class. If you're good at managing your time, this class is a breeze and one of the best classes you'll take at Yale. Even if you're not good at managing time, you should still take it. The material is incredibly relevant and so well taught. These are the types of classes you come to Yale for.",
    "Yes! Great course, interesting material and very engaging professors",
    "Yes!!! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale! I'm so glad I took it, but I definitely took it for the wrong reasons. 1) Do not take this class for Geithner. He is shockingly dry. I'd read his memoir before class and was expecting some fieriness. But honestly if I didn't know what Geithner and Metrick looked like before the class, I bet I'd guess that Metrick was the former Secretary of the Treasury (\/New York Fed President). Geithner just stares at his feet murmuring unconvincing answers to the questions for the class. And often, he'll actually ask Metrick to step in. This is all okay because he only comes for a handful of classes during the term (and it's always a great opportunity to figure out who the snakes are in the class -- they'll show up just for Geithner not Metrick). Take the class for Metrick. You probably don't know who he is (I didn't really), but you should. 2) This class is a significant amount of work. I don't care who you are, the sheer volume of assignments will take time. I've taken other classes that cover similar topics and find the Crisis fascinating, so I errantly assumed this class would be a light workload for me. This was not true at all. 3) If you're not super familiar with econ, I think this class would make an amazing Credit\/D. You will learn so much from attending class and just listenign to Metrick talk.",
    "Definitely take this course! Really interesting lecture material, Professor Metrick is a fantastic speaker. You really get a great understanding of the GFC through lectures, guest speakers, etc.",
    "Yes - incredible class.",
    "Yes - solid class and Geithner is interesting.",
    "Absolutely! It is so well taught, very interesting, and one doesn't need a background in finance at all to enjoy and do well in the course."
