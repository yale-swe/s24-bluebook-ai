    "The atmospherein this class is not very active, not very like a communication class, but more like an acting class, or PRETENDING class.The teacher is very careful and thoughtful, but the homework in this class, I think, is not very helpful as lots of them are just FORM. Form is important, but students prefer to learn something DRY and SOLID, if they cannot learn in a fun way.",

    "that the course taught many fundamental things which one many not have chance to look at. E.g. how to frame ideas, what structure should be used to answer any question, presentation roadmap etc.",
    "The best thing about this course was that you get to measure your progress in communication from the beginning of the course with the initial assessment to the end of the course with the final assessment.",
    "The best thing about the class was the discussion sessions every Monday. It was when we could really work on the skills we learned the last week. I think the discussion sessions were longer and focused on those who needed more help.",
    "Lot of inputs by the instructor",
    "Give many useful skills and culture background, vey helpful to international students."

    "Pace of the course - there was too much information and material to be covered in a short period of time.",
    "The writing skills could be taught in more detail.",
    "The hours for the practicum were late during Monday, for this kind of activity a morning session suits better. Some students didn't take the practicum sessions seriously and that lessened the impact they could have had on the rest of the group.This course didn't have a TA and maybe it would be interesting to experiment and have a TA who holds individual practice sessions with each student to do oral assessment. I believe this would be more useful than going to a communication coach, since it would follow the course syllabus more than what the student wants to work on. This is not saying that the communication coaches aren't a good help, it is only in regard to practicing the course materials.",
    "It should be more practical based with more time for discussion and practice of skills learned in the class.",

    "I advise to make it compulsory for all, may with some moderation. If not possible then it will be in the interest of the reputation of University like Yale that the office bearers of Clubs, Associations etc., who are organizing or interacting a lot ( almost daily) with the graduate folks through emails, meetings, letter writings, workshops, lectures etc should attend this course. It will facilitate in the improvement of culture and reputation of the University."
