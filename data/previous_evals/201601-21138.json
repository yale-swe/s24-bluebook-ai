   "comments": [
    "Yes, it made me a lot better at arguing. It also exposed me to a lot of new, sometimes radical, political views.",
    "Public Opinion is a good class is you don't get far-left leaning TFs that make it a point to publicly disagree and argue with the professor every class.",
    "I found the content of this class to be interesting and thought-provoking. The role of public opinion is a constant question that political scientists continue to grapple with. That being said, the readings all often felt like more of a defense of the professor's view than actually covering the various perspectives on the issue. Especially in the articles of his own, it was clear that the class was presented from a quasi-libertarian approach with little conflicting course materials. This made the course much less engaging and helpful than I anticipated going in. The TAs did their best to correct for this bias, but overall, I still feel like the class concluded and I only know one side of the argument. The current professor, however, does not appear to be returning to teach next year, so I highly recommend the class if it is a different instructor. Furthermore, in its current form, the class is fairly low work, with weekly readings, an occasional pop quiz, and one ten page paper during reading week.",
    "Nice 5th class",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because I found it pretty boring. Maybe take it if you are looking for a political science class.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class to anyone, I think Prof. DeCanio is leaving though.",
    "I would recommend this class to students without background in politics or political science but who want to learn about voter ignorance and the information problems in US politics.",
    "10\/10 would recommend #lit",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The lectures are run poorly, and though the reading was very interesting and the final essay was honestly very enjoyable to think through, the class is only beneficial for the lack of work it requires. Easy credit, but DeCanio is very difficult to listen to and he seems to be trying his hardest to persuade us to not like democracy.",
    "A relatively easy class with an awesome lecturer in DeCanio. Workload is one 15 page final paper and a few pop quizzes on the reading scattered throughout the year, so very light and manageable (readings are rarely more than 15-25 pages). The biggest reason to take this class is DeCanio - he's an extremely interesting and entertaining lecturer who does a good job of incorporating class participation organically into his lectures without forcing the issue too much. I would definitely recommend this class as a fantastic 5th course if you are at all interested in the nuances of American public opinion, and even if not I would highly recommend any PoliSci major take a class with DeCanio before graduating.",
    "great course",
    "Yale lost the best class on campus.",
    "A great intro class to help you decide if the field of political science is right to you",
    "A must take class at Yale.",
    "Some readings are interesting, but lectures were dry and you had to attend because of potential of pop quizzes.",
    "Good class for basic politics! Sometimes repetitive but good fun!",
    "Yes i would recommend to other students. Awesome class to take",
    "Kind of an epic class, with some in-class quizzes at the end and a paper. Little work and a unique perspective on American democracy."
