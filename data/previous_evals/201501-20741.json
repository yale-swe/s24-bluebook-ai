   "comments": [
    "A lot of material but well explained and very relevant to research. I would definitely recommend the class because it helped me better understand research in the field and was overall very interesting.",
    "It is a laid-back class, but you can make it tough if you are self motivated and dig into the subject matter.",
    "Despite the interesting material, I would not recommend this class. It is too loosely structured and doesn't have clear learning objectives, or regular assessments to help students determine if they are meeting those learning objectives. Prof. Loria is very knowledgeable and very friendly, but his teaching style consists mostly of copying material onto the blackboard. There are much more effective methods of helping students learn. Incorporating a diversity of teaching methods, engaging the class with questions and active participation would do make this class a much better learning experience.",
    "The course is a great introduction to graduate level biochemistry with a focus on enzymology. The course is good for any chemist with an interest in biological chemistry.",
    "Good introduction to enzyme kinetics. Useful for anyone in biochemistry or organic catalysis.",
    "Great detailed coverage over kinetic models and methods for experimentation",
    "Yes!! It's a good course to take when you want to learn about something outside of your field.",
    "The course covers the fundamentals in the understanding and determination of biochemical rates and mechanisms. While an emphasis is on the biological systems, the information can be transposed onto other applications and be used to study a variety of kinetics and thermodynamics of any system. I would recommend the course to any student who wants a more in depth understanding of studying kinetics and mechanisms in a biological context.",
    "Rates and Mechanisms gives a detailed overview of the theory of enzyme catalysis on the chemical level and backs up that theory with case studies of different systems that represent the various concepts of the course. I would absolutely recommend it, especially if you are studying anything on the kinetic level, even if catalysis is not explicitly part of your interests. The principles of allostery are covered in detail and were very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I gained a better understanding of enzyme kinetics. Many of the topics we covered will be helpful in my research.",
    "The course exposed me to other areas of chemistry and shed some light on the applications of organic molecules and other techniques from organic synthesis.",
    "This course was helpful for expanding my understanding of biochemistry and enzymatic transformations. This information is useful for expanding my horizons outside of organic chemistry and for better understanding kinetics for catalysis, which will be useful in my dissertation.",
    "Although entirely not related to my field, it really gave me the opportunity to observe how the link between biology and chemistry. Very eye-opening.",
    "The course linked together many concepts that were introduced in undergraduate and expanded upon the basics of kinetics in a biological context. The course will allow me to better understand the determination of kinetics and thermodynamics throughout my research career.",
    "This course absolutely helped me build a foundation for my research. Studying transient binding kinetics depends heavily on the concepts discussed in this course and working with reaction mechanisms really helped to connect things back to chemistry."
