    "In-depth coverage of the biology of Malaria, Lyme, and a few other vector-borne diseases. Like the title, that's what the class is about. BUT THIS CLASS IS SO FREAKING AWESOME. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT. Best one I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to another student. The workload is manageable, not too much reading, and the material is so interesting!",
    "The perfect science class for non-science majors. Prof. Belperron is very nice and explains even the very basics so you won't feel lost. Plus, when the slides have something complicated on them (chemical formulas or anything like that), she'll tell you you don't need to worry about that.The subject matter isn't the most interesting but the workload is very light and I was able to do fine without doing all the reading. Take it with a friend and you'll enjoy it. Studying for the quizzes isn't hard if you just listen during lecture. The final paper is also very manageable.Plus, no final = super clutch.",
    "This is a good course to fulfill a science requirement, as there is basically no reading and it is quite interesting. The quizzes are difficult, but the midterm and the final paper\/presentation are not a lot of work. Helpful if you are interested on combating malaria in Africa in particular.",
    "This course teaches non-science majors about malaria, lyme, and other vector-borne diseases. It went into in-depth analysis of malaria and lyme disease, so be prepared to learn a lot of technical stuff about these two diseases and not much about other diseases. I would recommend it to another student if he\/she doesn't mind that most of the work will be rote memorization. Also, although it's a science credit for non-science majors, it's definitely not a gut - you'll have to spend time learning the material for the various quizzes, midterm, and the final paper is long and takes a good deal of research.",
    "You learn a ton about Malaria and Lyme disease. What you learn can be applied to other diseases, so it's not a waste of time. I would recommend taking the class.",
    "This course is an encompassing look at various vector diseases throughout the world. Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 106 breaks down comprehensive medical and immunological topics into understandable pieces for non-science majors. By the end of the course, students will be well-versed in Malaria, Lyme Disease, Babesia, and other pathogens which burden the world. The class also looks to the future, as the final project is planning an intervention to help ease the suffering caused by these diseases.",
    "It's a good science class for non-science majors...although I still struggled with the tests\/exams (as a non-sci major). The final project is a panel discussion+ paper which was great.",
    "I would reccomend this class to another student. It is the first science class that I have found at Yale that was both accessible to non science majors and intellectually satisfying.",
    "I totally recommend this class. It rocked. Especially with Professor Belperron, who was really awesome.",
    "Malaria was a really fun science credit. The subject is really interesting and the class is relatively low-key because it's so small. You have 3 quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 paper and 1 panel presentation. It may sound like a lot but the quizzes and midterm are pretty standard and the panel and paper are fun if you choose a good malaria\/lyme\/or other disease intervention. Professor Belperron is the nicest person and most helpful. You should definitely take this if you're looking for a slightly more legit science credit and you've taken bio before and you're interested in real-world application.",
    "It was a good intro level biology course with enough science content and was not very difficult for someone with no biology background. Workload was well spread out with a few quizzes, a midterm, and a presentation\/paper. I would recommend this class for anyone needing a science credit.",
    "Take it. great science credit"
