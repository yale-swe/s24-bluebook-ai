   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interest in film or trying an art class. So much fun and you learn a lot",
    "Intro to Digital Video is an awesome class, a really great venue to try out making videos\/films\/art even if it's not something you've done before. There are four projects throughout the semester and only a few readings along the way. It's very doable as a fifth class, and I'd definitely recommend it anyone if Sarah is teaching.",
    "You watch videos in class whenever you're not learning how to use Photoshop and final cut. And then you make four videos of your own. It's great!",
    "This course is a solid introduction to video art - critiques are lowkey, the course is a brief introduction to digital video. If you have no experience with video, you'll come out of this class with a solid technical and artistic education. If you're new to video art but not digital video, you may find the technical aspect boring, but the video art education is invaluable.",
    "Cannot recommend this class enough. It's a pretty diverse class in the sense that people come in with different intentions and are each able to develop something based on his or her own interest. By the end of the semester we all grew in our own ways. Sarah is amazing. She is super fun and supportive and really sets a positive tone for the class. Amazing amazing.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class for anyone trying to take an art course and anyone who has interest in video making. It was a great introduction into the technical side of video making as well as the artistic side of it.",
    "Strengths: Good teacher who knew the important things to teach, was very understanding and encouraging, and the material was interesting. Weakness: Not enough time, so many things to learn, yet I felt so rushed through all of them, I wish we could have picked one topic to focus on intensely. Also wish there had been more equipment and more computers with final cut pro. Lots of work, so credit D it or take it in a light semester. Grading also kinda arbitrary, not sure what my grade is gonna turn out to be like. Or how the grading is done.",
    "I would really recommend this to any student who is interested in learning video skills or in being creative."
