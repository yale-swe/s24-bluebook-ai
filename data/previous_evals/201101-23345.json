    "I didn't love all of the discussions that we had--I'm not sure how to improve those, but I just didn't think we were engaged enough or interested by all of the questions posed in class. Most of the invited guests were interesting. Overall, I'm grateful for the exposure to the land trust community that I received in this class that I wouldn't have received elsewhere.",
    "I didn't know much about land conservation before taking this course. I got the broad survey I wanted, plus met numerous leaders in the field.I can't say enough about Brad's intelligence and skill in a course like this. From engaging students in dialogue, introducing and synthesizing a range of topics, and bringing in really interesting speakers, Brad just excels at this course.",
    "Land conservation is my focus here so this course was extremely valuable. The guest speakers were very informative and interesting. I wish we had the title tracking workshop but there are other opportunities to get that.",
    "This was a great course from a theoretical and practitioner point of view.",
    "The class is based around a clinical project in which students partner with various local land conservation organizations. The clinical project was a wonderful opportunity to begin to think about how the various topics and discussions we had in the class portion could play out in a professional setting. The clinical project is a wonderful component of this course."

    "The speakers were great, the class approached conservation from a number of different perspectives, and I really appreciated the underlying questions of \"who are we conserving land for?\" and \"what drives people to want to conserve land?\"",
    "Professor, class format\/discussion, clinical",
    "The course has a well-defined structure and direction, and the material builds over the course of the semester. Yet, each week we had a different practitioner in as a guest speaker to share their experiences on a specific topic. The course thus drew upon a diversity of experiences and perspectives but also succeeded in maintaining a coherent direction and additive material."

    "I sometimes had mixed feelings about the question and reaction writing assignments we did every week. I think they should be kept, but I wonder if there's a way to keep them fresh and not seem rote. Maybe I could have done better at that myself.",
    "It would be nice to make the online forum more like a forum and less like an area for simply posting. Many folks said remarkable things- it would be nice to air them out a little bit via more discussion online.It would be nice to talk about energy siting issues and how energy folks can work with land conservationists.",
    "Can't think of anything.",
    "Out of class time sessions",
    "Clinical projects can be hit or miss, and I was working on a clinical project that did not feel as if it was a big priority to the partner organization. I was a little down on the project until the very end, when I really started to write the plan - I really enjoyed producing the plan and finalizing the project and in retrospect got more out of the project than I had realized during the course of the semester. I think that was more a function of my ability todevote time to it rather than the project."

This course then fit extremely well in my program of study here, and, together with other courses and experiences I had the opportunity to explore this semester, has helped shift and reshape my understanding of conservation and how I will be working in the future."

    "The clinical project is important, and think hard about what you want to get out of the project. I simply read the project descriptions and keyed in on ones that sounded interesting. I would, in retrospect, try to think about what skills or knowledge I wanted to develop through the semester, and try to select a project based on that. I didn't take advantage of the post-class dinner opportunities during the semester and wish I had - do so if you can."
