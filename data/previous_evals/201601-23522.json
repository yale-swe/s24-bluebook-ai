    "great class if you're interested in learning about the health of women and children.",
    "Interesting material, assignments were also interesting and fair. Not a challenging course at all",
    "Good course - I wish the topics were covered in a more in-depth manner though. I'd like to see more statements in the slides cited with the studies that created the evidence. Many of the topics were covered in a very general sense. I also with the three written assignments had been spread out more throughout the course. It made the workload very heavy on the back end of the course and I think we had the necessary information to do some of the reports, especially the immigrant health one, earlier in the course. It would be great if a trip to Hartford to see lobbying in action could be integrated into the course",
    "This class was great! I learned a lot about health policy in relation to women and children's health through Mary Alice's class. She provides students with powerpoint slides to take notes on while she is presenting, which is really nice. However, I wish we used less paper for the reports that we present together in class to be more environmentally friendly. Having powerpoint slides is fine but we should limit the number of pages we print out for the 2 reports we share in class (different country's MCH policies and immigrant group in the US). Everyone ends up with 18 different copies of their classmates' reports, which don't get read and disposed of properly.",
    "This was an amazing course! I learned an incredible amount about the health of women and children. Everything we learned felt very applicable to the real world and I feel much more prepared and equipped to work in this field going forward. Definitely one o the best classes I've taken at Yale and I'm very happy. It was practical assignments, knowledge, and lectures -- YSPH at its best!",
    "This is a pretty good course to learn about how health policies impact women and children. I think this course had a good bit of overlap with the required policy course in the beginning which made it get off to a slow start. The assignments seemed really random and not particularly useful to the course material. I think the course would be better served by restructuring some of the assignments. Also, the presentations were not really that fair. For example, only a handful of students gave their testimonies and were graded on their presentation while the remaining students were graded simply on a single question to the testifying students.",
    "This course provided a lot of useful information about maternal and child health, as well as relevent policies, both in the US and abroad."

    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0I really like her lecture style",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Very responsive and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Well prepared",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Good instructor - I just wish she had gone into more depth in her lectures. Her rubrics were very useful, but it seemed weird that things were graded as done vs. not done rather than on a scale of how well they were done.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice is a sweetheart! She cares a lot about her students' feedback and tries to answer all questions to the best of her abilities. She has straightforward guidelines for what she expects in the report assignments, which are helpful. I find the in-class report discussions to be the most fun part.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She's incredible - very knowledgeable on the topics she covered, very understanding; she knows how to create assignments that are interesting and helped us to learn, and she was willing to adjust them if necessary.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice Lee cares very much about her students and is incredibly knowledgable about the subject matter. I'm thrilled to get to know her, mostly because she cares so much. The only criticism I have is that she's not harsh enough of a grader--she should maybe have higher standards in the future to push students to do better work. Also, she could maybe provide more detailed feedback about assignments with more constructive criticism. Other than this though I'm very happy with her teaching style and the course overall.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0I like the fact that Mary Alice has real world experience in women and children's health. It is helpful to gain a real world perspective on the policies and issues discussed in class. Discussing the history of women's health was interesting and thinking about some of the implications of women's health and the role of policy within them was interesting. I think Mary Alice could be a bit more organized. Her evaluation forms of assignments don't always match up with the syllabus which made things difficult. Also she sent emails directly instead of posting all the resources besides the class slides on Classes V2 so I ended up relying on my classmates a good bit to find out what information about the class had been shared.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0The instructor was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the course material, and provided helpful feedback on assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Great class if you're interested in learning about the health of women and children.",
    "Good course, reasonable amount of work but backloaded, very general overview of topics",
    "This course offers a great overview on topics related to maternal and child health. However, for a policy course, I think it was a bit lacking in the policy aspect - both the historical policy timeline and in the current issues facing the area in the present. Each lecture is its own topic and touches upon both history and current issues, but only very quickly.",
    "A great class to take if you're interested in learning about how US policies affect maternal and child health. I left the class feeling angry with the US but hopeful that there are good changes in place to remedy the disparities in care for our women and children here in comparison to other countries that treat their women and children a lot better. Informative, interesting, and low-key.",
    "10\/10 would recommend.",
    "An amazing course that really equips you to work in the field of women & children's health. Not a very hard course, but it provides really practical information about how to improve health. I'm very glad I took this course, learned a ton of new information. Definitely would recommend for other students, in HPM or outside.",
    "I learned a lot from this course about maternal and child health issues and policies, as well as the process of preparing testimony. I would recommend this course to another student also looking to learn about these topics."
