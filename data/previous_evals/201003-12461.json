   "comments": [
    "It was a good overview of stats, but there is no section which makes it somewhat difficult. Getting a good TA is crucial.",
    "As interesting as the final few weeks are, I cannot recommend the course as a whole. The first eight weeks fall into all the traps of a large lecture course and personal contact is limited. Whilst my own TA was excellent, help sessions were often run by others who didn't appear comfortable with the content of the course. I would, however, take another course with David Doherty, whose leadership of the Political Science lectures in the last six weeks was superb.",
    "TRy to keep up and you will do fine. The curve will help you",
    "Its useful information to have at your disposal.",
    "Shop the class. If possible wait until you are assigned your TA. Then decide whether or not to take the class. The professors are absolutely fantastic. The TAs are \"god-awful.\" With certain TAs it is literally impossible to get an A. This class is destroying my GPA whereas friends of mine with different TAs are walking away with an easy A. It is very relative.",
    "Good overview of basic topics in statistics",
    "Useful. Yeah. Take it. Relevant and not grueling QR.",
    "Stats 102 was frustrating for the first part of the class, but more enjoyable and helpful for the second part (the actual poli sci portion of the class). I'd recommend the class, but be cautious. You have to be proactive about finding your own way to learn, (books, study groups, searching out the best TA) because you won't get it from all of the lectures or all of the TAs.",
    "Statistics 102 is a class for people with interest in understanding the conceptual basis of regression that is used for political science studies. If you are interested in an in-depth, mathematical experience, you will not get it there. But, if you are really a poli-sci person, and want to be able to understand those graphs in the journals that you comb through for a paper, then this class will help.",
    "If you've taken stats before, you'll probably enjoy it. I was extremely stressed out for the first half, though.",
    "A good intro to Statistics. Homework can feel like busywork at times, but overall a valuable class.",
    "No. I wouldn't recommend this class to my worst enemy. I hated it.",
    "It's a really useful introduction to stats. The sections are nice, because they frame the statistical analysis within a topic that you actually might be interested in. Take it, it'll be good for you.",
    "Intro stat. I don't know much else to say about it. I enjoyed the second half of the class more when we talked about real, political examples, but, in general, there's not much to say about the class other than it teaches you basic statistics, which is pretty important to know.",
    "If you have never taken stats before or you are looking for a refresher, this is a good course to take because Prof Reuning-Sherer is really good and funny. The problem sets do require several hours but they arent that hard and the tests are not tricky. Do not take this course if you are just trying to get an easy QR because you will not get an easy A.",
    "yes--gives you a solid foundation about statistics",
    "Yes, an interesting QR, not that much work.",
    "If you're interested in statistics and regression, go for it. If you need a QR, go for it. I wouldn't have taken this just for fun though. After talking to friends in other sections, I think that 102 is a good bet for your section. It proved to be a great mix of teaching styles.Advice: buy one of the older edition textbooks. I found one for $12, and it was the best investment I've made in a while. All my friends consulted it during review sessions, and I did a lot of reading in it and found it helpful.",
    "Reuning-Scherer leads a fast-paced first half of the semester. Problem sets aren\u0092t particularly difficult, but they cover a lot of material, and it\u0092s easy to fall behind if you don\u0092t go to class. One midterm was easy, the other surprisingly difficult given the first. R-S an animated lecturer and tries hard to entertain, but his jokes are the like the Thomas Kinkade paintings of humor: kitschy and predictable with a good splash of Christianity. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . David Doherty led the PLSC half. He wasn\u0092t listed as the professor. He was young, genuinely entertaining, and relaxed. Lectures were pretty solid and the problem sets and final were straightforward (no surprises).",
    "The second half is not a bad overview of introductory statistics, but the first half is incredibly boring. I feel like I got some very useful knowledge from the second half, but the first was just too much information, presented in too frenetic a manner, for me to feel that I got much out of it. Worth it to fill a requirement, if necessary, but not exactly a fun class.",
    "stats, man. if you can count and stuff, you're good. apparently not a hard class and its true that if you can wrap your mind around the shit, it's not that bad but, in my opinion, it sucked. that being said, required for my major and an important skill to be familiar with.",
    "first half terrible, second half (if you take poli-sci) is great.",
    "The first half of the course moves very quickly, and although lecture slides were handed out at the beginning of class, I often found them difficult to review after class was over. The class was suggested for those (like myself) who had never taken a statistics class; nevertheless, some people in the class will have taken AP Stat or something along those lines. That being said, I appreciated the humor peppering some of the explanations. Having the recommended-but-not-required textbooks was very helpful. The second half of the class moved at a much more relaxed pace, as we covered a fraction of the material in greater depth.",
    "Good stats class that makes it easy for students to learn. The material goes quick but is taught really well",
    "I would recommend if you have never taken a course on stats. But you learn as much time as you put into it."
