    "This course focuses on the ways that historians write about gender in American history from the colonial period to the present. The course readings are particularly strong in women's political and social history. This course is useful to students of gender, although perhaps most useful to those who will be relying heavily on social and political history methodologies.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students, particularly students interested in the United States.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a peer; I feel I have a much stronger grasp of the terrain of women's and gender history now, which was what I was hoping to get out of the course."

    "As I mentioned, Prof. Meyerowitz does an excellent job of positioning the readings in the literature, which allowed me to understand well the historiography of this topic. I definitely emerged with a better understanding of the historiography of gender in the U.S.",
    "This course laid out for me the overall geography of the field of women's and gender studies; I feel much more comfortable in my ability to conduct research in this area.I also was benefited by the final assignment, which compelled me to read several books that will help me to design my orals fields and provide context for future research projects.",
    "I have a much stronger grounding in women's andgender history now, which I believe will hold me in good stead as a gender studies scholar; this is particularly helpful given that I come from another discipline."
