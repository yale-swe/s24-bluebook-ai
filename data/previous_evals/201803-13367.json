   "comments": [
    "Intellectual creativity, exploring thematically, inter-disciplinary approach, practical skills of conference presentation, a broad understanding of the Momoyama period",
    "Enrolling in Professor Yiengpruksawans Japans Global Baroque class truly developed, diversified and enriched my academic knowledge and perception towards the interconnected, multifaceted and various works of visual art and literature, created in Japan and Europe during the Momoyama and Baroque periods. Such interdisciplinary and complex approach to these works deepened my analytical and investigative skills. Furthermore, many research information, knowledge and experience-including a conference-like session-enabled me to directly and actively acquire and\/or improve many research knowledges and skills.",
    "I gained knowledge in a region of art history that I have never studied in the past before. The course helped us developing cross-cultural and interdisciplinary skills between Japan and Europe in the early modern period. I particularly learned a lot about cartography thanks to the research project I worked on."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe a bit more stress on the readings.",
    "The numerous and various visual works incorporated in this class-from Momoyama castles to Italian Baroque paintings-gifted students a comprehensive, multifaceted learning experience, regarding the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within Europe, Japan and, perhaps, even the whole globe, especially with respect to the international and intercultural relations occurring during these times. The great amount of secondary sources, penned by professors and investigators of many academic disciplines, enabled students to come into direct contact with the academic and investigative trends occurring within the studies of these eras. Additionally, via a simulated conference session and many insightful instructions from Professor Yiengpruksawan herself, students were able to interactively acquire essential research skills.",
    "The seminar was very small which created an intimate yet stimulating learning environment. It did not only investigate the artistic exchange between Japan and Europe, but it also touched upon the historical background, science, music, and cartography of the two regions. The readings were pertinent and useful to our class discussions and helpful for the final \"conference talk\" and research paper."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, anyone who wishes to think of history in a global context and think through it thematically would greatly benefit from this course.",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to my colleagues, because they would be able to experience directly the marvelous and wonderful effects of interdisciplinary learning, especially with respect to intercultural and interreligious relations between Japan and Europe, and, perhaps even the whole global network of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Furthermore, my colleagues would actively acquire knowledges, skills and experience as an academic researcher.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It discovers a fascinating topic, which is equally pertinent to students of Asian and European art, and demonstrates how similar we are despite our cultural differences."
