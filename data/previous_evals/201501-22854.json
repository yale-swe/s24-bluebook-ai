    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. I enjoyed this class a lot more than most of my courses. After a semester in this class, you will listen to music and watch dance in a new light.",
    "Watch videos of people dancing in class and listen to jazz tunes for homework? For sure. Also explore the ways music and dance intertwine, and intersect with your life. A chance to bridge the gap between analytical and personal writing. Very low key. Very rewarding.",
    "An incredible cultural experience of a class. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to learn through a creative lenses about history and people."
