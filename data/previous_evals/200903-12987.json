    "All excellent, but for grad students, mid term and final exams are a nuisance, since they are not the reason for taking the class.",
    "I thought the chronological organization was appropriate as well as the use of the two main books - one on cities and one on suburbs. My only suggestion would be that there was a lot of overlap between the material in Prof Hayden's book and the lectures on those topics. I also noticed that a lot of the readings dated to the '80s and I was curious about more recent scholarship. Overall though this was a very useful survey course. The deadlines for the draft and paper were early but well appreciated, and I think the requirement to turn in a draft was extremely useful. I'm a little less certain of the value of taking blue book exams at the graduate level, though they did help to synthesize the material."

    "My suggestion would be to eliminate some of the overlap between lectures and readings and include more recent articles in the readings."
