    "Absolutely. No class in Islamic History at Yale can hold a candle to Professor Bowering's course.",

    "The course was an excellent overview of Islamic history up to 1500. It provides the general historical framework for his long and vast field.",
    "I didn't have much of a knowledge of the history of the Islamic Empire-- I had taken Islamic Theology but this covered transitions in thought, not action. So it was helpful (albiet painful-- I'm not really one for strict memorization).",
    "Very much."
