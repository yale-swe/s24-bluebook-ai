   "comments": [
    "Great seminar! Lots of reading but very interesting.",
    "Great class, focused discussions on specific topics relating to 1950s medicine and health. Prof. Rogers led great discussions, and I liked all of the readings. Really interesting material, and it was fun to continue this after taking her class in the fall. The workload was manageable, and she has reasonable standards for our papers. The first two papers are really good prep for the final paper. Take it, or anything from Rogers!",
    "Take this class - it's a chill seminar with a lighter workload than others (2 smaller papers and a standard seminar term paper), Professor Rogers makes very interesting points, and the reading was almost always compelling. The topics are varied enough that you remain engaged, but they overlap enough as well that you feel you can make connections between them. I wasn't particularly interested in the Cold War era, but really enjoyed the course nonetheless. Do be warned that Professor Rogers is very picky when it comes to your writing style and will flip out a bit if you even so much as use certain words she doesn't like. This can be incredibly frustrating and seem rather pointless\/trivial.",
    "Naomi Rogers is a great seminar leader. You get to learn lots of really cool things about American Medicine, like leprosy, nuclear fallout, nationalized healthcare, and Indian health. She definitely teaches you the skills to be a better historian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Favorite class I've taken at Yale.",
    "This was a really enjoyable course. Professor Rogers is an animated discussion leader and it was a pleasure to be in a seminar with her. She's very good at cutting the crap when it comes to primary sources and what's really going on in history, and she's very funny. We discussed many interesting areas of medicine after World War Two. That being said, it was hard to get a sense of overall themes throughout the course, and there are definitely a number of topics we couldn't cover because of the time--make sure to check out the syllabus to see if the topics interest you. In preparation for the final paper she had a library session at the Medical History Library; this was really useful as we got to know one of the librarians and became acquainted more of the incredible resources here. She did not give many structured deadlines for the paper, however, so many people were scrambling at the last minute. Professor Rogers is also a tough grader, however; you have to work hard on the papers to do well. It's a great class!",
    "Great seminar. Professor Rogers is excellent and her enthusiasm for the subject really rubs off on you. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend it for another student. It's a good summary of the medical issues from 1945-1960ish. Interesting material, good discussions, and not too much reading every week.",
    "Great course. Probably less difficult than the average history junior seminar, because the first two written assignments are pretty structured and the reading is a manageable amount. Lots of primary sources, which some seminar professors leave out. And the material is interesting, especially if you're into the Cold War cultural aesthetic.",
    "Definitely recommend",
    "Yes, this has been one of my favorite classes in the major. Be prepared, it's quite a bit of reading to do every week.",
    "This is an awesome HSHM seminar that I highly recommend to any HSHM student, or anyone interested in medicine, or a particularly interesting look at the affects of the cold war on American Society. Professor Rogers is a very great seminar leader and does a great job of guiding class discussion. The reading each week is very manageable and extremely interesting. Your grade is made up of 3 papers that increase in size and percentage of grade as the semester continues. Professor Rogers is very concerned about improving her students' writing and gives good advice on how to improve one's historical writing. The final paper is really open and gives you a chance to write on any topic you find interesting during the course. A great writing credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course because the material was fantastic and Rogers is a great section leader. The workload is not too demanding and the research required for the final paper can be interesting and eye-opening. Take it!!! (Even if you are not an HSHM major)"
