   "comments": [
    "This class is an exploration of the grotesque as it relates to Russian literature. Although a background in Russian literature and philosophy would be helpful when taking this course, it is far from necessary as Professor Muravnik provides all the requisite information. If Professor Muravnik chooses to teach this course again, then I would definitely recommend it to any student. Even though I am not a Russian major, Professor Muravnik was able to get me excited in this topic.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course.",
    "I enjoyed the class immensely. Kostya is a great professor, and moves effectively between pretty sophisticated literary and philosophical discussion of the literature we read and nuts-and-bolts grammar and vocabulary (not to mention explaining the far-flung cultural references and generally amusing commentary on Russian life in the 90's). Almost all of it is in Russian, but it's definitely understandable. The course takes a fair amount of work, and the reading can be tough, but it's worth it."
