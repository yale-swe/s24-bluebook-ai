   "comments": [
    "Its a requirement, but even if it wasn't I recommend it to any junior who is unclear about their senior essay and wants to get knowledge or advise about what to do for research and stuff.",
    "This is a requirement for the sociology major, but it is a great class and opportunity to meet the other students in the major in your year. Professor Adams is fantastic and you should definitely take the class if it is with her. She invites a lot of cool speakers who share their research projects and it's a great class that forces you to develop your senior thesis ahead of time so you can apply for grants and get money to do your research over the summer.",
    "This course was surprisingly interesting. Its a requirement and the subject matter is dry but Professor Adams is wonderful and she gets so excited about your own project that you can't help getting excited as well. I don't think I could have prepared for my senior research without this class so I definitely recommend taking it junior year rather than sophomore year, that's when you need it the most. This is a very useful class and it's not very hard, just make sure to start bouncing ideas off Professor Adams or your TA as early as possible in order to get the best research proposal you can out of this course.",
    "The class will teach you various methods that sociologists apply to do their researches. It will also help you organize your own senior project. As a required class for sociology majors, I think the class helps a lot preparing for senior year.",
    "Take it if you need to. Its not very exciting but it is a very easy A",
    "Readings can be dry but this course is very useful for planning your senior essay.",
    "I didn't find the class very interesting, but it is pretty useful in helping you with research. It also presents you with good examples of a variety of different types of sociology. If you're in the major (which everyone in the class is), you don't have a choice anyway, but it's not too bad (as long as they never do it at 9am ever again. That was awful).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow sociology student, maybe not to another student who's not interested in doing sociological research. This class does a great job of preparing and exposing you to the stuff you should be doing as a senior sociology major, but if you're not interesting in doing your own sociology research, this class might not be interesting and probably not what you're looking for.",
    "Great course for junior sociology majors. Really helps you get moving on your senior project.",
    "Yes! You learn a lot and it's incredibly useful if you are thinking of becoming a Sociology major. Professor Julia is absolutely wonderful and will go out of her way to teach you everything you need toknow about the research methods and procedures you'll need for your senior research project. Take it!",
    "If you want to learn how to do solid research in any social science, take this course.",
    "SOCY 160 is required for junior majors so my recommendation isn't going to count for much because you have to take it. This class teaches you important methodology and encourages academic creativity. It can be kind of boring and seem way to introductory at times, but if you even halfway apply yourself you will get a lot out of it. The class aimsto \"foster an academic community of young scholars\" and it really does, making you collaborate and share and become familiar with your fellow majors. Plus you will be helped every step of the way to developing your senior thesis project. Also, Prof. Adams is the nicest person in the world.",
    "Really helpful preparation for senior essay research. I wouldn't recommend it for non-soc majors."
