   "comments": [
    "It's hard but worth it. If you do have a serious interest in Russian, it's worth the commitment. I liked it a lot. But if you're not a language person, you will have a rough time in the class.",
    "It's a lot of work, but Professor Titus is fantastic and you CAN learn Russian. About an hour of homework every night, and lots of studying (Russian vocab and grammar is so easy to forget), but the course breaks it down to the point where it's doable. It's a bit lenient, which makes it manageable, but you have to keep on top of your stuff. It's definitely a difficult language and the textbook is really bad, but it's a fun class (TAKE THE LATER SECTION) and if you're looking to learn Russian and you can commit the time and energy, I'd strongly consider it.",
    "Yes!! Russian is very fun and\u042e\u043b\u0438\u0430and\u0417\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440are great instructors. I do feel like we learned less than in other intro language classes, but part of that is getting adjusted to a new alphabet and introducing concepts like cases. If you already speak another language with cases like Slavic languages, German, or Latin, or if you're good at language learning, then Russian will be easier for you. If not, be prepared to work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a great language. Also the professor and department are well organized and knowledgeable.",
    "Russian 110 is the first half of a first-year course in Russian. I would recommend it to anyone who actually wants to learn Russian. It is very cumulative, but as long as you put in the time, it is very methodical and easy to follow. I loved it.",
    "Absolutely, if you are at all interested in learning Russian or just want to take on a new language this class is great.",
    "Take the class! Both Julia and Zakhar are amazing and make Russian something to look forward to everyday. They make the class is fun, light, and engaging, and you will be surprised with how quickly you can learn the basics of Russian.",
    "good class, interesting, would recommend",
    "L1 Russian is intellectually rigorous and requires hard work on a daily basis, but the support system is extensive and the overall result is a fulfilling experience. Prof. Titus wants you to succeed and will expend great effort to ensure that you have the skills to do so in this course, as did the TA. Definitely recommended.",
    "Take it if you want to learn russian - you will work, but you will learn russian well.",
    "This is a thorough introductory course. It is a lot of work, but if you stay on top of it, it isn't hard to do well.",
    "A fun class with a good balance of the grammar\/vocab and interesting cultural aspects. I always felt welcome and comfortable speaking in class (and I'm not a great linguist). The homework is fairly consistent and predictable, time-wise. Highly recommended; Russian is fun!",
    "The class is an excellent language class, and everything you expect in a good Yale course is present here. The teaching is good, the tests are fair, and if you are at all interested in Russian language andculture, you will find yourself genuinely intrigued by what you are learning. The language is hard - more difficult than Latin based languages, though easier than the popular character-based languages of East Asia - something generally derived from not understanding the grammar or its constructs, as learning the Cyrillic script is not exceptionally difficult. Moreover, I found the class enlightening beyond the practicality of knowing Russian. I never had a good grasp of syntax prior to taking this course; after it, I not only understood the highly structured, almost mathematical nature of the Russian language, but by being forced to consciously constructed sentences, understood what I was doing when I subconsciously composed English sentences. If you have any interest in Russia or in learning a Slavic language, or are looking for an alternative to the tedium of Romance languages, I highly recommend taking Russian."
