    "I was able to draw comparative connections between different methodological approaches.Widened the theoretical foundation of m own research methods.",
    "This course was extremely useful for me because I did not have an undergraduate art historical methods class",
    "As I said before, I feel that this class has helped me grow the most as a student this semester. I was exposed to art historians' thoughts and approaches to art that I had not encountered before. Moreover, I was consistently asked to compare methodologies, weighing their validity and use value against each other. Learning this type of scrutiny has been invaluable to the way I know understand the history and development of the history of art as we know it."
