   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. As someone who hated language in high school (probably because of a series of frustrating teachers), I was shocked to find that I not only tolerated but truly enjoyed this class. It was laid back enough that I rarely felt stressed out, but I loved seeing my effort pay off as we all made progress each day. I would also definitely recommend going to the Italian tables, as they helped immensely with speaking.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially if you want to learn a language quickly and efficiently.",
    "If you are merely interested in fulfilling a language requirement, don't take this class. It will become the most time-consuming academic commitment of your semester. However, if you're looking to learn Italian in 13 weeks or less, this is the class for you! You will feel very accomplished at the end of it all, either way.",
    "If you're willing to put in a lot of work, it's an incredibly rewarding and fun class. Michael is without a doubt the teacher you want; I can't imagine having someone who wasn't so interested in us enjoying ourselves as my professor for ten hours a week. It's been my favorite class here so far, but it's also been my hardest.",
    "Such a great class!! Italian is an amazing language and Michael is the best! ALOT OF WORK, especially a the beginning, but worth it if you really want to learn the language.",
    "This class is a great way to start off your Italian career at Yale, but it is VERY intense, be warned. Professor Farina is amazing and everyone loves him! He makes the difficult class very tolerable.",
    "If you want to learn Italian, and well, this is the place to be. Michael is an absolutely fantastic teacher.",
    "Rigorous and fun class, I would recommend it (although more as pass\/fail, I'm not sure what the experience is like taking it for a grade)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are willing to work hard and learning languages does not come as too much of a chore for you. It does go pretty fast in terms of grammar and vocab, so if this is not something you're used to, or if you're not used to speaking\/listening in a foreign language) then you may want to take the normal paced course.",
    "Yes, I will recommend this to another student. It was amazing to learn so much just in one semester."
