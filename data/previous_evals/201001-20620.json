   "comments": [
    "Yes, I recommend it to the students who are willing to take CS as the major. It digs into many details in programming and computer hardware which needs many background knowledges.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with strong C programming ability who is interested in systems programming. I would not necessarily recommend it as a general-purpose CS course because of the specific skills and interest set this type of course requires---despite being an introduction to OSes, it gets quite in-depth and the assignments are challenging. The professor is very enthusiastic and makes himself very available to students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students, as the debugging skills alone are worth the effort. The class is a lot of work, as evidenced by its' \"programming intensive\" distinction, but is well worth their time."

   "comments": [
    "For a student working on application research, like me, it is not so obviously useful. But I definitely learn a lot about the hardcore computer science skills, which helps me to understand details in programming.",
    "This course does not directly contribute to my dissertation or research, although it has helped me understand computers more deeply. As a computer scientist, I appreciate this in-depth knowledge of Operating Systems, and I value the practice in C programming, but I don't think I will use the information learned here in any direct way in the future."
