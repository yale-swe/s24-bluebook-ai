   "comments": [
    "Professor Wrightson is a joy to learn from. His humility translates as respect of all, which in turn creates a classroom where all are respectful of the other. A place where learning can happen. Would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in writing and history.",
    "Every history student should be required to take this class.",
    "I would recommend auditing and then, for a research class, taking one with more structure.",
    "yes, I would recommend.",
    "History 628 is a course focused on learning more about microhistories. Each week, Professor Wrightson has a list of books chosen and we are recommended to read at least one per week. In class, we discuss the books and raise questions about the microhistorical works. We also work on an independent project that is catered to our interests and during the second half of the course, each person gives a 40 minute presentation about the microhistory they have worked on throughout the semester.I would recommend and encourage all students to take this course. Very beneficial to those who are interested in becoming historians.",
    "This course gives you the opportunity to write in a particular interesting style. Take it especially if you have a cool source you want to work with or if you're really interested in the dynamics of structure and agency.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who has an area of study prepared and wishes to develop a microhistory project in that area."

   "comments": [
    "THis class allowed a \"window\" into histories that are often not used. the class started me on the process of seeing what I want to do.",
    "Helped me to refine some of my own beliefs about the profession and how I would like to contribute to it.",
    "Before this class, I had a very vague understanding of what a 'microhistory' was in a historical context. The independent project that I worked on pushed me in the right direction in my future research. I now have a clear understanding of what I want to research,the geographic location(s) that I am interested in, and the type of historical research I want to focus on.",
    "The course has helped me honed my research and analytical skills.",
    "This course enabled me to delve into a source I intend to rely on quite a bit in my dissertation, which is part of the reason I did it."
