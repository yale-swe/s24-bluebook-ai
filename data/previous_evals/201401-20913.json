   "comments": [
    "Take it! A very worthwhile, handson engineering class - especially if you're not sure about going into engineering",
    "Great course but do not attend lecture when Tarek Fahmy is scheduled to teach. You should take the course if you are interested in learning that basics of engineering (even if you don't plan to be an engineer)",
    "yes but beware of ranging workloads. finals week (near end of project) so much time spent",
    "This course it great for an introduction to engineering and design. If you're unsure of which field of engineering you're interested in, this a good start. Also, the final projects are very cool and conducted in a very professional environment with your client.",
    "The two words that come to mind when I think of ENAS 118 are interesting and disorganized. Interesting: Each week of lecture focused on a different engineering field, so you could really get a taste of why each of these subjects is about. Some weeks were better than others, but that is the case for almost every class. Disorganized: First of all, the workload for the first 5 weeks was intense, the next 5 weeks was next to nothing, and then there was the final project, which most groups probably didn't have enough time for. Often times PSets would be assigned, often poorly construed, and they would be changed\/updated many times, sometimes even after you completed that part of the assignment. In retrospect, I am glad that I took the course, but I was definitely questioning my motivation during a few of the weeks.",
    "If you like group projects and making things, this is the perfect class. However, don't take it if you want to learn about the different types of engineering.",
    "Yes, if they revise the organization of the course.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It does not go into enough detail on any of the subjects to be useful. The one redeeming feature of this class is the client project, which is a great opportunity to learn real skills and to work in a team. The class is not much work until the project, but then be prepared to spend a few all nighters making it work right.",
    "As a non-engineering upperclassman, I liked this class for how it expanded my horizons and motivated me to finally take advantage of some of the resources in the CEID. The majority of the course is a fairly disjointed series of lectures about various random aspects of different types of engineering, but I did appreciate having to try out Matlab, Arduino, AppInventor, and other programs\/systems that can be really useful but that I might not have tried out on my own initiative. The best part of the class was the final project - everyone is split into groups of 4-5 to work with actual clients (e.g. the Marsh Botanical Gardens, the Peabody Museum, the Yale University Art Gallery) who had real problems they wanted solutions to. However, I wish there had been more emphasis on the final projects throughout the semester, rather than cramming most of it into the last two weeks. (Not the fault of the students, but the way the course was set up.)",
    "ENAS is the epitome of a hands-on class. Regular instruction is usually conducted in lecture format, where the material learned in lecture is applied in a hands-on setting during lab. Don't be fooled. Homework may make up a large portion of your grade, but these homework assignments are very comprehensive. Don't be surprised if you find yourself working on a single assignment for 10 hours straight in the basement computer lab of Dunham Lab,",
    "A must-take class at Yale. This class has made me excited about engineering, about the capabilities of the CEID, and about my own capabilities. This is a chance to become familiar with a lot of valuable programs in the engineering world in an environment where everyone is learning it with you. This detail was important to me because I was able to really embrace learning the new skills without feeling intimidated like I would have been had I been in a room full of individuals who had already mastered everything.",
    "YES, TAKE 118! If you are at all undecided about engineering or which engineering, this class is super helpful.",
    "The work is very instruction based and the material is very shallow which is sort of to be expected since this class is an introductory survey of engineering.",
    "This is a really cool class, and in addition to learning about engineering you get to use the CEID to build something for a final project. That being said, like any class, it has both interesting and boring parts. Some of the lectures are great, others not so much. The homework is also really variable, with some weeks giving too much and other weeks none at all. The final project is really awesome, especially if you like working with your team. I would recommend this class to anyone, even if they weren't considering engineering.",
    "ENAS 118 is not your average course. I\u2019d recommend it if you enjoy working on independent projects and don\u2019t need a lot of structure in order to get things done. I took ENAS 118 because I wanted to acquire some hard skills while at Yale. Be aware that while you get some good experience in programming, SolidWorks, and 3D printing, ENAS 118 will by no means make you an expert. Rather, it provides you with an introduction to these skills and helps you get started. What\u2019s great about ENAS 118 is that you spend the second half of the semester working on a real-world problem with a client that you\u2019re paired with (e.g. the Yale Farm, Art Gallery, Peabody Museum). Your experience in your class is determined by which project you select, so choose wisely! Most of the projects are very rewarding and teach you a lot. The other great thing about this class is that you become very close with a lot of the people in it. It is very much an experiment, though, so don\u2019t take it if you can\u2019t handle a little uncertainty.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to a another student. As a student with a strong background in science already, I did not learn that much from this course. However, it was very cool to explore the ceid and the projects were a valuable experience.",
    "1 ENAS 118 is an incredible course. No matter what you are interested in, take this class. It's so fun, and you actually learn something practical.",
    "ENAS 118 is a great course if: you want to learn about all the types of engineering and think you can actually get something out of 9:25 lectures or you think designing a product for a real yale client would be cool. I felt I fell under both of those categories and really think I got a lot out of the class! There are also a lot of cool perks like CEID membership, training on some of the shop things, free arduino. And the homework is very chill. Recommended! (if you can manage to get in... it was pretty competitive this year)",
    "This was an introductory class that would give you an understanding of the general concepts of each engineering discipline. While it attemlted to do this while also encompassing a sort of consulting\/engineering project, it did both poorly. Too much time was wasted on material that went over the class' head and too little time was spent focusing on the client part. Our client even noticed that and commented that it was sort of an explosion of productivity just a few weeks before demo day and that he was amazed that we finished. If we could focus on one aspect or the other, or even make it one class period and a client\/group meeting on Wednesday and then lab on Thursday\/friday, then the class could be more productive.",
    "Yes absolutely. If you like solving problems or building things then definitely take this class.",
    "Awesome class. Eric is the best ever!",
    "Fun class! You learn to make use of the CEID, including the 3D printer or Laser cutter. The team project is the highlight. If you're trying to use this class to determine your major, it won't help. It's not focussed enough to give you an idea of any engineering major.",
    "This class is perfect for anyone interested in engineering and not sure what to take, anyone who likes to make stuff, or anyone who wants to learn more about making stuff (not just engineers). The project is great if you are in a group full of people who like to take initiative to learn new things and are willing to dive into a project or subject even if they don't have any experience. The TA's for this class are amazing!",
    "My feelings about ENAS 118 are mixed. I went in with high expectations from the reviews from the previous year, so that may have contributed to why I was somewhat disappointed. The way I would describe ENAS 118 is an intro to engineering course. You'll learn a lot of key engineering basics, mainly MATLAB, Arduino, SolidWorks, app development, and machine training. For any engineering you do at Yale, these skills are important. The main draw for me was how hands-on the class. I was really tired of all the lecture and theory courses I had taken the previous semester, so this was a nice change of pace to be spending time in the CEID actually building. Moreover, Professor Dufresne has a ton of energy and is ready to help you whenever you need it. Your TF will also be of incredible value throughout the semester, both for weekly homework and the final project. I did say my feelings were mixed though. I ended up studying for other class during lecture because the material we covered in the ENAS 118 lectures ranged from too simple (what is electricity) to too complex (a complete description of biological processes in the cell). Sometimes the material did not even apply to the class. The labs ranged as well; the Design for Disassembly Lab was a lot of fun, but the synthesis of proteins was long and somewhat tedious. Workload shifted depending on the week. Sometimes I was free, and other times, I would be spending hours on a problem set (especially SolidWorks). The final project was quite fun and one of the most noteworthy elements of the class. It really does cement the skills you learn in class, and it is inspiring to see your ideas come to life. The timeline though was a bit tight, and you end up giving the clients a prototype rather than a nice product. I would still give the course of a generally good recommendation. It may improve in later years, so this review may or may not prove helpful. You do get to try a lot of forms of engineering; for me personally, it more cemented that I wanted to stay in mechanical\/electrical engineering and not do biomedical or chemical engineering. :)",
    "A survey of engineering majors and an end of the year final project where you work with a budget for a client.",
    "Hit or miss. If you have an enthusiastic and hard working design group, then you will probably enjoy your experience better.",
    "Sounds like a great class, but expectations should be lowered. To be fair, it is a new class still in the trial and test-driving phase, but this semester it was way too rushed. In the end I did not properly learn anything and the TA's and professors were not particularly helpful with the client project. Basically the client project is a lottery for matching up skills and interests in a group with the client problems. Some client problems are easier than others and so skew grading. Most lectures were boring even though I was interested in the topic."
