   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this course if you ever plan on doing your own research project.",
    "It's all right. Great if you're looking to put together a long-term global health project and you don't necessarily feel like spending the time outside of class to do so. You can actually take this class as a fifth class.",
    "Recommend!",
    "This class will be great if you need to be forced into writing a research proposal for your Junior summer. However, this is basically a two hour lecture of research methods every Friday morning. Since the class is now bigger, the feedback process was really slow. Also the during the semester pilot projects were kind of a disaster. In terms of research methods, this class could be better taught and would just improve by a smaller class size and more interactive teaching style.",
    "This was a good, useful course. Although the lectures and readings aren't terribly illuminating, you work through an individual proposal for summer research which you can use at the end of the semester for funding applications in the future. There isn't much work during the course of the semester, although you might feel differently at the end of the semester, after the final proposal is due (it was a lot of work). Also, our TA graded pretty hard (definitely heard a lot of people get B's and B-'s on individual assignments and proposal drafts), but it's all beneficial in the end because it's improving your work and chances to get funding. Also, a major plus is that you get to meet Kaveh, a very big guy in public health at Yale, and you also get to meet a group of motivated, smart students really interested in public health\/global health which is really nice.",
    "If there are other research methods classes that undergraduates can take, I would avoid this class. If you are considering taking this class, I would at least check how many TA's are on staff and if they plan to take more than 18 people. This class was terribly mismanaged, in part due to the fact that just oneTA had to do ALL the grading, comments and mentoring for the entire class. We were constantly sitting on our hands, waiting to get comments on our research proposal drafts and unable to move forward. Furthermore, the expectations for the final research proposal were very unclear (pertaining to whether it actually had to be a viable project with approval from whatever NGO we partnered with, length, content, etc). The difficulty of the class stems both from the challenges of creating a viable research proposal and short group project proposal AND the disorganization\/lack of clarity of the assignments. The class did teach me the basics of conducting research, but you could probably just get that knowledge from reading a book about research methods. Prof Khoshnood's lecture regurgitated the reading, so there was no point doing the reading. Now, if you are serious about conducting an independent research project, this can be a useful class. At the end of the day, I am glad that I have a research proposal that I actually plan on carrying out, but the process was just annoying. If you know what you want to research and know what NGO you will partner with, the process is MUCH easier (foster contact with the NGO EARLY ON!!!).",
    "if you're interested in doing independent public health research, take this course. very good overview of how to design a research proposal and think about researching a topic. gets you prepared for a summer grant proposal",
    "Unless you thrive in a course that offers no clear expectations, with a TA that either sluggishly or never responds to your emails, doing assignments prefaced by negligible if any guidance or instruction, do not take this course. Your time would be much better spent simply reading the textbook or research methods journal articles. And your patience would be less frayed as well.",
    "Great class if you are interested in doing global health research in the future, especially if you are making plans for the upcoming summer (since you work on your summer proposal in this course). The major task in this class is your individual proposal, and there is little work other than this (some readings, 2 homework assignments).Professor (Kaveh) and TA (Dylan) were both great.I definitely recommend this course - just make sure to stay on top of your individual work, since this will be largely self-motivated."
