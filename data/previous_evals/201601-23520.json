   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Applicable skills learned Weakness: Assignments do not complement the order in which the lectures are given. 2) Some assignments are redundant. - Some assignments (such as the expert review) would be best completed as a group assignment as opposed to individual assignments, especially since the same information is being communicated.",
    "This was a great class. I learned a great deal from the hands-on portion of the class and the main assignments were excellent. The lectures were boring, but Marney was great about being honest about how boring they were - she understands!",
    "Really glad I took it. It wasn't without typical team work challenges, but the course was great.",
    "Overall, a great course. More SPSS instruction for students without prior knowledge of it is needed.",
    "Wonderful class.",
    "Strengths: learned an entire new skill I have not been exposed to before. Learning SPSS has been amazing. I have a new found appreciation for questionnaires and surveys with more knowledge on the process. I thought the way class was structured was great, with the final paper culminating all the work we did step wise in the course.",
    "The course was fantastic. At the end of the semester you leave with a tangible skill of being able to create, test and validate a questionnaire.",
    "Strengths: Main paper was broken up into different sections and due dates, so when the final paper was due, it felt manageable. Learned how to develop a questionnaire, which is more involved than I previously thought. I LOVED the discussion-format of certain classes, where we got to gather with our groups to talk to Marney about thoughts\/questions. And I LOVED that we got to analyze our own questionnaire data. Weaknesses: Lectures could be a bit dry, but that was almost inevitable given that the subject itself could be a bit dry. Improvements: None. If there's a way to make the lectures more captivating, probably that.",
    "Strengths- being able to research and develop a questionnaire from scratch, and actually gather data! Really interesting to listen to other people's projects, and very thoughtful lectures into the amount of work that goes into creating an effective questionnaire. Areas for improvement: I'd appreciate more structured time in the lab going over the trickier parts of reliability and validity analysis- maybe one or two more sessions??",
    "very helpful methods class",
    "Critical skills gained in this course including how to create a questionnaire and how to manage, analyze, and report on data from surveys using SPSS"

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very accessible professor who shows she cares about her students and their learning. Is also quick to provide feedback which is very much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Excellent! Thanks for a great course",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney rocks. She is wonderful, brilliant, and charmingly sarcastic. She really cares about her students, responds to emails, and knows oh-so-much about everything. She might be my favorite YSPH professor.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is a wonderful instructor who cares a lot about her students. She is very receptive to feedback.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is incredible. Her teaching style is unique and we all learned so much from her. Marney is passionate and very intelligent!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Loved the classroom environment, open and engaging\/friendly teaching style, and the contents of the course itself. We learned exactly what we needed to know and nothing beyond or \"extras\". The end product was us taking away so much skills and knowledge. I can pick up any questionnaire today and know everything I need about the process. Wonderful!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is without a doubt one of the best instructors at YSPH. She absolutely loves what she does, and her excitement about the subject matter is contagious! She is one of the most approachable and accessible professors at Yale, and the level of feedback that she provides on assignments is unparalleled.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I really enjoy Marney's teaching style. It's a bit more laid back, but she certainly doesn't let quality suffer. She gets her points across and then lets us talk about our project with each other and with her. I thrive in that kind of environment.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Best professor ever!!! Makes even the driest lecture material super engaging and fun. No complaints here!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0very knowledgeable and a good instructor",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is an incredibly kind, accessible, and respectful professor. She truly understands the pressures of being a student and structures her course in a way that reflects that. One suggestion would be to be super clear in expectations for students-- specifically I'm thinking of our time in the computer lab. It wasn't clear whether we were working through problems together as a class or working independently as a group. The use of videos to teach SPSS was great, but they weren't labeled very well for searching specific processes."
