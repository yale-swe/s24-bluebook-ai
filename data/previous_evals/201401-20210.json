   "comments": [
    "A chill class that involves many different types of hollywood films and includes different angles of film analysis.",
    "Analysis of the development of the Hollywood blockbuster and its influence on other film markets. It changed the way I looked at these films, and the papers were a lot of fun to research and write! I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Excellent class for those who aren't film majors but appreciate film and are willing to look a little deeper. I imagine it won't be as fun for pure film studies majors because the focus is non-technical but rather holistic: a lot of factors (economic, political, etc.) are involved in the making of a blockbuster, not just aesthetics! But Ron Gregg is an amazing lecturer, extremely knowledgeable. I appreciated that he is not just another highbrow critic, as well as his ability to take blockbusters seriously (Jurassic Park is not exactly high art, but it still has a lot to offer). I'll never look at another Marvel superhero film the same way. Take this class!",
    "Definitely recommend it",
    "Yes! It's a unique perspective for a film class, examining the economic systems that determine the content of modern blockbusters",
    "Best class ever.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I am not a film studies major, but I love movies and this class gave me a new perspective on the films that a lot of people have seen. It also gave me more access to global cinema than I have had before. It was well structure, not too much work, and the readings\/lectures are interesting an enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The movies are all very interesting and diverse, Professor Gregg is the greatest, and the homework is fun! You watch a lot of movies and write essays comparing blockbusters, which while it is still real work, is such a change from other classes it is almost fun to do.",
    "This is a great course if you are interested in film or are looking for a class that is relevant to present day. The workload is not too overbearing, and the films are great.",
    "Take it as a fifth class if you have any interest in the film industry. Midterm, two 5-7 page papers, and a final. Not a heavy workload, considering your homework is watching good films and then reading some brief analyses.",
    "Super interesting class. You learn a lot about the entertainment industry, and there aren't other classes at Yale that give you such an interesting overview or that make as interesting arguments about the direction of film. Ron Gregg is an excellent, passionate lecturer who will change the way you see the Hollywood blockbuster. None of the assignments are too difficult, but be wary since grading varies widely by TF.",
    "Yes, great course. Very applicable if you are going into the business.",
    "I highly recommend this course! Awesome films!",
    "Do you like watching movies? Of course you do. So take this class. Ron Gregg is honestly one of the best professors ever - so great - GO TO LECTURE. The material is soooo interesting, and the film screenings are all movies you'll want to watch anyway. The readings are mostly unnecessary and the exams are easy if you go to lecture. I went to almost every lecture, did none of the readings, and did very well. If you've always wanted to take a film studies class at Yale but never have, THIS IS THAT CLASS.",
    "Easy class, not life changing, interesting enough",
    "Really fun and not too hard - great movies, interesting insight into Hollywood (less individual analyses of films, more about the structure of the industry)",
    "The powerpoints were never posted online, so you always had to go to lecture to copy down what was on them. For the entire lecture, the professor kept reading his notes from home really quickly (as if he was in a rush), so it was almost impossible to take notes of anything that he was saying. HORRIBLE grading!! Instead of either assigning letter grades to the papers directly, they used number scores and then converted them to letter grades using a conversion scale from Colorado State (which even included A+). They did that because there were several TAs grading papers and they wanted to be consistent in assigning letter grades - but since humanities are so subjective, it's obvious that a score of 80 that TA X assigned is not necessarily equivalent to a score of 80 that Y gave out. Since apparently they REALLY wanted to use number scores, they should have taken into account the mean and average of the entire class (like normal Yale classes) and curved with respect to that. I got an 80 something percent on the midterm, which according to their scale was a straight up B, but they did not know what the mean was when I asked them - so basically my grade was not curved and given their harsh grading, I am sure that lots of people got C+ (you needed 75% to get a C+ and they were always taking points off for nothing to differentiate people from each other). I took this class for fun, but it ended up being a grading nightmare. They were also very vague when giving out paper prompts, but then very harsh in grading them. This class should have a writing credit too, given that my TA at least analyzed every single word like this was an ENGL 120 class and not a film class with a \"write about the marketing strategy about whatever blockbuster you're interested in\" prompt. The midterm was also a struggle. It consisted of definitions (which were fine) and essays. For the essays, they never mentioned the concepts that they wanted us to discuss (they were very general), but when they graded them, they took points off for not talking about X, Y etc. How was I supposed to know exactly what you wanted me to write about if your prompt was so vague????",
    "Yes, especially if you enjoy watching popular blockbuster movies from the past decade. This course has a nice balance of film analysis and economic\/industry analysis. Not a lot of work (two papers, midterm, final). Prof. Gregg is very nice and I think the course is well structured.",
    "Yes, interesting material and manageable workload (two 5-7 page papers , midterm, final)",
    "Good course to take even if you're a non-film studies person, get to watch a lot of really cool movies! makes you understand the world of film more.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It's a great class, especially for a person looking for a fourth or fifth class. I took it Cr\/D\/Fail and really enjoyed watching the films. Professor Gregg is great!",
    "If you want an easy B+ then yeah",
    "This class is great! Not too much work but great movies and a good way to learn about how to analyze and discuss fun films.",
    "Great fifth class. Super chill and the work wasn't too bad. As someone who had never taken a film class at Yale, I found the material pretty interesting, but it's definitely not that deep. A must take for popular movie buffs.",
    "This class is for anyone who wants to learn about film or the film industry in a relatively stews-free environment. IT IS NOT A GUT THOUGH. It's not particularly hard, but it's definitely not a gut. You have to do some work in this class to do well.",
    "Very highly recommend this class. The film selections are really great, and Professor Gregg's lectures are always interesting. Not too much work, and a class you'll enjoy going to. Not as much of a time commitment as it seems.",
    "Great! fun! Light workload. A little repetitive but Ron Gregg is the best.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Not only is it not too hard but it is very enjoyable and actually very interesting and makes you look at movies especially Hollywood blockbusters in a new way.",
    "Movies come out. Some of them are very successful. Others are total flops. Find out why! This class is pretty low-key, but it made me much better at watching movies and thinking\/talking about them. If you only take one film class at Yale (and you should take a film class!), this one is a great bet. This class deals far more with economics than with nitty-gritty film studies stuff, which was great for me. You'll get out of this class what you put into it; it's a very real and intellectually challenging class, but a lot of people took it as a gut. Their loss.",
    "I would recommend the class, it was quite informative and a lot of fun.",
    "Just take it, especially if Ron Gregg is the professor.",
    "Don't take this class; it's entertaining because you've seen all of the movies and watch a lot of clips, but you don't learn much and you'll find yourself frustrated at all the time you've wasted by the end of the semester. Also, not as gutty as it sounds.",
    "Definitely a great class to take for last semester senior year. Really interesting to learn about the movies we've all seen, how that influences culture, and how culture influences it. Be prepared to put in a good amount of work - two essays, a midterm, weekly required sections, and weekly 2-hour film screenings.",
    "Cool class to take if you've always wanted to take a film class. You watch a lot of great movies, and Professor Gregg is a great lecturer. I enjoyed the parts of lectures that were analysis of the actual films a lot more than the economic\/production side, which is also a focus of this class. 2 short papers, midterm, and a final, but it's definitely not a bad workload (you don't need to do all the readings, though I'd suggest doing at least one per week to get a sense of them). Fun elective.",
    "This was one of my most favorite classes of the semester. For someone who is not film studies major but wants to have more background knowledge and critical ability of film, this kind of class is perfect, especially because the movies that I will be watching frequently in the future are precisely Hollywood movies. This course gave me a great overview and framework with which to critically evaluate and think about the entertainment and movies I will be consuming in the future, which is exactly what I wanted for a film course. It also introduced me to extremely interesting issues and topics to think about further regarding Hollywood, pop culture, realism, marketing, and the entertainment industry. I learned a lot from it .",
    "FANTASTIC class. Take it. Literally no reason not to-- you watch awesome movies (i.e. The Dark Knight, Little Miss Sunshine) and analyze the \"blockbuster formula\" in general. 2 papers which are interesting, a midterm, and a final exam. Prof Gregg is so engaging, and his lectures are honestly fun to go to. I was never bored, as he did a great job of incorporating movie clips into the lectures. Take this class!!",
    "An overview of how Hollywood has changed from its founding and how it has continued to evolve into the 21st Century, responding to various events such as 9\/11 or trends such as the rise of independent cinema.",
    "Yes - this course is a really interesting way to look at something you've always looked at in an entirely different and informed manner.",
    "Great class. Not labor intensive. The kind of thing you should take for life enrichment.",
    "This class offers a comprehensive look at Hollywood cinema in the 21st century, with a particular look at how 9\/11 demarcates a significant shift in the types of films that are being made and the types of stories that are being told. The films are great and easy to watch (The Dark Knight, Moulin Rouge, Casino Royale, Gravity) and it's interesting to learn about such mainstream films in a much more thoughtful way. Take it if you're looking for a fun but also rewarding credit.",
    "This class is perfect. You watch a blockbuster every week, turn in two papers, and take two tests. Just take it. Prof. Gregg is the man.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who is at all interested in film. The class is an interesting look at current film trends and what goes into making a blockbuster film.",
    "Would definitely recommend--the essays and tests are fun and not a lot of work, and the materials are genuinely fun and engaging.",
    "Hollywood in the 21st Century: you'll get to watch a ton of really fun movies. Go to screening -- I never got why film studies majors seemed to think that was so important but it was so much more fun watching them on the big screen with friends. Speaking of, take it with friends. Hopefully you'll get a good section, and that'll make it good. It's a chill class, work isn't too hard, and everything is about interesting stuff so it works out. It isn't a standard film studies class, though -- much more about the economics of blockbusters than you might expect.",
    "FILM 321 was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. It really makes you look at films you've probably seen many times before in a completely different way; I know that I look at blockbusters differently after taking this course. Professor Gregg is a really interesting lecturer. The variety of films is also great; you never feel like you're seeing too much of the same thing. Even if you haven't taken another film studies class, you'll enjoy FILM 321.",
    "I recommend the class. It is very interesting and pretty low-stress.",
    "It's great!! Really interesting material, great lectures and films, and overall an interesting topics for both film and non film majors!",
    "Very interesting class. One of the few classes where you get to study blockbusters in an academic setting.",
    "Attend lecture and section and go to the movie screenings and you'll do well in this class. There is a LOT of reading but you definitely don't need to do it all. The papers are pretty easy and fairly interesting to research too (they're on movies!). This is kind of a gut but it gave me a whole new perspective with which to view the movie industry.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is fun and you learn a lot."
