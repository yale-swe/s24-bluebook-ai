    "Boring, but necessary. Professor Kushnir lectures very close to textbook at 0 o'clock in the morning. Not surprisingly, nobody goes. However, there's extra credit on pretty much everything, and although sometimes tedious, the work is always very straightforward. This just something that you get done so you can apply it to physics or econ.",
    "From what it seems like, this course depends a lot on the instructor. If it's Kushnir, it's basically a high school level math class all over again--little mathematical rigor, lots of emphasis on rote problem solving techniques. You don't have to go to class--it's all directly from the book.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. The problems sets are biweekly, which i think is easier to handle. The teacher is really nice, always available to help, and explains things well. Tests are fair.",
    "This course is ok.",
    "Math 246 is a good introduction to all of the techniques needed to solve elementary differential equations. The homework is manageable and the information is important, so I would recommend the class.",
