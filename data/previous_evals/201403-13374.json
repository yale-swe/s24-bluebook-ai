    "Take it! What a truly wonderful introduction to conservation science. This course made astounding use of Yale's resources in the humanities and sciences, as well as the crossover between the two. I think the humanities and science students both felt out of their depth in the others' field, but the extent to which professors and TAs made themselves available to answer questions and clarify procedures more than made up for that difference. I was constantly impressed in the first few weeks by the number of conservators who took time out of their schedules to present to us, in-depth, about art historical or scientific backgrounds and methods, and particularly enjoyed the trip to the West Campus conservation labs. The lab part of the course was my first real lab experience, and it was really exciting to be working on a potentially useful and new project while learning lab skills and the molecular biology involved in our procedures. The professors and TAs gave incredibly generously of their time and answered questions from the simple to the complex with the same amount of patience and thoroughness. This course is the sort of thing Yale should strive to provide, combining a storied history in the humanities with scientific applications, and I'm very thankful I was able to participate.",
    "HSAR 218L is possibly the coolest course offered at Yale. It will impress anyone to whom you describe it, you will have a lot of fun, and you will learn a lot. I hope it gets offered in future years!",
    "HSAR 218 is a time commitment, but a fantastic course. There are no other courses like this at Yale. It is one of the most interesting courses I will take during my college career. The professors and TAs are so great and knowledgeable. If you have the time, please take this class. You will find a problem in current day art conservation and basically try to solve it! I am privileged to have taken this class and would recommend it to any other student, regardless of science background. This class is small, so every student has so many resources at their disposal. Great class, please take it.",
    "I would recommend this course hesitantly. While the arena of art conservation is fascinating, both conceptually\/ philosophically and in terms of its scientific basis, only the first of the course deals with conservation. The remainder of the time is devoted to lab work. This term, students seemed to experience a good deal of lab setbacks, difficulties with agar and bacteria. Although you are not expected to have success with your experimentation in terms of the grade, it can be hard motivationally to experience these challenges. Be wary, individualized assignments mean you have to be an independent worker and do a lot of research on your own. Dont expect your professors to conceive of the scientific basis for your experiment. And once youve made a decision about the materials you will be researching and embarked on lab time, there seems to be no going back! If you take this course, make sure your experiment is very solidly conceived, in terms of its chemical basis, before embarking on it.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It gives you such a unique opportunity that you cannot experience anywhere else. The class combines art history and molecular biology to give you a chance to actually develop a molecular tool for conserving or identifying an art work. The synthesis of these two subjects isn't just done on a superficial level. The class really delves in depth and takes you to a level that seldom undergraduates can experience. Even if you don't have much experience in biolab or art history the structure of the class guides you through all the necessary processes. The bottom line is that you get to carry out really cool research via advanced lab procedures that you can't do anywhere else.",
    "A really cool concept that is not carried out properly by the professors involved. The professors sell it really well, \"humanities students welcome,\" \"no lab experience or chemistry knowledge required,\" etc., but in reality, this class is made up of a group of art history students and a group of STEM students, and it is impossible for art history students to do well when compared to students who have extensive experience working and testing things in the lab. And there's no learning curve, the professors basically expect all the humanities students to turn into Madame Curie when handed a pipette, and when this doesn't happen, your grade is affected. I found the grading and criticism throughout this class overly harsh, especially when most of the problems in the lab arose because of mistakes made by the TFs.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to a fellow student. This kind of initiative of bringing together the sciences and arts really represents the spirit of Yale's liberal arts education. I think that it would be a shame if future classes didn't have this kind of resource. I know that for many of my fellow classmates taking the class, it was their first experience with biomolecular techniques in the lab; for other STEM majors in the course, it was their first history of art-related class. Really puts things in perspective to explore a different aspect of something you were already interested in, whether it be art or science.",
    "A great course with a strong team of professors. If you are a non-science major, be prepared to reach back to whatever you remember from high school AP chem and AP bio. Work outside of lab is not extraordinarily time consuming, but you'll probably end up coming in for extra sessions.",
    "If you want to take a fun course and also learn a lot this is the course for you! Be prepared to go up science hill twice a week if you arent a science major though! It definitely takes time but the research you do is pretty amazing because no one else has done it before! Also, the course is capped so if you want to get in you should definitely go to the open house!",
    "Difficult; rewarding if you teach yourself science first; and ultimately an experiment in fortitude, public speaking, and not rolling your eyes when science people condescend to your humanities background. Do not be deceived--the art component of this course is only in the first three weeks and then only makes up 25% of the papers\/presentations that make up the rest of this soul-sucking class. I have been conditioned to vomit in my mouth a little every time I hear the word \"phage\".",
    "218L is the perfect interdisciplinary class-both art history\/art and science are represented fairly, and you get a really good grasp of how they interact with one another. Fight your way to get into this class-it's amazing.",
    "MB&B 218L is a must-take course at Yale! Both art and science majors will benefit from this course! Although it seems daunting at first, the project-based course is amazing and you will not regret it! After all, you are at Yale so what better place to take such a course that meshes both the arts and the sciences?"
