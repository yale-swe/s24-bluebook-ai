   "comments": [
    "This is an amazingly poorly taught class. Unfortunately, depending on your major you will be required to take it. You may want to consider taking ENAS 151 instead of this class, but I feel like you will actually learn more by taking the class through the math department instead of the engineering version. If you need to take the class for your major, then it doesn't really matter how bad this class is, but if you do not need to take it then try to avoid it. Lachowska is a horrible professor. She would spend a lot of time in lectures trying to find her mistakes, and would have trouble conveying some of the more difficult topics. The class as a whole is not very demanding, if you put in the time.",
    "It's a difficult course that requires a lot of work. Unless your major requires it or you have an unwavering love of math, I wouldn't suggest taking it. It isn't a course you just take \"for fun.\" If you are willing to put in the time and effort, though, it is ultimately rewarding.",
    "No. Take ENAS 151 instead.",
    "I would recommend not taking 120 unless required for a major. Otherwise the course is relatively useless and unsatisfactory.",
    "Take it if you really have to.",
    "I recommend this course as a founding block for studies in physics, mathematics, etc. I have heard that ENAS 151 is a much better close, though, which covers the same material, so if possible I would recommend that over math 120. Math 120 is poorly taught in general, and ends up being a much more difficult course than you would initially expect.",
    "I would recommend it for students who feel confident in their abilities with Calculus. Some of the material is fairly difficult to comprehend and the course moves quickly, so there isn't much time to focus on a specific topic. If this is not a course that you have to take to fulfill major requirements, I would think carefully about whether or not you truly want to take it.",
    "MATH 120 essentially takes all the calculus you already know and then throws in the third dimension. I would recommend this class to another student if they did well either in MATH 115 or Calc BC and enjoy math - this class is a little too boring and not quite easy enough to justify taking if you don't really like math. Lachowska is meh- she certainly isn't the worst teacher, but if you are really expecting to learn a lot in class rather than study the textbook faithfully, I would find someone else. She does wear the best raincoats though.",
    "Math 120 is a prerequisite for many classes at Yale, and a necessary foundation in multivariable calculus. The material got much more difficult towards the end of the class, but overall I thought it was a manageable class and very interesting.",
    "This was a pretty interesting class with a low course load. Keep in mind that you'll be in a class where half the students have covered multivariable before. Also, the final is significantly harder than the midterms and problem sets.",
    "Only take it if you need to. Unless you have a sincere interest in math or a high aptitude for numbers, I don't think the class will be too enjoyable.",
    "Math 120 is usually a necessary stepping stone to higher math classes, so likely you have to take it, Professor Lachowska isn't a bad teacher for it. Professor Lachowska can be abit dry, but every once and a while makes class more interesting, showing a sense of humor.",
    "This course is a great class to understand Multivariable Calculus, however, it moves very quickly.",
    "No",
    "Don't take this class unless you have Frame. I heard he's the best teachers and all the rest basically suck. That's the reality of the situation. I had Lachowska and she was just bad. Not worth the effort required to learn the material at all unless you are going to be a math major or something closely related. Most majors won't need anything more than single variable calc anyways. Just avoid this class unless you have to take it. I heard 151 is much better and teaches the same material which is good."
