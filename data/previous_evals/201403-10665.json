   "comments": [
    "I would tell a fellow student that this is a course on OPTICAL astronomy, which is essential for any astronomer to know. It is good that this is required.",
    "I would describe this course as highly introductory with an emphasis on historical background and instrumentation technology. I would hesitate to recommend this course to a graduate student, though it might be appropriate for an undergraduate. The lectures were just too irrelevant to current practices in the field. The pace was extremely slow. This course definitely left something to be desired, I don't think it prepared me for my future career nearly as much as I had initially hoped it would.",
    "Yes. May seem redundant if you have already taken undergraduate observational course.",
    "Astronomy 555 is a course with reasonable workload, that covers a wide range of observing theory and techniques. As the course stands, one will need to use IRAF to complete the major assignments, which will present the main stumbling block for completing the course material. I'm not sure whether this is a necessary hurdle to clear, but it certainly makes you aware of potential pitfalls in performing data reduction, and through inevitable multiple attempts you will become very familiar with the order of operations.",
    "As stated above, it's a bit more of a history course than real practical applications.",
    "I would recommend it as an important course to learn the basis of observational astronomy.",
    "It's a fairly easy course which gives a good overview of observational techniques."

   "comments": [
    "It is difficult to think of where a working knowledge of observational astronomy would not be applicable. Even as a theorist, it is essential to know when your predictions might actually be verified.",
    "I do not plan to work with observational optical data in the future. Thus, the direct practical use of the course is limited. Nevertheless, much knowledge gained in the course is very useful for an astronomer in general.",
    "This course increased my knowledge of historical background of the discipline, especially concerning instrumentation. I'm not sure yet if it will contribute to my research, I think it could contribute a little if I were to go into instrumentation.",
    "Learnt IRAF!",
    "See above.",
    "I'm thinking I'll just need to audit this course next time it comes up to really get something about observational astronomy.",
    "Helpful for basics of observational techniques.",
    "The course gave me an historical context for modern observational techniques. It gave me experience in iraf, and doing photometry and spectroscopy. It also introduced me to instrumentation that I may work with in my research."
