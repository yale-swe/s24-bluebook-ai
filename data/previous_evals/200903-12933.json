    "If you want a deep understanding of any particular work, you probably won't get it here, but if you want to get exposure to a broad array of writers pertinent to western culture, this is a great opportunity. just try not to get behind on the reading",
    "Definitely recommended, especially if you like the Western cannon.",
    "I would recommend DS to anyone who loves to read and is actually interested in this stuff. It's much more fun if you do the reading, and you can only convince yourself to do the reading if it's something you want to read. It isn't for the faint of heart, so make sure you're committed.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Although Rawson wasn't terribly interesting he definitely cared about the material and wanted us to do well. Not too hard a grader either.",
    "Rawson's a very good teacher; I regret not getting to know him better, and I probably would have enjoyed the class more had I done so. That said, students will like the class either way - DS Lit is an excellent course.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is an introduction to the great works written from the Greeks to the Romans to the medieval period. Although there is a paper every week and lots of reading, DS Lit is a great program for those who want an intellectual introduction to the Western canon.",
    "Take first semester directed studies only if you enjoy reading and are not seeking any directly applicable benefit other than the understanding of an wide area of older texts.",
    "Yes, I have elaborated above. I think Professor Rawson is an experience worth having!",
    "Directed Studies Literature is the chance to read everything you need to, but which you wouldn't get around to on your own. Personally, I enjoyed the books in and of themselves, but, even if I hadn't, I'd be glad to have read them.The lectures were consistently the best of DS; a few of them were so impressive that the applause went on for minutes afterwords.The workload was intense, certainly, but, because it is literature and poetry, it went faster than expected. Even though this course had more pages per week than philosophy or history, I still ended up finishing it faster.Take this course if you have any interest in literature whatsoever.",
    "An interesting ancient literature survey class with a lot of reading."
