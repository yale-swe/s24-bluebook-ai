    "Definitely take this if you are concentrating on sculpture. It's also fun and challenging for non-art majors.",
    "Very interesting expanded study in process, materials, and sculpture forms.",
    "A fun and unique foray into the creative world. You don't actually need prereqs (I didn't have any). Three major projects, plus an iron pour which was very cool. A lot of flexibility and independence--not for everyone especially if you are interested in theory; there's not a whole lot. Designing and building your sculptures is usually very fun but often also frustrating. The first project is a wood-metal hybrid, the second \"found art\", and the third is open-ended. A great class to take if you are tired of regular class structures and if you like using machinery and working with your hands. Less reading, less formal and structured (and probably more fun) than the intro to sculpture but you have to think for yourself more. YIKES! Also, one of those classes where you get out of it what you put in to it.",
    "Take it. You'll never have another chance to work in a shop like this or to do an iron pour. Do it."
