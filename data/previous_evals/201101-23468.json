    "I thought the EMD seminar this semester was fantastic - we had a great variety of different speakers coming to talk on a variety of different subjects, and they all illustrated very different ways to take the education of EMD forward into different jobs going forward.",
    "Each seminar includes speakers presenting information related his\/her expertise and area of study. Many of these topics focus on infectious diseases in the developing countries. Although it is understandable to have a desire to prevent diseases in poor, developing countries, some students are more interested in domestic issues and there should be a better balance between the topics presented.",
    "This semester's speakers were much better than last semester! Definitely an engaging semester!",
    "More absences would be nice",
    "I liked the EMD seminar series- it provided me with insight as to the process of research, exciting Infectious Disease research under study and exposed me into the how research actually works."
