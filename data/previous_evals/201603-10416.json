    "Amazing course - thoroughly able to explore various painting mediums and styles",
    "I learned to use oil paints, to capture scenes as time is passing, to incorporate details to make my painting come alive, to use colors that represent the world in the most appropriate way.",
    "I learned a wide range of techniques such as egg tempera and glazing, and learned to view changing light not solely as a time constraint but as a way to render my subject",
    "I hadn't painted in a while and I got to get back into it in a relaxed, encouraging setting."

   "comments": [
    "Loved the course - nothing really needs improving",
    "Strengths: traveling to different places on campus, being provided materials, Sam's relaxed but encouraging attitude, the creativity of project assignments. Weaknesses: sometimes there is not enough direction\/feedback.",
    "more critique and feedback would be helpful!",
    "This course was exactly what I was looking for - lots of painting practice across a wide variety of subjects (painting water, portraits, buildings...). I liked coming into class not necessarily knowing where we were going to paint, because I had to adapt to the location instead of planning ahead. The locations chosen were very relevant to the techniques that had been introduced and the role of time in plein air painting. While I did think that the out the window painting was beneficial for me, I wish we had spent maybe 1 or 2 Wednesdays less than we did and gone to other sites."

   "comments": [
    "One of my favorite courses this semester - always looked forward to Mondays and Wednesdays because of Professor Messer's class!",
    "heard great things about sam which was why I took the class. the class is mostly observational on-site paintings and sam is a really good leader. I wish we had more critiques with a better sense of personal direction for everyone in the class.",
    "Painting Time is such an amazing class for students looking to spend the majority of class time painting at various locations (the women's table, the morgue, sterling, the pool, the peabody...) and re-discovering campus through the act of painting. Various techniques like egg tempera and glazing are covered, and you learn to capture a scene a lot quicker than you would spend on a studio painting. Sam is an awesome, relaxed instructor who clearly loves teaching this class.",
    "One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Really enjoyable and I learned a lot. It is nice to balance other more academic classes with art"
