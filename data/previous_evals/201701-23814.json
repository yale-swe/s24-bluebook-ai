    "Watching the design faculty critique the models themselves was the most valuable part of this class, particularly from Ricardo and Michael.",
    "It was useful to get to know the work of the first year designers, and understand their individual processes as we go into collaborations with them in SRPs and thesis shows. It was also useful to be part of a dialogue where we, as directors, could share our responses to the scripts and develop a working language with designers for this."

    "This class was one of the most frustrating I've had at YSD. Because directors often had to leave by 1:00PM to attend rehearsals or other commitments, we very rarely got to experience the most valuable component of the class: hearing the design faculty critique the models. Ming's chronic lateness made it hard to feel invested in the class and the discussions we sat in before having to leave were leaden, sentimental and rambling. Expectations in terms of assignments and participation for the directors in the class are vague which--coupled with the aforementioned poor time-management, makes it hard to feel invested. I understand a lot of these issues will (I hope) be dealt with after Ming's retirement, but it seems a shame that the education of those taking the class has to suffer in the meantime.",
    "The class is too long - as directors, we often have to leave early to make our production work, and miss half the class. The class feels exhausted or bored by a few hours in, which is not a productive state to receive feedback in. The classroom is far too small. During feedback sessions, most of the class can't actually see the set box and critique."
