    "This course is amazing. Even coming in with a pretty solid quantum background, I found plenty of new material in this course. Understanding everything can be really time consuming, especially with the depth that Vaccaro goes into. If your math skills are shaky, you will get murdered on the Problem sets, so understanding all of calculus is a must. There is also a heavy emphasis on physics, particularly wave mechanics. At times, I feel that Vaccaro's treatment of certain concepts is a bit too involved mathematically for this level, but luckily, not completely comprehending the nasty math isn't a requirement for doing well. That being said, Prof. Vaccaro is an exquisite lecturer and even if you aren't much of a person who learns in lecture, you can find his detailed notes on library reserve. The exams are fairly difficult, but you have LOTS of time to finish it, and the prof is very effective, so the grades are usually good. I wish this were one of the open Yale courses, despite its thick content.",
    "This class caused me a TON of pain, but that's because I hate math. No matter how much I studied, I couldn't make a good grade. Maybe you'll have better luck. Seriously study this stuff more than you would study material for another class, because it ends up covering A TON of concepts.",
    "very interesting, well taught class. definitely would recommend it to anyone interested in an applications-based approach to quantum mechanics.",
    "Very in depth course with long problem sets that are often more tedious than anything else. Course material is bland, but attending class is necessary because Vaccaro is a great lecturer and really knows his stuff. Between the handouts and my notes, I never needed the book. Tests are comprehensive but not impossible.",
    "Most of the course is about quantum mechanics. You learn to solve some basic types of QM problems, like harmonic oscillator, particle in a box, etc., and you apply these concepts to hydrogenic atoms, multielectron atoms, diatomic molecules. You do some Born-Oppenheimer approximation and LCAO-MO theory (including H\u00fcckel MO theory) toward the end. You feel like you get a little more of a hands-on taste of QM applied to atoms, molecules, and bonding, but it's still all very vague, and you still don't feel like you're anywhere close to understanding quantum mechanics when you're through. But Professor Vaccaro is pretty organized and clear. Worth taking.",
    "It's a very different course from the 332 course, so expect a big change of pace. It is a lot of work though, so be prepared.",
    "This class is really hard and really good. Take it! You will learn so much. The quantum theory that this class focuses on is essential to a scientific understanding of chemistry. USE HIS LECTURE NOTES. Reread every lecture before each midterm. Study a lot, they are very hard. The problem sets are also hard and time-consuming. Go to section. The tests are basically closed-book problem sets. Vaccaro is notorious for his heavy workloads (this class isn't as bad as his pchem lab though), so get ready to rumble.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Absolutely. Many people take this course because they are required to do so. But if you are interested in basic ideas in quantum mechanisms, this course maybe one of the places to start. The course covers most aspects of the nonrelevistic Schrodinger equation and it's applications. The lectures are very well designed and the homework is very interesting. Professor Vaccaro is a enthusiastic professor who delivers all the lectures in an organized way with a sense of humor. I liked the lecture style a lot.",
    "Chem 333 looks at quantum mechanics in depth. We didn't get through some topics on the syllabus, such as statistical mechanics, because we went into so much on detail on wavefunctions and spectroscopy. If you're taking this course, it's probably because you're a chem or chemical engineering major, but I'd recommend it for non-majors as well. It's a tough class, but you'll learn a lot.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class (one of my favorites this semester); the amount and sequence of material was just right, and tests and workload were both fair and interesting. The class is very well structured (handouts, lecture notes on reserve, homework assignments, discussion sections) to reinforce material and allow many opportunities for clarification. I didn't mind that we didn't really use the textbook. Professor Vaccaro is an extremely knowledgeable and engaging lecturer. I appreciate how organized he is, and I never felt like we had to rush through anything in order to stay on schedule. After doing poorly on a midterm, Professor Vaccaro met with me several times to answer my questions. Throughout he was very encouraging and approachable, and I felt like he always respected me as a student, which allowed me to ask questions without reservation.",
    "Pchem II was actually a lot more engaging and more challenging that PchemI so I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject. Having a strong Math (Diffeq) and Physics background will make your life easier but it's not completely necessary. Be prepared to work hard, but definitely take it!",
    "This class is extremely hard, but also one of the most well-taught classes I've taken. Be prepared to spend 6-10 hours working on the weekly problem sets. The Psets themselves are written to teach material in addition to what is discussed in class. In sum, it's extremely difficult, but you learn a lot.",
    "Obviously this is a difficult class. Use the bible, and don't be afraid to approach Vaccaro for help, because he genuinely wants his students to succeed. Pset are long and math heavy but doable.",
    "Vaccaro has the powerful ability to convert a complex subject such as quantum chemistry into relatively straightforward and easy to understand concepts. His handouts and lecture notes are very lucid and can give you a complete understanding ina short amount of time. If you have questions, Vaccaro is very accessible and can explain material really well. His tests are usually reasonable (even if they are long and difficult) and he gives a lot of partial credit. The problem sets can also be long and shouldn't be left for the night before; they should also be read really carefully because some material from the homework shows up on exams. All in all, even if it is a difficult class, it is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and gave me a great understanding of quantum.",
    "You discuss the failures of classical physics (experimental deviations from theory) which eventually leads to the Schrodinger equation. The Schrodinger equation is the crux of this course as it gives a complete description of any system; you find \/ approximate \/ consider solutions to the Schrodinger equation for increasingly complex systems until one can approximate atoms and molecules. Basically, the course provides a semi-rigorous (because some of the higher math is skipped) mathematical foundation for modern quantum chemistry (atoms \/ molecules \/ bonding)I would recommend this to anyone who is unsatisfied with the superficial explanations given in general chemistry \/ orgo.Alternatively, if you took freshman orgo and liked McBride's qualitative treatment of HOMO\/LUMO theory, you will like this course.",
    "Everything about this class was as it should be. The professor was enthusiastic about teaching. The material was nothing short of fascinating. The weekly problem sets were challenging and useful to complete because they deepened our understanding of the material. We received as much help as we needed inside and outside of class. Most people who took this class were genuinely interested in the subject. The midterms were difficult, but fair, because we were given enough time to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts. The final was overwhelming though--at the end of the semester, all of a sudden there was just so much to put together and you found yourself thinking that everything about quantum mechanics is pure crazy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it even though it is a difficult class, you can learn a lot.",
    "Yes definitely, you should be thinking about this rather than biophysics which seems like a waste of time. This you learn a lot, although for that to be true it needs to be difficult, which it is.",
    "Warming, this class is actually Quantum Mechanics. Don't be fooled by the chemistry in its name. Unless you are a physics major, be prepared for a struggle. Odds are, you have to take it. Buckle up",
    "If you are taking the class, you probably have to take it. But hopefully it is not something you will dread the whole time and you will come to appreciate its value. It is definitely heavy on math and physics concepts, but at this level there is just no way of avoiding it. I think its a great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You learn so much about the physical natura of atoms and molecules, and this is very applicable to someone who is learning chemistry. You basically learn quantam in this class, but Vaccaro makes the material seem much easier and understanding this helps you understand a lot of the chemistry terminology that one learns in high school chemistry. Problem sets take a considerable amount of time but are reasonable, and they really help you learn the material. The midterms arent too bad, since they can be done in unlimited time, but the final is much more difficult. Overall, this is a good class and you will come out of it feeling like you learned a lot.",
    "This was a course in basic quantum mechanics, and a very good one at that. If you have ever sat in orgo and wondered where those pretty pictures came from, you should take this course. Vaccaro is a great teacher, and has perfected the art of teaching a very difficult subject. If you pay attention and ask lots of questions, it isn't particularly difficult and very rewarding. Problem sets took 3-5 hours, never more than 5.",
    "Class is super hard. Be prepared for lots of math and lots of equations and lots of confusion."
