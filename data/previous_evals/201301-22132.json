    "Fantastic class for bilingual students.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who have a strong foundation in Russian. As a student without a great foundation in Russian, I struggled with the fast pace. Otherwise, it was a fun class and I took a lot out of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say this was one of my favorite class so far at Yale. My Russian has improved a lot, as was the purpose of the course. All the readings we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done have been enjoyable and everything assigned is all useful, not busy work. Overall, very positive experience. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it. The course does exactly what it sets out to do: it builds your grammar and vocabulary so that you can write essays; it involves a lot of reading which improves your ability to do just that; it develops your speaking skills, especially emphasizing the difference between formal and informal speech."
