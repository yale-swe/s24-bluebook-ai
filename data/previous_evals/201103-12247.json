   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended. About 6 undergrads in class, 6 grad students and some people in my class were majoring in engineering or totally unrelated fields. That said, the course is specific, technical and art historical, but definitely at least worth shopping for anyone!",
    "Take it if the subject interests you, the instructor's will not disappoint.",
    "I would highly recommend this class or any class taught by professor barringer or holly! The material is fascinating and the chance to work at the ycba is awesome. It's not easy or light but it's worth it 100%.",
    "Would strongly recommend this course!! Makes great use of the BAC's resources and has excellent guest lectures from visiting scholars and professors, in addition to Holly and Professor Barringer's wonderful class lectures. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale!",
    "Art and the British Empire was totally fascinating and illuminating for me, as a non-major interested in representations of imperialism and post-coloniality but with no background in art history. I did not feel that I learned a great deal about the methodologies associated with the discipline, as I had hoped to do, but I learned more than I hoped about the intellectual history of the British empire and its aftermath. Highly recommended for anyone interested who is willing to feel a bit at sea methodologically, or who already knows a bit about how art history is done.",
    "A survey of British imperial art from the sixteenth to twentieth centuries, with particular emphasis on 19th century art in India. Tim Barringer is, as always, brilliant and engaging; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a class with him at the helm, but we were also incredibly lucky to have PhD candidate Holly Shaffer team-teaching the class. I don't know if this iteration of the course will ever be offered again, but take anything with the two of them (and by that I mean either).",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's one of the best classes at Yale. It expands the way in which you think about questions of colonialism, imperialism, race, gender, art, and history. Professor Barringer is basically a god, you get to work with the objects you're studying in the YCBA, and for us there was an amazing trip to the Met. Class is a blend of lecture and seminar, and my classmates were terrific and added so much to myunderstanding of the topic. I think one of the strongest points of this class is the way in which it highlights the political motivations and implications of art, and in that it is incredibly relevant - just take it.",
    "YES YES, A THOUSAND TIMES YES. Best course I've taken at Yale hands-down. You'll get to know the YCBA like the back of your hand and it's a good way to learn about topics that Yale is a leader in - British art. Especially if you're a math major like me and need a course that takes you to the opposite end of campus to get your blood running. Prof. Barringer is the best and if you get Holly, the course will be a fantastic experience.",
    "Definitely not an easy course (especially if you've never taken an Art History course or if Art History is not your thing), but if you're willing to put in the work, it's worth the effort; the professors are great, friendly, and helpful, and the subject is an interesting topic not much delved into in other course. Awesome class!"
