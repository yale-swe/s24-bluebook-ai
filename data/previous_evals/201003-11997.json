    "Good class. Wish it were more of a seminar style. Problem sets were extremely difficult and time consuming, but overall, the work wasn't too bad.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "this is a senior seminar in lecture style. The problem sets are extremely difficult, but the overall workload is acceptable. The final paper is on any topic related to finance and macroeconomics, and is an enjoyable way to explore your own interest.",
    "It's interesting material.",
    "I wouldn't - I wanted more of a seminar instead of a lecture class.",
    "This is a very interesting class, but the problem sets are impossible. So, work in groups.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend taking it unless the Professor makes some changes to the course (which I think he will). It's a good seminar for juniors, but seniors definitely have better choices.",
    "Great course about the macroeconomic models explaining financial markets and panics. A must-take for people interested in financial policy-making.",
    "If you are interested in the material.",
    "Great class if you're interested in financial crisis, especially with regards to current events and there is no final which is always nice!",
    "i definitely learned a lot from this class by doing my own presentation and paper because those were structured in a way to help you learn. however, the lectures honestly did not teach me a lot, except for certain basic concepts that were reitereated again and again- such as suspension of equiliberium, firesale, and some others.",
    "Seminar. Clearly you need to take it for the major or else GTFO and RUN. PSETS = NO FUN."
