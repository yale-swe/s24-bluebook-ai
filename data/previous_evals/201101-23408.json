    "absolutely i would recommend this course to a fellow student",
    "It is a great class with a medium amount of work that I would highly recommend.",
    "Democracies and War seminars revolved around a premise about democratic wars each week. We then read a few pieces from academic journals and discussed those; each week students presented on these articles and then asked the reset of the class questions. The course was very redundant and the readings were not very engaging. You'd be better off taking something like Political Philosophy, MoFoPo, or Grand Strategy.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in the topic of democracies and war, who enjoys reading interesting articles, and who does not mind writing papers. The amount of reading is fairly light, and if you get started early on the papers then the amount of work is not bad at all.",
    "Absolutely. This was an overall fantastic course, one of the best of my Yale career. It provides a strong theoretical foundation on the democratic peace, a safe environment in which to discuss its oft-politically charged conclusions, and the time and space to further reflect on a still-nascent field. What could be better?",
    "Yes. If you are interested in the course material you should definitely take it",
    "This class is a largely theoretical class about democratic wars (wars with one or more democracies as participants). It explores the topic of democratic peace theory, but then you delve in deeper, looking at everything from the decision to go to war to the conduct of democracies during wars. I completely recommend the class. Professor Kane is wonderful, and he has such an interesting way of looking at the question of democratic peace. Do the readings (there aren't that many) and be prepared to discuss a lot, because the discussion are at the root of the learning in this class. However, they're also completely worth it.",
    "If you like political philosophy, take it!",
    "This course explored the democratic peace theory and all of the implications that go with it. We analyzed everything from the causal mechanisms of the theory to its implications on democracies' ability to fight war to the politics behind democratic wars. I would definitely take this course if you're interested in international relations or the future of great power politics."
