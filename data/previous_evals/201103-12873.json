    "This class is one of the best music opportunities I have had at Yale. As an undergraduate, you get the chance to play with really high level players in the school of music, and get regular coachings from Professor Friedmann. As a musician, this class is so eyeopening about how one should approach a playing piece of music from an analytical, formal perspective.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a purely performance class; you get a piece and work on it over the course of the semester, workshopping movements in class once a month or so. All the classes are basically master classes, which gets a little boring if that's not something you're used to, but then again it's Friedmann so they don't get too boring. Aside from that, it's also very minimal work (two listening quizzes, short paper) so not too terrifying. You'd be absolutely crazy not to take a class with Friedmann while you're at Yale so it might as well be this one. He's an expert."
