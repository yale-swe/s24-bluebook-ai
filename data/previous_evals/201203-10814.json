    "I would strongly recommend it because the instructor is nice and this course could give us an overall sight of Physical Oceanography.",
    "Yes. This course is useful to gain a general idea of the ocean physical oceanography, and also helpful to further research.",
    "definitely I will recommend. it's very necessary to have this class to focus on ocean.",
    "I recommend this course because students can obtain the basic knowledge on oceanography both physically and mathematically. Not only oceanography but also atmospheric science is partially covered, which makes this course more rich in content.",
    "- Definitely recommend.- Good, solid introduction to ocean dynamics.- Good, relatively detailed treatment of ENSO and waves."

    "This course gave me not only the overall sight of Physical Oceanography, but also lots of details in some certain fields I am interested in. It help me a lot on my own research and my dissertation, which are highly related to this course.",
    "Strengthened my knowledge of fluid dynamics.",
    "it provides me a comprehensive knowledge about oceanography which is very useful for my further research.",
    "It explains the interaction between atmosphere and ocean, which is quite important in understanding the entire climate. I think the knowledge I obtained in this course will be my fundamental knowledge on larger-scale climate system. This will support my research in the future.",
    "- Got me introduced to ocean dynamics, which is very similar to atmospheric dynamics and will be useful for my research and further courses."
