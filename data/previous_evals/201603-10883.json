   "comments": [
    "My listening comprehension, reading comprehension, and writing certainly improved simply by virtue of having classes in French, reading French literature, and writing essays in French. That said, my speaking did not really improve and may have even declined since Professor Girard was often the one speaking in class. That was fine by me talking about literature and \"intellectual matters\" in French is a whole different ball game, and I found it hard to participate in class for that reason.",
    "I became much more proficient in reading in French. I learned a lot of vocabulary and a lot of French History. I also feel more confident in my French writing.",
    "Practice reading and writing in French at a higher level and with greater speed.",
    "This is a fantastic intro class to further develop reading\/writing\/comprehension skills; unfortunately it's less helpful for speaking, as Prof. Girard likes to run a \"lecture-style\" seminar where she speaks for a long time before asking questions.",
    "Knowledge of crafting an essay in the French style, of French literature's historical background, and of the vocabulary and grammar used in literary French."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Reading list could be slightly revised such that there is a more even distribution among the weeks. It doesn't really make sense to read 200 pages of Proust in one week and then 10ish poems in another. I also think the grading system could have been clearer. Essays could count for more and perhaps the oral should count for less since it took such a short time.",
    "I thought the biggest weakness was the fact that we weren't really able or encouraged to talk in class. Especially as the final examination was an oral, it was very frustrating to not be encouraged to speak in class, it honestly felt like a lecture most of the time even though it was seminar-sized. I didn't have a lot of incentive to read the books we were assigned since I knew we wouldn't have to actually discuss them in class.",
    "Strengths: exposure to range of French literature, thorough lectures for literary and historical context, helpful comments and opportunities to improve your writing. Weaknesses: tendency towards lecture format made this not a good course for improving speaking.",
    "The readings are okay, but I wish we had read some more recent literature as well as francophone literature from outside of France. The course is also a lecture, despite small class size, and I think this is a big problem. As a language class that is advertised as such, the class should be more discussion based. It's also literature, so I'm not sure why there wouldn't be discussion.",
    "Would be great if we could spend more time talking in groups!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Take this simply because it coversmany of the great authors\/works of French literature. I would do it with Girard too because I think Sanjabi has a slightly different reading list, one that does not include some big names that should be on an introductory course to French lit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. I love french literature, but the texts we read are important for the literature of the world. Strong foundation in this field. Good feedback on written assignments.",
    "This is an excellent course for making the jump from language classes with a focus on grammar, vocabulary, and oral skills to literature classes with a focus on reading and writing at a more sophisticated level. The readings covered the full range of French literature and the opportunity to revise the essays meant my writing improved significantly. It would not be a good choice for someone whose primary interest is in improving their oral French.",
    "I would only recommend this as part of the requirement of the French major or if you need to in order to take upper level French courses. Mme. Girard lectures every day, so there is very little time if any for language practice. I honestly think I might have gotten more from reading French books on my own this semester.",
    "This professor is generous and extremely willing to help, no matter how trifling or last-minute your question. The class sessions are less interactive than you might expect, since Prof. Girard does like to give lectures on the background and content of each author, and she tends to ask questions that are difficult to answer, but the material is well chosen, short, and fascinating. I had some trepidation about taking a literature course in French, but Prof. Girard was able to make me feel confident in my French."
