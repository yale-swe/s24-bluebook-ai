    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student--even if you are not an AFAM or AMST major. It is very interesting and as a student you have a lot of freedom. You get out what you put into the class in terms of reading all the material and finding a project for the papers that is most interesting to you. The class offers a very cool way to think about these texts and makes you pay more attention to the book art of anything you read. It is not that much work but you learn SO much by the end of the semester. Take it.",
    "This is a gem of a class. You read a variety of kinds of African-American texts that include book art from Huckleberry Finn, to a graphic novel, to poetry, to picture books. You take several trips to Beinecke and YUAG to examine primary texts. Professor Stepto is the sweetest, and is very accessible outside of class to talk about papers. For this class you must write 3 papers totaling 25 pages, but you get to divide up the pages for each paper as you wish. This was SO NICE because I didn't feel pressured to fill up excess pages on the first paper, and later on I didn't have to cut down my ideas to fit a page limit. This class is not too difficult, and I highly recommend it if you like American literature or are interested in art!"
