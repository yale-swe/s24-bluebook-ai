    "It would be nice to be able to drop one reading response. There was one week that I did the readings but had absolutely nothing to say that I hadn't said before in other reading responses.",
    "It could be improved only by maximizing the number of engaged students in the course.",
    "One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you like Brad, you'll like the class and it's almost perfect. If not, why are you even thinking of taking this class.",
    "It would be nice if our reading responses could be weaved more into class discussion. I think there was little incentive among students to put effort into them because we never got to talk about our response papers or each others in class",
    "Brad is a fantastic seminar leader and contributed to a positive classroom environment where we were all able to contribute and learn from each other. The content is carefully curated and changes year to year. I really cannot think of a way to improve this class, other than to perhaps make one or two weeks' reading responses optional, since I sometimes found myself running out of thoughts I could articulate in a 1100-word written response."

    "A unique course for sure. You'll have a lot of fun and learn some interesting law topics. Don't be deceived though, essentially writing a 4 page paper on a slew of legal cases each week is a decent amount of work.",
    "If you liked Law, Technology, and Culture, you'll enjoy this course, too. More reading responses, more reading, more Brad. A good course to take second semester of your senior year -- but weekly reading responses are not a trivial amount of work.",
    "Take 183 first. Then you'll know if you want to take 185",
    "This class is unlike any other at Yale. I learned more about the interface between law, technology, and ethics than I thought possible in one semester, while also becoming close friends with the rest of the seminar. Definitely take CPSC 183 before this, as it really feels like an extension of the lecture. Still, Brad is one of the best educators at this university, and taking this class will prove it. Plus, free cupcakes!",
    "5sure",
    "YES! If you like Brad, take this class now!",
    "If you're reading this, you've likely already taken 183. If so, 185 is the same except better because more Brad and more happiness and more cupcakes. Reading responses are a decent amount of work if you want to do well on them, but overall fantastic!",
    "CPSC 185 is the cooler uncle of CPSC 183. In all seriousness, it's similar content and structure wise; readings each week that are mostly court decisions and articles. Reading responses are now each week, there's no midterm, and still a final project. The seminar environment is perfectly suited for Brad's teaching style and I really felt like I got a lot out of it. A great course, both in terms of content and enjoyability (is that a word?)",
    "Yes. This course covers a host of interesting and relevant topics that make you think very deeply about how your own information is controlled over the internet. Brad is an excellent professor and students are very carefully chosen to create the best intellectual and social experience every week during seminar.",
    "YES",
    "If you enjoyed 183, you will love this class.",
    "Take this class! It's a continuation of 183 with a very different style and is (somehow) even more engaging."
