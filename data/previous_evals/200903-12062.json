    "Good class, just beware that the literature can bog you down a bit. It's not a class for those looking for light happy reading.",
    "I would really think about how much reading you are willing to do before taking this class. It's a pretty intense load, even though everything I read I thought was valuable and interesting.",
    "Yes !!!",
    "French 250 is a good course, not too heavy on the philosophy (that is, if you don't think of yourself as a philosophy buff, you'll still be fine and able to understand the basic concepts of existentialism explored in this course). The course is largely discussion based and has little work besides the reading and in-class presentations. The reading can take very long, however.",
    "French 250 is a great course as long as you are willing to put in the time to do the readings. If you prepare the readings well, the class discussions can get very interesting. If you start to miss readings, the class quickly becomes dull (since you can't really follow what's going on or be a part of the discussion). As long as you are interested in existentialism and in French literature, you should enjoy the course. Don't worry so much about the language aspect. As long as you try to get your point across nobody cares if you make a few grammatical errors in class. Some of the analytical readings are even in English, and we were occasionally given the opportunity to discuss them in English. I would say go for this course if you want to do a lot of reading and want try discussing it in French.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who feels comfortable reading in French and has an interest in both literature and existentialism."
