    "Boris Kapustin has crafted a brilliant course. I want to entirely agree with what my other classmates have said, but let me just summarize and offer a few additional points:This is the core class of the core classes of EP&E, so if you're in the major then you have to take it, and if you're not then it's tricky to squeeze in to the roster. It covers seven big-deal thinkers, from Aristotle to Schumpeter, tracing the evolution of interdisciplinarity that lies at the heart of this major. And interdisciplinarity is real: if you don't walk away from the class with an appreciation for how you can't really know anything unless you look at it not just ethically, politically, and economically but also culturally, sociologically, historically, etc etc etc, then you've missed the point.It's a great class. Just about everybody gets starry-eyed in front of Kapustin, and rightly so, since he's one of the smartest and most eloquent people on the face of the planet. Class discussions can sometimes be disappointing, with students very rarely responding directly to each other. But the ideas are great, the professor delightful, and the result an engaging course that leaves you knowing a lot of these authors much more inside-and-out than you probably will from any other course at Yale.",
    "Yes. You pretty much have to be an EPE major to get in, so you'll take the class any way. Just make sure to take it with Professor Kapustin.",
    "It is a class that analyzes great political thinkers in the past and see how economy, politics, and ethics interact in society. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "TAKE IT, if you can get in! Truly one of Yale's gems",
    "This is a very wonderful class and taking it with Kapustin is a great privilege. He is one of the most incredible professors at Yale and if you can take this class with him, by all means do. Kapustin makes what could be dense political philosophy incredibly engaging.",
    "Required for EP&E, but a course every one should take. Kapustin is exceptional \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I don't know a professor that can explain political philosophy as eloquently as he does. I think if you write down what he says verbatim, you could turn that into a bestseller. Plus, the content of the course is extremely interesting, especially in light of democracy's failure in the U.S. and Europe.",
    "This class is a more in-depth discussion of many of the classic writers in EP&E, although the course is more focused on ethical and political thought than economic. I would absolutely recommend it with Professor Kapustin. He made the class interesting for me, and I was much more interested in what he had to say than the actual reading itself.",
    "TAKE IT ! TAKE IT ! TAKE IT !If you are an EP&E student, and need to do Classics, you absolutely HAVE to take Prof. Kapustin's section. Kapustin is an incredible seminar leader - the best I've ever had at Yale. Don't anticipate speaking all that much in section - but this is the one time where its worth it, just to listen to Kapustin talk. He has a remarkable ability to distil and synthesize the knowledge of different philosophical thinkers from different eras - and to consistently relate older writers to what you read. He is also very, very helpful at enabling students to work through complicated ideas they may have, and to clarify and condense them into the required essays. The readings are equally marvellous.",
    "Take this class. Kapustin is the best, you'll learn so much context surrounding texts and come away from each class wow-ed.",
    "If you have to take this class, you should take it with Kapustin. If you don't have to take this class, you should still take it as long as you think you'll find the reading remotely interesting. This class was AWESOME. It is the only seminar that I've taken to date where I thought every single class session made me think and was awesome. Professor Kapustin is a wonderful professor and has a certain style of teaching that I think is perfect - he's very respectful and engaging with students' comments, guides discussion well, and does a great job explaining the reading. He's also very helpful during office hours and by email. As someone who did DS and didn't really like it because I felt like I didn't get much out of it, I LOVED this class and wish every DS class I'd taken was more like this one. The reading is not overwhelming, he's very considerate about papers, and even though we only spent one or two weeks on each author, I felt like I got a ton out of each session and really got to engage witheach work in the syllabus, even when I didn't manage to do every page of the reading. Even when you do confusing stuff (e.g. Hegel), he's great about taking class time to explain it and he treats every question with respect and thought (even really simple clarification questions). Definitely a class I loved this semester."
