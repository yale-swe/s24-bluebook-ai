    "Not sure who will be teaching this next year, but I've heard it's good with Valentine. Hazari also seems like a great teacher.there's a lot of material covered, and it can at times seem pretty random, and some of it isn't covered in the texts, so make sure to go to class.my year we had basically no problem sets, so we didn't know what to expect on the midterm or final.",
    "A good class if you're interested in spectroscopy and evaluating spectra. Some stuff on thermodynamics and kinetics of coordination complexes.",
    "The class goes through the basics of inorganic chemistry\/coordination chemistry pretty well but only gets really interesting near the end. Faller talks a lot about theory and how to get to certain techniques, but you're never sure what you need to know and what you don't because there are no practice problems.",
    "This class was pretty good. I didn't have the prereqs for it, but I still found it manageable.",
    "This course was a good advanced inorganic chemistry course, but it started out at a level that it is possible to take this as your first inorganic chemistry course at Yale. I would recommend taking it if you are doing research in inorganic chemistry and would like to learn more about the spectroscopy involve. If you are taking this class with Professor Faller, just as a warning, there are few problem sets and it is difficult to see what will be tested on the tests. I would recommend meeting him in his office and asking him questions about the class material."
