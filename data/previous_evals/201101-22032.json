   "comments": [
    "It's a great class, and I definitely recommend it, but make sure every member in your group decides to put in the same level of commitment into chamber music - otherwise, it can be very frustrating if all the members have different levels of commitment.",
    "Good opportunity to play chamber music for credit, not really any work required besides rehearsal.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in chamber music. It should be taken seriously, but it's not an enormous time commitment and rehearsals etc. were always like a nice study break. Plus you get to choose your own repertoire (along with the other members of your group, of course). The studio classes are really helpful - they're a great way to get feedback from a perceptive and supportive audience.",
    "This is a really fun class, and a great way to get to know other musicians! The masterclasses are a wonderful opportunity to practice performing in front of others, and the student feedback is always interesting and informative. Definitely take this class if you like playing music, and you like other people!",
    "See reviews from prev semester",
    "Learn and refine an entire chamber piece throughout the semester. Get to know the other members of your group really well! Super fun experience, especially if you love chamber music as much as I do!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any students who enjoy playing an instrument. Performing chamber music is both intellectually challenging and rewarding.",
    "I would definitely take this class. It is the best music you will find at Yale college.",
    "Requires timely rehearsals. The work required is primarily done outside of class, so you must be able to allocate time for chamber music. Overall, I had a great time with my chamber music ensemble.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any other classical musicians at Yale- it has the potential to be a very high level of performance, and it's great to see other serious musicians who are passionate about what they do. It's often difficult to find this among the craziness and stress of other music programs.",
    "I would highly recommend this course provided that the other student was very dedicated to music and had already achieved a fairly high level of proficiency.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Take it if you can. It's essentially your only option if you want to play and perform chamber music with some kind of structure. Form your own group if possible, though Wendy does a good job putting together ad hoc groups.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is one of the rare opportunities to get credit for performing and you get to work with amazing musicians. This class is so much fun I almost forget I'm getting graded on it.",
    "What's not to like? It's chamber music. The coaches are great. The performers are talented. The music is especially wonderful.",
    "The class provides an organized framework, with coaches, studio class, and (hopefully) set rehearsal times (you have to work that out with your own group) for playing and performing chamber music - it's the best thing ever! You have a coaching once a week, with coaches alternating each week between one of the 2 faculty members who run the class or your group's assigned member of the School of Music's post-grad student quartet-in-residence. You're supposed to rehearse at least 2 hours a week on your own, and there are studio classes about once a month (which unfortunately go on for about an hour and a half, can be soporific, and you don't get to play that often in them - each group basically plays one movement, hears comments from other students and coaches, and sits down). If you like playing chamber music (and how could you not, it's fabulous?!) audition for this class!",
    "Any serious musician at Yale should take advantage of this great course. It is rare to find a chamber music class of this caliber outside of a music conservatory."
