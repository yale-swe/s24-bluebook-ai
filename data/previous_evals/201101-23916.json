    "Gender and Health in Modern Africa was a great class. It covered a wide range of topics in modern African history, stemming largely from the turn of the century and the colonial period. While the syllabus appears to have a lot of readings and assignments, the papers aren't that bad. The readings are long and theoretical though.",
    "I would recommend this for someone who is looking to get a general overview on health issues in (mostly southern) africa. If you're more interested in a certain topic in a specific place this might not be the best class-it felt like more of an introductory course. It also straddles an awkward line between history and contemporary Africa which was difficult to reconcile throughout the course."
