   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I would appreciate a little more structure, particularly if at the beginning of each class the instructor would talk briefly about the topic of the day instead of just letting us dive into the problems.",
    "This year, there wasn't really any instruction at all. I think this should be a full credit course with real lectures in addition to problem solving sessions.",
    "Pretty fun and relaxed class where you work on math problems with friends. Take it only if you are interested in competition math, not for a easy credit though.",
    "Strength: instructor, interesting topics, low time commitment Weaknesses: meetings on Tuesday evenings, weekly homeworks",
    "Solving problems in groups is a great asset of this course. Persistence through difficult problems was strong in our groups, and having others with whom to explore\/grapple with concepts was instrumental to my learning.",
    "I enjoyed it most of the time. In my opinion the questions that were presented could be more representative of the Putnam, because of this the questions became more about sudden inspiration, whereas the Putnam is about exploration. All in all I think there should be more emphasis on fewer problems during the class with additional materials for after\/during the week.",
    "You get as much out of this class as you put in, which is a good thing. If you're having a hard week, this class adds no more stress. But if you have some extra time some week and want to spend it doing fun math problems, this class gives you that opportunity.",
    "It was exactly what it was meant to be, practice for the Putnam by simply doing lots of problems",
    "interesting content!",
    "I wish there was more instruction. I had never done proofs and just wished that 75% of the class time was used doing example problems as a class. I felt very lost.",
    "We did lots of practice problems, and the homeworks reinforced our in-class themes. But there was very little \"learning\" in each class beyond doing practice problems, and I would have appreciated a more guided\/hands-on approach to the material.",
    "Essentially a problem solving seminar for a half credit. Pretty well structured and Pat is awesome.",
    "Strengths: It's a fun way to get a half credit and to get yourself to take the Putman. Weaknesses: Because it's largely self-\/peer-study, you don't learn much. It would be great if there could be a lecture component to the course in which real skills are taught.",
    "More teacher engagement would be nice.",
    "It's great because you can practice writing proofs and working with math in an environment of smart and supportive people!",
    "Group work is a strength. A weakness is everyone is coming at this class from different backgrounds and with different intentions so sometimes theres an imbalance.",
    "Really fun - it's a great way to hang out with both math and non-math folks alike!",
    "It was generally very good.",
    "The strengths of this course include a wide array of problems to work on and a supportive community of math problem-solvers who are eager to work on them. However, solutions to problems were often not given, and students had to find them online themselves. I think it would be better for the instructor to give solutions to key problems and explain why they are instructive.",
    "The instructor was the best aspect of this course, he really cared about teaching us",
    "I really liked it as is! Actually would not change anything - I liked how chill the class was as it allowed people at different abilities to be doing different things",
    "The course is good- dividing up its class into those who are very much interested in math and those who are looking for an interesting half-credit course. We could have perhaps gone over more problems as class before being left to try problems on our own.",
    "Strengths - low time commitment, fun class Weaknesses - still felt a bit unprepared for the Putnam, but you can never be fully prepared anyway",
    "The non-math major \/ math major divide of rooms seemed somewhat exclusive - I never got to know the students in the other room. Maybe a larger room would be more helpful for the administration of the course if possible or some switching of the rooms",
    "The course did really well in catering to different math backgrounds, and offered a good variety of problems every week. It could improve by offering a solution guide\/hints to previous weeks' problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "No, this course provides no benefit to the students and is used only as a way to boost Yale student participation in the Putnam Exam, for which this class does not prepare individuals.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is at all interested in math, as it is available to all levels of mathematical ability.",
    "Yes",
    "The class is definitely going to be different next time it's taught, so it's not really worth reading reviews",
    "If you are taking the Putnam, sure why not?",
    "Only for mathies who would like to do well on the Putnam.",
    "Absolutely. A fantastic, low-pressure opportunity to engage with (and enjoy!) math particularly if you aren't in the major.",
    "Again if you want to do better on the Putnam or if you're interested in doing math with other people, do it.",
    "I'd highly recommend this course to anyone who's interested in learning techniques about competitive math, and having a less stressful course.",
    "Anybody interested in Math based proofs should take this course!",
    "Definitely. This course is extremely flexible, so it's easy to tailor how much work you do from week to week depending on the workload for the rest of your classes. Even if you don't put much work into the class, at the end of the semester you come out with a packet of fun math problems to do on your own and the experience of participating in the Putnam.",
    "Why not? It's fun, you get to meet other math students and practice fun math problems, and at the end of it you can take a university-level math competition. Pat will become your fun uncle and you get an extra half credit to top-up that 4.5 you had to take for the language requirement. Plus there will probably be some free food at some point. Again, why not?",
    "If you need a half credit and want to spend an extra few hours a week on fun math problems, :)",
    "ya",
    "It is a good course. You might not learn a lot if you are not a math major.",
    "If you want to take the Putnam, for sure!",
    "Fun seminar to do Putnam problems for a half credit, pass fail. Homework is just scanning in a solutions, so essentially nothing. You have to take the Putnam which I guess is work, but why take the class if you have no interest in taking it anyways. Lots of fun, and Pat is the best.",
    "Yes, it's a chill way to do some fun math even if you know you have no chance of doing well on the Putnam.",
    "Yes, this course was extremely fun and rewarding when you solve a problem!",
    "Yes! It's a great course if you're thinking about math, or if you are even just curious about it. It's super low-stakes and laid back.",
    "Yes if you are interested in doing more contest math.",
    "If you need a half credit sure.",
    "Yes! It's a ton of fun and you'll actually learn some cool proof strategies!",
    "For sure! Chill and you learn a bit, if not just get some practice in.",
    "Yes",
    "Yeah!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is seeking to improve their mathematical problem-solving skills because it is a low commitment class that exemplifies the \"you get what you put in\" mantra of learning.",
    "If you need a half credit to graduate or round up your credit count take this.",
    "Absolutely, riveting material",
    "Absolutely yes Pat is an absolute gem and the course\/work is a lot of fun.",
    "Unless you actually have a chance of doing good on the Putnam before taking this class, it might not be much help. Take it if you think you want it, but if you have no expectation of doing well, then it may be a drag.",
    "Yup, definitely! As long as that student liked math in some way",
    "If you need a half credit that meets once a week, yes, please take it. It's like a crash course in proofs and number theory- the weekly homework is to attempt 2 problems we looked at in class (they're not graded, you just have to do it) and there is no final exam. You will be required to take the famed Putnam Exam at the end of the semester, but it's a really great course! Pat is a wonderful teacher. Very fun to learn from and very, very good at explaining mathematical concepts. Thank you, Pat!",
    "Yes! Great half-credit course that isnt too much of a time commitment, and you learn a bunch!",
    "It was fun! It felt more like a club than a course. Take it with friends!",
    "Yes! Take the Putnam too :)",
    "Yes, I think this would be a great course to take regardless if you're interested in the Putnam or not. It introduces simple concepts and shows how they can be used to solve a lot of cool and complicated problems."
