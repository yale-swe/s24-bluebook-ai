    "So much of Chinese poetry like all poetry canons across the world is dominated by male writers, but this course really showcases the depth and breadth of female poets and their incredible artistic output over the course of Chinese history. Additionally, I learned much about Chinese history while taking this class, which helped my engagement with the texts. Professor Chang includes broadly important events in history as well as idiosyncratic moments that other, less interesting professors might gloss over.",
    "I learned about different themes and trends in Chinese literature, such as poems about sickness, courtesan-poets, etc.",
    "Learning to put prose into context and analyze and write about it. Learned a lot about the background of traditional chinese values and teachings through readings in class.",
    "I learned about prominent women writers in Chinese history, organized by theme -- such as widows, those with illnesses, recluses, courtesans, nuns, etc."

   "comments": [
    "This class is amazing. Professor Chang is a great lecturer: warm, engaging, witty, and passionate about her work. You could listen to her talk for hours about a subject that she has dedicated her life to. Despite the high level of discussion and the intellectual rigour that is demanded of the class, it is somehow also incredibly relaxing to sit in an intimate room and discuss poetry with Professor Chang for 75 minutes.",
    "This course was listed under LITR, EALL, and WGSS. i don't know if this is common for cross-listed courses, but this class lacked a coherent approach. As a result, it did each of the three fields a disservice. We would read poems but wouldn't really do any close reading. The fact that we ignored this gave me the impression that the poems weren't as complex as the Western poems I had studied in my other classes. All of the discussion questions asked broad questions about groups of people (e.g. courtesan-poets, nun poets) and expected us to come up with something meaningful after having done only a day's worth of reading. How can we do justice to these groups of people and acknowledge nuances in individual members if we've only read a fragment of what they have written? This class should either teach the history of Chinese literature or actually pay attention to individual poems and writers.",
    "Strength: Professor is very knowledgeable and very willing to help. TA is also always helpful.",
    "A major strength of the class is that it is extremely well organized by topic, and the readings are carefully selected as well. My personal preference would be to eliminate the discussion part and just listen to lecture (but more of a relaxed lecture, where students can ask questions)."

    "Take. This. Class. I looked forward to every lecture, and made sure that I did not miss a single one. The syllabus and readings were incredibly well-chosen, and you will take so much away from hearing Professor Chang speak and read poetry. She is not only a great lecturer, but she has amazing taste in literature, and you will definitely come away from this class with at least one or two new favourite poets.",
    "No. I took this course because I wanted exposure to non-Western literature. Because of the weakness of this course, I worry that taking this class might actually strengthen existing stereotypes about the inferiority of non-Western texts.",
    "Yes, a great fifth class and you'll learn alot about chinese culture and values.",
    "Yes, take this class! Kang-i is a renowned figure in this field and she has so many insights during lecture. It is also an amazing, almost spiritual feeling to connect with poets from centuries ago, as generally the poems are very accessible (i.e. free of pointless abstract sophistication of a lot of today's poetry). The course is also very well organized.",
    "Very much so. Prof. Chang is not only one of the foremost scholars in her field, but also an engaging & insightful lecturer with immense anecdotal knowledge, and a sweet and funny person who makes class feel like a fireside chat. She makes connections about the writers I couldn't have arrived at myself. But they are not esoteric: the poems suddenly reveal themselves when she talks about them. She is very open to daring or unusual essay topics. The structure of the course by theme rather than chronology made for a much richer experience. The only downside is that the translations are often not so great -- and I fear some students will think that Chinese poetry is much weaker than it actually is."
