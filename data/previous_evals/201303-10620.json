    "Learn the basics of latin. Take latin if you're interested.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student who does not have any Latin background or very little background. I took Latin in high school, but still found the class to be challenging.",
    "This class emphasizes the basic principles of latin grammar. I recommend this class to students looking to relearn the fundamentals of latin, and who want to gain a solid understanding of the language before matriculating on to the next level.",
    "Absolutely. Even at the end of L1, you have acquired tools to translate parts of the great ancient authors - an exciting achievement if you ask me.",
    "The best Latin course ever",
    "Excellent course. You learn the material you want to get from an intro Latin class and you learn it well."
