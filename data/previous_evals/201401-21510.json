   "comments": [
    "This is a good class to take, just be sure to talk in section because that grade counts for a lot.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Not very much work and the material can be very interesting.",
    "Yes. Definitely. You learn a lot, and the course is not time-consuming",
    "I would recommend this class without hesitation. The lectures were organized and interesting, and the workload is extremely manageable. There are weekly readings, but if you pay attention in lecture and take good notes, you don't necessarily have to do the readings. The tests are fair; if you study for them, you'll have no problem getting a good grade.",
    "This class is such a cool combination of psychology and political science. Bullock is an excellent lecturer and the class is super clear-cut! Definitely take if you're interested in either subject!",
    "Interesting class material and manageable work.",
    "This is a typical psychology course with political examples. Many topics will be very familiar to psych majors. The real draw of the course is John Bullock, who is an amazing lecturer and thinker.",
    "Simple. Yes.",
    "It's a fine class. Not super hard.",
    "No. don't take this unless you are extraordinarily interested in the psychology behind voting behavior and participation in politics. Even if the syllabus seems interesting, the lectures are a drag. If you need an easy class though with minimal work, you could pretty much not show up to lecture and not do the readings and still be fine. Bored, but fine.",
    "If you find the class material interesting and like the syllabus, take this class. It has interesting material with a great professor and the workload is manageable. Political psychology has some really interesting applications in politics, law, and elections. It is worthwhile for anyone looking to pursue those fields and it does not require preexisting knowledge about psychology. Some idea of how to read a social science paper is helpful and more of a background in statistics would have been nice, but it is by no means needed.",
    "YES! I like really structured, clear lectures and even though Prof Bullock doesn't use slides, he does a great job at presenting the information in a clear and organized manner so you know when you're transitioning topics. He's also such a great, articulate lecturer and one of the best parts of his class is that he WELCOMES you to interrupt him and ask questions if you don't understand something or just have another question about the topic. That's a very refreshing change from big lectures at Yale, where you usually have to wait until section to ask questions and even then you don't get to hear it from the professor's mouth. Also the information is super interesting and relevant to the real world. You'll never ask, \"why are we learning this?\" It's all about psychological phenomena that effect us every day. Also, there's only three tests and that's it. They give you a choice of which questions you want to ask, so that's nice.",
    "Very easy class. Interesting material. Take it. And there's no final.",
    "This is a truly excellent course. Professor Bullock's lectures are remarkable and every minute he speaks is valuable - one wants to take notes on everything. He also really cares about teaching his students. The structure was also excellent - just three short exams and the option of writing a paper in lieu of the third. I thought the topics were fascinating and truly important for any student of political science. I would caution, however, that one mistake on the exam can end up really costing you for your grade, so beware. Definitely a terrific course though, and highly recommended.",
    "This class is an engaging intersection of political science and psychology. No previous political science or psychology experience necessary. I would recommend this class, it is interesting, Bullock is a great professor, and the only work is reading & midterms.",
    "yes i'd recommend it! two exams and a choice between a third final exam or a paper. (choose the paper). and interesting material",
    "Only take it if you really need the credit....didn't get much out of it. If you really like theory and want to learn how to criticizes an article, you'll gain those skills in the class.",
    "Very interesting class that isn't too hard",
    "This was a great class. Very interesting and, if you're willing to put in the work, not too difficult.",
    "My favorite class at Yale by far. Everyone really needs to take this class. Professor Bullock is a great lecturer and his grading is so fair, which is such a nice change from some of the arbitrary grading in other classes. The class is really chill with 3 easy non-cumulative midterms, section participation which was really fun, and you even get a few lectures off and end a week early.",
    "You literally learn about the cross section between psychology and political science-- attend lectures!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as an introduction to the topic. Because the reading is research papers, it can be dry at times, but it is good practice for other political science and psychology courses where reading those is the norm as opposed to getting spoon fed from a textbook. Professor Bullock has an interesting lecturing style, but he was more than willing to take questions during and after lecture. Workload is very manageable and grading is very fair.",
    "Two lectures a week, three exams and a weekly section. Prof Bullock is a great lecturer, I enjoyed listening to him speak. The material was not always the most interesting, and there is a large section participation grade that stressed me out about talking during section, but all in all a good class.",
    "A solid if unspectacular course if you are interested in politics; probably not worth your time if you've already taken intro psychology.",
    "Take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to somebody in the political science major.",
    "Good course and quite interesting material. Bullock is the big strength \u2014 amazingly caring and prepared teacher, who never wastes a second of your time: if he has something to say, he says it concisely and with the most carefully chosen words imaginable; if he doesn't, he either doesn't hold class or lets you leave early. There is a lot of overlap with other courses in the psychology and political science departments, but, overall, a very solid class, and one that makes me appreciate political science methods (the class is VERY methods-focused), and the value of conducting a true experiment. Low workload and fair exams. Shop it, though, and see if you can listen to Bullock, who has a distinct speaking style that might turn off some.",
    "Take it. You will learn something, no matter what your interests are.",
    "Take it Credit D unless you're a psych student because the curve is hard and there are a lot of try-hard psych majors in it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The lectures were always interesting and the readings and exams were manageable.",
    "This class is interesting, but I recommend taking it as a polisci major rather than as a psych major. Half of what you do is repeat findings from intro and social psych (Milgram shock experiments, Asche studies), and then tack examples from politics into it. I didn't come out having learned a ton about politics or campaign strategies, and ended up relearning a lot of intro psych kind of stuff. Professor Bullock is a unique lecturer, so be sure that you are comfortable with his style before signing up.",
    "The tests were pretty impossible which I wasn't expecting - one wrong answer and your grade dropped super low. One of the TFs mentioned this too, that a lot of the people who had obviously done a lot of work for the class weren't having it reflected in their test grades. That being said, Professor Bullock is a great lecturer and I really enjoyed the class. My TF was really great too. Don't come in expecting an easy A though - I don't think it's a class where how much work you put in necessarily correlates to what your grade ends up being.",
    "I would recommend this course. I thought the information presented was very interesting, enjoyed having Professor Bullock as an instructor, and thought the tests were fair. Recommended.",
    "Take it because it's interesting and will open your mind a lot, but be wary of the exams. Study the readings carefully but above all situ the lecture notes very carefully. If you miss a class get notes. The exams heavily lean toward lecture with reference to he readings.",
    "Definitely take this class. It was one of my favorite classes at Yale. The material is really interesting and the professor is eloquent and really knows his stuff. The exams are very straightforward.",
    "Very well thought out course, covering what feels like a broad range of topics, while at the same time linking them together well. I joked to a friend that this course could be re-titled, \u201cSkepticism in the Social Sciences\u201d and I feel that's fairly true. Bullock does emphasize the fallibility of each author or study, and a fair chunk of the course looks at the ways in which we might be incorrect in our own assumptions and beliefs. It is very much more a Psych course for Poli Sci majors than it is a Poli Sci course for Psych majors, however as a psych major you'll go into some depth in a sort of \"applied\" sense in select fields. Even for those not in polisci or psyc, I'd recommend it, as it's an interesting look at select topics in psychology as they might relate to politics and the voter. Grading is blind, but fair and exams are non-cumulative. He will probably take some days off through the semester, so there's not *that* much to cover, and no text-book. He makes lecture very optional, but *do* go, most of what's covered in the exam won't *necessarily* be covered in lecture, but it will be made obvious how you should be approaching the readings as they're often not as concise as the scope of them that you need to know. Impassioned about this area, and incredibly intelligent, I have heard that some students find Bullock's tone to be monotonous. I disagree. While mimic-ably idiosyncratic (\"Students..... I'd like to talk to you today about priming.... but before we begin...\"), he is fairly interesting to listen to. However, do beware of any time he starts a list (\"there are five things you need to know about X\"): some items will have 5 minutes or much more spent on them, and others you'll miss because you forgot there was a list and suddenly he's on #3. I hear that this course may not be taught again in the near future, but I recommend taking a class with Bullock if you can (I have no idea what this course will be like if taught by someone else).",
    "The course title is a bit misleading because it was more of a psych course with some political applications rather than a full-on course on politics. Prof. Bullock is incredibly logical and methodical in the way he lectures, and has a way of attaching an importance to every word. Exams were tricky but fair?",
    "Political psychology is a great class for a student of the social sciences looking to bridge the gap between two very important fields of study. The interdisciplinary approach is essential, because the psychological tools we are granted are necessary to understand our complex political scene. The class also taught us how experiments, data, and research are essential to any theory or proposed theory in political psychology. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I don't think Professor Bullock is teaching this again (at least soon) but if you are interested in the topic, I would highly recommend it. It is interesting and cool to learn and he is extremely knowledgeable and precise. Would not recommend if you are not really into the material as you will probably find Bullock to be a boring lecturer (although I did not).",
    "I would recommend this course but would warn that there were more statistics involved than I expected; however, it was still fine without having taken any statistics course prior.",
    "I liked this class a lot. The readings are interesting, the material is great, Professor Bullock is very sharp, and has a good sense of humor. The first day of shopping period, standing outside the door as it was crowded in a too-small room, I didn't think it was anything special, but I'm glad I stuck around. Professor Bullock is one of my favorite professors. The material is fascinating --one of those classes where you don't do all the readings, but wish you did. Not too much work--one of my easier classes this semester. Most of the material came from lecture--which was always interesting to me. Bullock is always super prepared and knows exactly what he's going to say. He doesn't use powerpoint and always pauses for questions. He goes at a good pace. Ideal learning environment: great lecturer, great readings, useful discussion section.",
    "Good class if you're legitimately interested in both political science and psychology. It was more psychology-heavy than I initially expected. There is a lot of reading but you don't have to do all of it. I thought the exams were not too bad, and the final was held a week before reading period, which was really nice timing-wise. Professor Bullock is a good lecturer and very helpful.",
    "Awesome class. Very interesting psychology studies and how they relate to real world politics. TAKE IT.",
    "A thorough introduction to the psychological aspects of American politics. (Note that the emphasis in this course is on American psychology and how it applies to the fundaments of politics\u2014less so on politics itself.) Fairly straightforward, the course includes three midterms that cover loosely organized material, most of which you'll find very interconnected. A huge perk is that it finishes weeks before finals even begin, but the workload\u2014maybe to accommodate for its early conclusion\u2014is fairly reading-intensive. Bullock's a quirky but amazing lecturer, and I think you'll enjoy this class if you enjoyed intro to psych.",
    "Do not take this class. Despite the potentially interesting course material, Professor Bullock made this my least favorite class so far at Yale. Everything is so robotic and mechanical and he never includes any review materials or gives any idea what will be on the exams. You don't learn much and you aren't even guaranteed a good grade.",
    "This course is heavily focused on the social sciences as a discipline and social science experiments. It is closer to psychology than politicl psychology. I would recommend it if you're into that kind of stuff, but you might find yourself bored if you're more of just a political science person.",
    "Very good class; focuses mostly on important psychological studies throughout history",
    "This class is based in psychology but centers around topics pertaining to political science. Good class with excellent TFs",
    "Absolutely. Take it.",
    "If you can take the class with TF Rosa Po, then absolutely. With a weaker section leader, I'd proceed with caution. The exams, while straight forward tests, come with a bit of time pressure and the mistakes for which points are docked aren't things you can necessarily prepare for. That said the material is interesting and it was fun to take it with a friend."
