    "This seminar is one of the best-taught and most thought-provoking I have taken at Yale (I'm a senior in EP&E, so I have considerable experience with political science seminars). Especially having taken DS, this course provides a fascinating counterpoint to the Western political canon. The reading load is moderately heavy but very consistent, and it's all worthwhile material. Professor Tauss knows how to motivate lively discussion in a seminar. I have greatly expanded my understanding of Chinese political thought and traditions through this course and would recommend it to any student except the kind that likes just to check email during classes\u0097you should take a lecture instead so you don't ruin the seminar experience for yourself and your peers.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Well, not really, mostly because I thought Professor Tauss could have done a better job leading discussion, but he's leaving so I don't even know if this course will still be offered.",
    "A great class and overview of Chinese political theory. Should definitely take it if ever offered again.",
    "I would recommend that other students take this class, but unfortunately, Professor Tauss is leaving Yale after this year."
