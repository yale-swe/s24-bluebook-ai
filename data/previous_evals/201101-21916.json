    "this class was more like from 9:00-10:25am. She lets you out about 10min late every time. We never really got through what we needed every class.",
    "Take this class only if 1) you really like 20th century music, 2) you are already quite familiar with 20th century music, or 3) you need it for an advanced theory credit.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course unless it undergoes significant revision. It is an interesting topic, but there was a lot of reading, weekly assignments to be turned in (sometimes twice a week), and it was just hard to maintain interest.",
    "This class is a lot of work. The subject material is interesting, but a little scattered. Some of the assignments felt tedious and pointless. However, much of the material was interesting, and pursuing a final project on a topic of your choice was a wonderful opportunity."
