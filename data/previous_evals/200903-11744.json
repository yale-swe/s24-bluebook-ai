   "comments": [
    "This course was well organized.",
    "too much work for half a credit. welcome to labs at yale. obviously dont take it unless you have to but if you have to, its a good course.",
    "You probably have to take it \u0097 I say do it as soon as possible.",
    "You probably have to take this class, but lucky for you it's actually kind of fun.",
    "Take this course if you have to. I wouldn't take it just \"for fun\".",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, although most of the people considering it probably are required to take it anyways. It's a very good lab class, not an overwhelming amount of work compared to other labs. If you have a good TA, you will actually enjoy this lab.",
    "sure take it... probably because you have to. It's not too bad.",
    "Chemistry 223L is the synthesis of organic molecules, using synthetic techniques studied in the prior semester of organic chemistry lab. I would certainly recommend this course to another student; while I enjoyed the first semester of organic chemistry lab as well, I really enjoyed this semester, when we could actually use techniques to create a tangible product.",
    "Required class, but a fun lab (a big difference from Gen Chem lab)and not too much work. Professor DiMeglio is really friendly and she keeps the lab well organized.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab because it really solidifies the techniques that you learned in first semester lab. You do a lot of synthesis reactions using those techniques, but now with more efficiency and skill!! The TA's are really helpful, and besides two long lab reports (that do take up a lot of time), the workload otherwise is low and less than first semester lab.",
    "It's a continuation of first semester orgo lab. Definitely a lot better than first semester.",
    "I would definitely take this if you are taking orgo 2 as a nice supplement to the chemistry you are using.",
    "Great lab course, very straightforward. Love Dr. DiMeglio dearly.",
    "Don't take it unless you are Pre-med or a chemistry major.",
    "Yes, it's probably one of the most fun labs to take at Yale. You get to synthesize all sorts of organic compounds using techniques learned from the first lab (Organic Chemistry Lab I).",
    "Well, take it if you must. Or else, no.",
    "While almost always more interesting than first semester, orgo lab II is still not something you would take unless you have to. The week to week workload isn't bad, maybe an 1.5 hours or so, but lab reports are always a pain. The labs varied a lot in their time and difficulty, but they were usually relatively short. Grading depends a lot on who your TA is, over which you have no control.",
    "Much more interesting than Orgo Lab I. Even if you didn't have a great experience with the first orgo lab I would definitely take this lab.",
    "Good for med students",
    "Take the course if you want to improve your organic chemistry techniques. But, be warned, the grading is sometimes ridiculous. Taking off points for missing page numbers. Pretty lame. Stupid. But that's how they grade the assignments. :(",
    "The second semester of orgo lab was interesting, and actually enjoyable. The syntheses were fun to do. And the course is very well structured and organized, which is a plus. However, there is too much work for this course for half a credit - it's about a full credit's worth of work. There were only two full lab reports, and there is plenty of time to complete them, which makes it very doable. Nevertheless, they are long and tedious. Also, the grading is harsh - points are taken off for every small thing, such as not putting the name or experiment title or page number on every page. The lab final was hard and tricky, and requires a lot of studying to do well. But other than that, the lab environment is very good and calm - the lab is not stressful at all, I'd even say it's soothing. If you have to take it, it's not that bad. If you are considering taking it for fun - it's not that bad either, but expect to do more work than you think for half a credit.",
    "Yes; it was good lab that displayed the concepts of organic chemistry efficiently.",
    "Chem 223L is the continuation of first semester orgo lab. You basically learn a few more basic orgo lab techniques, combine them for several labs, and do more of the same write-ups. They're longer this semester, but you also have more experience, so that should somewhat balance out. They still grade pretty harshly on stuff like format. Don't leave the full lab reports until the last minute. They are very very very long and time-consuming.",
    "You are probably taking this course because you just finished up first semester orgo. Don't worry. I found second semester lab to be about the same amount of work as first semester, and in some ways easier, since the experiments and lab reports become pretty routine."
