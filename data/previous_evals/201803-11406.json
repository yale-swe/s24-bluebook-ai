    "I really enjoyed this course, most of the readings were very interesting and I was encountering some authors and scholars (ancient and modern) for the first time. I appreciated the seminar style of the class, but it might have been helpful to indicate which readings we would focus for each class. I have found in larger seminar courses like this one, some professors choose to include weekly writing assignments or reflections on the readings as a way to gauge how students are encountering the readings since some students participate more vocally while others do better in writing. This may be a way to increase participation or at least see what students think about the week's readings before the class discussion."

    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interseted learning about and problematizing ancient \"rhetoric\" and rhetorical methods in an interdisciplinary way. Though the bulk of the reading pertained to classics or New Testament, most of the issues discussed had much wider applicability."
