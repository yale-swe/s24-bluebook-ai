    "An introduction to how the internet functions!",
    "Some knowledge on how to use an obscure framework that nobody uses and for some reason, the only support online for this framework is in the form of public email threads.",
    "You learn about the different layers of a computer's network and how they work together to carry out the functionality of a computer - internet requests, email, messaging, etc. The focus is mostly on understanding what happens in the computer when an end user requests something from the web or send something to another end user.",
    "I learned about the internet and its underlying processes",
    "A broad view of the inner workings of different networks and protocols that make the system which we know as the internet.",
    "How the Internet works from top to bottom, and specifically the way it moves packets from source to destination. There is a very clear hierarchy of layers in the Internet as set by the Internet Engineering Task Force, and we learned about each of them in detail. Personally I thought learning these things was really cool, and made me feel much more knowledgeable about how the Internet works.",
    "I learned a conceptual and calculation-based overview of the 5 layers of the internet.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength in that it followed closely along with the text book which made reading the text an even greater supplement to the lectures in class.",
    "The biggest strength was the content -- there's so much interesting stuff to draw from! I was confused about the course's organization -- I'm not sure why we did the transport layer after doing everything else. Overall, this course suffered from a lack of energy -- in the future: host a walk-through session on Wireshark and Mininet; provide more strongly-guided review sessions for the exams; and use more real-world examples. It'll go a long way to keeping us engaged with the content and excited to be in the course.",
    "Constant busy work is not fun...",
    "Strengths - The professor is open to listening to the concerns and wants of the student Weaknesses - Some assignments, especially the final project, depend more on coding knowledge than what you learn in class. We never got grades back in a timely fashion.",
    "The material covered in this class was very interesting. It certainly taught me a lot of basic networks that will probably be useful in the future. But thats pretty much it. I dont think the course was well structured, there was a lot of requirements; too much homework that only added up to a small percentage of the final grade. The tests werent hard but they were long and unclear. After spending some time on some part of the final project we learned that the professor decided to not grade it. And overall, the lectures were relatively slow and boring.",
    "Lecturing could be somewhat improved",
    "The course gives a great overview, but there is a very big disparity between the expectations of the professor with the students' progress, and their actual standing in the course, as well as the brevity and length of each homework assignment.",
    "Strengths: the material is really interesting, the textbook is very very good and is considered the gold standard textbook for this material, the slides used in class are taken straight from the textbook so are also very good, and the professor is super knowledgeable and articulate. The material is not overwhelming, and I felt like I had a good grasp on the concepts we learned. Weaknesses: class can be very dry, and even though what the professor actually says is super clear and makes sense, it is hard to pay attention because of the extreme monotone. Also, the class is not well-organized: the midterm dates were not on the syllabus and changed on the fly, the homework questions were poorly worded and taken from the Internet, problem sets were due just days after they were posted because they were posted late, and grading was extremely slow so we had basically no feedback before the middle of the term and the Cr\/D deadline. (We also never got feedback or scores on the second midterm or final project, which were collectively 65% of our final grade.) Solutions to these problems include planning midterm dates before the semester starts and posting them on the syllabus, handing out the homework on time so we have ample time to work on it, and being more proactive about grading assignments. Not putting the midterm the day after break would be helpful too, since it basically takes the vacation away from us.",
    "This is a well-structured course, the problem sets were often enough and very helpful for the exams, and the exams were fair. The lectures were often slow, but Leandros was very helpful and would make sure everyone had a solid understanding of the concepts.",
    "Content is very interesting but the course is disorganized."

   "comments": [
    "If one is going to be going into a profession that designs applications for the internet, then I would recommend this course to them. However, any other profession in electrical engineering doesn't really need to know about these topics.",
    "This is a lower-work EE elective, and it has interesting content, but it's not a very fulfilling course, so I can't fully recommend it. The grading was tricky and we don't have a sense of how we're doing in the course -- the average on the first midterm was a 70. Lectures were boring, homeworks and their lab components were dull and repetitious, and while the final project was interesting it used a skillset that we had not interacted with before at all (i.e. python mininet).",
    "I probably would not recommend this course. The workload is deceptively high, lecture consists of reading slides, but at least you get notes on the exams.",
    "This was much more work than I expected and there were some stuff that I wasn't happy about. The project at the end was somewhat helpful but super annoying. Also prof is nice and all but a very boring lecturer. I wanted to fall asleep most times I was in class. Wireshark labs were just busy work. Exams ask sometimes for minor details but it's okay because the exam's are open notes. I was frustrated at many points in the class.",
    "It's a doable class. Not necessarily the most enjoyable, but it's on the lighter side for an engineering course.",
    "The material covered in this class was very interesting. It certainly taught me a lot of basic networks that will probably be useful in the future. But thats pretty much it. I dont think the course was well structured, there was a lot of requirements; too much homework that only added up to a small percentage of the final grade. The tests werent hard but they were long and unclear. After spending some time on some part of the final project we learned that the professor decided to not grade it. And overall, the lectures were relatively slow and boring.",
    "Yes, good way to learn about how something as essential as the internet works",
    "Only if they really needed to take it for their specialty.",
    "Maybe. The prerequisites say any math OR computer science class is enough, but I disagree: you need an understanding of probability, either through AP Stat or some stat class at Yale (probably any S&DS class is okay), and you ALSO need intro CS, since the final project requires a fair bit of Python, which is doable if you know another language but tough if you have never coded at all. If you have never written code and\/or have never learned probability, you will definitely struggle with aspects of this class. If you do have that background, I'd probably recommend it, since the material is really interesting, you'll learn a lot, and as these types of classes go, the workload is not too high. The professor is also very good at explaining things if you actually focus on what he is saying, although he can be really tough to listen to because he speaks in a quiet monotone the whole class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone (regardless of your major) who is interested in the inner-workings of the internet from a high-level view. The problem sets are mainly simple math\/probability and the only programming is in the final project, which you can receive abundant help with.",
    "Not unless you're willing to spend a serious amount of time communicating with the TA and professor. It's more work than it seems. Psets and the final project aren't that well-defined, the scope of the midterm\/final was difficult to determine (and the fact that they were open-notes added a weird element to preparing for them). The content is very interesting."
