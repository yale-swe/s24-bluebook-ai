   "comments": [
    "I loved the class and would definitely recommend it. There is so much more to be learned about the South and people should take the opportunity to explore these more intricate histories.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in, especially if Andy Horowitz is still the TA. You'll learn about parts of southern history you didn't even know existed. Prof. Gilmore is great, and always has a colorful anecdote about life in the South to add to discussion. There is a lot of reading, and some of the books can be a little dull, but most are very good. And you can write about pretty much whatever you want for the term paper. Great class.",
    "Take this class!",
    "I would recommend it. It was quite a bit of work, but it was well worth it.",
    "My favorite course I've ever taken a Yale. The final paper is pretty intense, but it's worth it.",
    "Take this class if you get in - absolutely great course with interesting material and great professor.",
    "History 139J is a course that covers the development of the South from Reconstruction to the present day. The emphasis is less on dates and facts and more so on cultural and social elements that brought about change in the South. I highly recommend this class to another student. Both Professor Gilmore and the teaching assistant, Andy Horowitz, were extremely invested in the course, and each seminar was enlightening and engaging. Additionally, Professor Gilmore and Andy were very involved in the paper writing process, offering helpful feedback along the way.",
    "Yes - the class was enjoyable, but a lot of work. There's a good bit of reading, as well as a 20-25 page term paper and a ~4 page film review. It's also really slanted towards political and social history, so don't take it if you aren't interested in those fields. Otherwise, you'll learn a lot and have a good time.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Prof. Gilmore is phenomenal, and you will be lucky to study with her. A very structured and interactive paper-writing process means that the research and paper are fairly rigorous\/demanding, but only in ways that are helpful, unlike when teachers demand outlines halfway through the semester when you haven't actually done research. The readings are very interesting and the class makes it worth your while to actually do them. If you are an underclassman you will get a whole lot out of this class and really learn a lot about the craft and profession of history, and if you are asenior you will still get a lot out of learning the history of the modern South and working with Professor Gilmore. Also the South is incredibly interesting, and this class covers a lot of different aspects of the region that you might not have considered previously but will be grateful to learn about.",
    "The history of the south since the civil war. Be ready for a class that is awesome but demanding. Also be ready for talking about gender relations A LOT and basically disregarding everything but black and white relations until the last week. I'm super proud of the paper I came out with, regardless of what grade it turns out getting. I wig there ha been a little less emphasis on class discussion though.",
    "Excellent class. I really enjoyed it and the material we covered was fascinating. The class starts with the populists and goes all the way to the rise of Wal-Mart, evangelism, and family values in the South. Professor Gilmore and Andy were great at leading discussion and always brought some humor.",
    "I knew when I walked into the first day of class and Sweet Home Alabama was playing that this would be a fun class. Amazing course with two absolutely incredible professors and a bunch of southerners in the course :p Most fulfilling, challenging, thought-provoking, hysterically funny and fun class I've taken at Yale, hands down. It's a ton of work but so worth it. Prof. Gilmore is extremely prominent in her field and Andy is possibly the coolest and smartest co-professor imaginable, and is an experienced historian in his own right."
