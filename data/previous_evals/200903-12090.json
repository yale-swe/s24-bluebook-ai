   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to a philosophy student. If you are interested in learning about how international relations work, take an actual political science class.",
    "TAKE TAKE TAKE. If you want a look into both philosophy and current events, take it. It's a great class, and the coursework's not too heavy (just a lot of readings). Often, lectures basically consist of \"The World According to Thomas Pogge,\" but hey, that's not too bad either.",
    "Phil 180 a very good course, particularly in its reading list, though Pogge is not the most exciting lecturer. If you don't take it though, you should still read the first couple Peter Singer articles on the syllabus (which are almost enough on their own to make the class worth it). They will blow your mind.",
    "I love philosophy and classical ethics, but did not particularly enjoy this class. It has a lot of potential, and a lot of the material is, in fact, worthy of study. This course does not do a particularly good job of doing so effectively.",
    "This class makes an attempt to present other viewpoints, but at the end of the day, it's really the World According to Thomas Pogge. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I did feel at times as though ideas were being shoved down my throat. Still, the class gives a good exposure to 1) global economic \/ distributive justice; 2) immigration \/ national partiality; and 3) just war theory \/ terrorism. I was most interested in the first part of the course, but the other two are also highly relevant to current events.There's a fair amount of reading, and in order to do well on the exams, you really need to read it (the midterm \/ final are intensely time-pressured). There are also two essays. Section discussions are generally extremely interesting (far above the average) since everyone has intensely personal viewpoints on many of the issues.Pogge is a good lecturer, and it was nice to have Markus helping him out so that the class ran smoothly. If you want to think about these highly relevant normative questions and are willing to do the reading, I'd recommend the class.",
    "GREAT CLASS. SUCH COOL INFORMATION.But...hard to do well in kind of so I took it Credit D.If you put the time in though, you'll be fine.The material is SO thought provoking and relevant. TAKE IT!",
    "It's a decent course. At times very interesting if you like applying philosophy to international issues. Other times, lecture can be boring, and there can be a large amount of reading that may be uninteresting.",
    "Excellent class. Professor Pogge is brilliant. Great readings if you enjoy philosophy or ethics in international affairs. A heavy focus on duties to the global poor. Some climate change, just war theory, terrorism. Even a reading by Osama bin Laden. I enjoy philosophy and politics a lot. This is by far the best lecture class that I've taken at Yale.",
    "This class is a really good introduction to the moral philosophy of international affairs; Prof. Pogge is a brilliant and a good lecturer, if somewhat inaccessible. There is a lot of work in terms of exams (2) and papers (2).",
    "Recommended! You learn a lot about central debates in ethics and international affairs. Professor Pogge is also great.",
    "Yes, the course changes profoundly one's outlook of life and makes us rethink what obligations we have towards the world's poor.",
    "The course is a fine lecture course for those interested in the philosophy of international affairs. It really is a philosophy class (Pogge is a philosopher, and the papers are meant to be philosophy papers) so that can be a very welcome break or a very frustrating diversion for PoliSci majors. In general, I'd recommend the course, because it is interesting and challenging but not too hard for most people to understand.",
    "Take it!",
    "This class was an overview of a wide range of philosophical views relating to global poverty\/distributive justice, just war, terrorism, and the morality of nationality and state borders. There was quite a bit of reading, but it was usually interesting. Lecture was definitely worth-while; Professor Pogge provided great critiques of the readings and was engaging for the most part. I would say this course is more of a philosophy class than a political science class, but it offers a wide range of views on issues that definitely pertain to international relations and each of our lives individually. Overall, I would recommend this class to another student--it was engaging, thought-provoking, and pretty fun.",
    "This class is great! I took it as a sciencemajor, pre-med, just interested in this stuff, and it turned out to be a good decision. The readings are really interesting, and section makes you think. It's great if you want to learn some philosophy but actually have it apply to real life issues. Pogge's great, the TA's were great. Pogge's a big name too, but so down to earth. Take it!!",
    "If this mix of ethics and IR are of interest to a student I would greatly recommend this course as a basis for a moral analysis of foreign policy, which is not available elsewhere.",
    "I would probably not recommend this class. I found the subject matter to be too applied for philosophy and too theoretical\/unrealistic for political science. However, if this is something you are interested in, then you can definitely get something out of this course. Pogge is unorganized at times, but definitely knows his stuff.",
    "Don't take it unless you're a bleeding heart liberal or a conservative who likes to argue a lot. And definitely don't take it if you don't like section assholes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students because Professor Pogge is fascinating and an engaging lecturer, the readings and materials are thought-provoking and highly relevant to international relations issues today, and overall I really enjoyed the class.",
    "Phil 180 is a great course, and well worth taking if you're at all interested in the ethics of international affairs (in re poverty, trade, war, terrorism, etc). It gives one a fundamental grounding in how to think about these issues and lives up to the title of Ars Liberalis (those things a citizen ought to know). The readings are long but doable (or at least catch-up-able if there's one or two that are too long to do the night before)--and worth reading anyway, you citizen-of-the-world, you...And above all, the teaching is great. Lecture is always a pleasure and not to be missed, and Prof. Pogge, Markus Labude, and the TAs were great and doubtless will be again next fall."
