    "Take it if you like Greek art and have a bit of a background already. (not too much necessary, but a little is really helpful)",
    "6 reading responses (2-4 pages), final paper proposal, final paper. I'd recommend taking the class because I really liked Professor Gaifman- the subject matter sometimes was confusing because it's so different than other typical art history classes that focus on the 19th century onwards.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it to a student majoring in art history or who is interested in classical things. To some, the material could be dry and boring, but to others, it is enlightening and exciting.",
    "yes!",
    "This is a very specific study of Dionysos in early Greek art, based on pots from ancient Greece. If you like Greek art, I'm sure this would be an excellent addition to your studies, but it is so completely single-minded that I found it very difficult to find an overarching purpose. It really isn't contextualized AT ALL in terms of other Greek Art, so coming in with some knowledge would REALLY help. It looked promising at first, but I found it completely repetitive by the middle of the semester. You would have to really LOVE this material to take the class, but if you do, Professor Gaifman is very knowledgeable, so she's a good resource for people who want to go much more deeply into the subject. She isn't great at explaining how and where to look in order to do that, however, so you really have to be very motivated and interested to get much out of the class.",
    "I would prepare them for the amount of pottery they will look at. This was not clear in the course description. Knowledge of art history would be important. I would tell them that it stretched my knowledge of this kind of art form and that I might not have ever sought that out before."
