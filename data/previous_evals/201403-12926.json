    "I would recommend German 120 for another student, but not the section with this professor.",
    "This course covers a wide range of German grammar, vocabulary, and culture. At times, many of the assignments seemed like busywork, probably because they were. Grammar concepts were often explained quickly and incompletely because there are often many topics to cover in a single class period, the logic being that one can simply find the day's presentation online and review it at his or her leisure. This was problematic within the classroom, because these rushed explanations were always followed by exercises from our textbook which incorporated our very crude understandings of these new concepts. I think most of my peers would have agreed that a majority of learning for this course took place outside of the classroom. The topics covered in the course were interesting, but the structure in which these topics are presented seriously needs to be reevaluated.",
    "An okay class with easy material but a lot of busywork. I mean, you'll learn German, not much else to say about the language courses. I did not take L1 and did this for fun because I wanted to learn German after living there for two months (using English) doing research. You shouldn't be worried about a lack of prior experience (get a tutor if you really are): by the end of L2 you will be at the same German level as perhaps a month and a half of concerted study. If you're taking German with Steimer he is a decent teacher but he takes himself too seriously. Textbook and homework package are expensive and generally useless. You can get the digital version for a bit cheaper. Would not recommend until teaching material set is changed. We had to keep up the farce of writing lengthy twice weekly emails to German penpals who clearly were not aware of what exactly \"email\" was. Projects were fun, except for the ones where blogging was required. So I guess half of them were fun.",
    "The German department is just bad. In particular, our class was a huge pain in the ass. Herr Steimer was taking off points for practically everything and on every occasion when it was possible. The classes were extremely boring (with some exceptions) and they were structured as follows: 10 min grammar, 5 min exercise 1, 5 min exercise 2, 5 min exercise 3, etc.... The class definitely failed to hold my attention. I know it is a language class but it could be so much more entertaining than just doing grammar exercises. Lastly, the homeworks are stupid and take you a lot of time not because they are testing your comprehension of German but rather ask you weird facts about Germany that have no relevance to the class. If you are looking at this, then most likely you have to take the class anyways. I pity you.",
    "I would recommend GMAN 120 01 for other students. It is a challenging course, it demands a lot of work, but it is worth it since you get a lot of exposure to the language and you improve your German skills quickly.",
    "L2 is a class that advances your comprehension and understanding of the German Language. While I enjoyed learning the material, I felt that the teacher was quite stringent."
