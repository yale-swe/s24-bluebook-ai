    "It is a more applied version L3.",
    "Great way to get fluent and review main structures.",
    "It was a very good final language proficiency course that really improved my grammar, and also speaking abilities. The work load is ramped up a bit from L3, but because there is class everyday you have no choice but to stay on top of it, so it is really not too bad!",
    "Taking Spanish with Barbara is a good idea for students who are willing to be bold in the classroom. The first half of the semester is all review of grammar covered in L1-L3, and affords little opportunity to talk unless you really force yourself to be heard. The second half of the semester finally allows some rich conversation as you discuss Spanish-language texts and films. Barbara is less interested in summary and more interested in commentary, so I'd imagine that her class discussions of these texts is more interesting\/creatively-rich than some of the other sections. It's important to know in advance, though, that while Barbara loves teaching and her students, she is a strong personality who will talk over anybody who does not assert herself boldly in the classroom. She also does not hide her frustration when students zone out, and her sternness was difficult for some students in our class to adjust to.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student who wants to build their ability to express more complex ideas in Spanish because I learned to express ideas I did not know how to express before because I lacked knowledge of the more complex grammatical constructions I needed to express those ideas. I gained that knowledge from this course and am now able to express many more ideas in a wider variety of tenses. The texts we studied were also helpful in reinforcing and building knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, helping us even more in applying these concepts."
