    "Q10. Professor Reuning-Scherer is an incredible educator. He is patient, creative, clear, and dedicated to his students. It was always a pleasure to attend his class.",
    "To answer #1, the comic book Jonathan suggested was really helpful!",
    "This is as good as it gets in a basic statistics course",
    "The T.A., Madeline Rubenstein, was excellent and extremely helpful!",
    "#8, 10 Really enthusiastic lectures, but sometimes it was too much. Especially when it's all going over my head.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer is great, he makes himself available very often and is extremely helpful. His energy and sense of humor made the class very enjoyable!",
    "Q8: I thought the professor was very engaging and obviously loves teaching, which is great. The lectures were very fast however, and sometimes it was hard for me to relate what we were learning to what we had learned. It seemed like the not-so-important stuff was given equal time as the need-to-know stuff, and it was hard to separate the two and understand how the material we were learning related to past material.",
    "14, 16, 17, 19",
    "Good class! Definitely worth taking.",
    "Question 12 The course was really useful and the professor was always available to answer questions from students.",
    "Your class, as it stands now, is an undergraduate course being taught to (mostly)graduate students. Redo your lectures, incorporating(FES students') research that applies each of the Stats models you want to teach. Have a new academic paper for us to read (each week?), then in class go over the model&data of the paper. This would be a more applied approach, causing us to look at Stats within other publications with a critical eye. This would teach us stats concepts; we are not statisticians. Also, at least 1\/3class days should be spent in the computer lab. You treat Minitab like a footnote of the class. Minitab is actually wildly important for the homework and so much time is wasted by your 100+ students trying to click through Minitab. Note: Other readings to consider for the class -\"Naked Statistics.\" I would suggest this be reading during summer before coming to class or during 1st month of class. Footnote: Thank you for your energy in class. Your effort is noted and appreciated.",
    "I felt that the classes were a little too fast and I did not manage to catch everything in class. However, the assignments helped to reinforce the concepts taught in class. I find the class really helpful as it allowed me to better understand scientific papers and I could put to use some of the statistic analysis in my projects immediately.",
    "I had never taken statistics before this course, but had a good math background. I feel like completing the assignments really brought the lessons home for me. However, I would soon forget the concepts and have to go back and relearn them multiple times in the semester. Now, at the end of the semester, despite the fact that I got a decent grade, I feel like I've forgotten most of what I learned and should probably take an introductory course again. It's hard for me to tell if this is due to my learning style, the professor's teaching style, the fact that I hadn't done math in a while, or something else."

    "The topic is interesting and relevant to life in general",
    "The professor teaches in an engaging and fun way. I laughed more in Stats class than any other class, which is extremely useful, as I have a tendency to disengage with math. The case studies were helpful, as were the step-by-step notes. Rather than getting stressed by math, I actually enjoyed coming to class. I will remember enough of the subject matter to be able to analyze reports in scientific studies with a more careful eye. The final project can be as easy or as difficult as you like, and the professor is very available to help.",
    "Jonathan's light-hearted and effective way of delivering the lesson and concepts.",
    "Teacher, final project",
    "- Access to his excellent lecture notes and slides ahead of time. - Prolific use of examples to illustrate concepts. - Revisiting past concepts often in relation to new content. - Inclusion of software-specific instructions for each statistical concept. Professor Reuning-Scherer's energy and enthusiasm!",
    "The best aspects of this course was how clearly Jonathan was able to convey some really complicated concepts. I also really appreciate his organized class notes that we can keep with us and continue to refer back to throughout our studies. Those notes will continue to be very useful.",
    "Fun to go to class, intense learning, clearly taught",
    "JDRS was probably the best part. He was energetic and funny and really committed to students learning the material. He made something which could have been very dry actually interesting and enjoyable.",
    "Extremely clear explanations in a non-jargon fashion by the instructor.",
    "Being able to reference the lecture slides during homework problems and take-home midterms was very useful.",

   "comments": [
    "An earlier start on the final project would be helpful.",
    "Maybe some of the homework assignments could be shortened",
    "Jonathan moves very quickly, understandably since there is so much to cover, but I sometimes would feel confused in lectures until I went home later and re-looked at the material or spoke to a TA.",
    "My biggest crit, besides that the material is unfortunately inherently kinda boring, is that whenever I went to get help from the professor or TA in an unstructured time period (i.e. sometimes the professor lets us sign up for 15 min time slots for help, but in this case I am talking about otherwise when he just has Office Hours), I always had to wait at least half an hour for them to get to me since there were so many other students, even when I got there 10 minutes after office hours started. I also felt bad about asking too many questions or asking the TA to further clarify since there were so many students waiting behind me. So I felt I wasn't able to use the TA or professor for help as well as I would've liked to.",
    "It should be more engaging of the class. Jonathan is great and always upbeat but the course itself is dealing with a topic that needs to hvae more active student participation.",
    "I liked the time in class towards the end when we worked in small groups to decide which statistical model was most applicable to the studies presented. A few more moments of group work in class would be nice. Otherwise, excellent.",
    "More homework (for practice)!",
    "The lectures go perhaps a little bit too fast",
    "It goes very fast. It's sort of inevitable because of everything we have to cover, but one or two things could probably be cut out just so everything goes a little slower",
    "The course moves very quickly. Class is dismissed early on most days, which I gather is by design since it's hard to hold students' attention for longer when discussing stats. However, I think on days when a particularly tricky topic is being covered, it would be beneficial to slow down the pace, use more examples and use the full class time.",
    "Not very interactive, beside answering \"ZERO\" every once in a while. More problems and lectures with examples from environmental studies or research would help me key in a little more. It would be more obvious of when to use different tests.",
    "I think it's a lot of material to cover in one semester so it might be useful to assign or strongly recommend one specific book for the whole semester",
    "Making videos available to be able to consult them after class to help resolve doubts.",
    "More information on what the final project is supposed to be - the examples were very different form what JDRS seemed to actually want. Sometimes, I wanted JDRS to slow down. JDRS's jokes.",
    "I would have appreciated more screen shots for the MINITAB work - the prof. went through examples really quickly in class and it was hard to replicate what he had done in class later on the homework since the slides with MINITAB instructions were sometimes incomplete.",
    "n\/a",
    "The assignments and midterms are more than enough to test and engage the students. I think the final project is unecessary and adds a heavy load at the end of the semester.",
    "Minitab for Mac - I feel it hindered my ability to learn by not having it on my own computer and ability to use it at anytime.",
    "No need for improvement--this course is great.",
    "Sometimes some classes were too fast, but the problem sets were useful to review the concepts that were taught in class.",
    "See note above^",
    "I wish that it was a little slower so that we can have the time to absorb and understand before moving on. A few more examples would be helpful.",
    "Especially for internationals it could be hard to keep up with the pace of the professor's explanations, which made it more difficult to understand. Questions on take home exams could be confusing. There was no book but books were suggested - that might be considered to do differently, but maybe not necessary. Slides were already very helpful.",
    "-The course was based on Minitab, which doesn't work on Macs unless you partition your drive, which Yale can not currently do for students. It would be good to either use a different program or find a way to use it on Macs. -The TA's were great, however, most of the times I went, they were too busy because of the volume of students. It would be good to have two TA's on duty especially closer to when assignments are due.",
    "Minitab is a great program, but I have a hard time working in public spaces on statistics without getting distracted-- because I have a Macintosh I could not work on my homework often while at home."

I am already seeing improvement in my reading and critique of scientific papers (my eyes used to glaze when reading statistical methods). I may even suggest finding excerpts of scientific article methods and asking the class why these scientists used these statistical methods (was it right, wrong, should they use another?). This could be helpful for us in critiquing scientific literature.",
    "Stats is important to any major where you're doing some sort of quantitative analysis of some [large] group of data, beyond just mean\/median\/mode stuff. But honestly I don't foresee myself using stats in my particular discipline, since we're often doing different sorts of analyses (I think he mentioned spatial analyses?) besides correlation between variables.",
    "It doesn't fit into my program per se, it just is relevant to life in general (reading academic articles, understanding sampling rates, etc.)",

    "It will help with my understanding and application for data analysis for my summer project.",
    "Valuable for people in any field. For me it is particularly useful to scrutinize \"every day statistics\" and those related to my course of study.",
    "Statistics is good to know for research.",
    "Everyone vaguely interested in science should take statistics, particularly those interested in environmental science. It's not only interesting and relevant, it helps a lot with readings of other papers and helps one better analyze other people's work. Really everyone at FES should probably have to take some sort of statistics class.",

    "The material is very helpful for my overall program and it was very important for me to take this course because I will use statistics for some other projects.",
    "Statistics is vitally important to my future research in the environmental field.",
    "It was a good refresher and it thought me additional statistical tools which I did not have. It will definitely help me understand how numbers in reports are churned and help to question the basis of these numbers when necessary.",
    "I used the skills learnt in this class already in other 1st semester courses and papers, so that was really great. Feel much more confident about stats now and feel that I will be able to apply it to other environment related research.",
    "I will be conducting social science research, which will definitely require understanding statistics.",
    "A basic understanding will be helpful, and give me a leg up in comprehension of ancillary professional materials, but I doubt I will ever use most of what I learned in this class.

Variability in stats and writing ability made it tough for there to be equitable participation by group members, but maybe that's not necessarily a function of the group work design, but the profile of my particular group?",
    "It was my favorite part of the course.",
    "We only participated in a group work for the final project. It worked out very well as we had time to focus on one area of the project. A disadvantage is trying to work with different schedules.",
    "I really enjoyed working in a group. Learned a lot from my teammates.",
    "I appreciated being able to do the homework and the final project as a group. I think we helped each other a lot in our learning.",
    "Its always great to know that there aren't any right answers in some stats problems. The groups helped in this regard.",
    "The advantages were that we could collaborate together to use what we learned in class and join our knowledge. A disadvantage is that our schedules were different so we needed to organize the time to work together.",
    "Group projects are the absolute worst. Always.",
    "It is helpful to split the work up and to be able to talk to someone about issues that you have.",
    "As always, when you work together you can learn from each other and have discussions about the material, which is a good (better) way of learning.",
    "Much of the statistical inquiry and material importantly rely on good practices and there are rarely absolute solutions-- so working as a group for the final project was instructive in bouncing ideas off of one another and reflecting on individual thoughts, decisions, conclusions."

   "comments": [
    "Actually go to the lectures; they're helpful, and entertaining!",
    "Remember to review what the professor teaches in class afterwards, or it's easy to forget the old knowledge as you learn new ones.",
    "A textbook is not necessary, but it can be helpful.",
    "As other students said before, stay on top of the material.",
    "Starting the pset like the day or two after it's assigned, rather than the day or two before it's due, is always a good idea. Try to get lots of help from the TA or professor, even if it's a long wait to do so...",
    "Stay up to date with the class work. Falling behind is a bad idea.",
    "It's an excellent statistics course. Take it if that's what you're looking for.",
    "The readings and weekly office hours helped alot if you are lost. Just go even if you don't have questions as other students might experience questions that you didn't know to ask.",
    "Ask questions during class to ensure complete understanding",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it - you will not be sorry",
    "Take advantage of JDRS- go to office hours, go to his open help sessions. They'll not only help you do better but also you'll get a better hold on the material. Also keep up. If you miss a class, be sure to watch it online and if you fall behind, be sure to ask for help. Besides the speed, this is actually a fun class that everyone should take",
    "Do not bother buying a textbook unless you want to have one for reference - the lecture notes are all you need to succeed in this class.",
    "Do the homework early and keep up on it. Don't try to take notes in class. The lecture happens way too fast for that to be an effective method.",
    "Do not fall behind and work on all of the assignments.",
    "Go to all the classes, take advantage of all the office hours and if you need to read a book to enhance your learning, the Cartoon guide is great.",
    "Get help early and often!",
    "Definitely take the class, it will go a long way in helping you understand data analysis.",
    "If you need stats take it, but if you have time to take it over the summer before the program at your community college, that is better for your bottom line.",
    "Worth taking. Good, comprehensive intro stats class. You learn a lot without much pressure.",
    "Take the course if you want to have atleast some grounding in stats. What you learn may be the bare minimal that you will need in the field",
    "Solve all the problem sets with time, because some might take more time than others and go to the discussion sections with the Teaching Assistants as well as with the professor. The professor was always available for the students to answer any doubts and he always showed a nice attitude to solve any question.",
    "This is one of the best stats class I have ever been to. Stats is still stats but at least the lecturer tries to make it more interesting and manageable. Stats is important tool to have especially in scientific papers and also in policy making as alot of information come in through numbers and there is a need to understand how these numbers are generated to draw the right conclusions on them.",
    "It can be rather time-consuming, but very valuable, especially when you don't have proper stats skills yet.",
    "Print out the lecture notes and take notes on top of them. Get the cartoon guide to statistics and follow along in there. Go to the TA's sessions as much as you can.",
    "Use the notes online and re-watch the recorded lectures on confusing material while browsing the notes."
