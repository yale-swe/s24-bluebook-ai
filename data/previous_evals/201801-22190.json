   "comments": [
    "A thorough understanding of the history of European and American theatrical realism, as well as the complexities, nuances, and subversions associated with it. Great selection of plays, paired with interesting readings in theory and secondary literature.",
    "This course really helped me improved my grasp of realism as a field. Professor Robinson's choice of plays, which covered a very broad range of different styles and approaches to realism, made the class very informative and interesting. Although I had been exposed to realism before, both in drama and in literature more generally, the fact that we studied works from many different countries was particularly illuminating and really helped me understand how literary phenomena can evolve across languages and cultures."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall this was an exceedingly strong course, particularly due to Professor Robinson's excellent teaching and the great selection of plays that we've read. I've especially appreciated, and found insightful, how the course began with precursors of realism and ended with a truly contemporary play, spanning the period from the 1800s to the present. It was also very helpful to be able to watch the video recordings of some of the plays on the syllabus. One minor weakness is that we often did not have enough time left to discuss our readings in secondary literature. In the future iterations of the course, it might be a good idea to either pare them down or make sure that there is class-time reserved for those pieces.",
    "For me, the greatest strength of the course was Professor Robinson's lecture-style teaching. Although there was ample opportunity for discussion during the seminars, I particularly enjoyed the fact that he would begin every class with a short summary of his own thoughts about the plays and about the contexts we were working with. I also thought the wide range of texts was a great strength of the class, and I really enjoyed it when we delved into closer readings of the texts. I think some more close reading would have occasionally been useful, as it would help illustrate the ways specific texts engaged with realism."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! It is both a fascinating introduction to a dominant (and ever-pertinent) movement\/aesthetic and a partial survey of theatre history over the last two centuries.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that wanted to learn more about realism, drama, or even about the processes of reading dramatic works through a more performance-centered view. I thought that the interdisciplinary feel of the classroom was wonderful. The fact that so many of my classmates came from such different fields really gave me new tools with which to approach texts."
