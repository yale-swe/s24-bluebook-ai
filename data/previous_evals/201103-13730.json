   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "The Manual Feed Plotters should both be working at least 90 % of the time. These are constantly broken and create insane backups when we are all using them in the same night.",
    "The resources were adequate and available. No improvement necessary.",
    "Good",
    "Manual Feed Printers seemed to be frequently offline or under repair. What the people in the DM office do in their free time is beyond me, but it seems like there is no excuse for those not to be working, especially with the high volume of demand for them- from this class and others.",
    "The resources were adequate, but there was never any instruction on how to use any of these resources integrated within the class.",
    "The resources were more thanenough.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, they were.",
    "Yes.",
    "We need more manual-feed printers. There is always a line several deep for this class as well as studio.",
    "I felt that our resources were very adequate, no complaints.",
    "The resources of the school used for this class \u0097 manual feed plotters, laser cutters, large desk spaces, photo-room \u0097\u00a0were always convenient for this course. I don\u0092t think there was ever a moment in which I couldn\u0092t do something because the school didn\u0092t offer it.",
    "adequate",
    "All computers were more the adequate.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, all of the resources needed were available.",
    "They were very adequate.",
    "Great.",
    "Resources were sufficient.",
    "Yes. all were available",
    "They were adequate, thanks.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, the available resources were adequate for fulfilling course work.",
    "Building an archive of former works can be helpful for upcoming classes.",
    "The resources are fabulous, but there seemed little occasion to call on them. I wish there had been a few exercises that directly involved examining precedents (requiring a trip down to the library etc...) -- some exploration of various drawing techniques that could, in turn, expand our own repertoire. Drawing technique itself, what I had hoped would be the core of the course, was actually a rare subject of discussion. I think the course might be better served by smaller, in-class sketching assignments -- all done by hand. As a more unified body of work (everybody working intensely, during class, and using similar media), the critiques could be more focused on drawing technique, while the projects could remain conceptually rich.",
    "Yes",
    "Manual feed printers were typically offline the day of this class. Very bizarre and unhelpful. Software and discussion thereof might be better integrated into the course.",
    "Everything was fine, except the manual feed print seemed to be down every time it was need for class. This is unfortunate because it is one of the only affordable options for print available to students."
