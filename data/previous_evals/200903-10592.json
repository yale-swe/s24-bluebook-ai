    "I will recommend.Useful information, esp the FT part. Complementary to Macro class",
    "It is a tough class if you do not have a very strong math background. Mathematica is difficult if you have no prior programming experience. The FT section is really great if you are interested in x-ray crystallography. The shopping period won't help you with this course because it doesn't get really hard until after the probability section.",
    "This course cover a wide range of math topics which is useful in future biophysics study and teach you how to use practical mathematica or matlab to solve real problems. I recommend this course. Because it will be very useful for my graduate study, although it does teach a lot in details.",
    "Gives an overview of upper level mathematics and their potential applications in biology. I would recommend this class to students primarily in biophysics. I would not recommend this to foreign students (Chinese) as their education often surpassed the scope of the course.",
    "We covered a lot of material, and moved very quickly. Particularly difficult for me were the sections on differential equations and fourier transforms. I don't feel like I took much away from these sections.However, the other sections - probability andlinear algebra - were very useful for me. I think I come away with a good understanding of these topics and will be able to use them in my research.Also our work with Mathematica was very useful. I am now comfortable using mathematica on my own, and I will probably do so in the future.",
    "Mathematical Methods in Biophysics is a great class for the new generation of biologists who want to use quantitative methods in biology. We learn bits of prob&stats, linear algebra, differential equations, and Fourier transforms, plus some computational work with the program Mathematica. Most importantly, it refreshed what I previously knew about math - now I can confidently use the math I had learned in college. Additionally, the class introduced me to new topics: though I still cannot confidently solve a problem with Fourier transforms or linear algebra, now I am not afraid to learn it better on my own should it appear in my research. I now know the context and basic applications of these methods. I believe that quantitative, mathematical methods like these will provide a huge advantage for our future research careers in molecular biology. `"

    "Math basisInspiration",
    "I think this course is fantastic. It broadened my knowledge and made me gain a new insight of what is mathematics and how it play a role in your analysis. I also learnt useful methods such as PCA.",
    "Very useful for understanding FT in regards to x-ray crystallography.",
    "It review the math I have learned. This course give me a chance to learn how to use software to solve practical math problems in the future. For my dissertation which might involve a lot of math, I think this course will be a good start.",
    "This course contributed to our understanding, and partly application of, quantitative mathematical methods in molecular biology. I think this quantitative approach will provide invaluable leverage for our future careers as biological research becomes more mathematical. That said, I do not know to what extent this will be relevant to any of my rotation projects. I hope the instructors continue to emphasize how each method could be relevant to MB&B research or other fields in biology or physical biology."
