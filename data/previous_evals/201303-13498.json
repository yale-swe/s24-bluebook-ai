    "An excellent course, a must-take for english and non-english majors. It covers major American novels and connects each to overlying themes in American literature. My only regret is that not enough time was spent on each of the short stories\/novels we covered.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS, and take it with Professor Goldsby!!! This class was so wonderful: amazing books, lively discussion, frequent but not overwhelming writing, and great comments on all our written work. We had two major papers (5-8 pages) and several classes v2 posts (1-2 pages), which were a great way to digest a work without having to write a full-blown essay. Professor Goldsby would write long and very helpful comments on all of these, and was willing to read drafts. Also, go to her office hours! I found this to be really helpful in figuring out my papers.Finally, this class has a fantastic book list: everyone should read these books because they are wonderful!! Moby-Dick sounds intimidating at first but I ended up loving it. Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely take this class!!!",
    "yes!! take it. really cool course on american literature.",
    "English 127 is an American Literature course with analytical essays. I would recommend it to any student who genuinely wants to read these works and who has had some experience with literary analysis.",
    "ENGL 127 is a great intro english course with really interesting texts. Look at the syllabus to see if you are interested in reading the texts - if you don't like the books, you won't like the class.Professor goldsby is WONDERFUL. She is extraordinarily nice and helpful and really really smart. She leads discussions masterfully. It's also not too much writing for a WR credit (about two 5-8 page papers, plus around 4 smaller 2-4 page pieces).",
    "This is a wonderful course, texts differ according to instructor so make sure you read the syllabi before signing up for a particular course! Goldsby's choices were stellar, and we were exposed to some really interesting 20th century readings. The class was definitely 20th-century heavy. I didn't really understand the chronological order--although Goldsby was extremely organised for each class session, the overall organisation \/ order of books eludes me.That said, TAKE IT WITH GOLDSBY! She really cares about each of her students, she assigns very interesting assignments (Whitman Archive, Dickinson Lexicon, etc.). At first, with all the assignments and v2 posts, it might seem like too much work--but keep in mind that we only have 3 papers and no final, so all the extra (and very interesting) assignments are in the place of a final exam.",
    "I would recommend it if you like English and want to read some of the classics like Moby-Dick, Whitman, Dickinson. Reading Moby-Dick alone was worth the class in my opinion.",
    "Take the class. As a pre-medical student, it was really great to have a chance to get a chance to explore American literature.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Professor Goldsby is an excellent teacher, and class discussions were always thoughtful and exciting. I really enjoyed the readings, especially Moby Dick. The workload was very manageable, and Professor Goldsby was willing to offer constructive feedback on drafts of essays. We also got to take a number of fun \"field trips,\" like a visit to the Beinecke. Take this class!"
