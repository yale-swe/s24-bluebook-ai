    "A good overview of the uses and challenges of decentralized systems. The lectures were engaging and thought-provoking. The problem sets weren't too difficult and were kind of fun (building a decentralized chat\/file sharing system), and you get to choose the direction for your final project.",
    "A great class. You build a decentralized peer-to-peer network through the labs in the class, and there's a great mix of theory and implementation. Ford is obviously an amazing professor, and lectures were a bit unstructured but very interesting. The class is kind of like a seminar in that people discuss more than they normally would in a CS class, and I really enjoyed that.Would definitely recommend to anyone!",
    "This class covers some great material that is both interesting and that I think every CS major should know. However, this year (and the previous time it was taught) Prof. Ford was quite disorganized, both in some of his lectures and in long delays in writing assignments, and several classes were canceled. Although the class enjoyed having only half the planned assignments, it was in retrospect a bit of a let-down.Also, every assignment was a continuation of the same peer-to-peer program, written in C++, which got to be a drag, as well as seriously problematic if earlier parts weren't written well, so be aware of that, and if you don't know C++, learn it beforehand (assuming you will still use that language). If they continue to use Qt, it would be worth looking at that first, too. All in all, this was a relatively pleasant course (less work than other programming-intensive courses, and from what I hear, no comparison to OS), if a bit weak on content (canceling classes made us run out of time). Only during the final project, which was due during finals period, was this very stressful.",
    "Recommended. Very interesting topic with major developments in recent years. Good professor. All problem sets are programming.",
    "This course is a really great course for learning about systems that are either distributed or that have no central administrator; aka the systems that are becoming more relavent and the more interesting systems in use today. The course was less work than advertised; as Professor Ford was often out of town on various conferences; we only had 3 problem sets instead of 6. That's ok; while they were good work coding in C++ (in the QT framework) and were interesting because you got to make various design choices that real systems designers using these protocols make, they had only a little to do with lectures. The lectures themselves were awesome and gave a good idea of a whole broad range of this interesting lecture. Bottom line: if you want to learn about the modern systems in regular use today, take this course.",
    "CS426 is an interesting course. Each assignment builds on the previous, starting with a peer-to-peer chat network, then adding features like decentralized file sharing. The material can sometimes feel overwhelming because of how many names and acronyms there are to describe each variant of each type of system, but the midterm was incredibly reasonable and we were allowed to do our own thing for the final project. It was a fun course overall.",
    "The topics covered in the class are extremely interesting. Professor Ford is engaging and explains the material clearly. The material was not approached particularly critically, though."
