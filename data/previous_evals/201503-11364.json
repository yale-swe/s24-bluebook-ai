   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it",
    "Yes, depending on their interests and capabilities.",
    "hard to adjust to the way of thinking but fascinating.",
    "I believe that it is a great class for anyone even mildly interested in western philosophy. The readings are long, and the papers take a lot of time, but Prof. Winkler is there to guide you through it all.",
    "This class is a rigorous but still certainly manageable survey over many centuries of challenging but enduring philosophical thought. I would absolutely recommend this course, granted that the student in question is not a passive participant in class and is willing to perform rigorous critical thinking and philosophical analysis. The student must also be willing to struggle with complicated and, oftentimes, nearly indecipherable texts -- but that aspect of the course is unavoidable and, in many ways, the joy of learning philosophy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to students who are willing to put in the effort. Doing all of the assigned reading is really beneficial in order to get the most out of the class and discussions. It opened my eyes to very interesting subject matter that now affects how I see the world.",
    "The DS Philosophy first semester course is centered around the works of Aristotle and Plato. Other philosophers like the Epicureans and Stoics are looked at later in the term, but in less depth. In covering these ancient philsophers, a lecture is attended once a week and is supplemented by two smaller discussion sections. Hearing from a large number of the Philosophy faculty in lectures was not only entertaining, but also helpful in guiding DS students through the sometimes confusing texts.",
    "Yes.",
    "DS Philosophy (fall semester) introduces students to the arguments of some of the greatest pre-Renaissance thinkers of the Western tradition. If you hope to trace the, take the course! If you don't mind imagining flying men, shadows in caves, and indecisive donkeys both inside and outside of class, take the course! If you wish to stimulate your brain and interact with some of the brightest professors and members of the freshmen class, take the course!",
    "Very good course; would recommend"
