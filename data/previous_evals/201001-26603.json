    "This was a fantastic seminar but in fact, I wish I had taken as a 1st year or a 2ndyear because it could have been turned into a much more fun mini version of the systems class. The second assignment where we had to swap the material of an iconic house allowed for a humorous response but also revealed how much more work we needed to do to really understood the building section and construction details of these houses.The final review was also fantastic because of the critics' honesty. There was never any aggressivity in this course and there was an honesty in the discussions that was incredibly refreshing. It only made me realize how tragic it was not to have been exposed to such an amazing critic as Deborah earlier during my time at YSOA.",
    "This class was not a requirement, but I wish some version of it had made it\u0092s way into the curriculum of my first semester in this program."

   "comments": [
    "Great range of topics and excellent reader! I will certainly return to the reader as a resource for future research.",
    "The material was interesting and relevant, with material sequence from week to week following a logical evolution throughout the semester. The two projects were also interesting, though the ultimate final expectations for them were not always made clear.",
    "the body of work and sequence were good. the last assignment should have been a physical assignment where materials were more of a critical expression",
    "I appreciated the class very much. It seems like the joint fabrication might be better at the end of the class and have the drawing be more towards the beginning. I wish the class had focused a bit more on innovative detailing rather than \"how we felt\" about a material. The discussions got a bit \"touchy feely\" for my liking. I feel that the readings were well selected, the right length and interesting to read.",
    "The course is well and clearly organized by material type and has two assignments that encourage the exploration of materials.",
    "The readings were great and intelligently selected and the assignements were interesting while still being reasonable in terms of load. There are simply too many electives at this school with delusional professors who think students will dedicate all their time outside of studio to their course. This in itself would not be so much of a problem if they were actually doing their jobs as teachers and really working to make seminar discussions engaging. Very few professors ever do that but Deborah and Jennifer were great because they always maintained the flow of the discussion.I also think what was interesting in the final review was the discussion for example of the projects dedicated to the Villa Savoye. We had an incredibly interesting discussion that dealt with both the theoretical and pragmatic building issues of this project and Corb's oeuvre at large. The best part though was that we were able to have this discussion looking at two sets of drawings that were incredibly humours and provocative without being the usual black, white and red diagrams. Some people at this school need to get over the 70s and Peter Eisenman's tyranny only persists because some people are simply too insecure to think for themselves and develop their own visual language. The assignements in this class made me want to draw more whereas most other drawing electives at this class in fact made me want to draw less!",
    "The material and, if weather had permitted, timing for the assignments were coordinated so well that its scheduling became one of the many compelling reasons to take this class. It means a lot to a struggling student to hear an instructor say at the introductory meeting that the course is deliberately structured to succeed in this environment, amidst other demands, and an overwhelming amount of pressure to focus only on studio. The amount of reading was manageable and the assignments straightforward enough for everyone in the class to reframe the problem for themselves. The manner in which each week\u0092s theme was addressed and explored was adequate, and in every class, inspiring. Most remarkably, unlike other seminars where student presentations are mandatory, the presentations were largely informative and complemented the instructors\u0092 own presentations.",
    "Material was very informative and very interesting class.Assigments provoked interesting discourse and it was fun creating our projects. I think that the course placed a heavy emphasis on thought and discussion and was less about production which was very refreshing. Deborah was excellent in her knowledge and presentation of the material.",
    "Good class, good subject matter, tough to fill up 2 hours a week though, the student presentations were good and a lot of work for each of us, but the discussions and how we each feel about these materials was a little overwrought. i think we should have made somthing for the final, rather than a drawing- to actually work with the materials. this course should have been incorporated with heavier fabrication element. something like kimo griggs in the shop and Deborah Berke in the class room. is that too crazy!? more making to ballanace the discussions"

   "comments": [
    "My expectations were to become more familiar with material detailing and types. I believe I became more aware of the types of materials that are available, rather than the detailing part. But I think that was useful nonetheless.",
    "I expected to learn a lot about the many different materials at the architect's disposal and to study multiple ways in which they are used. The course was a good survey in the application and use of each of the material groups we studied.",
    "I think this course could have instigated more discussion on materials in contemporary and not just traditional uses.",
    "I expected to learn how to think in terms of materials and the course was a good starting point.",
    "I had hoped for the time and space to really consider the themes presented in the course thoughtfully and find ways to articulate the dormant but extant positions I seemed to have about materials in architectural design and experience. I would have liked to test some of these realizations in a design project."

   "comments": [
    "The course is valuable in that it serves as a good introduction for the material pallette and tools at the architect's disposal. The speculative projects also challenge the students to explore new uses with materials.",
    "this course was of moderate value to me.",
    "The course put me in contact with a large number of interesting architects and buildings that I did not know and I am glad to have discovered. The organization of architects and buildings by material type was refreshing, as I found it unusual and interesting.",
    "I would never have thought before starting my architectural education in a graduate program that I would pine for some focused study on materials. Had I been more cognizant about materials in the initial phases of any of my projects here, I am certain they would have been stronger.",
    "This is a great class for students in their terminal semester. It combines \"pragmatic intuition\" with theory, research and readings to conceptualize decisions that we will all soon be making in our professional lives.Both Deborah and Jennifer were extremely professional, knowledgeable, inspiring. Thank you for a great final semester!",
    "This course was very valuable for our understanding application of materials and it was very helpful to see the wide variety of uses from other architects. The variety of projects presented was amazing and it was invaluable and empowering for students to see this before entering the profession."

   "comments": [
    "Great, provocative and enthusiastic teachers!",
    "The instructor is knowledgeable and her firsthand experience with many of these materials allows her to confidently lead the course and offer criticism on the assignments. The assignment expectations and direction, however, were sometimes less clear.",
    "the instructors and tas were very well prepared and receptive to student ideas. they were incredible encouraging and helpful in developing our own opinions and ideas.",
    "Both Deborah and Jennifer were effective, responsible and supportive professors.",
    "Deborah is an incredible inspirational figure. It's sad to think she is that rare brand of architect at this school who totally believes in the art of building but who can balance talking about it in both poetic and pragmatic terms. In addition, her social \"consciousness\" or attitude is very refreshing considering the cynical, greedy attitude many other critics at this school seem to have.",
    "Professor Berke encouraged discussion and individual exploration. Jennifer Newsom was the most organized and proactive teaching assistant I have ever had. I especially appreciated how they provided physical material samples to supplement the class presentations.",
    "Deborah was excellent in her knowledge and presentation of the material. Jennifer was also great and very enthusiatic about the material presented. We need more teachers who are as caring and enthusiastic about their material."

   "question_text": "Suggestions you may have for course improvements:",
   "comments": [
    "While the material covered is relevant to the history of architecture, perhaps this class should begin to explore contemporary materials and projects that push the envelope in terms of material choice and application. The projects could also be a place for greater experimentation, but often fell back to conventional uses that we had studied or seen throughout the course. Readings were at times a good supplement, but at other times were not so relevant to the discussion in the seminar.",
    "design a better closing assignment and encourage students to choose their own precedents.",
    "In my opinion, the participation of experts in materials as guests, or even the projection of short videos during the class, (including people from disciplines outside architecture), can enrich the course by providing a different perspective. In this way, the discussion that follows each presentation would become more challenging and deeper.",
    "I think the course could have benefitted from a field trip or site visit."
