   "comments": [
    "The resources are great!",
    "All of the resources expected\/required were available.",
    "The available resources were more than adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work.",
    "The resources were adequate.",
    "yes, all facilities were available. They are wonderful resources to have and one of the great things Yale has to offer. (especially the library system which is unparallelled- i can spend days in there).",
    "Yes, they're adequate.",
    "Most resources were available. However, I found the general organisation of the library to be extremely poor, it was very difficult for me to find books due to a convoluted shelving system. I found that on average, I found 30% of the books that were listed as available on the shelf after a search on Orbis. This made it very frustrating and eventually I gave up looking. This I think had detrimental effects to my studio work as I could not fully take advantage of resources, and my self explorations were thus limited.",
    "The facilities at Yale are great. It would be most helpful if students could check out library books for at least 3 days at a time.",
    "yes",
    "The biggest problem comes from library. Because I can borrow books only for one day, there is few time for me to read it. The other problem is studio space. If I make big models, the studio space is not enough for me. I think it will be better if each studio have a common space for model making or for us to put big site model.",
    "Resources were very good except for the library. Its lending policies do not allow for thorough research of materials. I can often find the same book that Haas will either not lend at all, or lend for only one day, available to check out from another school through Borrow Direct for a 2 month loan. It seems ridiculous that we can get books from another school for months that Haas will not let us have for more than a day. The $5\/day late fee is also much too high and exploitative of architecture students who need to reference the text, drawings, or images contained within for longer than 24 hours without having to constantly renew the book.",
    "The undergraduate students are loud. The March I students who use the form-feed printers are loud too. I suggest moving the undergrads and the printers to different locations.",
    "The resources available to us at Yale are exceptionally good.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, software and facilities were adequate. Desk space is great, but individual pin-up space would also be helpful in organizing our thoughts and displaying for classmate discussion."
