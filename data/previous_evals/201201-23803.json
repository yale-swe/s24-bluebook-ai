   "comments": [
    "Overall, I thought the course was great. Informative and instructive. I liked hearing guest lecturers speak about their areas of expertise. The personal monitoring experiment was eye-opening and well worth the hassle. The course was grounded in the actual practice of assessing exposure, which I very much appreciate.",
    "Strengths: we get to really focus on exposure assessment by doing critiques every week. And by doing a draft for each topic, we get the chance to see where we did not pay attention to and improve.",
    "This course was recently redesigned and seems to be better than the stories I've heard about how it used to be. I really enjoyed the hands-on approach that was taken when we did the field work by carrying air monitors around for a week. However, the turnover on getting the data back to analyze and write-up took entirely too long and made the whole thing seem disjointed. Moreover, this was the only practical thing we did. I would like to seem more practical applications for this course. While it is great to say that I took a course in exposure assessment, it would be better to say that I have experience performing an exposure assessment, or some elements of it. The course is good in that it goes through the different areas of air, water, physical factors, and occupation. The course assignments are very end-of-term heavy. The information for the final paper was not given out until early April and I would have liked to see it earlier so that I wasn't trying to shove it in at the end of the semester when there is already a ton going on. Moreover, we had to write critiques every week which was helpful in learning to understand scientific papers and their methods better, but the work became very monotonous.",
    "Weakness:1.Use of same old slides without updating year after year. Need to update the content of the subject2. Language used is too technical. Simplify the teaching communication in simple non medical terms as all students are not researchers and do not have medical background.3. There is no additional resourcesSTRENGTHcan be applied in research all what is learnt",
    "I found the concepts that I learned in this course very useful, I think that they are directly applicable to my field. However the only weakness in this course is that it lacks a lab component. If this course provided us instruments to measure stressors directly it would be much better.",
    "Strengths of the course:-Diversity of guest lecturers-Diversity of issues related to exposure assessment-Good solicitation of feedback from instructor and TARoom for improvement Improvement:-More opportunity for student interaction would have been nice since this was a strength of the course."

    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0The instructor taught very few lectures. He taught only the first few lectures of the semester and was very slow going through the material. He almost never got through everything he had planned to go through. Overall, he was a good and knowledgeable instructor, but it didn't seem like he was really that interested in teaching the course.",
