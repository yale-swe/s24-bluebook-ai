    "The assigned reading were interesting and very balanced. Professor Coen is an excellent seminar leader and ensured that our discussion remained on point. The course could benefit from a few bridge texts\/background reading given the varying backgrounds of the group.",
    "I was exposed to several new authors and learned more about the historiography of science and imperialism. I particularly enjoyed when we were able to connect and contrast readings from different weeks. However, I did not feel the course was as coherent as I would have liked. A reading course such as this is likely to be somewhat idiosyncratic, but I would still have preferred more of an arc to the course as a whole."
