    "Lots of interesting material, horrendous lectures and feedback. Not one hw assignment was returned, and I never found out my grade for the midterm. Everything I learned (taught myself) was really interesting though. The programming assignments themselves are fantastic!",
    "The lectures are terrific, Ford is amazing. Psets take a long time, lots of time spent debugging, especially lab3 (virtual memory). The material is conceptually interesting, but I feel that a large amount of pset time just goes to finding stupid bugs like reordering two lines of code or changing a + sign to a - sign (we're talking hours here). Very frustrating, but that's #oslife. You learn a lot though. Most of the kids who take OS know it will be a lot of work but a very rewarding class. I know a lot more about what's going on internally. Definitely take cs421 (compilers) as well, with that and OS you really feel like who know the internals of everything.",
    "If you like systems, this is an excellent class to take. Bryan Ford is extremely knowledgeable about operating systems; I learned a lot in his engaging lectures.The majority of the coursework in done over 6 large assignments, where you fill in parts of a unique teaching OS. It can be frustrating at times but the gratification at the end of the tunnel is enormous.",
    "If you are going to take OS, nothing can stop you. Some people liked it. The problem sets are unbelievably difficult and the problem specifications are unbelievably long. They also have little or nothing to do with the lectures. The lectures are disorganized. The class is an imitation of MIT's 6.828, if you care to look that up. You work in partners, which saved me, but didn't help my partner. The midterm exam was never even graded. Bryan Ford is a nice guy but this kind of work was just not for me. You would have to be incredibly interested to remain happily committed to completing the work for this course.",
    "First, about the time: I don't think this takes 30 hours every week, but it does some weeks, so it's not as bad as some people say. Otherwise, OS is definitely a useful class as it pretty much covers all the problems that everyone deals with in systems programming. It gets tedious if you're not really into OS's, but I did come out feeling like I should have taken this course. It gets to the bottom of the abstraction, so even if you don't write OS code again, you'll know about how schedulers and tuning might help when you even just use OS's.",
    "Take it! 422 is definitely programming-intensive, but if you manage your courseload well, you'll do fine."
