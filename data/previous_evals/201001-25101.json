   "comments": [
    "I would recommend PHYS430 to a physics major looking to gain mastery of classical E&M. The homework is manageable (not like 410 :D) and the tests are basicallystraightforward. Prof. Werner is very friendly and accessible. Hopefully next year, there will be a chance to cover relativity and other \"cool\" topics in greater detail.",
    "Don't take this course if you don't have to do so. It isn't a bad course, but it doesn't provide the student with any new information about Electrodynamics which they haven't already learned in other Physics courses. Professor Werner is a nice guy, but both the TA and Professor are pretty inaccessible outside of class. The problem sets are challenging, but not unfairly so. Overall, this course should really only be taken by intensive physics majors.",
    "This course is OK. I not the best at vector calculus, which is essential for most of the course. Take it for the major (intensive physics or regular), probably not otherwise.",
    "If you're a physics major, you have to take it. It's a standard 400-level course - lots of material to get through in one semester, though, and some of it is very dry. I didn't get much out of the course that I couldn't have learned from readings Griffiths E&M. Problem sets were reasonable and the exams weren't too bad - just an hour-long midterm and final.I wouldn't recommend taking the class if you're not a physics major - there are tons of much more interesting physics classes to take.",
    "Physics 430 is a good class.The information is important, and you have to take the class for the intensive physics major. There is a decent amount of new information, but a lot of it will be review from previous classes. Like most physics classes, the problem sets are difficult but rewarding. Overall, it was a good class.",
    "Take it as a physics major; it's interesting. If you're not a physics major, you probably won't like this course.",
    "Good course, but unfortunately not as mathematically rigorous and one would expect. Too much of the course is spent reviewing material from intro physics. Not many hours per problem set."
