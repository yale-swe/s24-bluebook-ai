    "I would describe it as above: a very straightforward introduction to bioethics from a scientist's perspective applicable to conducting research at Yale. I would only recommend it to another student if they were a first-year student in the biological sciences, though in that case they are likely required to take the course anyway!"

    "I found it helpful to have a sanctioned forum with experienced faculty to discuss and ask about sticky issues such as sources of pressure and biases that can negatively impact our science, and where to go\/what to do if we find ourselves in a moral\/ethical dilemma.",
    "In some cases, it provided insight into some aspects of my discipline with which I was less familiar (such as the review process for journal articles). These clarifications will be helpful when doing such things as submitting my own papers and dealing with ethical issues in lab (should they arise)."
