   "comments": [
    "No background in calculus is necessary for this course, but the majority of students in the class have taken calculus in the past. This class is the equivalent of the AP Calculus BC course, so those who have taken AB Calculus should do well, assuming they put in the necessary effort and work.",
    "Take this course only if you can make sure you have a good section leader. The course is not too difficult and Miriam Logan definitely made it very easy to understand for me. The material is pretty much Calc BC. The midterms are fair and the workload very manageable.",
    "This course teaches you the second half of BC calculus and is a good recap if you felt you didn't really understand series and sequences. I would recommend this course.",
    "Take Math 115 if you really like math or if you need the course for a major or prereq. Otherwise I would say it is probably a difficult course and would be hard to do well in. If you do the work, you can do well, but if you're not willing to work, could easily be a disaster.",
    "If you get Miriam Logan, you will LOVE this class. She is simply AMAZING. She is SUCH good teacher, knows the material well, and can convey it very well to her students. She let us set her office hours, and held 2 sessions weekly. Before the midterms, she held at least 2 review sessions and more office hours, and before the final, she held office hours EVERY NIGHT for TWO WEEKS, and held 3 REVIEW SESSIONS! She was also happy to meet with her students at any time for extra help - she once met with me on a SUNDAY afternoon and basically taught me the whole class I had missed that Friday for a competition (not many teachers would do that!). She put in many extra hours, baked cookies and banana bread for us, and has a cute Irish lilt! She cares deeply about her students, and it shows.So if you have to take Math 115, TAKE IT WITH MIRIAM and you will never regret it! Obviously, you need to do the weekly problem sets and take the class seriously for it to be manageable, but Miriam makes herself very accessible so it is no problem. Our class was only 18 people or so, so it was a good size, and she got to know us all very well. I will miss her a lot next year, and can only hope that she'll teach Math 120!",
    "If you only took Calc AB or the equivalent in high school, you should probably round out your knowledge of single-variable calculus by taking this class. (If you're taking it, you probably need to take it to satisfy requirements anyway.) Just make sure you take it with the right person - this is one of those courses where who your instructor is makes a world of a difference.",
    "YEP",
    "I enjoyed this class--but I also find math fun (even though very tedious at times). However, I don't think I would have taken this class if I wasn't trying to fulfill a requirement. If you do your problem sets and keep up on the material, you'll be fine. The professor makes\/breaks the class.",
    "The course is essentially just more derivatives and integrals, but requires heavy creativity in order to think through the questions. I would recommend it, but make sure you get a good teacher like I did. It makes all the difference in the world.",
    "MATH 115 might be a little useless. You can apparently get through MATH 120 without it. The topics might be easy but it is tested and graded very harshly. If you have to take it, take it with Miriam Logan. She is extremely, EXTREMELY dedicated and the best teacher ever! Just as an example, she had office hours every day until the exam and basically had office hours from 10 am to 10pm the day before the exam!!! She was literally in the classroom all day helping us!"
