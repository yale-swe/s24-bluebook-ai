    "SO EASY! Since all three tests (75% of your grade) are take home, you literally don't have to do any reading until test time! Then just read the parts you need to read for the test. The two to three days you have to do the take home tests can be annoying since they will take a fair amount of time (probably upwards of 6 hours) to do right, but the total amount of work is almost nothing.Section is mandatory and is 25% of your grade. You have to read a scientific paper and then in section, explain a figure with a group of ~4 people. Section's not too bad...Apparently the average grade for this class is also inordinately high (A-?). So this is definitely the easiest class at Yale you'll ever have.",
    "- I would recommend that they skip this course for Cell Biology instead",
    "This course was a great introduction into molecular biology and was very interesting. Professor Dellaporta was a great lecturer, and Rodeheffer and Pollard were pretty good too. When the section that Altman taught came up, it was a bit frustrating because he spent a lot of time talking about things that we either already knew or things that were not important to the class. Going to lectures is very important, as is starting the take home exams early! I think that if you got a 5 on the AP Bio exam, and you are interested in molecular biology, this is a great class for you.",
    "Don't take it. The material is boring, the instruction, worse, and the midterms, though take-home, are RANKED before they are scored. The grading system is unfair, section is a nightmare that will leave you wishing you could claw your way out of the room. I have regretted every lecture, every Friday morning section-- don't make the same mistake!",
    "dont take it unless you need the credit for bio\/premedi took it credit\/d just \"for fun\" to learn about shit - mistake.",
    "Not too bad for a legitimate science credit. The topics are so huge that you end up learning just enough to know how much there is to know, which is eye-opening and intimidating. The three take-homes were manageable though stressful. I had never taken AP Bio, but I feel like I did fine in the course (though I guess I could find out otherwise later).",
    "A long string of wasted words divided by essay-based midterms that stress you out to no end.",
    "Yes! Its one of the only \"easy\" classes you might find in the bio department. And by easy I mean minimal work WHILE STILL Learning useful material! Don't worry too much about the grade and (if you chose to take this class this semester) study based on how it might help future classes. This covers some of genetics and a bit of cell bio so use this time and the professors now and learn the material just to learn. Then by the time the takehome test rolls around, you will be extremely prepared!",
    "MCDB 200 is a good course to take. Professor Dellaporta is a great lecturer and very fun to learn from. The RNA section is a little more difficult to learn and to stay engaged in. The sections, although intimidating at first, are really helpful.",
    "Not a terrible class. You'll learn something (although probably not as much as you would if the exams were in-class rather than take-home), and lecture is okay, except for Altman, who clearly hated us all. Dellaporta,Rodeheffer, and Pollard were all really good though. Probably worth taking if you're willing to suffer through the RNA unit.",
    "Overall, a good course and a necessary one. Not the most interesting, but one that you can definitely do well in. The take home tests were tedious (especially Altman's) and took several days to complete. I felt like I didn't really learn the material. I don't think I know molecular biology much better at all than I did coming into the course. I think this is partly because of the take home tests, which one can do very well on without ever reading the textbook beforehand. Instead of having four professors, I wish the course be taught by just one or two for better continuity. Rodeheffer was by far the best!! He was very engaging, got the class involved in his lectures, and did a great job of actually teaching. Pollard and Dellaporta were also good, but Altman was just awful.",
    "Good intro before Cell bio. Proteins section was the most interesting. DNA went over my head and RNA was boring and difficult to understand. I would recommend this course for potential MCDB majors, not for anyone else though. No real use to other majors.",
    "Good class. It's fair. You can get as much out of it as you want, depending on whether or not you choose to go to class and do the readings. Dellaporta was awesome! Though Altman covers the most difficult material, I only could manage going to one of his lectures. Teaching myself the material through the readings was much more useful. The take-home midterms are nothing to whine about. As I said, it's a very fair class. However, DO NOT TAKE THE LAB!",
    "Molecular Biology is a course well-suited for students who have placed out of the introductory biology courses and who want a good background for later, higher-level biology courses such as Genetics or Cell Biology. The class is broken into three parts taught by different professors and roughly based around the topics of DNA, RNA, and Protein. Although Professors Dellaports (1st portion) and Pollard and Rodeheffer (3rd portion) were engaging and informative, the instructor of the middle portion, Professor Altman, was so terrible a teacher that I am hesitant to recommend the course if he is still going to be teaching in it. The meets for lectures twice a week with a discussion section on a third day for going over weekly assigned journal article readings. Exams are take-home, and generally fair.",
    "I would recommend this class. All the tests are take-home. All the professors (except Altman) were interesting and engaging.",
    "It was a good overall course, though i felt like a learned nothing, it was fairly manageable b\/c it had 3 take homes and no final.",
    "Take it if you can opt out of 120. Its a good basis for genetics\/cell bio too. No psets. Take home tests are manageable, just very long.",
    "This class was really good for me. I'm fairly good at science but have absolutely no desire to major in it. Some people who were interested in doing so said that the class didn't really (in their opinion) prepare them for higher courses since all the tests were take home, so no \"actual\" learning was required. So, in light of that, I would recommend it to people who like science but aren't particularly interested in really pursuing it.",
    "Amazing course--if you're even half-interested in biology, take it!",
    "Good class but beware because the grading scheme for the tests is frustrating because you can have the right answer but not get a good grade. Also, make sure you can make all the sections because no excuses will work.",
    "Take it. Three take home tests.There is literally no reason to go to class, especially altmans. I do recommend pollards becausethey really were interesting and well put together. You'll learn a lot about the field of biology.Trust me, I'm expecting an A, DONT DO ANY WORK OUTSIDE THE TAKE HOME TESTS. Don't go to lecture expecting little tidbits to help on the take home, and don't read the textbook. Time wasted.",
    "Two lectures a week, plus friday section. Three take-home tests and no final, so you can concentrate on learning concepts without killing yourself. Curve is A-\/B+ split along the class average. Textbook reading is far from essential except when doing the take-homes. I'd recommend it because it was a pretty enjoyable class (everyone but Altman was at least decently engaging) and counts as an elective for MCDB majors. A nice refresher between AP Bio and genetics\/cell bio.",
    "I would recommend it if you need the bio credit. It's a basic intro class, and the format of the take home tests is nice.",
    "Great class. Take it if you want to learn about the cell.",
    "Molecular bio is a good class if you are hesitant to dive into cell bio, and gives you a strong foundation for that class. I would recommend this class to others, it is not too much work and you learn a lot.",
    "As someone who hasn't taken a biology class since 9th grade, I actually found this to be a pretty valuable class. This is important stuff to know, and it's very interesting. Lectures were good at times but often lacking- as a result, most of my learning was done from the book while doing the take-home exams. The exams weren't difficult (mostly regurgitation from the book), but be prepared to have them devour your life for 2-3 days if you want to do well.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who received a 5 on the AP bio exam, but wants a refresher before diving into genetics or cell bio. This was a very interesting course that really exposed me to the worlds of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Lecture was very interesting, but I really enjoyed the weekly paper discussions as I usually did not completely understand the paper going in, but left feeling I had a good grasp on what it was all about. The different lecturing styles was a little difficult at times, and the take home tests were very time consuming, but I very much preferred them to in-class exams. I feel that I have gained a good base from which to build the rest of my biology career. Improvements-wise, the RNA section was very interesting, but the test did not accurately reflect the material covered in class and the book \"reading assignments\" were vague and so I had to resort to frantically reading all over the book finding the necessary information for the tests.",
    "I don't really know because this is the only Biology class I've taken. I didn't thoroughly enjoy the class, but I didn't hate it either....",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're at all interested in molecular biology. If you're considering whether to use AP credit to advance, go for it. This class is not too difficult (being all take home tests) but you still need to truly understand the material. Dellaporta, Rodeheffer, and Pollard are all great lecturers, though I skipped many of Altman's lectures (and somewhat regret not skipping more of them..)",
    "Its low on workload so thats a plus, but the grades are kind of a luck draw. Grading is so subjective and really pend more on your writing skills - and not like englishy skills, more like how can you jam as many facts into this without losing coherency.",
    "Overall, MCDB 200 is a good course to take if you want to have a better foundation in Molecular Biology first before going on to Genetics and Cell Biology. The discussion sections are one of the strengths of this class, as we learn how to read scientific articles, a skill that will be useful for those planning on continuing in the sciences.",
    "Good if you're looking for an easy class or an intro before cell and genetics.",
    "Yes. Great intro-level biology course.",
    "Take it. It is pretty easy, and you can learn a lot.",
    "MCDB 200 is a low-stress course except for around midterms. We had 3 take-home midterms this semester. There's virtually no transparency in the grading process, so grades can seem quite arbitrary. Lectures are boring except for Dr. Dellaporta's section of the course, but you'll end up learning a lot. The textbook is really well written.",
    "This class is not phenomenal. It was convenient to have a low stress class, especially a low stress science class for a change. However, the class has a lot of potential if only you put a lot into it. The first third, taught my Dellaporta was fantastic. I learned so much about DNA structure, and the test was a good judge of that. The portion by Altman was disastrous. Even if I attended lecture, I had no idea what was going on. I felt no cohesion, and explanations were just not good. The last portion on proteins with Rodeheffer and Pollard was better. Rodeheffer only taught 5 lectures, he was quite good for that short time. Pollard was also clear and a good lecturer. However, I could tell that he probably thought a little less of us, compared to his cell biology class, as he always brought up concepts, diagrams, etc. only to say \"Don't worry, you won't be accountable for all the details\/steps\/etc.\" I heard that the tests this year changed. Those few days we had for each take home test were hell. I worked nonstop, but I also liked to write so much for the one that did not have a word limit. The first exam for Dellaporta's DNA section was extremely fair and tested what he taught us, and it included a broader perspective that helped tie the topics together for me. The RNA section by Altman had questions out of nowhere. The protein section was all right. I got the same score on each test, even though I barely learned anything in class after Dellaporta. All I used was the textbook. Also, the discussion section is worth a ridiculous amount. For us, it was worth 25% of our grade and was calculated by averaging an attendance grade out of 5, with a participation grade out of 5. I don't know how I got a participation grade of 3, since the way it was set up, everybody spoke at every section (in the form of group presentations about figures in a paper). Choose Chriss Westphal as your TA, hands down. He is really chill. I would only recommend this class to freshmen who have a lot on their plate already. If you CAN put in the time and effort to cell bio, it might be worth it. I shopped cell bio and was petrified, which is why I switched. In the end, I am glad I did it, even though I will never know whether it was the best decision.",
    "This is a good background biology course for those students who have had a background in Biology but are not yet fully ready to do their best in a higher level course like Genetics or Cell Bio. Though slightly boring, the class is quite informative, and the grading curve is relatively easy.",
    "I would definitely recommend MCDB 200. If you received a 5 on the AP Bio exam but do not want to be overly ambitious and take Cell Bio, you should take this class. This is a great class for anyone interesting in majoring in MCDB, becoming a pre-med or just interested in molecular biology. The grading is very fair, the professors are leading researchers and the material is quite interesting.",
    "Take it if you want a chill course. Be wary though, because it's not as easy as you think.",
    "A solid class that is not too hard.",
    "I would recommend if if you're pre-med. If you're not, don't.",
    "Overall, this class was a great intro class for the MCDB major and provided essential background knowledge in molecular biology. Low workload and class twice a week made this class an excellent one to take for aspiring bio majors and premeds.",
    "not having a final is nice - doing all the reading is not necessary - just skim the summaries\/section headers so you know where everything is for the take home exams",
    "Overall, it was a pretty good class. The teachers vary in style- Altmann's section can be very rewarding if you make an effort to listen and discern what's important rather than just getting handouts like the other sections. All of the professors are very passionate about their material, but having the rotation can make what to expect a little inconsistent. The sections are one of the stronger portions of the class, and you can get a lot out of them if you participate.",
    "I would not recommend thiscourse to a fellow student especially if they are focused and ready to take on challenging biology courses their freshman year. The main reason i took this course is becaue i wanted to relax and get into biology studying mode at Yale. This was not the case.",
    "To be honest, I think that if you're going to take Genetics or Cell Bio anyway this class is not the most useful other than that it will make the first two weeks of Cell bio a little easier. That said, you cannot take MCDB201 lab (which I thought was a wonderful lab) without this class, and I think the lab makes it worthwhile.",
    "Relatively easy. Good preparation for Genetics (MCDB 202). Good freshman science class.",
    "If you have a general interest in the subject, it is a course worth taking. However, not as easy as some make it seem.",
    "MCDB 200 was a fairly easy class to get through- the only things you're graded on are 3 take-home tests and your attendance in section. However, this means that there is absolutely no incentive to do the reading or to pay attention in class, and when you're a (prospective) MCDB major, this is a big problem. The teaching ranges widely, from Professor Pollard, who was very good, to Professor Altman, who was abysmal. Unfortunately, Professor Pollard taught after Professor Altman, and at that point I was so completely turned off to the class that I missed out on a lot of what Professor Pollard had to offer. The discussion section is basically discussing scientific papers, which, while (sometimes) interesting, doesn't contribute to general understanding of the material."
