    "I learned so much about writing humor and many different techniques and approaches. Too many I can't list them all here.",
    "I learned not only how to frame a humorous piece at the macro level, but how to pack it with effective, funny jokes at the sentence level.",
    "I gained concrete skills for how to be a humor writer. This class simultaneously improved my writing skills but also allowed me to better understand and cultivate my sense of humor.",
    "--How to understand the logic and patterns of humor --The notion of how important the question of *audience* is, for understanding how humor is crafted and targeted --exposure to tons of incredibly funny material from the 19th century to the latest Louie CK (and the ability to critically interpret WHY the material is funny and HOW its creators chose to present it)",
    "I learned how to effectively craft, revise, and develop my humor (on paper). I was taught the intricacies of humor on four different levels - namely, sentence-level jokes, tone-level jokes, character-level jokes, and narrative jokes. Collectively, I learned how to combine these different aspects of humor to create a better-functioning humor essay.",
    "Developed more of a strategy for writing humor pieces"

    "Extremely well designed. Mostly strengths with few weaknesses.",
    "This course was awesome. My favorite class at Yale. One of the best parts about it was that the students shared a lot of their work with each other. Professor Wepler is really great at facilitating conversation.",
    "I'll cover the strengths in the review section -- and to be honest, don't you know them already?? To focus only on things not already covered in the mid-year assessment, but: 1) Given that the class pauses for 2-5 minutes to read through the humor pieces assigned for each week's reading, in order to search for humor techniques, I found I could do none of the reading in advance -- and I had the time to read the entire piece in the time the class was putting it under the microscope. Unclear whether this speaks simply to my own laziness as a student, or a sign that some in-class assignments could be done as purely in-class assignments rather than being ostensibly read in advance, but I thought I'd put that out there. 2) Unfortunately, students taking the class CR\/D are the main factor holding back the course from being even greater than it is....and that's a factor beyond Prof. Wepler's control. This meant that some peer reviews were far more thorough than others, and also that the number of students responding to the humor challenges on the course forum dropped precipitously throughout the year. Prof. Wepler already provides a master-level calendar of expectations in the syllabus, but many students don't follow the expectations that are clearly spelled out there. As it is, I'm not sure what more could be done, other than having a frank conversation about how to triage the work in the case of students who are CR\/D-ing the course, so that their choice to ease back on the workload will have a minimal impact on those students who are taking the course for a full grade.",
    "The amount of writing in this class is the sole reason for my improvement. We wrote an essay every week, and every week my grade improved. I had never written a humor essay prior to the class and struggled with the first few papers. The weekly experience I gained allowed me to breeze through the later essays. Simply put, this class is challenging but effectively so. I have no weaknesses to report for this course. It is, in many of our opinions, the most enjoyable writing course available at Yale.",
    "I liked all of it."

    "Yes! As someone who has taken various writing classes before, I have to say this class is probably the best. First of all, it's so much fun because it's humor and it makes you laugh. Second of all, the writing is very challenging and has you scratch your head a lot. So if you are a serious writer, you need to consider taking this class. The class is the best designed class I have taken at Yale, with many components, big and small, that teach humor writing through reading, workshop and practice. The workload can seem overwhelming at times, but if you are really into humor writing and plan to utilize some of the skills in your future writing endeavors, it's definitely worth the time. Professor Wepler is one of the kindest and most considerate professors I've ever had. He's very nice (even if your writing isn't good), very helpful, very knowledgeable about humor and humor writing, and very thoughtful in designing the class. I can't say enough good things about this class and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning to write humorously!!!",
    "When I got into Yale, I had no idea I would be getting credit to take a class where we talk so frequently about ballsacks, bodily fluids, and barfing. So in other words, yes! This class is a blast. Of course, you have to enjoy writing, and being funny, because you will be forced to do that a lot. There are frequent writing assignments\/tasks, and while they're short, they do require you to constantly be thinking of fresh, funny ideas. As long as you pass that minimum threshold, then absolutely take it. Ryan is a fantastic teacher who is very dedicated to the class. The amount of time he puts in translates to you getting a lot out of the class as one of his students. You'll learn so many different strategies and theories for how to write humorous pieces. You'll come out of the class not only having honed your comedy writing, but also your writing in other subjects, as well.",
    "Absolutely. Incredible course--challenging, fun, and exciting.",
    "fantastic course",
    "Absolutely, undeniably, yes yes YES! As a means of being exposed to funny material, you are bathed in the humorous glow of Tina Fey, Mark Twain, and other comedic luminaries. As an intellectual exercise, you dig deep into thinking about the logic of humor, how audience targeting works, and, of course, when the F-bomb is funny and when it is not. As a way to motivate yourself to write, you are constantly writing funny mini-essays and improving your work. As a way to receive editing and feedback, the workshop days and one-on-one talks with Prof. Wepler ensure that you are flooded almost with more responses than you can incorporate into your next draft. If you've done humor writing before or not, you HAVE to take this course. Just keep in mind that if you only do it CR\/D\/Fail and don't do any of the humor challenges or other mini-assignments, your lower level of investment in the course will also affect the enjoyment and satisfaction you derive from it.",
    "Anyone who is lucky enough to make the roster for this course should take it. It is the best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "This may be the only class where you spend twenty minutes thinking of the funniest way to say \"asshole,\" and is worth taking just for that. But more importantly, perhaps, this class helps you become a funnier you. Ryan is amazing at not prescribing a specific sense of humor, but having people think about what they find funny and making them deliver that funniness in a clearer, more precise, more consistent, and more diverse way, as well as teaching lessons that are valuable for writing in general. Great workshopping, great peer interactions, great course readings, overall just a ton of fun.",
    "If you want to think about the inner workings of humor pieces and develop your own strategies, this is for you."
