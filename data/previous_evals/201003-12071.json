    "Good introduction to microeconomics.",
    "Definitely take this course if you plan to major in Econs. Tolga is awesome. He's funny and very understanding. You may find his teaching fast at first, but if you read the textbook, it all makes sense. Be prepared to adjust yourself to Tolga's accent; you'll get used to it after several classes.The curve is not so harsh if you study hard. This semester it's 10% C, 50% B, 40% A.",
    "Take econ in the seminar style. I know so many people who took the lecture and either hated it or dropped it. Take the seminar if you possibly can. AND TAKE IT WITH TOLGA!!! Tolga is so awesome and so helpful. My roommate had the other teacher and was miserably confused all semester. Tolga's office hours are amazingly helpful, his classes are fun and interesting, and he's always available for help anytime. I would highly recommend Econ 110 and Tolga.",
    "I would recommend it. It's better than the lecture. The psets aren't bad and going to office hours definitely helps you with them. Especially now that the curve of the lecture and the seminar are equal, there's no reason to take the lecture.",
    "Its a course that teaches the basics of how the market works, but on a personal level. It studies why individuals make the choices they make, and provides explanations for different scenarios a buyer may be put into. As well, it describes the cost and inputs required on the production side of the business model.I would recommend this course to others interested in economics.",
    "This was a really great class, and I especially enjoyed the small, seminar format. Tolga is a great teacher who keeps the class engaging and interesting, and works hard to make sure students understand the material. I would recommend this class if you are interested in economics--I think it is better than the large lecture course.",
    "I think that it is a good class, but if you are not into econ, it and willing to keep up with the reading your life will suck. :)",
    "Yes, but only if you plan on majoring in Economics. If not, and if you would like to simply get your feet wet in economics, take the lecture.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, but with Tolga.",
    "It's a great course! It's a little more work than the lecture, but it's totally worth it if you are at all interested in the material",
    "If you've never taken an Econ class before, this might be a bit difficult. Just make sure to read the textbook to strengthen your understanding of the concepts. Also, make sure that you understand every problem on the problem sets.",
    "It can be a bit of a struggle because it is an introductory \"weeding\" class. However, I would definitely recommend the class to students with an interest in going into business, especially with Tolga as a teacher. I found not only the class but also the material very interesting and plan on taking macro next semester. Do NOT get behind on the reading and make sure to get headstarts on the problem sets because they can be a little tricky. Also, go to Tolga's office hours because he is always willing to help in any way possible.",
    "TAKE IT!!!!!! Econ seminar with Tolga (that's the way he likes being called) is a Yale-must! I talked to many students from the other section of the seminar and from the lecture and none of them had a better experience in Economics than I did. Since the classes are over I met many of my Econ classmates and ALL OF THEM, I must say again, ALL OF THEM said \"I miss Tolga\". Tolga presents the subjects so clearly with real life applications that are extremely interesting! And when he presents economic examples about our lives???? THE BEST MOMENTS! We were able to see that we were in front of someone that knew what he was doing. He has so much experience! The textbook is VERY GOOD! You learn so much having fun with the examples! We have only 6 problem sets throughout the semester which is very fair! Tolga is extremely helpful in the office hours! His review sections are also great! If you get into the seminar with him, TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this course if you have already taken another microeconomics course in high school. If you didn't, then just be aware that this may be a difficult and fast-paced course. For all students, be prepared to read the textbook a few times to truly grasp the information. This was the class I had to work the hardest in first semester but it was also my most rewarding class. It was definitely a challenge, but it was worth it.Take this class with Tolga. He is such a charismatic and brilliant teacher! He makes the class so fun and entertaining!",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for something rigorous. You learn a lot but it is pretty intense"
