   "comments": [
    "I would recommend 170, but would forewarn those considering it that though the readings start off very light (just a few pages of poetry), they begin to pick up toward the end of the course and become very long (an entire half of a short novel, for example), and be difficult to complete amongst all the other work. Speaking is not too necessary (just one oral presentation, plus the exam is oral) but a strong comprehension of not just written, but spoken French, is necessary, because otherwise you will miss important notifications about when things are due, screenings, etc.",
    "A large amount of reading, and if you don't do it you will have to for the final. However the workload is reasonable if you keep up. Interesting and enjoyable discussions on the books during class. A fun class, i recommend it.",
    "French 170 is a good overview of French literature from the Middle Ages to the present. It covers a variety of texts, such that most anyone could find a pleasing topic for assignments. Classes typically consisted of an overview of the text and its context by the professor followed by discussion largely directed by the professor but with student input. Assignments consisted of readings, three essays, and a project, and were generally quite manageable. Focus is placed on the ideas presented in the course texts rather than on grammar and vocabulary. I would recommend the course, either as an introduction to French literature and history, as a way of furthering one's language skills, or of fulfilling the language distribution requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. I took it thinking I would get a great survey of French literature but would sacrifice some more language practice that I might get in 160. Yet, I got plenty of language practice, and now I have a breathtakingly vivid image of France's cultural history. Professor Girard always introduces a new French expression in class each day, and she helps refine students' speech in class and students' writing by requiring a rough draft of each paper. Yet, she is not at all intimidating after the first class, and her historical knowledge is unbelievable. Each day she explains the cultural, political, and intellectual atmosphere at the time each text was written (and you never read excerpts, but either short or long works by each author). Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course if you didn't take French Literature AP in high school. It's a good survey course, though don't expect to become an expert on any one author or text. Also, Prof. Girard spends a lot of time discussing the historical context of the readings, so perhaps try another professor if you're looking for a line-by-line approach to reading\/",
    "I would definitely recommend Professor Girard; her knowledge seems boundless, her enthusiasm is apparent, and she clearly cares about improving both the French and literary knowledge of her students. The class is good for one looking to dabble in many different areas of French literature, but some readings are definitely more interesting than others, meaning that some weeks are more enjoyable and others less so. The essay component of the class is challenging but manageable; I felt as though I was pushed to improve my French writing without being totally crushed at the thought of writing three papers in the French over the course of the semester.",
    "Definitely recommend. It's a lot of reading, but if you keep up they are really interesting and certainly representative of their time periods.",
    "French 170 is an excellent introduction to the scope and varying foci of French Literature over the past 500 years. As for its personal affect on me, it has stoked my interested in specific time periods and movements in French Literature. It rekindled my passion for the applications of a language that I had become disinterested in and has condensed my ideas of what literary topics I might pursue in future courses. I recommend this course to a student who is interested in literature or history."
