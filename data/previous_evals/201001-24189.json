    "Yes, I recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking",
    "I would recommend this course if you REALLY love metal; if not, don't take it, because that is all you will be doing. It's nice for the skills, but the skills can be taught in a quicker fashion; unless you REALLY want to do a lot of metal for a lot of time, take your art practice elsewhere.",
    "if you are self-motivated, i would recommend this class.there is very little structure and teaching, it's mostly a class where you go in and work. it is very open to creativity.you mostly teach yourself and come up with ideas by yourself, but the professor is very supportive and helpful.",
    "ART 120 is an excellent course for a student who is self-motivated and has a clear idea of what he or she would like to accomplish and fabricate. Brent is a fantastic and patient instructor, and I would recommed the course to any interested student.",
    "Excellent technical and working introduction to metalworking and welding. Lots of time in shop, great for those who want to be hands on. Practically no limit to the amount that you can do or make provided that you pay for the extra materials. Definitely worth taking if you're at all interested in metalwork.",
    "I would not recommend Art 120 01 to a fellow student, unless they were interested in pursuing sculpture. It was just too much work, and too much frustration for someone just generally interested in art. Also, it left me feeling frustrated and upset with my inability to use the metal shop to turn my imagination into reality.",
    "It's the bomb. No, seriously. If you want to learn the basics to welding metal and creating metallic structures, this course is definitely for you.It's a lot of hard work and patience, but it you're willing to learn this medium, you won't regret it. And also, you sound like a badass in conversations with your friends.\"So what did you do today?\"\"Oh you know, just welded a giant pair of wearable bat wings. Nothing much, oh and I burnt a hole in my shoe doing it.\"...so cool"
