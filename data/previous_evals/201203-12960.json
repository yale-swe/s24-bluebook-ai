   "comments": [
    "Interesting, but can be very difficult and confusing. You have to start to think in a whole new way. Kagan is not shy about his beliefs and will try to convince you to see things his way. Make sure that you are either willing to be swayed or secure enough in your own beliefs that you are willing to listen and understand what he is saying. Definitely take it Cr\/D. If you work hard you might be pleasantly surprised but Cr\/D allows you to enjoy the class without worrying because grading can be very harsh.",
    "Grade deflation, but great class",
    "If you must take this class, take it credit D.Somehow, when I read the reviews, I didn't take this advice seriously. Listen. If you're good at writing papers, and you're good at writing philosophy papers, it doesn't matter. Shelly's grading is inane and this will ruin your GPA.By the last paper I figured out what he wanted from the papers (simple, stylistic blandness), and managed to get an A. But my other papers that got B-'s were just as good if not better.Anyway, this class was sort of interesting, but probably it wasn't worth my time. Shelly is an arrogant man, and though he's really smart, I don't like that he's only willing to teach his own opinion.",
    "I feel pretty ambivalent about this course. Half of it was really great, and half of it was a bit lackluster. I don't think it was because of the course, though, but rather just my overall attitude towards philosophy. This was my first course in philosophy, and I just came to the realization it's not my cup of tea. Kagan is a GREAT professor though. If you are at all interested in the topic and\/or philosophy, definitely take this course. If you have zero background in it and are just mildly interested (like I was), be cautious and seriously evaluate the course during shopping period. AND TAKE IT CREDIT\/D.",
    "Kagan presents his opinions to you twice a week with convenient analogies and clever semantics. I rarely felt compelled or convinced by his arguments, and I think he truly didn't care if his students learned anything...as long as they agreed with him at the end of the term. This class was a waste of tuition money.",
    "Death is a ball-buster of a course. It's an enticing subject, of course, and the lectures are interesting and bring up some interesting viewpoints. However, while I do appreciate Shelley's acknowledgement of the definition of academic grading, it was frustrating to try very hard on a paper (since there are only three and comprise 75% of your grade) and receive a rather jarring grade in response. For a higher-level 300 course or something, I could understand the logic behind such a process, but for a rather introductory philosophical course, it was harsh, and I didn't appreciate it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but the writings are graded very harshly. This would be a great class to take as Credit\/Fail, since you'll be able to enjoy the discussions without constantly worrying about your grade.",
    "A must-take. Prof. Kagan is the most enjoyable lecturer that I have had so far at Yale - he just sits on a desk in the front of the classroom, in jeans and Converse, and chats with us about the nature of death. You simply can't get much more awesome than that. The workload is very manageable - only a few light (and basically optional) readings, and three essays. Many people say that Prof. Kagan is a hard grader, but I had never taken a philosophy class before and did just fine. I would suggest taking it Cr\/D initially though, just to be safe. But absolutely, take it! It's so interesting, and really makes you think about your life (and the nature of life in general) in a new way.",
    "A lecture that unless you like listening to, you never need to attend. Most of the class doesnt. The papers require nothing but your own musings, and you can do the 3 papers and section without any reading or lecture. I took it credit\/d. easiest B of my life.",
    "Good course, but horrendous grading practice. Sure, everyone knows that Kagan grades this way, but that keeps many students from taking this as a grade. Instead, many do pass fail and don't put as much effort into it as they could. Readings not needed to do well, never discussed in section. Overall, didn't really learn anything new, as I already shared many of the same thoughts as Kagan. Would not recommend.",
    "Yes, but definitely take it Cr\/D. Too tough of a grader to just throw caution to the wind. Grading system is easy though. Three 5-page papers and a section grade, split equally.",
    "CREDIT\/D. CREDIT\/D. however good you think you are, take this class credit\/d.",
    "I honestly did not feel like this class was worth it. Lecture was a little boring. It was too much opinion for me. I like to delve into analysis of philosophers and Kagan didn't even go near the readings that we had to do so there was really no point in doing them. He's a very energetic little man. His lectures were just basically him prancing around the stage and giving his opinion. He's a brilliant man but I wouldn't put him on the same level as a Plato or Tolstoy. I wishhe would have analyzed philosophers approaches to death more so that his own.",
    "The first half skims through metaphysics and personal identity, and the second focuses on how we should feel about death. It's fun.",
    "Take it. Though Professor Kagan is (in)famous for his harsh grading, it is still well worth it. The class makes you think about issues (such as suicide) that most ignore. In some sense, it is a fantastic class for personal development.",
    "If death intrigues you- take this class!",
    "A class that will benefit you the rest of your life. Take it! But take it credit\/D if you've never written a philosophy paper.",
    "Makes you think logically and structure arguments coherently. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in getting the most out of a liberal arts education.",
    "No. And here's why - neither the class nor Shelly Kagan is as great as it\/he makes itself\/himself out to be in the beginning of the year. And please listen to me because you are most likely going to make the same mistake that I made. As I did, you are going to go through his evaluations, which are extremely polarized - some say he's fantastic, some say he's terrible - and shop the class and decide that the evaluations that say he's terrible are just wrong because he SEEMS like such a fantastic professor and ignore the evaluations and take the course. This is what I did, and this is what you will probably do - DO NOT DO THIS. He's certainly not terrible. He genuinely isn't terrible. He's mediocre - I don't know about you, but I despise mediocrity. However, as a human being, he is fantastic - this is probably going to lead you to believe, while you are shopping this course in the beginning of the semester, that the course is going to be great. No. Most of the things he said in class were either a) so obvious you could've thought of them on your own, b) even if not so obvious, not enlightening in any way, or c) too quickly dismissed or accepted or reach no substantive conclusion. I'm telling you, he'll fool youinto believing that the course is going to be amazing with his extremely charming and humorous personality (I was fooled too), and yes, he's a great person, but not a great professor. Do not take the course. (And I'm a potential philosophy major, so it's not even that I just didn't like philosophy or some sort of bullshit like that)",
    "Death takes us through Shelly's arguments for whether we have a soul, what happens after death, and how that should make us feel about life.",
    "This is a great class--grading is very stringent, but if your writing skills are strong and you can learn to write a solid philosophy paper, you should be able to do fine. You get to think about some very interesting themes about death and being. Taking this class definitely changed a lot of my perspectives on how to live my life in light of the fact that I will die, and I generally would recommend this class!",
    "Shelly is a fantastic lecturer. Classes are great because of his engaging and intuitive style. Death is unsurprisingly a philosophical look at the subject, don't expect discussion of religious or cultural attitudes. I really enjoyed this class but be warned of Kagan's traditional draconian grading policies (eg. be prepared for about one letter grade lower than what you are used to) so it might be a good class to cr\/d.",
    "It's an interesting course, but not the oh-my-god-it's-a-must-take course that it's made out to be. I think it can be improved if Kagan doesn't take his grading scheme so heavily. It's terrible when a good philosophy paper earns a C. It's ridiculous. However, the material in the course is excellent, and it is really reflective. I think section is also great because we discuss a topic that is so personal and relatable to all of us. The books we read are also excellent.I would recommend this to a student to take Cr\/d\/fail.",
    "it's a great credit d but an even better class if you're willing to give it the time. i wish i had given it more time..",
    "It's an amazing class and super interesting. If you're afraid of getting a B maybe don't take it because he is a strict grader and really good papers get Bs. But the lectures and discussions are amazing and it's not a lot of work. Just 3 papers.",
    "TAKE IT. Credit D though. Three 5 page papers and you don't really ever have to do any of the reading. But the papers are graded to a tough standard.",
    "Do not take this class. While the subject might seem interesting the lectures and discussions quickly fall apart. This class could be a lot better if Shelly was willing to use notes to structure his ideas in lecture. He reads these evaluations and many people have made this point. I hope this year he's willing to change some of his methods.",
    "I would very mcuh recommend it. Thought provoking, in both class and secoon.",
    "Fun class and topic. Take it CR\/D.",
    "Three 5-page papers, graded aggressively, but they teach you how to write logically and analytically. Other than that, the readings are interesting about half the time but aren't necessary to do well in class. A good choice for Credit\/D",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to think deeply about Death. You might not find any concrete answers, but you'll learn to ask questions you wouldn't have thought of before and that's something.",
    "It is a very interesting lecture that improves your critical thinking and ideas about death, but it is a complete bear to try and get a good grade. I would recommend this class to another student as credit D or auditing.",
    "TAKE IT. Incredibly well-taught, very manageable workload. You learn much about life in the process of self-reflection.If you don't have time, watch the lectures online. The best part of the course for me was writing the essays but there is already so much one can gain just by listening to Shelly.",
    "The papers are very hard to write but if you like philosophy then this is the class for you.",
    "YES. I could not be more adamant about that. Take this class!",
    "Take this class. Shelly is phenomenal. He won't teach you about philosophy, he'll teach you how to engage with ideas and decide what your own philosophy is. The material can be challenging if you are unfamiliar with thinking like a philosopher, but it was definitely a rewarding experience.",
    "Death is a clear, precise look at a topic that raised many interesting questions. Kagan is a joy to listen to, and as a class it is a joy to follow--exceptionally clear. If you have not taken a lot of high philosophy it will be a fun way to get your brain moving in much more precise ways, and clarify thinking. Its hard. The lectures are so enjoyable and the paper writing is really hard. I wish I had CRD this class. But I did pull through and write a final paper I m really proud of, which is a good feeling. If you take this class, you will definitely enjoy it.",
    "Yes- fun, interesting class which especially improved my ability in writing a philosophy paper.",
    "Good course with interesting lectures however the grading is tough",
    "Take it Credit\/D\/Fail, seriously the grading is wacky. All the papers are very analytic in nature, think math proofs.",
    "An awesome intro philosophy class although sometimes it gets a bit depressing.",
    "I would recommend the course - it was graded on 3 papers and discussion section this semester, meaning lectures and readings were all great but never explicitly required to do well in the course. So that means you can read at your own pace (be prepared for section though). The papers are graded harshly, but the first one was dropped if you did better later on. It was also great to be able to write the philosophy papers from your own ideas - the whole point is to \"philosophize\" and not to learn about what other people might have said or thought. The material really got me thinking about some deep, fascinating questions. I'd definitely recommend taking the class - Shelly is also great, really passionate about the material!",
    "Take it. Most people took it credit-d, which I think is the way to go.",
    "Yes I strongly recommend! And the grading isn't even that hard! I started off as crdfail thinking I might literally fail the class, but I came out alright and I switched back to a letter grade. I have learned so much along the way. Seeing myself progress makes me happy. Death provoked and continues to provoke so much deep thinking within me.",
    "Lecture is here-and-there some days, but it has less to do with Shelly himself than the intricacies of his subject matter. There will be engaging days and boring days but that isthe way of philosophy: you have to understand the boring bits before you can get to the big mind-blowing stuff. The three essays weren't that bad, but it is often difficult to keep up with the reading unless you constantly refer to the syllabus or have it recorded in a schedule somewhere.",
    "it's the perfect introductory course to philo. or, the perfect course for non-philo majors who wish to know a little bit of everything about philo. it cuts through different kinds of philo concepts like immortality, determinism vs. free will, ....and, more than that, it widens your perspective on life and which i believe, can help you live life better.",
    "Death explores the questions of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surviving his death, questions of personal identity, questions about how one should handle the knowledge of his death, questions about the benefits of immortality, and questions about the morality and rationality of suicide. That is a very brief and incomplete summary of the topics Shelly discusses.Would I recommend this class? Yes, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to everyone. However, I recommend taking I Credit\/D\/Fail unless you want it to count as a prerequisite for the philosophy major or you are confident in your ability to write a philosophy paper (and I mean confident in writing philosophy papers specifically, which is very different from the type of papers students usually write.)",
    "A great, deep thinking course.",
    "Deserves the hype. Kagan is one of the clearest thinkers out there. Additionally, he recognizes that this is an intro class and takes his time laying the groundwork. This may be frustrating if you've taken many Philosophy classes before, but you can easily push the discussion up a notch by talking to him after class or going beyond with your papers.",
    "take it!",
    "Some interesting ideas but it takes too long for Kagan to make a basic point. I felt like what he was saying could always be condensed from around an hour to 15 minutes. Take it credit\/D",
    "Tough to get a good grade, but interesting.",
    "Death is a really interesting class regardless of whether you have taken any other philosophy courses at Yale. It is true that the grading scale is harsher than in many other classes -- but don't let that deter you from taking it! It covers a lot of interesting material, and Shelly Kagan is a fantastic lecturer who will make every lecture worth attending.",
    "A fun, engaging introduction to philosophical thinking. Kagan is excellent. In my opinion, during the first half of the course he tips the scales a little bit in favor of physicalism but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly balanced and he does tackle some strong dualist arguments. The readings are interesting and some of them help on the papers. Section was enjoyable, and increasingly so as the semester went on. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be scared off by the grading\u00e2\u0080\u0094I found it refreshing that a professor wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give me an A on something I had just crapped out the night before. My TA offered excellent feedback and there is help to improve between the first and second papers so you can do well in the course if you put in the effort. That said, it is probably intelligent to start the class Cr\/D\/F.",
    "This is a good fun philosophy course that isn't all that much work-I'd say take it.",
    "I would not recommend it. If you take it, but do it cr-d but still be careful",
    "I wanted to like this course, but it was difficult. Kagan's lecturing seems really engaging at the start, but it gets repetitive. You feel the curriculum is being stretched unnecessarily to fill a semester. Would take another class if you want one with Kagan.",
    "Interesting course, not much work, but the grading is very harsh. This almost forces you to take it cr\/d\/fail. With a loaded schedule, it's very easy to become disengaged from a dfail class. I know the purpose of grading harshly is too encourage students to push themselves, but for me it forced me to take it dfail and ending up having an opposite effect.",
    "This is a really good class, and most everyone should take it. It offers a great look into an issue intimately tied up with all our lives. Shelly teaches the class as a tour of metaphysics and value theory, dismantling the soul, arguing againstthe badness of death, and considering the problem of suicide. The class takes a stand on all these issues, but does so with a healthy dose of philosophical rigor. For those of a religious persuasion, the class offers a cogent challenge to many theistic beliefs. For those who are more perplexed, or just want to clarify their thoughts on the matter of death, this class is a wonderful guide.",
    "It is for good reason that the click-through rate of Death on OpenCourses exceeds one million: Shelly Kagan is relevant, clear, witty, and often convincing when he argues for his controversial views on death. In Death, Professor Kagan invites students to think for themselves and to \"face death without fear and without illusion.\" I greatly appreciated Professor Kagan's style of addressing philosophical questions head-on and from all angles, rather than limiting our study to the views of some particular philosopher. His lectures were my favorite part of my week, each week.Despite his fame, Professor Kagan is extremely approachable: he hangs around after class to answer student question and even asks students to refer to him by his first name. When asked a question, he always assumes that there is an intelligent insight behind our garbled words, and works to tease it out of us before answering.Many students will tell you to take this course Credit\/D\/Fail. They're probably right, but don't let that get in the way of you taking the course seriously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 otherwise you'll be missing out on an opportunity to learn to think more rigorously and write about tough concepts more clearly.",
    "It's a great class to take Credit\/D. Interesting, deep material that will challenge you to think about your mortality. Also, relatively easy workload - just three five-page papers with reading that you really don't need to do. The class will exercise a part of your brain you probably don't exercise very often unless you're a philosophy major.",
    "If you have a strong belief in the afterlife, I wouldn't take this class. Shelly will try very hard to dissuade that belief. Also, if you do take it, unless you are the best writer you know, do it Credit\/D. That being said, I really enjoyed the class. It will get you thinking in exciting ways.",
    "I took Death because I had never taken a philosophy course before and I wanted to take one before graduating, andalso because I had heard interesting feedback about Shelly Kagan. Overall, I would probably say I was disappointed. Not only do I feel like I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really learn much, but I often felt like lecture was somewhat silly. I enjoyed the second half of the semester more when we moved into talking about more practical matters, but in the beginning of the semester the material was very lofty and difficult with which to relate. In retrospect, I wish I had taken a different course as an introduction to philosophy. The difficultly of the grading scale is somewhat ridiculous, pushing what I believe may be the majority of the students in the class to enroll with the credit\/d\/fail option. I probably would not recommend Death to another student. It is an interesting course on which to sit in a few times here and there, but you could probably get the same things I got out of the course by watching a few online lectures or reading one of Shelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s books.",
    "Easily one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Kagan is a brilliant lecturer, and it was like opening a new present at Christmas every time I went to his class. I implore you to take his class, especially if you've never taken a philosophy class before. It will certainly open up your mind in ways I didn't think were possible. Also, a very good use of Credit\/D.",
    "take it credit\/d, it'll save you a lot of frustration and stress over the unusually hard grading scheme of this class. typical philosophy class of course: more questions asked than any that are fully answered in a satisfying way. workload was easy, 3 five page papers, absolutely zero need to do the reading (well, with julianne as a TF anyway, who was great btw). kagan's lecturing format is very much 1) these are the assumptions we'll make 2) i'm right because xyz 3) it would be pretty stupid of you to think otherwise. example would be outright exemption of religion or afterlife, etc. which was actually good for me as an agnostic engineering major. the topics are interesting and theres some good things to be learned from the class, take it. really doesn't deserve the kind of hype it gets, however.",
    "Interesting course, if you're not worried about perfect grades. I needed a humanities credit, and it's not particularly difficult to not fail the class, but you also won't get an A unless this is the most important class to you, which it simply couldn't be when I just needed a distributional credit."
