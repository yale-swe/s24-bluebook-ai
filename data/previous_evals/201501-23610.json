    "One of the best classes I've taken at FES. You learn from the papers, the instructor & your peers. Presenting on the material forces you to learn it far better than you ever would just reading about it. The class does a great job applying the concepts covered to a broader range of environmental issues. It was a very low-risk way of engaging with the subject matter & improving my understanding of economics, CSR & behavior.",
    "Fantastic course - I got a good sense of the field of environmental economics and the latest research. Through the presentations and discussions, I also developed an understanding of economic analysis, and how the research applies to our daily lives.",
    "Great course, I really appreciate the seminar style of this class.",

    "The presentations really forced you to learn the material and practice your public speaking skills, while doing so in a very supportive environment. I never felt like I was being hung out to dry and both Kotchen & my classmates helped me to better understand the material.",
    "The engaging discussions - people in this group truly wanted to learn and share information, which made the discussions a joy to participate in.",
    "This class was a great opportunity for discussion of market mechanisms and behavioral economics in service of environmental goals.",
    "All of the readings were applicable to any field of study. Going beyond the statistics and into applied statistics\/consumer behavior is something that anyone can use.",
    "This course was fantastically designed - the opportunity to really engage deeply with the primary literature was an excellent learning opportunity not just on the specific area of study, but on the skill and craft of reading journal articles."

   "comments": [
    "The reading selection would be improved by including more field studies",
    "Could actually benefit from more presentations, perhaps some partner presentations. Would love to have read some more case studies relating to the natural world; land management, conservation, species protection. The tuna case was the closest we got. I know it's harder to find relevant material in those areas, but there was an awful lot of energy material.",
    "The format of student presentations may need some re-thinking - if you did all the reading then the summary-of-reading part of each presentation was unnecessary.",
    "There need to be greater incentives to induce other people to read so that there is a livelier discussion.",
    "I do think some kind of transparent accountability device would help guarantee more uniform preparation for the class. The tension is that with presentations designed to give a summary of the entire paper, it can feel redundant to read other articles (as they are typically well summarized for you by the presenter). This might be avoided by encouraging presenters to spend less time on overview\/review, and more time on specific questions\/concerns with the method and findings."

The course considers a series of studies on various topics exploring how people respond to various stimuli to encourage (or discourage) green (or anti-green) behavior. This is not a course on any specific (green) market but the economic perspective of the general marketplace.",
