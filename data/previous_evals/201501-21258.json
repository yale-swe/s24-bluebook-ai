    "I would recommend it if you are willing to put in the work. Sometimes the problem sets can be tedious calculations.",

    "It was a good introduction to renormalization, non-abelian gauge theories and the standard model",
    "It is a difficult but rewarding course covering material all the way to the Standard Model. I would only recommend it to a student who actually thinks they will get something of it (ie it is related to their field). Otherwise, it just too much work."
