    "I learned a lot taking this course. It was a beginning level chinese course and we learned a lot fo characters and the basics of how to say simple sentences.",
    "I learned introductory Chinese grammar, characters, listening, and speaking comprehension. I learned how to say and construct basic Chinese sentences, read simple Chinese passages, and communicate my ideas in Mandarin.",
    "I learned the basic of Chinese. I learned a lot of new vocabulary, grammar, and about tones.",
    "A LOT of Chinese",
    "I learned how to speak, write, and read Mandarin Chinese. I also learned how language learning works in general.",
    "I gained a decent amount of Chinese vocabulary.",
    "I definitely think I made a lot of progress in Chinese fluency. I started knowing absolutely nothing, and ended knowing quite a few words\/characters and phrases.",
    "Greater understanding of how interconnected East Asian languages are (certain Chinese words are extremely similar to words spoken in Korean, my parents' native tongue); lost fear of messing up in front of others (every single student butchered tones or characters at some point during the course, and that was completely fine---it was a learning experience for all of us)"

   "comments": [
    "Some of the strengths of the course were the frequent daily exams, which forced students to review the day's material before each lesson. Other strengths included the weekly TA sessions, the around-the-table based discussions, and engaging textbook. The workbook exercises that referred to previous material were also instrumental in reviewing the material. The only things I wish could be improved were a less stressful oral examination. I think that it would make more sense for the professors to deliver the oral exams in person rather than in a digital form. I also think that having professors read the sound recordings on the test out loud would also be helpful and more authentic. (although, I can see how seeing it in a recorded form is more authentic) In future years, I would love to see even more oral review, with emphasis on getting students to communicate their ideas fluently.",
    "I think that this course was well designed. I think teaching a language is hard, but I felt like I learned a lot this semester.",
    "The course moves at an incredibly fast pace and you will learn a lot of material, although it does feel like a bit of a grind sometimes. Lots of daily flashcards, character practice, etc",
    "The relatively small class size and the weekly TA sessions were very helpful.",
    "Learned a lot. Very rigorous. Wish we spent time learning to write some more complicated characters in class.",
    "The course is heavily focused on the dialogues and reciting them which I understand to a degree, but I felt it was a weakness in terms of learning to use the language beyond written scripts (that the teacher sometimes had to correct to tell us what was unnatural about them). A strength of this course is that while they do expect you to learn a lot of characters, they are very forgiving in that on tests you can use pinyin and there is only one section of characters which you can pass the test with A or B even if you fail that section. Another weakness I would say is that you do most of the learning outside of class and just review in class which I didn't; find helpful because if that's the case I might as well buy the book and not take the class at all, but feedback on pronunciation is definitely helpful.",
    "I wish the teachers would post grades on Canvas throughout the semester, so that we'd know how we are doing over the course of the semester rather than only seeing your grade at the end.",
    "The daily quizzes and vocab were good at keeping students up to date and accountable with the course material. One suggestion my TA and I discussed was emphasizing\/spending more time going over the meanings of common radicals in the beginning of the course (radicals can serve as context clues for the definition of certain, complicated characters later on in the course)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "yes, you learn a lot about chinese really quick, so if you want to get well at a certain language they really teach chinese well.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I believe that anyone who has wanted to gain an understanding of Mandarin would benefit immensely from taking CHNS 110. I have learned more in one semester here than I have in a foreign language all throughout high school. I think this is a result of the great and engaging textbook (there are many funny love stories within the dialogues), the teacher (who also had many stories yet was able to communicate grammar principles effectively), and the learning environment (the teacher encouraged active participation in the class by calling on students and making them respond in Chinese.) This was a 9:25 am class, but there is no point in time that I was tired. In fact, CHNS 110 was a great way of starting my day and waking me up.",
    "Yes. I think this a very good introduction to Chinese and that you learn a lot.",
    "Yes! It's a ton of hard work but is very rewarding",
    "Although very rigors, the instruction in Chinese 110 was very thorough and I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "If you want to learn Chinese or study abroad in China, I do recommend this course. Although I feel there are better ways it could be taught and organized, taking the course and having feedback from teachers and support from classmates is helpful enough. The workload isn't as bad as people say in my opinion. There is a short quiz everyday at the beginning of class based on the dialogue unity (one character that you must write along with its pinyin, one sentence to either translate into English or Chinese, and one word to translate into English, pinyin, or both), homework is in the form of online quia quizzes (should take no more than five to ten minutes) and written workbook assignments (some are longer, but if you work with a friend or have already reviewed the material it can get done in a decent amount of time), and after every two units there is a test (reading comprehension, listening, translation, character writing, and free responses of what you should say in a certain situation). There are also two oral tests where instead of class you report to a computer lab and record your answers to a set of questions (usually 12 and each question gives around 30 seconds or less for a short sentence response plus they give time to prepare before recording each question). Each piece of your grade is relatively small, but it is important not to slack.",
    "Absolutely. China is becoming an enormous player on the world stage, so knowing Chinese could be immensely useful for future career prospects.",
    "Yes! It is a well-guided and thorough introduction to the Chinese language (I am shocked at how much I can say in Chinese after only 4 months of studying and practice)"
