   "comments": [
    "Very light workload, great thought-provoking stuff.",
    "This class was pretty good. The material was pretty interesting - a lot of theoretical analysis of public opinion and its role in politics. The professor is really chill and makes seminar fun.",
    "Public Opinion is a decent course. I thought DeCanio could have done a more active job in guiding the seminar discussions, but overall I have a positive impression of the course. Not the best course I've taken at Yale, not the worst. The readings are managable, although the term paper can come quickly if you don't plan for it. I'd recommend it, but it's not an enthusiastic endorsement.",
    "Take this class. Work isn't too bad and the professor is awesome.",
    "Again, hilariously easy throughout the year, good material, but not all that much of it. I.e. I learned and talked about some really interesting things, but not all that many. I would recommend it to another student if they're looking for a fifth class or a really relaxing seminar.",
    "Advantages this class has going for it: an incredibly cool, laid back professor who doesn\u0092t mind jokes (and discussions about topics that don't directly relate to the readings or the occasional complaint about the New Haven crime rate), interesting papers that you will probably end up reading even if you don\u0092t have to, and very smart students to have discussions with--save for one Canadian. Final assignment is a 12-14 page research paper\u0097don\u0092t stress about it, pick something that you want to write about.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to political science majors. Readings aren't very difficult especially for a seminar but the levels of discussion may be difficult for non-political science majors.",
    "Public Opinion is a class about the influence public opinion has on the governing process. Issues of democratic responsiveness, heuristics, etc.",
    "I would summarize it as a very interesting, relaxed class. It consisted of weekly discussions on fairly shorts readings, and didn't really require that much effort until the final paper. I would recommend it, but only if you're really interested in the topic.",
    "Questions the strength of democratic institutions. Yes I would recommend this class.",
    "Great course. Interesting look at public opinion, democratic responsiveness, voter ignorance, the difference between elections and markets, and other similar topics. DeCanio is the best - young, funny, willing to just chat at the beginning of every class, and interested in his students. Only work is reading and a 12 page paper at the end. I'd definitely recommend taking it, but my guess is only poli sci majors will be able to get in - DeCanio is a rising star.",
    "Yes, if public opinion and elite autonomy is something you want to study in detail."
