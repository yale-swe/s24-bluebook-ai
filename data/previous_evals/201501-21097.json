   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Overall, I would recommend it.",
    "The first semester of GS is a whirlwind: a tour de force of GS topics ranging from Sun Tzu to Lincoln, to the Cold War. It's very much a survey - lots of material covered in just one semester, so be prepared to really dig in. It's fascinating though, and you learn a ton. Really enjoyed it.",
    "A widespread introduction to historical and strategic thought full of lively discussion and very interesting ideas. I always had many new thoughts to ponder after each class. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, because you get to interact with very engaging fellow students and professors as well as ideas!",
    "It is a good class if you are interested in reading a few \"canonical works\" of Grand Strategy, but honestly, the structure of the class is a bit weird. We spent half the semester talking about grand strategy in antiquity and then it felt we suddenly transitioned to the Cold War -- maybe we could do a few more things to patch up our understanding of GS in the middle?",
    "Yes, I would recommend GS to another student because the course material is so fascinating and important, and because the instructors and guest lecturers are generally very impressive.",
    "GS is a course on the conventional definition of strategy -- more often than not that means military means and large, grand political ends. If you have not read the classics in another course (as an undergrad), it is worth it to take this course. As a graduate student, you are better off taking a smaller graduate-level (and graduate student only) course.",
    "Very demanding course but exposes you to some of the best professors at Yale and most politically active students. Life-changing experience.",
    "It will ground you in the classical roots of strategy in the west. It will make you more comfortable with paradox and high skeptical of certainty in formulating guiding principles--don't embrace or rebel against the lessons offered, just slot them alongside your life experience in attempt to shine a little more light onto the opaque chaos.",
    "One has to remember that despite the reputation, it's just a college course. It is a very good college course, but there are limits.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about the things that matter. Also, do the reading. Do all the reading. I've never gotten so much out of readings as I did these readings.",
    "Grand Strategy is an unusual course. There are several hundred pages of required reading every week (with thousands of pages of optional reading to supplement) and a 2-hour weekly seminar on those readings. It is frustrating as a seminar because there are way too many students (about 20 undergrads plus all the graduate students and weekly visitors) to ever have a productive back and forth discussion. The assigned texts are all interesting individually but there was far too little synthesis between the texts to give them relevance and context. Sometimes the professors leading the discussions were insightful (Prof. Garsten and Prof. Tooze were phenomenal and their comments\/discussion leadership made the rest of the sessions bearable) but in generally I found that the course utterly failed to be intellectually challenging. The grading structure for the papers is absurd. There are known discrepancies in the grading- certain professors are notorious for being much tougher than others and there is no way for a professor to actually coach students to improve their writing over the course of the semester because different things are important to each professor. This is extremely frustrating for the students because we are always fighting yesterdays battle- there is no way to learn what a professor is looking for and then adjust accordingly for the next paper. This course is under new leadership, so it will be interesting to see if it is able to undergo the serious self-reflection to actually earn the prestigious reputation that it has on campus. The books assigned are great, so it is worth taking for the intrinsic value of reading those texts but dont have high expectations for the seminars in the spring. The professor are obviously very accomplished and intelligent but you will get almost no contact with them from the class- the only plus is that being in GS with give you the opportunity to seek them out privately and you might actually have interesting conversations if you take that initiative. Think carefully before taking this class and talk to students that have taken it in the past. Its prestige is worth something, but it could very easily be a total waste of your time at Yale when there are so many other, better courses."

    "Fine",
    "Very much so. I am excited for my summer research, which will tie in fully with my thesis work next year.",
    "While this course did not directly pertain to my discipline, I feel like the ideas and ways of strategic thinking I learned in this course will definitely help me.",
    "It forced me to read a lot of books that I wouldn't otherwise have read and make a lot of connections that I otherwise wouldn't have made.",
    "This course has lived up to its reputation and is perhaps the best I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "Not within my major, but helpful nonetheless in my overall strategy and pursuit.",
    "It greatly increased my knowledge of the progression of western society from religiously dominated to secular political institutions. Key for any understanding of Global Affairs.",
    "Definitely opened up a side of history that I was not familiar with",
    "This course guided me toward the kind of history I am interested in."
