   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it! Two in class midterms, section, and term paper is a very manageable workload ad the topics covered are so important to be aware of and are interesting!",
    "the readings can be a bit dense, but the class is definitely worth it!",
    "This course is certainly interesting insofar as it will cause you to reconsider some environmental issues and how they are managed in this country. However, lectures are generally very flat and the readings often seem unrealistic and inaccessible (i.e., 100-page court case summaries or lists of EPA regulatory schemes). Section was actually the most enjoyable portion of the class for me as it was there that these otherwise disparate elements were weaved into something more useful. The final paper is also a pretty fun assignment so long as you choose a topic of genuine interest for which you are willing to invest some time researching. Overall, I would not recommend this class to another student who does not already have some interest in environmental issues. At the same time, I would not discourage anyone from giving it a shot.",
    "Take it! Everyone at Yale should really be exposed to this material for the sake of knowing your environmental past and future footprint on the planet.",
    "DO NOT take this class. It is completely not worth it - Wargo's lectures are very sporadic and not really relevant to the final, sections suck, you honestly walk away having learned nothing and the midterm and the final are a HUGE pain to study for and the TAs that grade them are sticklers for details and good writing. It honestly was one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "Super interesting, you learn a lot.",
    "Take this if you are interested in the environment. Not too hard of a class depending on your TA.",
    "Interesting class - one that everyone should take at Yale. There are a lot of environmental issues covered in this course, and all of them are extremely relevant to our futures. Professor Wargo is a thoughtful and good lecturer, and the TFs were great. Not too much work or weekly reading either. Definitely worth it.",
    "Good class.",
    "This class will make you a more conscious citizen. Take it.",
    "Definitely recommended. Although lectures were disorganized and hard to follow in the beginning, this course gave me an understanding of current environmental policies and law, especially through Wargo's outstanding knowledge on the subject and extremely effective section discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course to you while also recommending that you care about it. I personally found it very rewarding because it made me think about environmental law in a more analytical way, beyond all the Go Green bullshit that kind of permeates environmental thinking right now. The section was especially good for this (my TA was excellent). The lecture, on the other hand, was pretty dull. Professor Wargo is an awesome guy but rarely gets animated in his lecturing. He said himself that this course is more suited for a seminar format, and I couldn't agree more.",
    "I would recommend this class, as it definitely improved my understanding of the way that politics and law complicate environmental decisions.",
    "Yes, this is a good class to take with not too much work. The material is interesting, the discussions aren't super left-slanted (as I expected they would be), and Professor Wargo is a good lecturer despite his somewhat dry style. Doing the reading is pretty much optional.",
    "If you're interested in environmental studies\/issues, don't take this class because it is too broad and too superficial for you. You would get much more just by reading a few non-fiction books or reading the news. I have taken a lot of environmental issues classes before so I was really bored during lecture and frustrated during section because it seemed like know one really knew anything about the issues.",
    "This is a great introductory course to environmental law, because you will get a broad survey about all the important issues and policies. You also get great discussions on ethical principles and policy approaches. Nevertheless, it is a big lecture class so you get what you put into it, and you can also mostly get by without being very interested.",
    "Definitely take the class! You'll learn important things about everyday life so it doesn't matter what major you're in.",
    "Good class. Interesting topics but a somewhat monotonous lecture that would be much improved in the seminar format. In retrospect, learned a lot about our system of environmental regulation, a system in need of a lot of improvements.",
    "Interesting topics, but not an interesting lecture or class format. Wargo just repeats what he says in his book in lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students because it teaches you so many things that are relevant to how we live our life. Environmental issues are things that our generation is going to have to deal with so knowing more about these problems will be helpful.",
    "EPL is a great class and gives a good overview of the history of environmental issues and law in the United States. There are two in-class exams that are each 30%, and we receive the possible essay question a week in advance so they are totally doable. The final 30% (aside from 10% for sections) is a term paper on the topic of your choice, which I had so much fun writing. Great class, and take it either in this form or in a seminar form if Wargo decides to teach it in a smaller setting!",
    "I would recommend this class because of its broad reach of environmental topics. In fact, I think this is valuable knowledge for students in any major to have in mind. John Wargo is a really experienced and intelligent professor. However, the lecture format of the class was at times lackluster and the exams require very specific studying rather than larger, more broader ideas.",
    "I'm a big fan of the class. This is important information that every American citizen should be aware of. It's a super easy SO credit too - only a midterm, final, and one paper. TAKE IT!",
    "A must take",
    "If you are thinking about taking this class, expect to learn a lot about FACTs, but not HOW TO THINK. Before coming into this class, any decent citizen would know that smoking is bad, vehicle waste air is bad, and Kroon Hall is energy efficient. If you single out the environment and talk about it on a standalone basis, we all know what the answers are to the majority of the questions. Professor Wargo has got the mindset of an environmental activist, but not a statesman whom we can trust to make actual changes. Professor Wargo habitually poses many dilemmas in the realm of politics and economics, such as the level of necessary risk and risk\/benefit analysis. But he never gives his coherent thesis in addressing these dilemmas. Wargos lecture is organized around a host of unconnected facts and their current measures. When he identifies a problem and subsequently a solution, he jumps on the topic and talks about for minutes. Then completely shifts gear to a new topic. In his last lecture regarding the ethics of environmental law, during which he gave his visions, this is especially obvious. Theres a deep desire in every Yalie to make this society a better place. We protest injustice, seeking for a change. Wargos class perfectly caters to this need: he supplies ammunitions where the US government and governments around the world have done wrong. But he never gives a set of coherent and practical solutions. I certainly feel like this class does not live up to the Yale College standard of fostering critical thinking. I dont regret taking this class merely because I have to take it to fulfill my major requirement. But if I dont have to take this class in the first place, I would have never sat in this lecture for the entire semester. I came to this class hoping to learn about how to reconcile environment protection with economic development, business ethics, and legislative tools. Instead, Professor Wargo tests people based on questions like whats the harm of cigarette smoking or \"tell me the scope of plastic regulation in America\".",
    "Really interesting and insightful, a good intro to the topic and fun bec it encourages you to be creative. prof Wargo was really interesting to learn from. I highly recommend the course!!",
    "Awesome class! Gives you a really comprehensive understanding of current environmental topics, all of which will shock and inspire you if you haven't taken an environmental studies course yet. Professor Wargo is such an expert in this field and it was great to take a class with him. Lectures are interesting and the readings (including one of his books) are also interesting. The paper was fun because you get to choose a topic you care about and it was interesting to learn more about a particular environmental topic. The exams were very fair.",
    "As someone hoping to work in the environmental industry, I though this class was really useful. But I think that you could get almost just as much from reading Professor Wargo's book Green Intelligence as from going to lecture. If you're interested in environmental law and looking for a pretty easy 5th class, I would recommend it.",
    "Interesting class, workload not bad and don't have do all of the readings. Sections, midterm, paper, In class final, both exams are essay options given ahead of time. Lectures were great but I didn't like the exam format.",
    "I would. Just be wary of the TAs.",
    "The title of the course is pretty self-explanatory... talk in section and it is worth taking.",
    "Seems like a reasonable class, but it is graded extremely hard.",
    "Take only if you're interested in the material. Granted its an \"easy class\" with little work (two midterms with questions handed out, and a short paper) but the material still needs to be learnt and learnt well, so make sure you give the class the amount of time it needs.",
    "I no longer trust the world. But that's okay. The class was really interesting, slightly monotonous at times, but the history of regulations was pretty neat.",
    "Would definitely recommend! This course was so important for me in understanding just how little the public currently knows about a variety of issues. The course offers both complex information that is more useful for individuals who plan to be involved in some way with environmental law, as well as simpler advice that encourages making changes in our daily lives and explains why we should make those changes.",
    "Required for EVST majors. Not a bad class, but maybe wait until it is redone in a seminar format; the lecture format leaves something to be desired. The workload is nearly nothing (two midterms and a final paper), so there's a certain lack of engagement during lecture.",
    "Have you ever seen when a professor gets a lot of reviews saying that his\/her class is \"easy\" and then the next year they try to crack down and make things more difficult? WELL, that's exactly what happened with Environmental Politics and Law in the Spring of 2015. This stupid class was so boring, AND the grading was unfair too. Instead of making the tests\/assignments more challenging, the professor just tried to deflate everyone's grades... There are 2 exams and 1 final paper (all rather easy). We got 5 possible essays questions one week before each exam, and then he put 2 of them on the test and you just have to answer 1 in 50 minutes. Sounds like a breeze right? Well yes, it is. So the professor decided to just give everyone super arbitrary grades on these essays (well, actually the TFs did the gruntwork of course) even though most people probably did pretty well on them. I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS CLASS, DO NOT TAKE IT!!!",
    "We mostly covered nuclear weapons, pesticides, plastics, air quality, coastal zone management, and tobacco. Grading was 30-30-30-10: two in-class midterms, a 2500 word paper, and section participation. I took this class because I needed a Social Science credit and I wouldnt recommend it for that alone because I think there are better, more interesting, more engaging options. But its a credit and the research paper was open and lets you explore whatever you want which was fun.",
    "I think this class is overrated. I took it because it had great ratings and didn't look like much work, but I found it extremely boring. I'm not that interested in the environment in the first place, so maybe that's why, but the lectures were just so dry and the powerpoints were so disorganized and unengaging. Professor Wargo seems like a really nice guy who is very knowledgeable and cares a lot about this subject, but he needs to do something to spice up the lectures. Most of the readings are either unnecessary to do or really boring. Your grade is composed of 2 exams, 1 paper, and participation. For the exams, he gives you the possible essay questions beforehand so they're not too hard to prepare for. For the paper, you can pretty much write about whatever you want and the workload is spread out across the semester which is nice. The class did end up being pretty easy, but I don't know if that was worth sitting through boring lectures 2x a week.",
    "Awesome course, not very demanding but you learn a lot about the environment around you. Highly recommend it",
    "A good summary of the major issues regarding the environment and human health. Many of the themes are important and you learn a lot of interesting facts regarding the subject material.",
    "Would not recommend very dry and boring",
    "Great material.",
    "Good, but the midterm and final were graded harshly",
    "To gain some knowledge about environmental issues and the controversies and complications of environmental law",
    "Don't take this course. Seriously, just don't. The lectures aren't interesting, and the grading for the tests is left very unclear, until everyone finds out after the midterm that all that matters is how much you can memorize of statutes. There is almost no synthesis of information required.",
    "This class is what you make of it, if you do all the readings and pay attention in lectures you will walk away with a fantastically broader understanding of environmental issues that we struggle with in america.",
    "Yes! Excellent survey of environmental challenges and frameworks for addressing them",
    "Environmental Politics and Law eases one into the American legislative system and exposes just how hard it is to treat our environmental issues effectively. I would recommend the course!",
    "This was a great overview course of the history of environmental politics in the US. It covered a huge swath of information in not very much time and used case studies very effectively to help solidify an understanding of more abstract laws and standards. Very interesting, definitely would reccomend it to anyone interested in how public health is protected (or often neglected) by laws in the US.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. The only reason this class has good reviews is because the class is filled with a certain class of people (whom I shall not name outright, but you should be able to guess who they are) who always take gut classes and have never take an actual good class in their Yale career. So to them, this class seems like a good class because they don't know what an actual good class at Yale looks like. Do not take this class, even as an easy fifth credit class. I took this class, not expecting it to be awesome, but at least somewhat decent, but dear lord, this class was so atrocious that I wanted to die on my way to class every morning. I also took this class thinking it was going to be at least somewhat law\/policy-oriented, which it wasn't at all (it tried to be and failed miserably). Professor Wargo's very well-meaning, but his lectures are filled with Wikipedia facts about environmental issues you could've looked up yourself. Section was absolutely atrocious. I shopped around 5 sections hoping that at least one of them has to be not terrible, but no, they were all equally terrible. No offense, but this class gave me a really good taste of how stupid the school of forestry students are. Section revolved around really broad, often inane questions about environmental issues that tried to appear law\/policy-oriented, but were so vague and broad (I don't think any of the TAs even really understand what law\/policy is). Section is also filled with really stupid people. This class belongs to a shitty public high school, not to Yale. Don't take this class. It's easy, but if you're like me and suffer from being surrounded by stupidity, stay away from this class like the plague.",
    "It's a pretty cool class about a lot of interesting topics, but it wasnt as eye-opening as I had hoped (especially based on last year's reviews)",
    "Although I took this class for Energy Studies, and the class had little to do with energy, as someone interested in environmental policy and law I still found it to be a fascinating class. It gave a window into the roots of environmental policy and issues that launched the field long before climate change. This is very useful for how to think about current environmental issues and to understand the statutes that are currently on the books. The class has a big focus on environmental and human health, especially for children, which actually turned out to be quite interesting. Lectures were not riveting but you walk out of every one thinking about the world differently, and that is the mark of a good class.",
    "Take this course. It's got a great prof, lectures, subject matter. Tests are harder than you would expect, but definitely not super challenging.",
    "This class is terribly boring and really not worth it. No one shows up to lecture or does the reading which makes section PAINFUL. I went to every lecture and showed up to section having at least thought about the material and it was still unbearable. The grading is not transparent at all -- I felt it was quite unfair too. Yes, he gives you a list of possible questions a week in advance so you can prepare before the exams. I found this to be unfair though because the TAs all have secret checklists of what they are looking for in each response -- its a total guessing game. After the midterm I met with a TA to discuss my exam and upon reviewing what two essays, he said \"it is very clear you are not struggling -- you obviously thought about these questions wrote great responses, but this just wasn't what we were looking for\". This was infuriating! A total guessing game. Not worth it! Do not take!",
    "Overall, it was a pretty good class, as long as you have a good TA. If you don't it might not be as good. If you work hard, go to class, and contribute to discussion, you will be rewarded, both in your experience in the class and in your grade. Wargo takes the class and material seriously, so if you are willing to do the same, it can certainly be rewarding. If you are interested in the subject, you should also consider Dan Esty's class, which I have heard great things about.",
    "Environmental Politics and Law was a terrific, if somewhat sobering, course about environmental conservation, resource management, public health, and law. The lectures were thought-provoking, the course work was interesting, and the workload was manageable. Professor Wargo is at the top of his field and clearly very knowledgeable about the subject. It was exciting to learn from such a well-qualified professor whose passion for the subject was palpable and very infectious. A highly recommended course!"
