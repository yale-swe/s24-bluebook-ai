    "We learned a lot about the different ways to think about the societal problems posed by advancing medical technology, and how these different modes are often in competition with one another.",
    "Bioethics, Politics and Economics is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. After taking Bioethics & Law (Latham's larger lecture), this was a way to learn more about bioethics and read literature (instead of just cases) pertaining to the various issues.",
    "This course is really informative! You discuss the intersection of public health, law, and individual rights.",
    "That ethical challenges are pervasive across the academic fields and in the real word."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot of students didnt do the readings. Either holding people accountable or acknowledging that most people wont read books and instead posting a few articles might lead to better discussions",
    "One thing Prof Latham might consider is having a more stringent policy for accepting students into the seminar, rather than just randomized acceptance. This way the students who are most interest in the topic would have a fairer shot at acceptance. One thing that was difficult this semester was the fact that the same few people spoke up, while the rest stayed quiet. Giving students the opportunity to express interest might increase the chances of having livelier discussions.",
    "The books that we read in class were great. We had some truly excellent class discussions, but most of class time was Latham lecturing. Even when students contributed, it was in conversation with him. Part of this is because he is so engaged with the material. I don't think he can let an interesting (or errant) thought emerge without responding to it directly. I guess I wish that in the senior seminar we were allowed to discuss these issues like adults, with less mediation from Latham, but I know that only like four of us consistently did the reading. On that note, I think the single best way to improve the class would be to require that no one have their laptop out. It was basically like taking class with 12 zombies, four students, and one over-eager professor. I think Latham would feel like he could release the reins a little if people actually were intellectually present in the classroom.",
    "Strengths - Professor Latham is so knowledgeable and passionate about bioethics. He is a great lecturer but also able to facilitate discussion in the seminar. Weaknesses - the course grade is only based on 1 paper due at the end of the semester, so in terms of grading, there is a lot of uncertainty.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely Professor Latham. He has a wealth of knowledge and is very well-versed in any topic related to bioethics. However, with that being said, this class is more of a mini lecture rather than a discussion-based seminar. If you are looking to do in-depth discussion and debates bioethics topics, this course may not be for you.",
    "I love Professor Latham, he is extremely adept at explaining dense material in an understandable and gripping way. His choice of class material is also relevant to current real world discussions which makes the class even more valuable.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and the professor. I was very interested by the course readings as well as the class discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Youll get out as much as you put in",
    "Yes. Latham is an excellent person to teach a class like this. Sure, he isn't the greatest seminar professor but the ideas\/discussions he introduces in class really engage students; it's an experience that is unparalleled compared to other seminars I've taken.",
    "IF you're interested in the topic",
    "Amazing course, amazing professor, definitely recommend taking this course!",
    "Take this class because the material is interesting and you will think a lot about some really important issues. Do not take it if you want a really cohesive seminar-style environment. Most people don't do the reading (even though it's so interesting) so Latham spends a lot of time lecturing. He's a great lecturer, certainly, but don't take it under any delusions that you will be fruitfully engaging with the thoughts and ideas of other students.",
    "Take this course if you can get in; bioethics is fascinating and Latham is great to learn from",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in medical law and medical rights.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student because the discussions were very interesting and covered a wide range of topics from vaccines to the opiod crisis. I really enjoyed it."
