   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to a fellow student. However, if you are expecting documentaries reminiscent of Michael Moore, you're in for a surprise because it's all cinema verite. It opened my eyes to a form of documentary other than the big-budget documentary we see in the theaters today. It's very unstructured though, so if you need a guideline to help you with papers, you might struggle a bit in this class.",
    "Each class consists of watching films and discussing them. I would definitely recommend this for anyone interested in learning the basics of filmmaking, and the specifics that go into making a documentary. There is not much work, just three papers, and Professor Roemer is really awesome.",
    "A wonderful class. Not too much work but a lot of learning.",
    "Definitely. Professor Roemer is a great instructor, and he brings some brilliant insight into classroom discussions about documentary, film and life in general. The films are all excellent, but usually very heavy. Workload is very manageable: you screen all the films in class, and write three 6-page papers. No final.",
    "Fo shizzle. Easy, interesting, meets once a week.",
    "easy -- but be prepared to watch LOTS of dark films",
    "you watch a bunch of documentaries, mostly older stuff, and then talk about them. you have no work other than three papers spaced out throughout the semester. This is one of those classes that required barely any commitment outside of class but I still feel like I learned more than in any other class.",
    "You'll watch thought-provoking, often sorrowful documentaries, but you'll be the better for it. Professor Roemer is one of the most interesting people I've met at Yale. Take this course.",
    "Michael Roemer is a compassionate individual that engages with the material on both the critical and human level. I came to class more to hear him talk than anything else. Be warned, it is hard to attend to this class without having an existential crisis, but it's good to have those. It allows you to reflect on your life.",
    "This class was much more interesting than I thought it would be. It's not a lot of work at all- but some of the films are pretty heavy.",
    "No. the class is too out of reach to be something important toyou."
