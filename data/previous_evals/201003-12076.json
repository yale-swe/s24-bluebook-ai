   "comments": [
    "A good class, assuming you are an econ student (the class is capped, so you pretty much have to be to get in). The material is really manageable, since you have to take intermediate macro I would recommend this one.",
    "If you're an econ major.",
    "Don't take unless you have to for econ major",
    "Recommend because it is interesting",
    "nordhaus is a sweetheart, but the TAs left some things to be desired. lots of material covered, but most of it left unexplained. overall this class is definitely for a person who does a lot of work on their own and doesnt rely on the class\/TAs to actually learn anything",
    "Good introduction to useful macroeconomic theory with which you can explain what is happening in the world.",
    "Of course!!",
    "Take this course if you're an econ major. Professor Nordhaus does a pretty nice job with teaching the class. He is generally a pleasant person and you can tell he enjoys teaching. I would also mention that his lectures became pretty boring. It was difficult to sit in this class for more than an hour.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, if you can get in. You will understand the world better after you leave.",
    "The most useful Economics class I've taken, definitely take it.",
    "Take it if your interested in the economy or if you need it for your major. Unlike intro courses, I feel like this helped to explain the nuances of our current economy more and was a bit more applicable.",
    "It's a requirement for the Econ major, otherwise don't take it.",
    "Absolutely take intermediate macro with Nordhaus. My favorite econ class so far. Very applicable subject matter, and not overwhelmingly difficult. Only every other Pset is graded, so the workload isn't too burdensome.",
    "If you are an econ major and need an intermediate macro class, take this one with Nordhaus. Tests might be more difficult, but you'll get a lot out of the class in general. For such a famous economist, Nordhaus is humble and funny.",
    "It's alright. Nothing life-changing. I personally just don't like macro very much.",
    "Basically you just have to gut it out. The material can be pretty interesting, but there is a lot of it.",
    "I enjoyed this class overall, but did not really understand how much I had learned until after i took the final. Nordhaus can be funny, if a bit eccentric sometimes, and for about half of the semester, he didn't take up the entire 75 minutes, sticking to 60 or 65. Only half of the problem sets are graded, which is nice. Also, there's not too much math, so don't be scared off by that. I'd recommend this course for econ majors and non-econ majors alike. The midterm and final were very fair, although the latter was excruciatingly long. A lot of stuff we learned this year strayed from the typical models because of the recession and the liquidity trap, but it was informative.",
    "It is not very difficult, but make sure you understand the problem sets and resist the urge to put less effort into the ungraded ones.",
    "This is a great economics course. Nordhaus relates things to the real world and makes it really interesting.",
    "tired of suffering through introductory economics courses with horrible professors?* this is the class for you. nordhaus is incredibly competent, very very very very very smart and extremely well respected. more importantly, he can actually teach. unlike 80% of the econ department faculty.plus, the material is super interesting and relevant. QE, liquidity traps, financial panics, trade restrictions, debt levels and economic growth are all useful things to know about and this course will ensure that you can actually talk about the semi-intelligently, unlike the majority of lesser mortals. highly recommended.oh, just a word about exams\/psets. they're very fair, graded leniently and there will be more review sessions\/extra help than you'll know what to do with.*with the exception of barry",
    "I would recommend this to econ majors but also others interested in economics. It's an important class and the topics are enjoyable.",
    "Intermediate Macro is an econ requirement, but it is the best of the requirements. Take it with Nordhaus, he's a bit monotone sometimes but he reallyyy knows everything there is to know about macro, he keeps his lectures very updated and tries to make them fun and interesting. The tests are rough but fair, and there are only 4 graded problem sets, so its not too intense.",
    "Yes",
    "Nordhaus is a boss.",
    "This is a great course that gives you all of the basics without a whole lot of confusing math. Professor Nordhaus does a great job of pinpointing the things that you truly need to know as an economics major and overall I thought that all of the problem sets and assessments were very fair.",
    "Finally I understand Macroeconomics! This class really makes me like economics and appreciate being an econ major so much more. The material is very interesting and relevant. The textbook very good read and well-written. Overall, this is by far my favorite econ class, and maybe my favorite class overall at Yale. So DO TAKE MACRO WITH NORDHAUS TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT BEING AN ECON MAJOR!",
    "Good overall - I'm one of the few who didn't *have* to take the course, and I can say that it's a fun way to learn a lot of VERY relevant concepts in a good environment. The work's not too difficult, a generous curve - why would you say no?",
    "Yes. It's a required course and it's very relevant to the real world. This course also covers the financial crisis that has hit us recently and allow us to apply concepts we've learnt to analyze the situation.",
    "Inter Macro will teach you about some of the basic economic models, and also give you a good grounding in the basic concepts of interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, unemployment, and the purpose of the Fed. It was a cool experience to read in the news about QE2 and actually have the basic understanding of why the Fed would do something like that. Prof Nordhaus is a beast, even if he does sometimes walk right up to sleeping students while lecturing and talk loudly to wake them up.The best way to summarize what I got out of this course is to say that I can now pick up the Economist or Wall Street Journal and actually understand what I am reading. A good skill to have.",
    "Yes- take this course if you want a broad understanding of Macroeconomics.",
    "Pretty interesting stuff. Most likely, you'll be taking this course because you are required to. Nordhaus is a great option.",
    "A requirement for the major",
    "Great class and one of the best, if not the best, taught lecture of the economics department. Prof. Nordhaus is one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "This course expands on intro macro by clarifying some concepts and exploring new models. It does a good job of relating macro to historical and present macroeconomic issues. Nordhaus is a great professor. 8 problem sets (4 ungraded, 4 graded), midterm, final, final paper. Fairly straightforward course",
    "If you're an econ major, you have to take intermediate macro, and I would guess this is the best one to take. Nordhaus is a really good lecturer - fun and engaging. The workload isn't easy, but it's definitely not too bad either. The midterm wasn't too bad, but the final was much tougher.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend ECON 122.",
    "go to section and lecture, do your problem sets and you will be set for the class.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's a good survey of Macroeconomics.",
    "If you're an econ major, you'll have to take an intermediate macro class, and this one definitely appears to be a better course than the one taught in the spring. Take it!If you're not a major but are still interested in economics, this is definitely a class worth taking, because it'll help shed light on a lot of recent economic developments.",
    "I liked this class. I really did. Professor Nordhaus is adorable. He totally understands how boring the material is and he embraces it. He comes into class with self-deprecating music, movies, stories, etc. to try and liven up class. And he's actually pretty darn good at explaining things.As for the material, it's almost exactly the same as what you learn in intro macro. So if you're looking for a new, informative experience, this isn't for you. That said, most people take this because it's required for the major, and it's actually a pretty good recap of some important concepts. And Professor Nordhaus does a great job of bringing relevant current events into the fold.The workload is pretty easy. A midterm, a final, weekly problem sets and a joke of a paper. The exams are pretty easy--I aced them with a day of studying each. The problem sets aren't too bad. There's only 4 graded ones, and they don't take more than 2 hours apiece. The paper literally took me 90 minutes, although everyone freaked out about it. Don't freak out! It's only 10% of your final grade and everyone gets an A.My recommendation for the best way to approach the course is to prioritize the readings. Pretty much everything in the exams is in the textbook, and it explains the concepts well. Definitely do the readings. But only the textbook readings--the supplemental readings are useless and don't show up on either exam. Try to make it to all the classes--he does a good job of highlighting what he thinks is important for the exam. Finally, give each of the 4 graded Psets like 2 hours each and spend a full day on each exam and you should be good.This is a good class! Take it! Professor Nordhaus is the best!",
    "You have to take it, so take it. This is the best core Econ class at Yale -- you will probably find yourself enjoying it, maybe the only core lecture you will actually enjoy. Nordhaus is the best so definitely take it with him. The curve can be tough, though, so make sure you are on top of everything.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "it's a requirement.. it's probably best to take it with prof. nordhaus.. 8 psets, 4 graded and 4 ungraded.. there's a paper and i wasn't really sure what was expected of it",
    "Econ 122 provides a base to understand all important economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, gdp, etc. and how they are related to each other. A great class to take if you are interested in pursuing a financial career.",
    "The class pretty much covers much of macroeconomics that's important especially for understanding today's current economic conditions and recovery from the crisis. So the class is helpful for helping to understand current events, especially as you do the paper and do research on articles on your own. The class is not too different from introductory macroeconomics, just goes slightly more in-depth on some principles and presents a few new things. I almost think it's possible to take this course without having taking introductory macro first.I guess I would recommend the class to another student since the material does help you understand more about current events and how a lot of the world around us operates economically. The material's not too tough and makes sense if you really read the book and ponder the concepts some; getting the whole big picture is harder though.",
    "It is imperative to keep up with readings, do problem sets on your own and stay awake in class. Dont think that you can cram for the exams because even though the Mid term is not too difficult, the final is rather massive and expects you to have a thorough understanding of all the models and the concepts taught throughout. You need to have all the concepts down really well otherwise the final will not be a pleasant experience.",
    "Pretty good course. A lot better than intro macro.",
    "If you're reading this, then you probably have to take it since you're an econ major. It's better to take it with Nordhaus than any other professors (if you can get into his class - he capped it at 120). If you're not an econ major, I think this class could be interesting for you as well. Nordhaus always ties lectures to current events, and I think the course helps people to understand the way the economy works on a bit deeper level than you'd have in intro macro."
