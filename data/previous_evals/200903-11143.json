    "This course is essentially a faculty-organized and supported study group for one of the Ancient Christianity and New Testament doctoral comprehensive exams. As such, it offers tremendous support for students in the doctoral program and offers a good introduction to the material at a serious level.",
    "Of course I would recommend it.",
    "RLST655 is a very helpful seminar for those doing doctoral work in the field of Ancient Christianity or an adjacent field. It helps train students to do serious research and to cover a great breadth of material in a short amount of time. It is not recommended for someone who does not wish to do research or become a specialist in this field."

   "comments": [
    "I would have learnt more if their had been more faculty oversight of the pedagogical strategies of the students in the course. Reports gradually became more and more bloated and therefore less and less useful as the course wore on. Presentations were of substantially different levels of usefulness, due to substantially different pedagogical strategies employed. Teach us to teach and we'll do better teaching each other in this course!",
    "How *didn't* this course deepen my knowledge of my discipline\/profession or contribute to my research?",
    "This course taught me how to wade through a large amount of scholarship in an efficient and timely manner. This, even more than the content (which was also very helpful as it provided an overview of what is known and studied in the field of Ancient Christianity) was the most valuable lesson of the course."
