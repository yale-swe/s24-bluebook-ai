    "Yes, I learned a lot and it was worth it, but it was time-consuming. The language will be helpful in the future due to its widespread use in this world.",
    "I would not recommended the class to other students unless they were required to take it and had their mind set on spanish.",
    "Yes. I love spanish so I'm quite biased but the professors in our spanish department seem to be very strong so I believe most people will have a good experience in the end."
