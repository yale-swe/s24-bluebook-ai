   "comments": [
    "The class is very discussion based and teaches you all about ancient Roman society through a lot of reading, It isn't too much work other than the reading, and its very interesting. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I 100% would recommend this class to any fellow student because of the professor's vast knowledge on the subject and the interesting subject matter.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who wants a basic understanding of western cannon. It is important to understand many of these ancient Greek and Roman works, because there are so many modern allusions to them.",
    "In this class, you'll get assigned a lot of reading, but it's not like you'll be asked to memorize anything so you don't need to know everything; all you need is the general idea. We had two small papers and one long paper, all of which Professor Freudenburg helped out with greatly. He has such a knowledge of the subject that it is incredibly interesting to have discussions in class or to meet with outside of class to discuss paper topics."
