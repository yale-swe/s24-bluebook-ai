   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're at all interested in the material. At least shop it--Shannon had me convinced after one lecture that it was important for me to learn this stuff.",
    "Sure, take it. You get to know some great thinkers, and Shannon is a great lecturer.",
    "A great, fun class for anyone who's at all interested in religion, regardless of how much knowledge they come in with. Shannon is an awesome professor.",
    "I took the class to fulfill my HU distributional credit. Its not an easy class- plenty of reading, and also a lot of DS'ers took the class making the expectation for essays a lot higher than usual. All in all though, I'm really glad I took theclass, as the interplay between reason and faith is always something that stimulates great discussion, and taking the class will guide you to read some of the most brilliant authors in history on the subject matter. not taking part II, however.",
    "This is a really great class. I think it helps--but is not at all necessary--to come in with some previous knowledge of Christianity and the authors. Having read many of the authors (Locke, Kant, Pascal, etc) in a political philosophy context, it was really interesting seeing them in this context and comparing the two. The readings are all great, and there's not too much reading (a bit dense, but Professor Craigo-Snell does a great job of explaining the readings in class--she really makes the class). 2 papers, a take-home final and midterm--all straightforward and graded fairly. Take this class--it taught me just how influential these authors were on shaping modern Christianity and modern society.",
    "The course material is fairly interesting. It is almost exclusively about reason and Christianity gets put on the back burner in most of the authors' writings. If I were to choose again, I likely would have chosen to take the second half of this course instead with more modern writers instead of the classics.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Even if you don't care about Christian Theology, this class will really make you think. The lectures were endlessly interesting. In terms of structure, the class is really straightforward. It's broken into 4 sections of authors, and at the end of each set, there is an assignment that pertains only to those authors. great class!",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a great way to read a lot of famous writers even if we dont read all of their most famous works. Also, if you have never taken a religion class, theological arguments are very different and unique from other kinds of thinking I have been exposed to and it is really fun to learn how to make and read these types of arguments. I am glad I took this course.",
    "You have to take this class! It's relevant for both Christians and non-Christians. As a Christian, I found that the texts and the discussions they produced about the roles of reason, faith, and feeling in religion prompted me to examine my own beliefs. Professor Craigo-Snell is a wonderful lecturer. I never found myself losing attention, since she's always talking about something interesting.Do know, though, that the midterm and final are actually papers indisguise. As a person who hates writing papers, I was a little miffed to find that this class actually requires four papers, not two. That said, they aren't very long.",
    "Good class. a subject matter I never thought id find interesting, but it was fascinating and it felt more close to home than I had anticipated.",
    "Reading very smart people and realizing that most of what you thought about religion and Christianity was just a cultural assumption. Kind of mind blowing. I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in Christianity or in religion or in living in a Christian dominated place.",
    "This class offers an opportunity to read of the greatest minds of the early modern period. The material you read by these authors is focused in the context of Christian thought, which is fascinating. If you have an interest in reading these authors, especially about their theologies, definitely take this class.",
    "Fairly solid course, you can get by without doing a lot of the reading. Not super challenging sometimes, other times randomly really hard. I'd recommend it half-heartedly. Just really look at the syllabus beforehand and try not to skip lecture since the midterm and final are basically just word-vomiting lectures.",
    "I would recommend it, as long one was interested in the subject, and could have a little patience when the professors wanders and becomes confusing and could deal with the random section on feminism and the treatment of women. But the material itself is pretty fascinating.",
    "I'm not a Christian, but am glad I took this class. Some of the writers are frustrating in their lapses from reality (Jonathan Edwards etc.), but the quality of most of the thought is stellar and inspiring. It's an impossible amount of reading, and I wish I'd had time to get through all of it -- but definitely worth taking, with the caveat that the grading can be harsh.",
    "This is an absolutely excellent class. I really enjoyed it; Shannon is a phenomenal lecturer, and the texts are really interesting on their own merit. Seeing the train of thought and the intertexuality moving fromDescartes to Kant to Schleiermacher is a very useful activity. I took this class with a background in the Western canon, and I found the texts to be amazing complements to what I read last year in DS philosophy and history and politics. Religion is a very important component of what these prolific authors wrote about, and it is often ignored.I am non-religious, and I was immensely glad that the material was very accessible to me, that important concepts were made very clear in lecture, and I found it immensely gratifying to study Christianity even though I do not subscribe to it. At many points in the semester, I found my personal opinions and ideas about faith changing rapidly.Shannon is a great professor, and she even tries to remember all our names. The essays and assignments are pretty easy.One important note: the emphasis is on breath, not depth, so you might be disappointed if you wanted to do a close reading of any of these works.",
    "I would recommend it to people who know what they will be getting into. Expect an entertaining and informative lecture. But also expect a cultural perspective and the occasional feminist critique; this is not Descartes done through analytic philosophy and close-reading.",
    "THIS CLASS IS GREAT. A MUST TAKE BEFORE LEAVING YALE!!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, both to people who don't know much about intellectual history and are looking for an interesting class that will give them exposure to the work of some great thinkers of the early modern period, and to people to have studied the broader philosophical positions of thinkers like Locke, Hume, and Kant but want to read more from them and study in depth how they attempted to fit the Christian religion into their worldviews. Professor Craigo-Snell is a great lecturer, and this course covers the early modern period from an angle that no other Yale offering does; I think anyone remotely interested in the subject matter would get something out of it.",
    "of course. take it it's amazing and has a brilliant professor",
    "Religious Studies 163 is not your average theology class. Rather, the course takes you through the early modern period, starting with Descartes and finishing a little bit after Kant, and examines their work from a religious, social, and philosophical perspective. Shannon is an amazing lecturer, and the books you read are some of the fundamentals of modern thought. This class will blow your mind on a daily basis; if you're even remotely curious about Christianity in the context of philosophy, take this class.",
    "Definitely take this course if you have an interest in philosophy or theology. The theme of \u0093reason, faith, feeling\u0094 is more interesting in the beginning though and gets a bit repetitive towards the end. Overall, the readings are long and hard to understand, but Prof. Craigo-Snell is a great lecturer who can honestly change the way you view religion."
