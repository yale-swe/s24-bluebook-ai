    "Sometimes a bit abstract, but if you go to the classes and sections, you'll learn a lot.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the mathematical aspects of finance. If you want some intro to investing in the market, this class is not right for you. It is essentially a math class. I would recommend it because it teaches useful and new things.",
    "If you don't mind the morning lectures, it is a great course.",
    "The material is extremely interesting and will surely pop up again, if not when you're actually working in finance, then definitely in other finance courses you take. The class is highly technical and abstract, which makes the problem sets extremely challenging. Nevertheless, the exams are very fair and the practice material provided is extremely helpful. Take it for the knowledge, not the grade. And don't just rely on the online recordings as there has been a lot of re-arranging and other changes recently.",
    "For non-economics majors, don't worry, you absolutely do not need any prior economics classes to take this class - despite what many may say. For people who are adverse to any form of mathematics and quantitative analysis, this class is definitely not for you - you might want to consider ECON 252 instead, it is a lot more qualitative. Absolutely a must take if you're anyhow interested in finance. Some parts of the course didn't really interest me that much (Social Security, Overlapping Generation Models), and others were maybe a little too theoretical - but aside from that, it is a very well taught class with awesome teaching fellows (at least for my year).",
    "A lot of material packed into not very much time. Useful and interesting if you're dedicated to learning about finance...probably won't look good if you're applying to finance jobs and have a bad grade in this class (something to keep in mind)",
    "Its a math course in the disguise of a finance class -- not recommended except for math related majors...",
    "I liked this class. If you're a quantitative thinker, it's a good way to learn the theory behind finance. Sometimes Prof G. raced through the material in class, but the problem sets were a good way to learn it. Samson was my TA and he was great, but he's graduating so you won't be able to have him next year. The problem sets weren't too arduous especially if you worked with other people. This year, the first midterm was pretty easy (you needed about a 90% to get an A) and the second was more difficult, especially because of the time constraints (you needed mid 80s to get an A). The final was straightforward aside from one of the problems. The problem sets were graded out of 3, and you could make a small number of mistakes and still get a 3. I would recommend this class, as it's a good way to learn about the concepts of hedging\/equilibria. It probably won't be useful if you want to do IBD but if you're interested in something that's more markets oriented, the concepts might be relevant even if you don't learn the tools to develop realistic pricing models. Take it if you can! You don't need an economics background, though intermediate micro would probably be useful for general equilibrium.",
    "This class is the best class I've ever taken at Yale - in terms of teaching quality, organization and structure. Professor G is very, very smart and very, very passionate about the topic and this was reflected in the way he taught the class. Exams were incredibly fair, he only asked questions very similar to the psets. We took an exam right before the course drop deadline and he made sure that we got our results back in time (unlike so many other professors). For the final exam he gave us the extra 30 minutes (as stipulated by the Yale College regulations) without us even asking for it, which is great - no other professor at Yale has done that for a class I was in - and I'm an incoming senior. I absolutely recommend this class and I hope that Professor G will keep teaching it because he's AWESOME at was he's doing.",
    "I am an econ major that had never taken a finance course before, and the course is what it says it is: a math-based introduction to financial theory. As Professor Geanakoplos was fond of saying in class, the other finance course Yale offers (taught by Professor Shiller) is more about institutions and the (often irrational) behavior of investors, while this class is very much about solving problems and coming up with a numerical solution to them. However, Professor Geanakoplos also provides context for how the theories discussed in the course evolved over time, which is cool, and he often talks about how his personal experience working at two hedge funds influenced his ideas as an academic\/mathematical economist about how financial markets work. If you don't mind a lot of problem-solving (the math required is not difficult; no calculus) and particularly if you enjoyed intermediate micro or are curious about finance, this might be the course for you! Also, the TAs were very helpful for bridging the gap between the material discussed in lecture, which often included a lot of theory, and the material tested on problem sets and exams, which was concrete problems. There is a second midterm in the last week of classes, which can be daunting, but honestly I think it helped me study for the final.",
    "Not really that hard, and not *too* much work. This is one of those few Econ classes that don't throw curveballs at you. There are certain types of problems that will show up on the exam, and lo and behold, they show up on the problem sets (and on the numerous past exams Johnny G makes available). Johnny G isn't the best lecturer (or chalkboard user), but whatevs. Just know how to do those problems that show up over and over again and you'll be good. Plus, the curve's one of the nicer ones that I've seen in Econ.",
    "An econ class worth taking. It was a pretty interesting, yet tough course on classical finance. I was expecting a lot more out of this class, but I'm still glad I took it. Problem sets are definitely tough, but thankfully Samson (aka the greatest teaching fellow of all time [no, seriously]) made the material abundantly clear in section. Take it if you like math, actually enjoy learning about finance, and want to hear John G's arrogant, yet witty, sense of humor.",
    "Hard but rewarding",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! While you don't need it to go into finance, it was a solid introduction to bond\/asset pricing, net present value, and mortgage valuations. Check out the Open Yale Course if you wanna get a sense of the professor's lecturing style.",
    "This is a tough class. The problem sets take awhile unless you have an amazing TA. Lecture is somewhat irrelevant to the problem sets. The exams, while straightforward, are difficult because there are a lot of concepts\/math. Good econ curve. But overall, not as practical as I thought, but still a good class to get through and take. Also John is an interesting lecturer.",
    "Solid course as an intro to finance. John G is a good professor, who is very knowledgeable and entertaining (good for a 9am lecture). The class is based off math, which is good compared with some of the more touchy feely econ classes out there. Problem sets are time consuming but really help in getting ready for exams. Two midterms and one final, which are pretty fair, if not also difficult.",
    "Fair class. Problem sets are pretty long and tough but the TF sessions are a lot of help. The tests are also extremely long, but there is a curve. I found the final quite difficult and lengthy. 9 AM is pretty tough, but the class is on open courses so you can just watch lectures online, or honestly, not even do that, just study the old practice midterms\/finals that are posted, that's probably the most time efficient thing to do.",
    "Solid class, learn a ton of useful material + not so useful market equilibrium models. It gets overwhelming sometimes (long psets)... Credit D it!",
    "It's a difficult class not because the concepts are necessarily difficult, but because lectures are often disappointingly unclear. You have to do a lot of learning outside of the classroom. Exams can have a few tricky questions--make sure to read the posted lecture notes--but they mostly resemble problem sets. If you work hard, a decent grade is possible.",
    "I learned a lot in this class, though the lectures were subpar. I give it a lukewarm recommendation, but only to people who are willing to put in the effort. This is a great class to Credit\/D though because no one gets a D.",
    "This class covers some interesting (and fairly useful) material: general equilibrium, present value, interest rates, zero and coupon bonds, capital asset pricing model, options pricing, and mortgage prepayment. However, the lecture quality was seriously lacking. Prof. Geanakoplos appears to have a hard time relating to students, and it often seems like he's talking more to himself than to the class. It was easy to lose focus, and then to just stop coming to class. However, sections were very helpful for doing the problem sets, which were good preparation for the exams. Also, the tests are very similar from year to year, so do the practice tests that are posted before each exam.",
    "Financial Theory builds up from micro-foundations to the topics listed in the syllabus. If you are interesting in finance, take the course. If you are not interested in a job in finance, but want to learn about how it works and why it is important, take this class. If neither of those applies to you, avoid this course.",
    "Not as obviously applicable to investment banking as I was hoping. Lectures were hard to follow and I had to do a lot of work outside of class teaching myself the material. Pretty frustrating all year. Curve is helpful but I still felt like I was playing catch up all semester.",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking to learn more about finance. It is math intensive though.",
    "Great course! The theory taught is fascinating to the core. The class teaches finance within the framework of economic theory. It has tons of math \u2013 you\u2019re always dealing with formulae, equations, calculations \u2013 numbers left right and center. Problem sets are really difficult \u2013 go to section! Exams are like problem sets, with a few additional conceptual questions her and there that can stump you. They come with a massive time crunch, so be ready! Also, beware of the highly experienced students that tend to take this class \u2013 they know finance, and are great at it \u2013 so this can be intimidating (and a bit annoying). Overall, a difficult but rewarding experience.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Geanakoplos is a genius and will probably win a Nobel Prize some day, so it is amazing to learn from someone that smart. He has the perfect background to teach this course since he is an academic as well as a very successful Wall Street hedge fund manager. The class is pretty difficult but in my opinion well worth it: you learn so much and come out of it with a much better understanding of the financial \"world,\" since you are now able to understand some of the financial economic literature and solve relevant real-world mathematical finance problems.",
    "This class can get very overwhelming. The material isn't always difficult (sometimes it is), but it is very easy to fall behind. Exams are hard, and later problem sets are hard.",
    "It is very high pace course. Only take it if you are interested in working in the financial world after college.",
    "Difficult, but a good challenge if you are up to it.",
    "Take it for a very basic understanding of finance.",
    "Pretty good course. Fair midterms and psets. The curve ends up being really generous since so many people drop or take it cred\/d. Almost guaranteed at least a B+ but getting an A is obviously competitive. Prof. Geanakoplos is an interesting character with lots of engaging stories but can get too off tangent in lecture. For those interested in using this course for business: -personally, I think this material had a more narrow subject matter than I expected. It is more useful for investment management or strategies in PE or HF. -I think I got a better understanding of general and applicable concepts through financial accounting. -I would also suggest corporate finance at SOM if you want to go into investment banking.",
    "Would definitely recommend it!",
    "I took this class expecting to learn a little about the finance world and the class met my expectations. I got to learn a lot about financial models. Overall, I'm glad to have taken this class even though I'm not an Econ major. The class can be quite a bit of work with weekly problem sets, two midterms and a final. However, it's not as difficult as people make it sound. It would be difficult to get a solid A but you can get away with an A- with a moderate amount of effort.",
    "As it sounds a class in finance. Covers a lot from stocks, bonds, derivatives, mortgages and more. For a person interested in a career in finance I believe it is a necessity to talk this course.",
    "It was a good class, but at a very challenging pace. I think that Professor G could have explained the topics a little more carefully and provided more guidance for the problem sets.",
    "Yes. A solid introduction to the theories and philosophies behind finance, which could be useful for anyone who wants to understand his personal finances and accounting better, as well as for more hard-core economics majors.",
    "Learned a lot in the class, going to section really helped. Tests are really long",
    "This isn't a course about finance, but some of the material is quite interesting. I took it Credit\/D\/Fail, and it wasn't too much work."
