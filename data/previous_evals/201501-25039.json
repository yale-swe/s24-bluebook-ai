    "I would not recommend this course unless you enjoy very theoretical political science and are very interested in India specifically. That said, it is nice to have a lecture course with low enrollment that functions as a quasi-seminar, like this one did.",
    "If you're really interested in and knowledgable about internal Indian politics, this might be a good course for you. Otherwise, maybe you shop around for something else.",
    "I do not recommend this course. I could see how Professor Devasher would be a good professor of a class about the Indian electoral system, but she doesn't know enough about Comparative Ethnic Politics to teach a lecture course on it. This class had a lot of potential but is not worth your time unless it gets seriously restructured."
