    "This is a great class! Take it if you're interested in learning about modern dance and in practicing something totally new& different!",
    "Take it!!! You will become so savvy in talking about dance and performance art, and Irene is really involved in these worlds. The things Irene notices and points out are incredibly incisive, and this class will inform your approach to art, your body, and ideas. So good!",
    "A dance\/theory class focusing on Trisha Brown and contemporary dance artists.",
    "Theater Studies is an amazing course that everyone should take even if they do not consider themselves dancers, because it teaches you about your own body in relation to space as well as creation. Not only are the readings interesting and complex, but they provide you with entirely new outlooks on performance art and the meaning of art in general.",
    "Work with Irene. She is so much fun, and really takes the time to look at you and give you corrections. Also, learning trisha's material is awesome."
