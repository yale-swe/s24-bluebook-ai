    "Absolutely, this is the most interesting course I've taken at Yale. Alex is a great lecturer. Highly recommend.",
    "YES!!! This class was fantastic. I learned a lot about the theory and case studies surrounding the field of nuclear politics, which was great. (If you actually want to learn about nuclear politics, take this class, not Dilemmas).Strengths: very structured syllabus, interesting topics and readings. The reading responses really helped digest the material before class, which was great. Standard workload: 5 reading responses, midterm, short group paper, final. TAKE TAKE TAKE!! You will learn so much.",
    "YES!!!!!!!! Prof. Debs is wonderful--clear lear, objective, thorough, patient, understanding, fair, chill, and passionate about his work.Discussion is chill. Subject matter is fascinating. Readings are long, but you don't have to do it all every time since some people are assigned to write about the reading each class. Grading is fair. Lectures are clear. PowerPoints are very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in how state-state interactions are altered by nuclear weapons, or to any student interested in state-state conflict in general.",
    "This is a good course - it has interesting readings and the lectures are good. Also not that much work",
    "The course was very interesting, covering a wide range of topics associated with nuclear politics. I would highly recommend the course.",
    "The course was fantastic! I was looking for a class dedicated to nuclear weapons and their effect on international relations and policy decisions as well astheir history and this class delivered exactly what I wanted. I enjoyed the reading, I learned a lot and I feel much more knowledgeable about nuclear policy now. I thought the class was well structured, the readings were relevant and interesting and the tests were at a fair level of difficulty."
