    "The course material was very good, but unfortunately, a three hour lecture with a monotonous professor is never a good idea. It's hard to keep focused in class. The PPTs are very detailed and the professor basically reads of the PPT. So I had no motivation to listen in class and ended up reading the PPT quickly after class.",
    "Question 9 - The instructor was extremely responsive when questions were asked, but often times the lectures proceeded without enough time for student questions and interaction. It would be great to structure more question and interaction time into the lecture period.",
    "This course is very important for any students who are interested in studying energy at FES. I think the school is really lacking in energy-focused courses and it would be a shame if this class (or something similar to it) were not longer offered in the future. That being said, the course could be designed to be a little more engaging. I found it difficult to fully pay attention to the powerpoint slides during a 3 hour lecture, especially since there were no exams that covered the material."

   "comments": [
    "The material covered The group project The case study",
    "Unlike most other F&ES classes on energy that give a broad and shallow overview of everything, this class dig deeper into the utility sector and gives students solid understanding on one topic. I believe this kind of class better prepare students for the job market than those overview classes.",
    "Professor Reilly brings a lot of great knowledge to the class.",
    "Learning about the business aspects from the perspective of electric utilities was very valuable. As someone in the land use\/sustainable development regulatory field, it helps to learn more about how the electric industry operates so that local regulations\/incentives can be developed that are beneficial to consumers as well as utilities.",
    "Very unique and valuable opportunity to learn about the practical level of an important subject from a practitioner with a wealth of experience. Instructor is great - very kind and knowledgeable and open. Some of the guest lectures were also great. And the field trip to ISONE was outstanding.",
    "Thorough overview of the electric utility sector. I now feel I have a comprehensive understanding of this material.",
    "The overall topic- utilities are so important to the energy sector but not often studied",
    "The content is very important for anyone interested in the energy industry.",
    "I thought the class provided a very comprehensive look at utilities. Somethings i think class was a bit slow but overall I really enjoyed the class and the material.",
    "Thorough explanation of electric utility issues by someone with very deep experience in the space"

   "comments": [
    "Lecture and homework assignment on rate base focus too much on the details of rate base composition that most students don't have any interest in or is likely to be useful in the future.",
    "While the material is dense by nature, the lecture style sometimes makes it hard to pay attention. I would advise more interaction with the students (Q&A, exercises) to break up with is a long class during a rough time of day.",
    "As someone without a business background, I didn't realize how business and math-heavy the course would be until it was too late to drop it. I really struggled with working with excel spreadsheets, and I honestly would have been totally lost on the group business presentation we had to do at the end if some of my group members hadn't been joint business students who knew how to do financial modeling. I would recommend making it more clear right from the first day that a business background, or at the very least proficiency in excel, is required to do well in the class. The fact that the class was so business\/ numbers-based is not a shortcoming of the class itself, but I think it was my own personal shortcoming- I didn't have the skills required to do very well in the class. I feel like I learned a lot and came a very long way over the course of the semester, but if I had known what I was in for I likely (in all honesty) wouldn't have taken the class.",
    "More time for student questions, discussion, and interaction during class.",
    "Sometimes the lectures felt monotonous. May be a good idea to ban lap tops so students are more engaged.",
    "Instructor presentation style. Lots of reading from power points, which is too much monotony for a 3-hr evening course. Some seminar-style class discussions would be good- need to get students more engaged. Perhaps students could lead discussions on utility current events each week for an hour.",
    "More engaging lectures (less reading from the slides)",
    "2 things: sometimes i wish there were more discussion. It was have been nice to have some debates, given how dynamic the jndustry is. For instancd, we wrote policy memos on arizona's potential deregulation. It would have been nice to explore that further by discussing what we wrote and why. The speakers also could have improved. The enernoc guy was the best and very interesting, the guy who helped run connecticuts microgrid program was not good at all.",
    "Maybe bring free coffee, instructor's low-key delivery combined with time of day sometimes made staying alert difficult"

    "Yes, but the utility case study could have been more analytical - it was great to do a deep dive on a particular utility, but felt like a book report without a great deal of opportunity to assess and explore the topics covered in class. Perhaps consider having it focus on a few aspects of the utility and then an analysis of how they are managing the transition.",

I don't know how to do a financial model, or even really work in Excel (I've never taken even a basic busines class before), and my classmates blew me away with their prior experience and knowledge and how they channeled that to help create an amazing group project.",
