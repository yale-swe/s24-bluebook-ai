    "I developed a basic understanding of Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and culture though this class, all information which I did not know before taking the course. I learned skills in speaking, listening, reading, and writing.",
    "Reading, speaking, listening, and writing in Spanish can be improved very effectively as a beginner's course",
    "I learned introductory Spanish. Developed my language learning ability.",
    "Rudimentary knowledge of the Spanish language and how to speak and read it.",
    "Alongside learning vocabulary and grammatical rules of Spanish, I learned how to utilize what I learned in conversation with my professor and with my classmates.",
    "The course helped me to develop basic knowledge of speaking, reading, listening, and writing Spanish, with the strongest area being reading. Reading the short novel was a great and fun learning experience and I recommend the course to keep doing it.",
    "A good understanding of basic Spanish, grammar, conversation etc",

   "comments": [
    "The only weakness I can think of is the lack of preparation for the listening exam. We did one listening exercise at the end of each chapter but the final was much more difficult than any of the practice ones. I wish there were more listening exercises during class.",
    "The class does an excellent job of teaching students the basics of Spanish. The class moves extremely quickly and the supersite homeworks are extremely picky with the answers which makes it hard to complete the homework accurately.",
    "Strengths were the practice in grammar and reading. Weaknesses were the lack of preparation in listening and speaking Spanish.",
    "I think the course efficiently taught students through the use of countless resources besides the textbook. Additionally I enjoyed how professor Valle stressed the importance of only speaking Spanish in class. I think the grading rubric could be a little more lenient especially since its a L1 course.",
    "I think the Supersite homework could be more evenly spaced. I would also like in class discussions with regard to some of the Supersite videos.",
    "Inconsistent homework- some nights barely any and some had hours of work",
    "I think its strength was the Professors attentiveness and ability to engage all students. The weaknesses came from the fact that tests were graded based on what you didnt know vs what you do know.",
    "it was really well organised and well taught. however sometime the learning from the website was too much"

    "Yes. It was a very enjoyable course with a great professor and I feel as if I've learned a lot.",
    "Yes I would. I think this course has greatly prepared me for L2.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they are a keen language learner. It could be a very hard course for someone where learning a language is not their strength.",
    "The grading seemed to be a bit biased",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes",
    "Id recommend this course to a student who wanted to learn Spanish and was ready for a lot of work.",
    "yes if you want a basic knowledge of spanish that is taught in an effective way."
