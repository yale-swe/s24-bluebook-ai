    "Any course taught by Professor Sullivan is a worthwhile endeavor. He is well spoken, thoughtful and measured. Simple observation of his teaching method is a lesson enough in itself. And yet there is so much more that he brings - experience, insight and a knack for picking the most inflective facts. Take this course.",
    "Take it. The best course on U.S. foreign policy currently being offered at Yale.",
    "For those who are interested in foreign policy, this class would help you to develop your insight more deeply.",
    "A course that explores the most relevant issues in international relations and the United States' role in shaping the future of the international order."

    "This course is directly relevant to my coursework and future profession as an IR instructor. It complemented my other courses very well - I was able to use concepts and ideas from another course in my final paper. The ability to explore these concepts from a different perspective in another course reinforced what I learned and will benefit my future students."
