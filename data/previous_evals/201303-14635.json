    "I'd say take it. This class is a solid introduction to multivariable calculus. Yen Do is an okay professor, not terrible but nothing special. Watch out though, he tends to fall behind schedule which makes it hard to do the problem sets sometimes. I enjoyed doing the problem sets, they weren't too bad. Pretty standard overall, but don't let that stop you from taking it. I have a really solid grasp of this math now.",
    "The material is fine, but the exams are very hard. Take it if you have to, not because you want to.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student if only he\/she was absolutely sure he\/she could handle it. Multivariable differs greatly from materials learned in AP Calc AB\/BC. Think carefully before you take it.",
    "I would recommend the course, but only to a person with some experience or interest in mathematics. I do not feel like this course is for someone just trying to satisfy a QR credit."
