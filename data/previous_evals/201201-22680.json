   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload was light but interesting and the subject matter engaging. The point of the class is to figure out how to interpret evidence and what type of evidence we use to make judgments. As such, it is not a class heavy on learning facts and information, but more a class centered on interpretation and critical thinking. Also, Thompson's book is really fun to read.",
    "THE SINGLE BEST IN-CLASS EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD AT YALE. Really mind-blowing stuff. Sometimes it felt like the class was still struggling to define itself. We actually had one assignment where we had to come up with, and justify, some alternate title for the course. Mine was \"Ascertaining and Representing Truth\". This class is basically all about how people try to figure out the truth, how they try to represent the truth as they see it, how they try to appropriate other people's versions of the truth, how their perspective and enthusiasms limit or enhance their ability to determine the truth, etc. In other words, general meta interdisciplinary humanities awesomeness. TAKE IT! GENONI AND THOMPSON ARE ROCKSTARS AND YOU GET TO HANG OUT WITH BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME. Also, I don't know if it will be the same your year, but I just LOVED my classmates. Really insightful, hardworking, surprisingly diverse group of people.",
    "This class isn't really well-focused on any one topic. I came out of it with some new opinions about different things, but no radically transformed view on evidence in particular. However, I would still recommend the course, and here's why: even though it's a bit disorganized, you get two great professors talking about their favorite things every week. In this class, I learned why the David is beautiful, how to think about architecture, and got a fascinating new perspective on Plato. And the other students are truly fantastic. If you're a humanities major, you should take this. Not a lot of work, but a whole lot of good clean humanistic fun.",
    "The seminar is an exploration of inquiry in the humanities when faced with incomplete evidence. You examine what constitutes evidence, how that evidence can be evaluated, and how in doing so you can draw meaningful conclusions.I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It will catch you off guard with how enjoyable it is. And all the while being extremely challenging. It was one of the tougher courses I've taken here.",
    "HUMS 309 really does belong under the \"Humanities\" heading. It covers a broad range of subjects and does a good job at providing satisfying analysis in the limited time that it has. I'd recommend it to anybody who would like to have two great professors show them the importance and meaning of the liberal arts.",
    "Sometimes a bit amorphous, but generally interesting. Good stuff to have read\/know.",
    "I would recommend HUMS 309 to friends who are interested in learning skills related to doing actual work as a researcher of arts or humanities. The class is not about opinions or philosophy as much as it is finding useful information and evidence.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student in any field, as the skills that it teaches - namely, the tools to interpreting evidence - are relevant not just to the humanities. This is both an art history and a literary analysis course, rich with variety. If you are looking for a class that enables lively and absorbing discussions, this is a class for you. If you are shy speaking up in class now, you won't be by the end of this course.",
    "An interesting course about the ways in which humans make judgements. I would absolutely recommend this course."
