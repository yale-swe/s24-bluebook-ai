   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course. It was one of the best courses I've taken in the graduate school so far. Both professors clearly cared for their students and were prepared to put in a lot of effort in aid of the learning process. The structure of the course was very helpful - namely, spending the first-half of the semester reviewing theory, so we knew what was going on, and the second half of the semester applying the theory to analyze papers. The theory section was taught very well and in a very intuitive manner. In the second half of the course, we read a lot of interesting papers and really achieved an understanding of where current research was at.",
    "It is a great course",
    "Trade I covers all the relevant theory of current trade literature and teaches you also how to bring the theory to the data. If you are interested in trade - this is your course.",
    "A must for a student interested in international trade -from both from the theoretical and empirical perspective"

   "comments": [
    "It gave me a very good foundation for international trade theory in the first half. In the second half, I was able to learn where the current literature is at. I now know a lot more about international trade than when I started the class and I feel adequately prepared to tackle higher level research. Overall, a very informative class.",
