   "comments": [
    "I learned about many topics involving technology law.",
    "Laws Codes Norms. You don't learn any skills perse but your insight expands like none other.",
    "I learned a lot about fields of law which I knew nothing about, but have very real world consequences. I never knew about what copyright really was, the implications of net neutrality, or what privacy really looks like in the digital area. I began to learn how to issue spot and write legal papers.",
    "more about the law and how it works, what currently works and what doesnt work about our legal system in the context of new technology, how to think about controversial news relating to court cases",
    "This class changed my perspective on the Internet and the future of the Internet.",
    "Challenging thought, some legal frameworks for privacy and copyright.",
    "I learned a lot about many interesting legal and normative issues that arise from technology (fair use doctrine, privacy, censorship, anonymity\/behavior online, circumvention, etc.).",
    "I learned a lot about law as it relates to computers in really interesting and fun ways.",
    "It is a good course however it sometimes turns into an unproductive class. But the topics are interesting.",
    "Legal gray areas in technology, e.g. \"can they do that? Yes they can, even though it morally\/socially feels wrong\"",
    "This course is a great intro to law course in many ways! Check the course website (google Yale Law Tech) for past syllabi that will give you an idea of what is covered. The course gives you the tools to approach many issues of law in a more sophisticated manner. Brad is also not afraid to argue with you, so it hones your logical and speaking skills if you're brave enough to speak in class.",
    "I gained a better understanding of what it means to be a student here at Yale.",
    "I learned tons about how technological developments are pushing the boundaries of the law. For someone who knew very little about legal matters this class was a great introduction.",
    "How to read and interpret supreme court cases.",
    "This class really helped me gain a better understanding of the world of copyright and the legal aspects of online culture. Amazing overall class, learned a lot about life and the world through Brad's lectures. This class extends past the idea of dry academia and instead seeks to engage students through their interests.",
    "I came into this course with absolutely no knowledge about computer science, and very little knowledge about how the American legal system worked. I came out of this course knowing how to analyze tech culture with our laws, and with more in-depth knowledge about current topics in tech culture. After taking this course, I will continuously question things about our tech world that I would have never even thought to question beforehand.",
    "Brad is a great prof and makes the class super interesting. With that said, this class isn't for everyone. There is actual work involved, not just cupcake eating (the take-home midterm is pretty long and thorough) but overall I greatly enjoyed this and I think it's not hard to do well if you put in a reasonable amount of effort to participate, stay up with the readings, etc.",
    "We learned about some of the existing topics in law surrounding technology and how new technology is affecting our culture. The class in general also just taught us to think critically about things and critique assumptions, including our own.",
    "I was able to gain a better understanding of how computer science and modern technologies interact with the law and society as a whole.",
    "We learned about important cases and some elements of copyright law, but it's hard to say what concrete things you learn. It is more a class that introduces you to how our law works and teaches you how to think like a lawyer.",
    "I learned how to do fair use analysis as well as an overall understanding of how we have made laws for the ever-changing field of technology.",
    "I learned a bit about the law and thought a lot about policy.",
    "A great class to make you think about standard drawing and statutory interpretation! Also a good review for reading case law and thinking about, for example, what a law or set of laws is intended to do (would recommend after Amar's Constitutional Law).",
    "More than most classes at Yale, this class teaches you things without you realizing it. Most of the classes were winding discussions and over-the-top demonstrations, which don't lend themselves readily to note-taking. But somehow you don't really need notes for this class. Do the readings and come to class, and the information just sinks in. I learned nuances in intellectual property law and fair use. I learned how internet, phone, and TV connections are maintained--and how to throttle speeds. I learned not only what the courts are saying about privacy, innovation, and new technologies, but what they are intentionally not saying (and what debates are still ocurring). And yes, I even learned a little computer science--with cupcakes! Although I admit I'm biased--I loved this class so much I started applying to jobs at companies focused on digital privacy and intellectual property.",
    "I learned a lot about copyright law and privacy law, especially in the context of new technology",
    "This is essentially an intro law class, albeit a rather unconventional one--we gained a basic understanding of copyright law, privacy, and various other concepts by reading cases, articles, think pieces, etc. This is not the kind of class where you come out on the other end with specific hard skills. Instead, you develop the requisite vocabulary and thought processes to begin to approach issues at the intersection of law and technology in an educated way (online data collection or internet hate speech, for example).",
    "I developed a wealth of insight into modern copyright law, foundational court cases with impacts in the internet era, and the meticulous mindset\/analytical methodology necessary for those in the field of law to possess.",
    "Gained exposure to a wide range of legal documents while learning how to read with a more critical eye.",
    "Insight into basics of how the legal system handles copyright and digital law.",
    "I learned a lot about copyright law, privacy, and how to read and interpret cases and laws.",
    "I think this class gave me a lot of tools to analyze and understand the ways in which our culture and society is changing.",
    "Alongside improving my analysis and critical thinking skills, this course has made me a more creative thinker. From reading responses to projects, the general guidelines for most assignments are \"do whatever you want and make it good.\" The course's free flowing and open nature pushed me to exercise the creative part of my brain. I am now better equipped to approach my other courses thanks to the skills gained form this class.",
    "We covered a wide range of 21st century \"Internet\" topics; the kind of things you would see in episodes of black mirror. Copyright, fair use, privacy, security, online harassment, remix culture, collaborative works... Everything is super interesting with great \"readings\" (many of which are videos)",
    "The class gives an interestingly presented overview of laws relating to technology, copyright, search and seizure, and other important issues.",
    "I learned a lot about the current controversies and debates surrounding the legal policies and culture that accompany the rapid technological development our world is experiencing. Through this course, I've learned how to analyze longstanding laws involving privacy and creative expression and interpret and dispute their legitimacy in light of today's current technological culture. Because of the way this class is organized, you learn a lot about current ongoing events about technology and law.",
    "Learned to think more critically regarding the law."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is taught in an exciting class environment. Sometimes it was less engaging, but overall a very fun learning experience.",
    "This course is only weak if you don't click with it.",
    "Brad is an incredible lecturer. I'd come from a class where I was basically falling asleep and then go to Brad's class and I'd be wide awake. He makes everything really engaging. There's a ton of reading, which is a struggle. I wish Brad touched a little more on the readings during class. It has also taken a long time to get any grades back, which has made it hard to know where I stand.",
    "Grading is very slow.",
    "While the material reviewed in the course is extremely interesting, covering topics not otherwise found in Yale courses, the level at which we engaged the material was completely inconsistent. During some lectures, I found myself really feeling as though I was learning valuable insights into 21st century technology law, and during others, I didn't learn anything that couldn't have been summarized in one or two quick sentences. This is entirely to do with the instructor.",
    "This course is extremely odd. It is a strong course which challenges how you think of the world and of law. I think criticizing any one part of the course would affect all other parts of the course. I think the best way to improve the course would be to make it smaller and post all the readings at the beginning of the semester. I would really like to have written a paper during this course because I wanted to engage with the cultural side of the course material more.",
    "The course finds its strength in its interesting issues and fun lectures. Its weakness is that the the grading is very slow--you don't know your midterm grade (from the beginning of November) until the end of the semester.",
    "Brad is amazing and makes the course fun. The course can't be improved.",
    "Strengths engages with real topics and really excites students. Weakness is when it becomes no longer about the material and just story telling.",
    "Applicable to daily life nowadays! Covered many broad and important topics. Explained how some things are the way they are now. Emphasized the importance of taking stances and participation in fixing or solidifying laws or interacting with government, at times.",
    "The reading list is great, though it could use some pruning (a ranking of importance of the readings for each night would be particularly useful). My favorite class discussions were ones where Brad advanced a particular thesis or idea while using students as springboards (and, of course, personal anecdotes). Some of the lectures felt a little unfocused\/got sidetracked, so I liked it when they were a little more tightly organized. The course would also improve if we didn't have to submit reading responses before the readings were discussed in class (i.e. have reading responses due Monday for either of the week prior's reading). I also felt pretty unprepared for the difficulty and scale of the midterm, despite doing most of the readings and showing up to class. The final project was a lot of fun, though, and is a good way to end the course.",
    "I don't know if it was the time this course was offered, the presence of high school students, or that I'm just a terrible person, but I always felt like this class was a battle where I was slipping out of engagement, only to be saved every so often by Brad because he's such a compelling guy. I've taken terrible (and terribly boring) classes here, and have had an easier time staying awake during them, so I always felt bad that this class was such a challenge.",
    "Brad is not only an incredibly entertaining professor but also cares tremendously about his class. The subject matter is really interesting and is likely stuff that you've never encountered before. Brad makes a great effort (and succeeds more often than not) at making sure everyone in this huge lecture is engaged, but I wonder if the class could benefit from shorter lectures and a discussion section?",
    "Brad is an amazing professor.This class's readings are unlike any other and actually engage you in the real world. Unfortunately, the grade return is pretty slow but I think if they have more TAs in the future that will make a big difference.",
    "The class needs more organization. I understand that the schedule\/syllabus is subject to change due to current events but a preliminary schedule or even having deadlines on the website would have been very welcome. Also, the TF's need to be more on top of their work and get assignments back to us on time so that we can actually improve upon them rather than continue to do them without any guidance. Strengths: I've learned so much in this course about copyright, fraud, search & seizure, etc. and it's been such an eye-opening experience.",
    "Brad should have a midterm date on the syllabus from the beginning. We did not know when the midterm would be until the week or two before. The midterm was extremely time intensive and I probably would not have taken this course if I had known that the midterm fell on the same date as two other big exams",
    "Honestly this class is super strong. Amazing lectures, very relevant course reading, and a solid work load. My only recommendation would be to get reading responses graded faster so students can get feedback as to what they can do better on the next one they write.",
    "This course is fun and relaxed, yet extremely educational and interesting. One thing that I think could be improved is the timeliness and the quality of feedback, both for the reading responses and for the midterm. I understand that for the midterm, it takes a while to grade over 100 long essays, but the reading responses are a different story - not every student turns in a reading response for each class, and there are multiple TAs who split the grading. It's difficult to evaluate your performance in the class or really discuss ideas in depth when it takes so long to receive grades and comments. Furthermore, the comments are sometimes only a single word or sentence instead of a full engagement with the ideas presented. It would be much more educational to have better comments on responses, especially since reading responses are the only handed-in assignments for most of the semester. Writing the responses and not receiving thought-provoking feedback makes writing them feel like talking to a wall - you respond to readings and offer your thoughts, but never hear anybody else respond. Another thing - I'm still not sure who some of the TAs are. They stood up during the first lecture, but after that, only a few of them were involved during class, and I forgot who the others were.",
    "Brad is an amazing professor, and the readings he assigns are very insightful and interesting. Class is a great supplement to the readings, especially when we watch related videos or look at related memes, which keeps us very engaged. The TAs and ULAs are all very interesting and engaging people. One weakness is that the lecture is not accompanied by section, so there's no formal discussion between students about the topics we learn in class. In addition, the class and group projects are a little disorganized.",
    "The content is super interesting, but the readings are super long and the take home misterm was quite hard. More information about the midterm should have been given earlier on. The TAs took too long to grade our reading responses.",
    "Being a lecture, I'm not sure how the class could be much improved.",
    "Brad. If you like Brad, you do well and get a lot. If not, nope.",
    "The strength is definitely in the lectures. Brad is extremely entertaining, and it is pretty much impossible to fall asleep in the class. You'll learn by watching youtube videos and internet memes through Brad yelling at you.",
    "I thought the group projects, albeit fun, were not an accurate assessment of what I learned in the class. The reading were posted too late for submitting a 4 page reading response. And some of the lectures were somewhat tangential. The strength of the course is Brad Rosen, who is as entertaining as he is effective. His teaching style is unique, but I found myself learning without even trying. The midterm was a great assignment. Long and arduous, but a great way of synthesizing what we learned.",
    "The fact that this course is run like a seminar is a strength and a weakness: if you're willing to participate you'll get more out and if you're not you'll get less. Brad is a strength: the single most engaging lecturer I've had at Yale. Reading responses are well designed, midterm is hard but fair, the two project opportunities give you lots of freedom to express yourself which is awesome.",
    "Brad's great! His lecturing style makes the content easy to remember, and he's a joy to talk to, too. I do wish there were more students taking this course for a letter grade, though, because it benefits a lot from student involvement in the course as a whole (i.e. going to dinners, talking with classmates, speaking in class, etc).",
    "Everyone's probably heard something about this class, so I'll keep this quick. If you enjoy Brad's teaching style, you will love this class. The material will stick with you. The classes will be fun. The projects will start new friendships. If you don't like Brad's teaching style, this class will drag on endlessly, and you'll feel like you're wasting your time. You get out what you put into the course, so if you're not trying to spend a lot of time in this class, you're gonna have a bad time.",
    "It is a very unusual classroom setting that doesn't work for everyone",
    "Strengths- excellent professor and content Weaknesses- sometimes got off track in class, with comments and questions from the class that derailed discussion",
    "He needs to be more organized with instructions.",
    "The main strengths of this class are its relevance to our lives and its ability to present complicated law concepts in a manageable and interesting way. It was also very engaging on the whole. The readings were consistently interesting, if long, and Brad always held attention in the classroom. It did, however, have several weaknesses. It took a very long time to get graded work back, and readings were often posted the day before class, making finishing them on time quite challenging. Class was sidetracked pretty frequently--this was a good thing most of the time, as it presented an opportunity to dive into interesting side issues, but sometimes we ended up wasting too much time on irrelevant topics. On the whole, I think this class could be improved by having better logistics.",
    "The course was both extremely informative and entertaining. Its strengths lie in Brad's ability to communicate a tremendous amount of legal knowledge in a very unique and palatable way, although its weaknesses--by the same token--might be considered as this very same teaching style not appealing to students who could otherwise benefit from the information offered.",
    "This class was my favorite this semester, and Brad is spectacular. My only comment would be that I think the grading system is strangely weighted, with the midterm, reading responses, final project, and class project all being weighted equally. I understand that Brad wants the grade to be based on participation and involvement rather than just reading comprehension, but it means that 50% of our grade is based on an less-objective participation scores for projects that are incompletely outlined. Specifically, I feel that the reading responses should be weighted more and the final (small group) project should be weighted less, or that the two should be combined in some manner. The reading responses still leave lots of room for unconventional participation that goes beyond the limits of standard response essays. Some of my favorite parts of the class were making unconventional reading responses (ex: video rather than essay) and I think that they deserve a higher prominence in grade feedback. The final group project is essentially asking a group of people to create an unconventional reading response for the whole course in the week and a half between finishing the class project and moving into finals period. I understand that this might sound simple, but it's incredibly difficult to coordinate with a group in this crunch period to produce such a comprehensive work. It would make more sense for the group project to be treated, and weighted more like a final reading response, and for each individual reading response to be worth more.",
    "Lectures were always interesting, though sometimes confusing over the course of the class in terms of what we would actually be tested on (though it worked out quite well in that format anyways).",
    "Brad Rosen is passionate and clearly cares deeply about the subject and class, and the material is interesting. However, the class is organized in an incredibly haphazard manner, which makes it easy (and tempting) to zone out, especially considering the fact that zoning out doesn't really affect your grade. A little more structure and information on grading would've been greatly appreciated. My biggest complaint though is that I took the class credit\/d\/fail, but didn't receive my midterm or the majority of my reading responses back until two weeks before the end of the semester. I ended up getting an A in the class but had no information about my standing when the credit\/d switch deadline came up, so I never switched and was honestly shocked when I did well.",
    "The material is very interesting and fun. Brad was entertaining as a professor and lecturer, but the class feels too big. It is great that it doesn't have a cap, but it does mean that only like the same 5 people would talk during class. I also felt like we never covered as much as we were supposed to in lecture because things got off topic due to people's unrelated comments\/questions. Also, it was very very very frustrating to not get grades back until finals or after finals period, as I felt like I was putting in a lot of work, but had no idea if my efforts were worth it or successful.",
    "Brad knows what he's doing, and this course is phenomenal.",
    "I think this class is incredibly engaging and mentally stimulating, I greatly enjoyed the course and feel it is one of the few classes I will remember vividly even decades from now. That being said, I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that the course did not offer any substantial grades until basically December due to grading delays and rather vague expectations. I understand many of the assignments were likely complicated to grade, but the delays were outrageous and very frustrating.",
    "INCREDIBLE PROFESSOR!!! Fascinating material, well-balanced workload, exciting overall class. weaknesses -- final project seemed a little pointless\/arbitrary and could've had more guidance with this maybe",
    "This course is fantastic in all of its quirks and oddities (I'm speaking here both of the class and its notorious professor). I can't do justice to critiquing the class as I could never have thought up anything like it. This is one of the best classes at Yale, hands down. I have been challenged, tested, and grown in the process. I am incredible thankful for having learned under Brad. I will add as an afterthought that I wish that work was returned in a more timely fashion. Though I always received helpful feedback on my assignments, it often took so long to grade my completed assignments that by the time the work was returned to me, the critiques were of little use.",
    "Great lectures and material, great Brad. Only weakness is that the reading responses take like a month to get graded and the midterm is very late, so it's hard to gauge mid-semester how you're doing.",
    "The class is very interesting, and Brad is a very fun teacher. The information is given in pretty concise, interesting ways.",
    "Strengths: lectures are fun to sit through if you've done reading, the readings are pretty interesting, Brad is a really helpful prof if you make the time and effort to go and talk to him, the topic is really intriguing and relevant in all of our lives. Weaknesses: the course is a mess with no organization at all, there is no set syllabus -- with readings that are often updated before each class (usually leaving not enough time to comb through all of them), the midterm is way too long (close to 20 pages!). Because there were never any specific prompts or goals for any of the writing assignments or projects, the learning objectives weren't always clear, the lectures (although sometimes really impactful) were often also disorganized and full of off-topic rambling. Potential Improvements: Maybe having a set syllabus beforehand with specific deadlines (especially for the class project and final project), cutting down on reading and engaging more in class with those readings"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were seeking an interesting and different learning experience from most other classes at Yale.",
    "SHOP THIS CLASS. If you can handle Brad, take it.",
    "Definitely recommend if you are at all interested in law and\/or technology. Brad is a great lecturer and you'll have a lot of fun. I didn't do any of the readings before the midterm which definitely made things harder, but the work is all pretty manageable. Fun class! Not a gut!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. It is a great introduction to the legal system and Brad presents it in a way that accessible to all students. Although its a lot of work, you will learn a lot. The topics you talk about in the class are relevant to current events so you'll be able to apply the knowledge where ever you go. also, cupcakes and sushi dinners!",
    "Sure",
    "This course is not for everybody. The course material is extremely interesting, but (as with most courses) it all hinges on the quality of the instructor. Make sure you get an impression of Brad Rosen before you take this class, and believe him when because if you aren't onboard with his \"teaching style,\" you will regret taking the class.",
    "Absolutely. It's interesting, but not super work-intensive; however, you still learn.",
    "The course lacks transparency throughout. No assignments were returned in a timely fashion and you don't know your grade until the semester is over. Very upsetting and stressful.",
    "Yes you should take this course, unless you absolutely hate Brad. Brad's teaching style is all over the place but if there's any part of you that gets excited by what he's saying you should stay in the class. The course is a wild adventure, but if you have the confidence to ask questions, push back, and engage with the readings, you will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course, simply because it covers topics everyone should know about--the fun lectures are just a bonus!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, if they have a sense of humor and are okay with a professor with a lot of personality.",
    "Take this class! However, listen to Brad's initial warnings: if you don't like his teaching style, GET OUT. You will be miserable if you cannot take his lectures. (He very truly, honestly won't mind, and really does prefer that you not take the class than be miserable and not get anything out of it.) Most of the time Brad leads the class to conclusions based in fact; when he goes political he will explain that it is his personal view and why he thinks that. It is okay to disagree with him on things that are not fact (he will respect you as long as you are consistent), and the class can still be enjoyable. You will learn a lot about law and legal gray areas, especially as it pertains to technology today. Brad is a very, very engaging lecturer who will lead the class to notice many little problems and whatnot in the law and our social standards today. You will learn why some things are the way they are and why your American liberties are pretty safe. He does care about his students and teaching them how to confront the world. The class grading depends on participation, reading responses, a midterm, a class project, and a final project. Participate! It helps and engages you with the class. Also, attend class!! Classes are the best part of the course. You don't have to argue with Brad but you can help point out issues in cases or ask clarification questions. Reading responses are fairly doable. Do them in a timely manner (it helps get an idea of your grading in the class in a timely manner). The midterm is difficult but at the same time really interesting (in Brad's words: \"she punched me in the face once. It was awesome\"). That said, if you do the reading and attend class and LISTEN TO BRAD and all his tangents (which aren't even tangents) you will know what to write. Class project is tricky since CPSC 183 is so large now, and grading is unclear. Final project grading is also unclear but probably about what you expect. Find some people in the class by the last month or so you don't have to start a final project until after Thanksgiving break but if you don't have anyone to do it with you will be sad. Overall grading is very uncertain but you will probably have an idea of where you stand in the class and if not Brad is willing to speak with you about it.",
    "As the course evaluations have always said, it's the Brad Show, for better or for worse. And I'd say that's mostly for the better. He can be a little brusque and brash at times but he's got a big heart and loves doing what he does. The course material is very interesting philosophically and legally (at least if you're into tech stuff like I am) and Brad knows his stuff extremely well.",
    "This is a rare class that reminds you why you're here. It's also a terrible class in that it's large, it's a lecture, and it has a bunch of high school students in it (of which many were super nice, but some were, like a few Yale students, out of control). You'll learn a lot, and Brad will tell you to stop taking notes, and then you'll take the midterm and you'll feel screwed because you have a very limited basis of knowledge. There always felt like so much there, so much to write down during lecture. Probably because there was. But instead you're supposed to soak it in, which is frustrating because soon this class is a distant memory. I'd still take it though.",
    "Yes! Enjoy!! Two words of warning\/advice. If you care about the material and want to do well this class will not be a gut. But it won't be too much work either. The midterm is great but takes A LOT of time.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Brad Rosen is a gift to this Earth and to Yale. This class will let you actually engage with the real world and things that are actually happening, not 400 year old Shakespeare texts or whatever This is a real world applicable class and will challenge you to think about the world around you and what you are and aren't comfortable with. The cupcakes every class help too. Brad is an amazing teacher, so personable if you get to know him, and if he takes you under his wing you will have a heavenly experience in this class. He's brilliant and you should absolutely take this class. It's a lot of reading for class, but they're articles and cases, not biblical texts or powerpoints. You'll laugh a lot in this class, and have some really fun arguments. The class and final project gives you so much freedom and you won't regret it. This is an amazing class.",
    "I would recommend this course, but don't be fooled by Brad's joking attitude. He does want serious work and participation, so take him and the class seriously if you want to get a grade. It was academically worthwhile to spend time reading and interpreting supreme court cases.",
    "YES. This is a must-take course at Yale. You will only understand once you experience it. Take this class!",
    "100% yes. Brad is a fantastic lecturer, and every class is super interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student - to shop, and then to decide. The teaching style is very unique; for some people, it's not for them, and for others, it is absolutely wonderful. A must-shop, and a must-take if it works for you.",
    "This was a great course that everyone should take regardless of their major.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students at Yale, because it is so important to understand how laws govern our current technological world. The readings consist of articles that I would honestly read on my own time, and class is very fun and engaging.",
    "I took this class without knowing anything about law and I feel like I've learned a lot. The professor is really engaging, but can be a lot for some people. The material was really interesting and I enjoyed going to lecture. I highly recommend this class. There're 5 reading responses (drop the lowest), a class project, a take home midterm (up to 7000 words approximately, quite hard) and a final group project.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was an unusual class, but it made me think a lot.",
    "A great class for anyone--teaches you how to think in the current era. Brad is amazing and lectures are never boring.",
    "Yes! shop it though. Make sure you like Brad.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone. I was not interested in law at all, but I still loved the course. Brad is a professor I feel like you have to have at some point at Yale - his class is really something unique.",
    "Very fun course that teaches you some useful stuff along the way. Not terribly difficult, but not all courses have to be. Most of the learning comes from readings, so do them if you can. The midterm is grueling, but other than that the workload is not bad at all. Great 5th class.",
    "Oh boy, here we go. I regret taking this class, but I think it's an awesome class if you know what you are getting into and are prepared for that, and I also think the course is flexible enough that you can get a lot out of it even if you don't respond well to the core premise, as I did. First thing to note, and most important thing: THIS CLASS IS A SEMINAR. That means if you don't participate you won't get a lot out of it and will in fact be worse off because you're listening to classmates more often than Brad. Second: THIS CLASS IS ABOUT LAW. Like yes it's about tech law but if you don't really care about the law (like me!) you probably will not enjoy this class if you want to learn things. Brad's an amazing lecturer, but make sure you like his teaching style (unorthodox, but effective imo) and take into account the above two things. Alternatively, disregard those things and take this credit D and just go to the fun lectures and BS the reading responses (which are graded pretty seriously actually. And then you can have fun with the class project and final project and maybe learn something through those two avenues. If you take credit D you will find a lot to enjoy but maybe not learn a tremendous amount.",
    "Hell yeah! It's entirely different from every other course I've taken at Yale, and it's a breath of fresh air. The material is varied and relevant to my life outside of Yale's ivory tower.",
    "THIS IS NOT A TYPICAL GUT! This course is very untraditional, and Brad is an amazing teacher and it is a lot of fun going to class and learning from him, but you do actually need to do work in this class if you want an A. The midterm is LONG, like 20 hours long, and there are a lot of readings, which you need to do when you write reading responses. With that being said, the class is awesome. You actually do learn a lot, there are lots of really interesting discussions, and Brad is absolutely hilarious. A great class that everyone should take.",
    "It's not a lot of work, but it's not a gut either -- that said, definitely take it if you're going to do most of the readings and the work (because you'll probably want to, anyway)! Brad and the course are awesome, but what really makes 183 great is student engagement and \"course participation,\" which Brad will distinguish from class participation. Shop it and see what happens!",
    "Yes, absolutely. Start it as Cr\/D\/Fail if you aren't sure the teaching style is for you, but trust that if you get into the class, you'll want to keep doing the work, coming to class, and participating in the project. It's not a hard class if you have the time\/commitment to really participate. At the same time, shop it before you consider taking it; Brad's teaching style isn't for everyone, and he really puts himself out there during shopping period to make sure shoppers know what they're signing up for.",
    "This class is as good as they say it is. Warning the midterm is quite challenging, but other than that the rest of the class is very doable.",
    "Shop it--whether or not you enjoy this class depends very much on you. Do you like Brad's lecture style? Do you enjoy the material? Don't take this as a gut class, because it's not worth it if you're not going to do all the readings and actively engage with the subject matter. I found the material to be extremely interesting, and while I found many aspects of the class to be frustrating, I ultimately came out with a lot more knowledge than when I started. I would say go to the first 3-4 lectures and do some of the later readings from previous years--make sure you're willing to invest the time required to get as much as possible out of the course. Be forewarned that the take-home midterm takes upwards of 10-15 hours, and there's a lot of reading to do throughout (but it's Good Content).",
    "This is a class nearly every Yale student would benefit from taking.",
    "Absolutely--if you have any interest in the law, legal writing, or the intersections of law and technology in the 21st century whatsoever, this class is a must.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Great class with interesting lectures",
    "This class is literally bioethics and the law, but replace bioethics with \"digital technology\". Brad Rosen is great, very passionate about the subject and his students, but exactly like bioethics the class is incredibly disorganized. No slides in lecture, too many readings to possibly get through so you have to pick and choose, and the grading system seems super random. (I took it credit\/d but ended up getting an A because I think they try and make it out to be less of a gut than it actually is. However, I didn't get any of my work back until two weeks before the end of the semester so I didn't get a chance to switch it). Overall it's actually a really interesting subject with a wonderful professor, BUT if you're the type of student who can't handle wishy washy grading systems and not having slides, etc. then I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Yes I had an amazing time in this class. It was dynamic and compelling and taught me how to look at problems through a multi-faceted lens. You will not regret taking this class no matter the final grade.",
    "I struggle to recommend this class because it was so frustrating to be a part of. I truly was interested in the material, and I felt that at the end of the class, I did understand fair use, copyright law, etc. But the class itself kind of felt like a mess. Brad says at the beginning of the class that it is not a gut, and although some people had told me that it is a gut anyway, it truly took a ton of work that didn't feel like it really helped me with the material. The class project didn't work well because we had to make a project that included contributions from over 100 people, so I didn't get anything out of it. I put over 22 hours into the take-home midterm, and then I didn't even get my grade back until after the very last lecture. There is not a lot of instruction throughout the course, it's just kind of like \"oh you have to do a final project and do a write-up for it,\" with no other description.",
    "YES! This course examines the laws and norms that govern some of the most important pillars of society todayfree speech and defamation in the context of social media, fair use and copyright protections in the context of Youtube videos and participatory culture, etc. Brad is an ace teacher and always keeps it engaging while challenging your ability to think critically about these issues.",
    "It's really simple. If you like Brad's teaching style, take this course and you will LOVE it. If you don't like his style, listen to him and get out. I really enjoyed it, but it's definitely not for everyone.",
    "Yes!! Obviously go to the first class to see if Brad's teaching is your style, but if you like the way he lectures then you'll love the course. Relevant, interesting material and the type of class that will make you laugh out loud one minute and pause\/ really reflect\/ question your initial opinions the next. Take it.",
    "Every student at Yale should take this course. Though Brad's teaching style isn't for everyone, whoever enrolls in this class will become a stronger thinker, student, and global citizen for having traversed the crazy jumble of copyright statutes, constitutional law, and memes that comprise this rollercoaster of a class.",
    "Take it! Brad is fantastic and the material is fascinating. This is a can't-miss on the big Yale courses circuit",
    "I loved the course, and it was very interesting. Shop it first, though, cause you'll probably hate it if you don't like Brad's teaching. If you end up taking it, be sure to ask when the midterm-project thing is because if you're not prepared, it's 30-40 hours of work that could make your week the worst ever, trust me.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students mainly because of the professor. Brad truly wants to do his best for every student and provides so many opportunities for students to interact with him in a personal setting even though the class has over 100 students. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS! You can get so much more from the course by just talking with Brad. The course material is also very interesting, though I will say that there is quite a bit of reading which is only posted a day or two before lecture, which makes for one day with A LOT of reading. As long as you focus on the main cases and what Brad talks about in class though (especially before the midterm), you should be fine though!"
