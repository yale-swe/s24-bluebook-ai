    "If you get into this class, consider yourself very lucky. If not, try to fight your way in. This class was very helpful in improving my writing as a whole, and Professor Sidorenko was amazing. She was so helpful, and she is extremely knowledgable on the topic of Sexuality and Society. It was my favorite class this semester, and I consider myself a math\/science person. If you can take this class with Ksenia, do it.",
    "English 114 21 is good if you like reading philosophy, are interested in WGSS, and\/or are very very liberal. Personally, I don't really like reading philosophy, I'm a feminist but not interested in the WGSS major, and I'm very liberal but not the kind of liberal that others in the class were. But it was very interesting to people who met those qualifications.",
    "The discussions are exceptional and the material is interesting. There is a lot of reading though.",
    "The work done in class may become repetitive but the content is useful and interesting.",
    "Strongly recommended. This class will certainly help me in the future.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to improve their writing and also get an intro to issues of gender and sexuality.",
    "If the exact same subject for English 114 were offered again, I would recommend it to another student. I would describe it as a class that works on writing ability while also teaching about feminist and LGBTQ theory. For students interested in those subjects (or in other subjects related to identity, like race or ethnicity), I would say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great introduction-level class to take. But I would probably not recommend English 114 in general. From what I heard from other students, the type of genuinely productive and vivacious discussion we had in Section 21 was rare, if not unique, among English 114 classes. The intersection of interesting subject material and passionate students led to a good class, but that would not be true of all English 114 sections."
