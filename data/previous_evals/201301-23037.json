Tepidness helps nobody. Also, use your design presentation as an actual tool to check in with your designers and to make sure that the full aesthetic of your show will be cohesive. In your post-mortem, ask bluntly about the areas of the show which you are most wary\/unsure about the success of; use criticism as an actual opportunity to grow and improve."
