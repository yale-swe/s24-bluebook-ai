   "comments": [
    "Contemporary Food Writing is an interesting addition to the Yale curriculum, and even though it has been very challenging, I have enjoyed the course overall, and Professor Chin has helped me improve my writing tremendously. Key strengths: Professor Chin actually cares about your development and spends a lot of time editing you many writing assignments, interesting reading list and fun optional kitchen time and guest speakers. Weakness: Too much reading that sometimes wasn't covered enough in class. Overall, however, I would highly recommend the seminar to another student, and I hope that it will be offered again.",
    "Provides a good opportunity to learn about food writing. The writing aspect is fairly loosely graded, and to be honest not much effort is spent improving one's own writing (little workshop time), but that might change in the future. The readings ranged in quality - some boring (e.g. reading recipes), but overall most of the readings were great (I couldn't put \"Heat\" down).",
    "I would recommend it if rough drafts were made mandatory and the readings were cut so that we could focus our discussions.",
    "A look at all types of food writing - from recipes, criticism, memoire, science, etc. Alot of reading of others work and writing your own. If you need an easy\/enjoyable fifth class, take it. If you get annoyed doing work that is ultimately pointless and not very stimulating, don' take it.",
    "It's a look at every imaginable type of food writing, from fiction to memoir to recipes.",
    "This class is a mixed bag. On the bright side, I got to go to great restaurants, interview interesting people, cook things I never would have cooked on my own, and write about it! It's not often that you get to do things like that and call them homework. On the other hand, there's an unrealistic amount of reading and a ton of assignments, and class time itself is pretty pointless. So if you're into food and like to write, take it, but know that it will sometimes be a frustrating experience.",
    "Wonderful overview of food literature and its roots. Heavy emphasis on writing (weekly assignments) with the possibility of revision. Great course if you're into the subject material."
