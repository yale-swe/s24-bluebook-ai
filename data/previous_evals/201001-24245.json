    "CENG 301 provides an introduction to reactor design and kinetics. While the course content is not terribly difficult, and a good portion is in fact review, the problem sets are fairly involved, though not necessarily theoretically challenging. Take it if you have to, but if not, look for a more engaging course.",
    "301 is not too bad compared to other ChemE classes. Conceptually it does not get too difficult; it mostly builds on basic thermo and kinetics you learn in intro chem or pchem. The last few chapters, however, are definitely a bit more challenging.",
    "I haven't taken another kinetics course, so I don't know if this is true only of kinetics at Yale or kinetics everywhere. The material is relatively elementary (conceptually not much harder than AP chemistry). Where the class might get hard is keeping track of all the equations and reactions that you have to work with. You don't learn much science, per se, but instead a vital tool that you need in order to model reactions, plants, etc.Chemical kinetics is supposedly a really important part if you're into engineering\/keeping track of reactions. For example, an important subproblem of tracking biological interactions is basically kinetics.The textbook, by Fogler, is ancient and full or errors. However, the author has a weird sense of humor that can be entertaining, and it is fairly interesting to read the applications in the textbook, so please do! I wish I did, it would have been much more fun and educational than the actual material presented to us.I know the class subject can be very interesting, because there was one lecture where professor Lutkenhaus brought in a guest who presented us with lots of interesting material and applications and counterintuitive behavior of chemical kinetics, that really stimulated the mind and got us thinking. But that was only one lecture :("
