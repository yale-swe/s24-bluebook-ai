    "ANTH 182 focuses on ecology and primate behavior, but there are many classes where other animal species are the subject to help drive home main points. I would absolutely recommend ANTH 182 to another student because the material was extremely interesting and the course was very well taught.",
    "Anth 182 was an incredible class, and I would highly recommend it to other students. I found the material about primates was very fascinating and a nice refreshing break from the other Yale classes that I took. Professor Watts is enthusiastic and so knowledgeable (though he can get so into the information that he spends a lot longer going over it than might otherwise be needed), and he has first-hand experience with primates. Anyone who is even remotely interested in primates would find this class rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about primate behavior. Our class was small, and I found it nice having an intimate lecture setting. It's an overview of different aspects of primate behavior (feeding, living situation, social relationships), and it also covered current issues of primate and forest conservation. It was great being able to watch footage that Professor Watts had taken of chimpanzees while studying them in Kibale, and lots of photos and video clips help make lecture even more interesting.",
    "Absolutely! Interesting and a manageable amount of work- 3 short papers, 1 take-home midterm, and a final research paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. Even if you're new to the field, this course quickly brings you in, introduces all the important concepts, and allows you to critically think about a specific topic for the term paper. Professor Watts is very passionate about his work and that passion really translates into enjoyable lectures and readings that draw you in.",
    "If the course title sounds interesting to you, then the course should be exactly what you are looking for! You learn a lot of things about a lot of primates, and towards the end of the class we started to learn about conservation. I really would recommend it--it was super easy and super fun, and you really can learn a lot from it!"
