    "I enjoyed this course however if you are a student who has never seen spanish before, I recommend taking a look at it during the summer.",
    "If you know spanish id take the class but if youve never taken the language I would stay away from Spanish at Yale",
    "Spanish 110 is great to take for starting off a language. Spanish spelling isn't hard, and if you practice and study regularly, then you will be fine for quizzes and the exam.",
    "A great introductory course that teaches you a lot of spanish in a short space of time. It requires about an hour a day.",
    "A good class. I would recommend it if you have taken spanish before. If you haven't its hard to keep up-- requires a lot of work.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to fellow Bulldogs. In summary, this class provides a solid foundation for Spanish. After just one semester, I can carry a conversation with native Spanish-speakers that live in my entryway. Though it entails a fair amount of nightly studying, I would certainly recommend this class to students looking to expand their fluency in other languages."
