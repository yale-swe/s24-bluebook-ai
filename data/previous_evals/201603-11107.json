   "comments": [
    "I've gained a greater understanding of European art as a whole, and have also gained insight into the logic of art historians, artists and the methods artists use.",
    "This was my first art history course, so plenty! Learned about the deep interplay between art and the social\/political\/economic\/etc. context in which it is created, learned more about how to analyze art work, appreciate connections between different pieces, all that jazz.",
    "I became acquainted with many of the most important works of art and artistic movements of the 19th century. I learned some 19th century French history. I learned how to write an essay comparing two paintings, and I learned about the relationship between \"modernity\" and \"modernism.\"",
    "I felt like I became a better art history writer and gained knowledge in the field of nineteenth century French painting.",
    "I learned a lot about 19th century art which was an area I was very interested in, so I'm very glad to have taken it!",
    "Our TA, Nick Robbins, acknowledged that it is difficult to see the value of an art history course in the midst of current events. But he decided (and I can confirm) that art history functions beautifully as a study of escapism. This course was challenging and engaging, and educated me in the evolution of a philosophy of art in France. The artists, like us, were looking to make sense of contemporary events--it's incredible how easy it is to relate to the sentiments behind writing and artworks from centuries ago. I learned how to think critically about artwork which I thought only had value in its literal physical appearance. I learned how to read into the meanings of works whose intentions I had long taken for granted.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's interesting material. I love artists like Monet and Van Gogh, and learning about their art and others was awesome. The course is based in such an important time period and it makes the most of that. This is both its greatest strength and weakness, as it covers so much that it can become overwhelming and too much to cover in one final essay effectively, as I learned taking the final.",
    "A friend of mine mentioned while watching me study-- and thinking on his words I agree-- that with all the time spent memorizing ~400 slides for the final, there's less time that can be devoted to deeply thinking about the works, in terms of historical context and their content and design. While ideally students will keep up with the paintings throughout the course, that realistically is not going to happen in 99% of cases, and *even so*, there will always be a great deal of studying for the exams that does not focus on more interesting content as opposed to rote memorization. Other than that, great course, great overview of artists, trends, and everything! Oh also it would be a huge help (and not that much more work for the professor) if the image powerpoints were uploaded with the relevant artists, title and date in the \"presentation notes\" section of each slide.",
    "I like that this course covers so many works of art. It is an excellent survey of the time period. I would have preferred more visits to the YUAG, but I am glad that we got to go three times. I also wish that section\/lecture were more aligned, but a scheduling issue prevented that this year.",
    "Very disorganized and confusingly taught for the quality of subject matter. I love the material but was disappointed in the way the class was organized.",
    "I think the strengths were really the readings and the section discussions--I honestly would have loved to take this class in a seminar format where I would have had more chance to discuss these works in full detail. I would love to take a seminar with Professor Armstrong. A weakness was the structure of the exams--maybe it's just typical art history protocol, but I thought it was very frustrating to have to memorize 300+ works of art for a final.",
    "This course was organized quite well! If I had one suggestion, I would recommend that Professor Armstrong simplify lecture content a little. She always included a long list of images on the agenda for lecture each class, but we rarely made it through all of them in time. I would rather her have cut down on the paintings shown than try and rush through each.",
    "I thought the course lacked any sense of organization. The lectures and the section readings did not match up and I found it difficult to keep track of the lessons that we were supposed to be covering in section because of this. In not providing a slide list for the exams, I felt as though the exams were unfair.",
    "This course was a revelation. Every lecture totally blew me away!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you like French art, take it. It's not a lot of work, and even if you've never taken art history before, it's manageable. Readings can become esoteric but never anything too crazy. Lectures are interesting, however, Prof. Armstrong says 'um' a lot but you get used to it after a while. Discussion sections are also pretty good, the TA was good.",
    "(). Alright so first some general comments and them some *advice* for if you do decide to take this course. tl;dr: Interesting, low work, would recommend independent of past art history experience. More info: This is a fun course that covers a variety of painters and artistic movements deeply associated with 19th century France. I took this never having taken an art history class before and in terms of difficulty it was fine. I also think this course would be great for someone who already does have experience with art history. Professor Armstrong is not very engaging in lecture and sometimes it seems as if she's jumping a little bit from topic to topic, so it can be difficult to develop a cohesive interpretation of the material as you go. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the material. There's not really a ton of work for the class (though if you cram, preparing for the exams will be a lot) and the weekly reading is average compared to other humanities classes I'd say. Overall, I learned a lot and really enjoyed the course. Advice: Professor Armstrong uploads lists of images (in a word doc) and powerpoints with the actual images separately (I have no idea why). This makes it difficult to have all the relevant material in one place. So, what I'd recommend is getting to class ~5 minutes early and then copy pasting from the image list to the image powerpoint. If you can't get to class early, then just do this asap the same day. Either way, I'd then recommend writing whatever Armstrong says in lecture that's associated with a painting in the 'presenter notes' section of the powerpoint. (This is going to come in handy when it's time to study because you'll have the painting, defining info, and analysis all in one place. Also, it's possible to merge powerpoints so look that up). Then, have a separate word doc open where you can write *general* information not about a specific painting, e.g. the historical context and stuff about the artists' lives she mentions. I found this really helped me when it was time to study. For memorizing dates of paintings (which you'll in the end have to do for ~400 paintings), I'd recommend learning the Major Mnemonic system as soon as possible. It might seem daunting but it's really not that bad and takes way less time to get accustomed to it then you'd think. Essentially you just have to transform the last two digits of the date (because the first two are almost always 18 due to it being 19th century art) into a distinctive word that you can associate with some distinctive feature of the painting. Then, when you look at the painting, you recognize the feature, you think of the word, and you convert that into a date. Voila. I can't overstate how enormously helpful this is in memorizing the paintings' dates. Ideally, you should spend a little bit of time each week memorizing the paintings from the lectures that week. Lastly, take notes on the readings\/in section because that will become relevant when it's time for the final. Hope this helps!",
    "HSAR 315 covers one of the most interesting periods of art history. While the textbook is not extremely exciting, the section readings are all incredibly thought-provoking. I loved having the opportunity to discuss paintings with the background that I gained from these secondary sources. This was my first art history course and I am absolutely hooked on the subject now. Bear in mind that this is a lecture and that there is no discussion in class.",
    "I think the material is amazing but the way in which it was organized was confusing and not worth it. Memorizing over 300 works for a final exam was simply crazy.",
    "This is a really great course if you are interested in art--it's one of the best periods of art history. The paintings and movements you get a chance to learn about are phenomenal, and Professor Armstrong definitely knows what she's talking about. The readings are also fantastic. One thing to be warned--the memorization for the exams is a LOT. Be ready to memorize 300+ paintings for the final.",
    "Yes! Whether your an HSAR major or not, if you're interested in taking an art history class, this is a great option. The rigor of the class is, for the most part, what you make of it. Section readings each week feature rich philosophical pieces and art criticism, as well as more straightforward textbook chapters. I am not an art history major, but I found the paintings, the readings, and the essay prompts very engaging and fun to think about.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, well-taught and engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Armstrong is a fantastic lecturer and brings life to this fantastic material."
