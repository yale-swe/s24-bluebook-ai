    "No i would not recommend it if you are looking to fulfill the QR credit. You can find an easier one else where.",
    "Take it if you need it.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. Seriously.",
    "A lot of high school material. Take it early (as a freshman).",
    "This course was extremely difficult for me. I took AB in high school and was relatively good at it, but it did not prepare me for this course at all. The speed of the class is extremely fast, which can be hard to keep up with. Also, the questions on the test always had tricks in them, which was frustrating because I didn't feel like my grades on the tests actually ended up reflecting whether I knew the material because the questions were so different than what we had routinely practiced for homework. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you need to take it. And if you do need to take it, Professor Casson is a very good teacher. He is methodical and organized in his explanations, which is very helpful since the pace of the class is so fast. He is pretty dry though, so if you need an enthusiastic teacher, I wouldn't take it with him.",
    "Yes, especially if you need it for a requirement. It's a fair class if you're willing to put in a lot of time and effort to truly understand how to solve problems.",
    "This course is difficult, and calculus is difficult. However, it is a good course that I would recommend taking. You have to do all of the work, but if you put in the time and effort, it will be a worth while course.",
    "Only take this class if you need it for a requirement. Otherwise a lot of the material will need to be self-taught and you will be competing with people that have much more experience in math.",
    "Overall review of calculus concepts. Great format with two midterms and a final.",
    "If you've taken calculus before, but are a bit shakey, take math 115. You'll relearn a lot of topics, but you'll be able to develop a strong foundation in math instead of playing keep-up in a higher level math. That said, choose a good professor! Not all math professors are the same; shop a few sections and pick the one that suits your learning style, not the one that has most of your friends in their class. You think it doesn't matter, but come finals time, having a good professor can have a large impact.",
    "Casson is great at explaining things. Our class averages were lower than the grad students, however, leading me to think he had qualms about teaching directly to a test.",
    "Yes; I did not take BC in High School and wanted to take a math class because I thought it would interesting. The exams were harder than I expected, but the curve works that problem out.",
    "This class is a good basic math class, not too hard but not necessarily easy either. I would recommend it to people who enjoy math or are needing premedical requirements satisfied.",
    "Math 115 is a food continuation of AB or BC high school calculus classes. It expects students to retain and understand previous courses, but it is not so difficult that an incomplete comprehension is absolutely necessary.",
    "I'd recommend one take this course because you learn a lot of interesting math, much more interesting than Math 112. However, I struggled in the course so I wouldn't recommend it unless you need the credit or love math. A tough course. The exams were hard."
