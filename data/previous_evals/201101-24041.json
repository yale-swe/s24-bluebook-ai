   "question_id": "AC350",
   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes they were available.",
    "Scheduling conflicts with equipment was sometimes an issue, with many groups trying to use the same machines, but I'm not sure that's avoidable...",
    "Yes.",
    "The large mill caused us a lot of issues in the last week. It seems as though it needs to be upgraded to support the cutting of wood. Also it seems like there should be a consultation with the shop managers before fabrication begins so that we have a better idea about how to do what we need to most effectively.",
    "The mills were consistently broken and in repair, making fabrication particularly difficult.",
    "With so many people trying to get mill time the projects became nightmares.",
    "There are not enough cnc mills for 30 pairs of students to be required to complete milling projects at the same time. A better way of approaching the class would be to become less proscriptive about the specific fabrication techniques that students use for a given project.",
    "Yes.",
    "I felt the resources were more than generous. It's true that with a class as large as ours even the multiple mills we have seems inadequate but Yale probably has more mills than any other school so it's hard to complain.",
    "The fabrication labs were often confusing and the monitors were often too busy to help.",
    "Not quite.",
    "The shop staff in general is very combative. They are often discouraging without being helpful, and the student monitors in general are extremely unhelpful and resentful of being disturbed. The staff is very vocal in there being a conflict between staff and faculty, but without getting into that, it might help to integrate the staff into the class at least so they aren't so hostile when we come down into the shop.In general though, the shop people are aggressive and condescending. This is not just an issue in this class.",
    "The sizeof the class made it extremely difficult to utilize the tools and resources of the fabrication labs. I would suggest staggering the assignments so that half of the class is required to use the mill, while the other half of the class uses the laser cutter. This technique would make the first half of the course easier to coordinate in terms of fabrication lab availability.",
    "We have a really great set of fabrication tools at our disposal, the only thing that was sort of ridiculous was that half of the fabrication groups needed to mill at the same time and the mills were completely full or broken...people were pulling all nighters milling. It would have been good to know before hand that the things we were trying to make were going to take that long to mill.",
    "The resources in the shop were enough for us to have intriguing projects.",
    "The difficulty of milling made that aspect of the class difficult and less enjoyable, but it had to be introduced. It was relatively well paced despite some setbacks, but given the process and resources, it was much better managed than what I had heard happened last year.",
    "Yes. Except that the shop monitors are often irresponsible and not available for the shifts they are supposed to work. This is especially so on Saturday morning. I would not mind if the shop was offically not open until later on Saturday, but if the hours are posted 9am on, it should be open.",
    "The fabrication labs were adequate for me, but not for 62 people all trying to use the same machine. This seems more the fault of the class than the fabrication labs, though.",
    "My only criticism of this course is the lack of interface between the instructors and the shop staff with project design and fabrication. Shop staff should be involved earlier in the process.",
    "Mills were often broken, and the certification process was tedious.",
    "The structure of the class really strained the fabrication labs at specific times of the semester. While it taught us how to use the equipment, it did so in a way that made everything into rote work.",
    "The library is a disgrace. It should be open later.",
    "As stated above, the prescribed tool and material for each project overloaded the demand and caused materials to run out and machines to break. Also, the lack of involvement of the shop staff caused the machines and materials to be miss-used.",
    "The fabrication equipment was extremely difficult to work with. We really need an updated software program for the foam wire cutter. It took endless hours of work to get our files to work with the software. The program crashes extremely easily, and it requires files to be set up in a very particular (and arbitrary) way. As just one example, we discovered that you have to set your Rhino file to millimeters, and then Chroma will think it's in inches. If you set it up in inches, Chroma scales the drawing incorrectly. If files contain greater than a certain number of lines, the software crashes. If files contain any closed polylines, the program crashes. We spent endless hours troubleshooting problems like these. This information should at least be included in the tutorials booklets.",
    "Projects should be staggered within the class. Perhaps some groups can do milling while others work on laser cutting. Having 60 students trying to use the same machines at the same time is chaotic and frustrating.",
    "Better coordination is needed between the teaching faculty and shop staff so that the students don\u0092t get caught in-between. There was obvious tension between the two in the beginning of the semester, which brought a lot of negativity to the course in general (the problem seems to have been resolved later but it should be avoided in the future). Similar problem occurred in the last project when installations throughout the building was disapproved by administrator and students had to take the blame.",
    "The resources were adequate.",
    "While the resources available to us seem adequate during the year, the simple fact that each week 30 teamswere requiring to do the same process was completely overwhelming for the shop. I wonder if perhaps teams could be staggered weekly so that the shop is not so crowded and milling for 12 hours not such a nightmare",
    "Resources were available although given the size of the class and time constraints, a lot of organization needed to be done in order to get the work done.",
    "Facilities were great. Get rid of the Plasma Cutter. It's a pain in the ass.",
    "Yes. However, it might be a good idea to stagger due-dates when mill-based assignments are due, as some students had a difficult time trouble-shooting mill problems, which led to some bottle-necking."
