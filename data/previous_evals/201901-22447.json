   "comments": [
    "The readings were super long, but that can be expected from a high level seminar. We worked with both undergraduates and graduates, which was cool. I really really loved how important archival research was to this course; I feel much more acquainted with the Beinecke after taking this class. Only weakness *may* have been how scattered each meeting felt at times; it was definitely super free-flowing and based in heavy discussion, which is great, but it felt difficult to remain engaged at times. Perhaps the class time could be shorter and might meet twice a week to really define the discussion topic rather than general conversations about an entire text.",
    "Strengths were a thorough introduction to the collections and support in writing a research paper proposal. Class discussions varied based on the level of engagement. The course could be improved by assigning less reading and more written assignments.",
    "No weakness for the course. At times having the seminar in the Beinecke proved a bit daunting and time was at times unevenly distributed between archival materials and the text. This was not a detriment to the course but rather, a small logistical comment on its ambition and scope. The greatest strengths were the quality of the instruction, class discussion, and the ability to give sustained attention to Delany's diverse body of work.",
    "Strengths: the class environment was very conducive to productive and exploratory discussion. The discussion was guided well and often flowed naturally through topics the professor had outlined. We were able to Skype with Delany himself, enhancing the experience of reading his work immensely. Weaknesses: the assignments were somewhat vague, and very few details as to what was expected in our writing was made availabe for each assignment. I liked that they were open ended, but at some points I missed marks I didn't even know I needed to hit. The pacing of the novels could have been improved as well, as some weeks it was obvious a lot of students did not finish a book because it was simply too long to read in 6 days.",
    "I think the reading could have been a little more balanced out (only reading some of the short stories in Aye and Gomorrah, having a little more time for Dhalgren, etc.) Engagement with the archives was really exciting though and this is pretty much the only Yale course I've taken that engaged with the archives so thoroughly."

    "Yes!",

    "Yes. I would recommend this course to another student looking to learn about literary archives and\/or Samuel Delany."
