   "comments": [
    "History of Capitalism and Culture brings together two concepts that at first might seem difficult to marry. By the end of the course, it became much easier to grasp the myriad connections. For anyone interested in how capitalism intersects with cultural themes, this course is essential.",
    "This class is relevant to most aspects of my life as a political actor and as a student of history, politics, economics, and anthropology. In today's world, \"capitalism\" must be scrutinized, and this class does an excellent job of doing so. This class is hugely ambitious, always exciting, often confusing, and worth-while for, in my opinion, absolutely everyone. That being said, the class entails a heavy reading load and much thoughtful engagement: it is a challenge to be respected.",
    "This is a class that thinks about capitalism and labor as forms of meaning-making, particularly in relation to forms of commodification. We do so in relation to a number of sites and texts, integrating conversations across various sub-disciplines (history, anthropology, sociology, literature, critical theory writ large). This is a class for students who are excited to think in interdisciplinary ways and have lots of leeway about how they choose to engage the texts presented to them. It is a class where creativity is encouraged and rewarded. It is a class taught by a professor who is clearly committed to pedagogy and engagement with students. Yes, I would recommend this to another student, with no reservations whatsoever."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my historical and theoretical understanding of culture and economics and their relationship in the United States. Through the readings and the discussion contributions of my peers, it introduced me to and extended my knowledge of a range of disciplines and approaches to history. The theories I explored in this class will absolutely impact the trajectory and methodology of my future research.",
    "I have a better sense of capitalism as a framework to discuss culture, which I think will benefit my discussion of it further in the program.",
    "This course gave me both content-knowledge about various key points and events in the history of capitalism\/labor, as well as providing me better and sharper theoretical tools for doing cultural studies of capitalism and its histories. In both of those ways, the things that I thought about and learned in this class are going to be integral to my ongoing academic (and activist) work."
