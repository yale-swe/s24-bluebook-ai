   "comments": [
    "The course is great !! And helps you understand the way microeconomics works I just loved it !! Very helpful",
    "Useful knowledge, but a little bit hard to catch up as an international student.",
    "I think it is very important to have an understanding of microeconomics as someone who would like to enter the healthcare administration and\/or consulting fields. I found this course to be very challenging, as I did not have an economics background coming in. The students in the course were very diverse in their knowledge of economics, but for someone who was starting from scratch I found it difficult to understand and build on each concept. The pace of the course was very fast. The lectures were helpful, though sometimes examples would have to be re-done, which confused me. I especially enjoyed the classes where we talked about the applications of microeconomics in healthcare, since this is what I wanted to get out of the course. For example, the lecture on health insurance was extremely interesting and valuable. I think I would have been able to connect more with the course from an earlier time in the semester if all (or most) of the examples used throughout related to health.Though this class was difficult, I found office hours and working with my peers to be crucial to my success. I am glad I took this course, because I think understanding economics is going to be very important in my future career.",
    "Microeconomics is a very interesting topic. But for a person without any economics background, it's difficult to connect theories we learned in class to real-world problems. It's quite frustrating to know every detail in the book but still not able to solve problems well.I think through practice one can be trained to \"think like an economist\", so I suggest the professor to offer more optional problem sets to those who want to practice.",
    "The course MUST be broken into two classes a week. There needs to be less material gone over each class and more examples. If the class was similar to Epi, like 3 quizzes (instead of a midterm) and a final I feel like it would be much more easy to digest.",
    "Strengths:Very applicable to healthcare.Gave me a good base knowledge of microeconomics.Great teaching style.Weaknesses:This was the professors first time with us, so it was a bit of a \"test\"A little unorganized",
    "The course is not well organized. More examples and better explained examples have to be provided. Classes have to be prepared previously. The textbook is probably one of the worse economic textbooks I've ever read.",
    "The material was sometimes confusing and not related to health care, but otherwise the course was fine.",
    "great",
    "very good course and important topicthe material covered is too vast and not directed towards public healthit feels like a business class school, many students have zero back ground in economics.",
    "Very good. Must do readings to follow what is going on in class.",
    "Reading from the syllabus, I was very attracted to the course. However, the material introduced by the professor is far away from reaching what the syllabus has promised us. First, the course is designed for students with minimal econ knowledge, but the professor never explained fundamental econ concepts. Instead, he jumps into the real life application of some random econ concepts right away, and I don't think the examples he gave is even relevant to what we are trying to learn. Second, the professor is not very responsive to student's questions. He will say something, but the stuff he said is only touching upon the student's question marginally, and the students are still left confused. Third, the course is not outlined well. With the content the professor introduced in class, there is no way we can solve the homework questions. I am pretty much teaching myself everything by reading textbook.",
    "Very interesting and useful content but it is very difficult and overwhelming at the same time. The quality of the course heavily depends on the instructor.",
    "- Economic frameworks and thinking is very important for health care decision makers and this course definitely changed the way that I think. It's very cool!- It was definitely a challenging course, because the content is very different than anything I've learned in the past.- The pace could have been slower, because this was an intro class.- I loved the culture in this classroom. Gradually, people felt comfortable asking questions and it was a collegial learning environment.",
    "I was a little disappointed with this course because I don't think it focused enough on healthcare. We started with the basics of microecon (which makes sense) but we didn't really revisit its application to healthcare until the last two classes. I would say I learned more about healthcare economics from the last two classes than the semester as a whole.",
    "Good overview of basic concepts of microeconomics. The lectures, readings and problem sets are integrated and organized. For those without any microeconomics background such as myself, the problem sets may be more time consuming.I wish that we had connected the course material to healthcare in a more direct manner from the beginning. The first half of the class was almost purely theory-driven.",
    "Dr. Moore seems interested in us and in teaching, but he really only cares about teaching to those in the class who already understand economic principals. His lectures are all over the place (he draws on the board and his graphs are confusing) and he goes into topics\/acronyms without fully explaining them. Many classes everyone left completely confused and frustrated because they had no idea what was going on.",
    "I'm so glad I took this course. I learned so much and it is a class that will stay with me in the rest of my health policy and management learning.",
    "At first there is really a lack of organization in terms of the textbook (there was 2 versions) and the problem sets. Many of us who have not had experience in the topic struggled with the pace. I think if he had some quick instructions on how to do graphs it would help. The book had little examples of problems with math, and often time do not label axis, so we struggle to understand methods for solving problems. I think the course is just to fast, for the amount of organization and guidance put in.",
    "Lectures were very good. Problem sets were close to what material was covered in class. I felt the textbook was ambiguous in its questions, and I felt the examples could have been better.",
    "The class is so relevant, though I don't think I learned as much as I would have liked.",
    "Great",
    "Solid intro to microecon with application to health markets. Well organized, problem sets tested knowledge learned in lecture, practice exams were helpful in studying for midterm and final",
    "The course is entitled \"Microeconomics for Healthcare Professionals;\" however, the course could have just been called \"microeconomics.\" While Dr. Moore did a great job incorporating the book material into health applications, most of the material learned dealt more with economics basics as opposed to healthcare issues.I wish the course focused more exclusively on healthcare related economics.",
    "While the teacher was very engaged and prepared for the class, he seemed to be out of touch with the skill level of the students when teaching the material. Many times he would quickly scribble up a problem, say \"ok yep and questions.\" The class would just sit there stunned looking at each other not knowing what to ask. My assumption is that he is not used to teaching an into to economics type course and it was not easy to realize these concepts he is burned to memory were completely new to many of us.",
    "This course is very important. The instructor must realize that the material is taught at a very fast pace to people that might not have had previous exposure to any type of economics training.Having a carefully drawn road up for each leasson is very important in order to make the material more effective and well taught (an example how intro to epi presents the material). It would be great if the instructor was to (1) provide his written class notes, (2) indicate that students should buy ONE specific edition of the text, (3) instead of assigning book chapters, the professor should assign the pages and sections of the book that will be covered.Since the order was not very clear at the beginning, I felt I ended up teaching the material to myself and not getting a lot out of lecture.I loved the idea of having \"review\" questions due before each class, that really helped me be on top of the readings before class and understand the material better.",
    "Very useful however not easily understood by those with no econ background",
    "This course was HORRENDOUS. I was very excited to take Microecon, as I do not have any background in economics and recognize its value relative to my career goals. This course was very poorly organized. The syllabus changed at least 5 times over the course of the semester, making it hard to know what the correct reading assignment was and when homework was due. The course was also structured very poorly, where concepts that build off of each other were taught in the incorrect order, making comprehension of the material nearly impossible. I was frustrated in every class, writing copious notes that I was never able to understand later. Further, there was talk that the book used for this course was written for upper level econ students, perhaps even PhD level. While I am sure of the validity of that statement, I agree that it was not suitable for an introductory level microeconomics class.",
    "I feel that the course took off too quickly in the beginning when learning about the basic microecon concepts. It was hard to establish the necessary foundation for the rest of the semester. That did change as the semester went on, and I feel that during the second half of the semester it was much easier to learn. Having the class twice a week, instead of once, would have helped, as well as a possible TA discussion each week to help cement the concepts.",
    "Enjoyed the course and learned a great deal. Challenging but enjoyable",
    "Excellent.There needs to be two session dedicated this course.The 2 hour time slot is too short.",
    "Strengths: Comprehensive syllabus and definitely a graduate level econ courseWeaknesses: The basics were not very well covered and sometimes i felt it was presumed that students would have some econ\/calculus foundation.",
    "Very conflicted about this course. It wasn't really micro for healthcare professionals, more like micro taken by healthcare professionals. It was basically just an econ course. Very limited examples pulled from the HC world though the prof, to his credit, did increase this number as the course went on (a bit).The subject matter was also pretty tough. He moved at a pretty fast clip. I didn't have any trouble keeping up because I've already taken a few micro courses but other people did. He kind of remedied this by grading the tests very leniently which was nice. I think he is used to teaching people who already have some exposure to economics or at least a large interest in it.I wasn't a fan of the books. One of the books was by Milton Friedman's kid and it read like it and the other, primary book was entitled tellingly entitled \"price theory.\" Their was a conservative slant to everything. Many of the readings were from Chicago school guys, perhaps predictably so, given the prof's history. He didn't once acknowledge the limitations of the hyper rational chicago school economics he was teaching. Seemed to have largely ignored the behavioral economics findings of the last 20 years.I don't think this would have been too nuanced for a semester long course, either, particularly since we spent entire lectures on topics as obscure (and, in my view, meaningless, particularly in HC) as Coase's Theorom.I also think he spent too much time on graphs and not enough on theory and ideas. Since we only have a semester of econ I think he should have spent more time on, for instance, what Dead Weight Loss IS and less on how to graph its existence with regards to monopolies etc. But I get this is how econ is taught everywhere (thanks Marshall) so it's kind of a cavil.Despite all of these complaints I actually liked the course and I think Moore knows his econ and he knows how to teach it. Maybe just not to Public Health students, yet.",
    "This course will make much more sense if you read the textbook before going to class.The Landsberg text is golden and there is a strong amount of repetition of concepts.The lectures are great because there is no powerpoint. It is all white board writing. This helps me personally. B\/c you start from scratch.Could be better if- final was a take home exam or open book. You will get a cheat sheet for the final though- there should a greater emphasis on the practical implications of microecon rather than the theory. The 2nd half of the term the prof did more example-based practical presentations and it was much easier to appreciate the course than in the first half of the term",
    "Very difficult for those without a background in economics. Prof. Moore did a much better job of slowing things down and slowly going through application of the material in the second half rather than the first.",
    "The course provided a good foundation in economic principles that will be useful for those going into healthcare professions. I think the key strength was the breadth of topics covered in the class. However, a related weakness in my opinion was the speed of the class. The amount of time for lectures did not seem adequate for questions from students or detailed explanations of problems. Since much of the course was based on the text book, it would have been very helpful to have more time for discussion. The course should either meet more than once per week or have sections. I also thought that the exam format did not reflect the content presentation well. I felt that I learned a lot from the course but wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to demonstrate that due to the way the exams were designed.",
    "no power points, brilliant proffesor",
    "Would rather have taken a microeconomics course at the College or SOM. This was poorly structured and disorganized."

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0He is knowledgeable and funny.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0I enjoyed having Professor Moore as an instructor this semester. He was always willing to answer questions both inside and outside of class. I think I would have been better able to understand the concepts if time was taken to very explicitly define economic terms and to establish more slowly the basic concepts of economics before moving on to more challenging concepts. I realize that it must be quite difficult to teach a course in which some students know nothing about economics and others were economics majors. It was great when Professor Moore used health-related examples to illustrate the concepts, because I think we all connected with the material in this way. It was also great to hear about Professor Moore's work on the economics behind youthful alcohol consumption. Overall, it was clear that Professor Moore cared about us as students and was willing to help.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Prof. Moore is very knowledgeable and professional. I like how he asked us to read the book before class - this is definitely helpful. I hope he could slow down his pace a bit, especially in sections before midterm. For beginners in microeconomics, the first few classes were really hard to keep up with.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore is a great teacher and very knowledgeable. This course is very challenging (esp with the set up of 1 lecture a week). This was not the professors fault. The material is difficult. However, I personally have begun using econ in my every day life, in my conversations with friends and way of thinking. Professor Moore is a great teacher and I feel next year if you make this class a Tues\/Thurs course and have a quiz every 3 weeks instead (no midterm) - I think students will have a lot better time taking the course!",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore wants to be here and takes time to be with the students. He is very personable and willing to help. No recommendations on what to improve.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0He needs to prepare classes in advance. His examples aren't very good and are very few.",

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0very good instructor",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Very good, however, fast",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0He was more theoretical that I had anticipated, but it was a good change from other Econ professors that I have had in undergrad. I was actively engaged throughout each lecture and learned a ton.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a01. Not very responsive to student's suggestions or questions. His answer to student's question is never directly to the point.2. In class, he never introduced the important and fundamental econ concepts that most of students didn't know. A lot of the times in class, I found myself listening to him giving real-life examples of a \"econ theory\" for half an hour, without even knowing what that theory really is, because he didn't make it clear at the beginning.3. The lecture part is very disorganized. There is no special emphasize on important concepts. In fact, he almost always spent way more time on less important concepts than important concepts.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0I do not like his style of teaching. His handwriting on the blackboard is not easy to follow and he advances topics without giving sufficient background introductions. Somehow I found it difficult to learn in his class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0- Cares a lot about his students' learning, which I appreciated.- Lectures could have been at a slower pace, because it was a lot of new content all at once.- Very smart and clearly passionate about economics. Though there's a difference between his aptitude of the topics and an intro class. Sometimes it can be difficult to close that gap. But what I liked about Professor Moore is that he pushed his students. He wasn't teaching at an intro level, but was really aiming to get students to become critical thinkers.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore is incredibly fun and brilliant. He was definitely passionate about the subject matter and really knew what he was talking about. He is also extremely approachable and personable outside of the classroom.My complaints spawn from the fact that I think he didn't have a lot of experience teaching this material to a group with a diverse background (not simply econ people). We went through the basics very quickly, and I personally felt left behind a few times. I bet if he taught the course again, he would spend less time on some nitty gritty economics and focus more on application in healthcare.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore is knowledgeable and organized. However, he sometimes provides explanations that are not accessible to microeconomics virgins (that is, virgins to discipline of microeconomics). I recognize that this may not be a simple task, because he must cater to students with a range of backgrounds.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Seems interested in teaching, but really only cares about those who already get economics.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore is a great instructor. He was very receptive and responsive to any difficulties we had and adjusted the course accordingly. I really appreciated this. I also liked the format of the homework for the second part of the course. The review questions ensured that we looked over the material before class that week.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0He is good but if he just even made his lecture notes available, we could do less graph copying and more note taking\/listening critically. It is very hard to pay attention and draw all the graphs that he is putting up. (Maybe power point or copies of the notes he brings to assist him with his lecture?)He is very nice, and it is wonderful to hear him relate things and put matter into perspective.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Dr. Moore is very skilled in Economics. I enjoyed his real world experience being brought to the classroom. The beginning of the class went a little fast, but overall I thought it was very comprehensive.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Great professor who seems to truly care. I think sometimes he went on tangents that left the students feeling lost, but they really added to the learning process for those who tried to follow and at least recognize what was beyond the scope of the class.",

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0I really liked Prof. Moore. I think he was passionate about the material and really cared if the students understood the material. I would encourage more tools for the students in order to make his material easy to follow and retain.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Dr. Moore knows his subject, and communicates his well. I sincerely appreciate his dedication to planning lessons and crafting the course. It was always clear he put a great deal of thought into it. Sometimes, however, this was to the detriment of the class environment. If a student had a question that didn't fall into his timeline, then Moore quite often ignored it or brushed off the student - but not always politely.I also wished that he relied a little less on his teaching assistant. I pay a lot of money to be here, and I don't think it's too much to ask for him to create the answer key to an exam himself.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Very smart however did not explain concepts well to those without a background in finance\/economics",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0I found Professor Moore to be a horribly unsuccessful teacher. He taught important concepts out of context, often very quickly and without examples of how to apply them, then assumed we had mastered the information. When he did provide examples, he often confused himself with the numbers and would get 20 minutes into the problem when he realized he had made a mistake and would tell us to disregard what had just happened. I would read the chapters prior to class feeling somewhat confident in my understanding of the material and would then leave class feeling as if I had just unlearned the material during the lecture. There were very few examples of how these concepts applied to the world of healthcare, which seems odd for a course called \"Microeconomics for HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS.\" When I asked a question, Professor Moore was usually unable to answer the question or would simply give me the numerical answer without explaining the process required to obtain the answer. My fellow classmates and I were constantly confused and griping about this course and his teaching style. Also, Professor Moore was horrible about communicating with the class; he often sent an email out with incorrect dates, times, chapter numbers, problem numbers, etc, only to send out about 5 correction emails soon after.I believe that Professor Moore is great at economics, but I do not believe he is well suited for teaching an introductory level course. Overall, I am very disappointed in this course and am afraid I will struggle in future courses because I did not get the economics foundation I needed in this introductory course.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Dr. Moore was a great professor, very knowledgeable and open to feedback. Despite the initial fast-pace of the course in the beginning, I feel that I learned a lot from him.",

Even made us coffee!Super smart guy, and an even a better person.Enjoyed chatting with him before and after classes - always had a smile on his face and had a great way of explaining difficult concepts.He's an asset to the Yale community.",

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Very friendly\/outgoing to students, but wish Prof. Moore would have included slides or some materials other than the blackboard when explaining the difficult concepts. Difficult to go back to lecture notes sometimes and understand some material. The midterm&finals tested in large part some material and formulas not emphasized in the text book but given in review session, which didn't seem fair to those not focused on the sessions.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore was approachable and open to discuss concepts with students during office hours and by email. I appreciated his expertise and the real-life examples he brought to the classroom. I thought he moved through the material a bit too quickly in light of how new the concepts were to most students. I would have liked less concentration on the text book, and more on healthcare-related reading material. I believe I got more out of individual Q&A with Professor Moore than from lectures.",

    "Aditya was a great TA, he gave up a lot of time to answer questions and was really supportive during office hours. He was also really knowledgeable.",
    "Aditya was very adept with the material. However, I did not like the method he used to go over questions. I understand that he wanted the students to try to solve the problems on their own with his guidance, but providing a little more direct guidance and answers would have been better in helping students go through the homework. Ultimately, his method deterred students from seeking help.",
    "He was very helpful and knowledgable",
    "Aditya did a good job considering the challenges of his position. Aditya often had to pick up the slack of Professor Moore, who left a lot of loopholes open and tasks undone. Aditya also had the task of reteaching the information when Professor Moore taught it in an incomprehensible manner.",
    "Aditya was a good TA, though I feel that he was overworked and could use a second or third TA to help him.",
    "Aditya was selectively responsive. He did not address all enquiries by email and that was discouraging.However, he was very good with sending class-wide emails.I think this class needs two emails. Aditya was not always available for appointments.",
    "Aditya: TA was excellent and he knew his subject very well. He was very responsive to questions and all in all a good TA.",
    "Nice guy, helpful.",
    "Great TA.Aditya was great and explaining. He is able to relate concepts in class to things that the students can already relate to.Almost like \"econ for dummies\" was his playbook. Great work.",
    "Helpful and eager to help.",
    "Aditya was great in that he explained problem set solutions well in person. However, because I could not personally attend his office hours (class conflict), I was unable to benefit from them. I think that having only one TA for such a large class was not sufficient. A section time to meet with TAs would be beneficial for the course.",
    "TA very nice and attentive"

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it to everybody !!!",
    "After all, Econ is important to learn.",
    "I would recommend this course to others who want to gain a basic understanding ofmicroeconomics for careers in the healthcare field, but I would definitely make them aware of the challenging nature of the course.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. This class is difficult, but I have learned a lot.",
    "If you want to learn about micro take the class!",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "I think examples are basic in fully understanding economics theory. It doesn't provide solid foundations on which to build upon for future health policy analysis.",
    "Meh.",
    "Yes I would recommend.",
    "Higher level economics than for public health professional",
    "I would recommend it if the student is prepared to do a lot of work to really learn. It is a great course, and I learned a lot.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student.",
    "Very useful, I heard the economics professor at the Management School is way better.",
    "I've come to think more critically issues about the health policy issues that I hear now. It's fantastic to see that growth in my thinking. So I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to play a decision-making role in health care.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this course to someone who really wanted to learn how microeconomics is practiced in healthcare because I don't think we spent enough time on it. I really enjoyed Professor Moore, but I think the course should be altered a bit to focus more on understanding healthcare through the lens of an economist.",
    "Good introductory course to microeconomics. Though you won't get to any advanced microeconomic theory, the course broadened my view of modern day healthcare issues and has introduced me to a new way of thinking. For those with no prior background in the subject, learning the material will take longer, but it is not out of reach.",
    "This has the potential to be a great\/important course for giving everyone a solid background in economics. Instead, it is a circus of confusion that leave most students frustrated.",
    "Necessary course for HPM students.",
    "read ahead so you can take notes on only thing things you need, and always ask questions if you get confused. The course is great and essential in my opinion, but also very challenging.",
    "I throughly enjoyed the Economic concepts applied to the healthcare field. I think it is vital to understand this view of the healthcare field using economic modeling.",
    "The class is a must if you are in policy or management, though you might learn more Microecon from a version at another school at Yale.",
    "amazing",
    "Everyone should have a working knowledge of basic economics, especially if you plan to have a career in public health. This is a good course to take.",
    "The course provides an introduction to economics, with a little emphasis on healthcare.",
    "Expect forthis course to move fast, especially in the beginning. If you are not someone who picks up on this concepts very quickly you will struggle. It also have very limited health care applications, so acts for as a general intro to micro econ.",
    "It's a really difficult class, especially if you have no economics background. It is, in the end useful, and you do learn a lot.",
    "Flat out, I would not take this course with Professor Moore unless you have to or unless you were an Econ major in college and can figure out the material yourself. I feel like I have as little of an understanding of econ as I did before I took this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It moves a little fast in the beginning, but not so fast that you will be lost.",
    "Yes",
    "I took this course as an elective and hence it turned out to be stressful than I predicted it to be. I would recommend it to any health care professional but just be ready to put some effort. I loved what I learnt.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in econ, PH student or not. For those without an interest in the topic I'd be on the fence about it.",
    "5 problem sets - ie homework-- only graded for completion.a participation mark... Its better for you if you participate just because you stay more engagedinclass midterm. take 1 cheat sheet which is double sided 8.5 x 11. You can cram as much or as little as you want on it.One in class final - same deal.Both exams are 2 hours in length as are the once-a-week classes.",
    "The material is very interesting, but the course should be improved in some ways.",
    "highly recommend",
    "Would NOT recommend the course to another student."
