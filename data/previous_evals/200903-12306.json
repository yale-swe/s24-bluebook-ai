    "There isn't much week to week work, and each week its just reading, but there is a 20-30 page paper at the end. As long as you prepare that early enough, this will be a pretty stress-free class.",
    "I highly recommend this class because you get to read more than just the Invisible man.",
    "Very good course. A little boring\/slow at times in seminar, but Prof. Stepto makes so many insightful observations that you leave class with a extremely profound appreciation for Ralph Ellison and Invisible Man.The weekly student presentations aren't especially burdensome, and they allow each class to be split up in a nice way. They're also, for the most part, genuinely interesting and allow other students to learn really specific Ellison-related topics in depth.If you're not particularly enchanted with Ellison, obviously this class isn't for you. Otherwise, it's a very solid English seminar."
