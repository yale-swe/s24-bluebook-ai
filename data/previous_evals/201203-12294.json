    "Take it!! Read the readings. They are interesting but kind of long. The assignments are fun, and the paper at the end really makes this class awesome. Professor Harms is really fun and interesting, and he is also organized and approachable.",
    "if you're interested in the region this is a great class that covers all the major themes of the region, including the idea of a 'constructed' southeast asia.",
    "Great overview of Modern Southeast Asia. I've never been there (was the only one in the class who hadn't) but I didn't necessarily feel out of place, I just learned a lot more than I was expecting.",
    "This course is a survey course of culture, history, politics, and economics in Southeast Asia. I would recommend this class for anyone interested in the region and the modern problems it faces today. Most of the students in the class were from Southeast Asia, but there were a handful who weren't and who were simply passionate about the region. The class structure is a seminar with daily discussions on the readings and a few papers and projects are assigned throughout the course. The final paper is doable and fun, in that you are able to pick any topic that interests you and write about it. All in all, this is a great class and I highly recommend anyone interested in Southeast Asia.",
    "Professor Harms' class was very interesting, but also very broad. We had readings each week from different countries and regions in Southeast Asia, which could sometimes get confusing. The class was also mostly discussion based, rather than half discussion, half lecture, as it was advertised (which i feel would have been more effective for my learning style). However, Professor Harms is funny, sweet, and very kind. He had some wonderful insights that really made me question modernity, cultural norms, and widely held beliefs about nations and southeast asia.The final paper and midterm paper were great ways to evaluate how well I could apply the theoretical concepts we were learning in class. I also really appreciated professor harms' writing exercise where we had to write creatively based on a picture, which i thought was a cool blending of disciplines to yield a more interesting product.",
    "This course is great! All of the topics discussed are very interesting and thought-provoking, and there is a great community feel. I wish that Professor Harms had lectured more though. He put a lot of emphasis on discussion and participation, but the few lectures he did were the best part of the course. General overview of geography, questions of modernization, and development in Southeast Asia, and the chance to focus in on topics that are most interesting to you. Lots of writing for a non-writing course, but definitely not an overwhelming amount.",
    "As a first semester freshman coming from Southeast Asia, this was my favorite course. It's very comprehensive because of the way it's structured, which is one theme every week: Ethno-linguistic diversity, religion and cosmology, political systems, etc. At the same time, the readings and discussion-based classroom allows very in-depth thinking about different issues that Southeast Asia has to face. The workload is very manageable with 5 reading responses, a mid-term paper and a final-paper, and the fact that Professor Harms is very flexible and willing to take suggestions\/make changes with the work helps a lot. Definitely take it if you're interested in the region.",
    "ANTH 244 was an absolutely wonderful course. Although it was my first course on Southeast Asia, I didn't feel overwhelmed by the course content and came away learning a significant amount about the region. Topics ranging from music to gender dynamics were covered, and while it seemed like a lot to take in, Professor Harms did a phenomenal job of breaking everything down into manageable bits. It is also a great course for those interested in anthropology, as the course is presented through an anthropological lens.",
    "Take this class if you have a deep interest in Southeast Asia. I would definitely recommend it if you do. You come out of the class, if you do most of the readings, having learned a ton about the region.",
    "I would recommend taking this course as a freshman or a sophomore because Professor Harms really helps you through the process of analyzing dense texts and incorporating them in a research paper in a way that you probably haven't done before in high school or even in your first few semesters at Yale. I don't think you're ever going to be able to do all of the reading (it's a lot!), but that's okay. Overall, ANTH 244 was a fun anthropology course and a good fifth class.",
    "It was a great survey course of SE Asia. Definitely recommend to anyone that is interested.",
    "Yes! Definitely! The class is great because Professor Harms is a really enthusiastic professor and discussion leader. I always felt in control in this class and knew how I was going to be evaluated, which was awesome. The course was well organized, and full of interesting information. I like the thematic approach that Professor Harms used as opposed to the country-based approached to teaching this course. Thinking about South East Asia through the lenses of modernity was incredibly interesting and valuable for me. Professor Harms is very approachable and provides very useful and detailed feedback throughout the course, which I thought was helpful when we had to write our final essays. He is also engaging and funny and a great lecturer and seminar leader.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in Southeast Asia and for anyone interested in anthropology. You will learn a lot. Not having taken a true anthropology course before, it took me a while to get comfortable discussing themes in an anthropological context.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in Southeast Asia today. The class size is relatively small but not too small, the reading\/assignments are all reasonable, and you really get to focus your assignments on the things that you are particularly interested in learning. Professor Harms is really awesome.",
    "An introduction to the anthropological study of Southeast Asia. This is a great class. Good readings, well-designed syllabus, lots of feedback throughout the semester, and a variety of assignments that let students go deeper into topics of personal interest. Professor Harms is sharp and supportive. The class works equally well for both dyed-in-the-wool anthro majors and newcomers to the discipline."
