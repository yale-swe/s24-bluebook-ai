    "Great way to combine an academic approach to baroque music and history with a professional opera production.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! IT IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE AT YALE. The workload for the first half of the semester depends on the size of your part. The workload is pretty heavy the second half of the semester is pretty heavy regardless of the size of your part. This class is a professional production. It is an incredible opportunity. Unless you are planning on being a professional singer, you will never have another opportunity like it. If you are planning on being a professional singer, it is great training and looks great on a resume.",
    "An incredible opportunity to work closely with a work in its historical and artistic context, bringing together a fantastically talented group of artists to put together a premier class production.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. How could you not? It's a chance for basically any person to get involved in some incredible opera with fabulous production values working with the best in the business. Because Baroque opera doesn't always take the same kind of big voice & crazy training that more modern opera does, singers who have thought about trying opera but been scared off by the vibrato and all can have an extremely rewarding experience with classical music. Must take!",
    "Best class ever! First half approaches the opera academically; second half is the production itself. I couldn't think of a better way to engage with a topic and field than to work with the best of the best in the field. Ellen Rosand's enthusiasm for this program is contagious, Toni Dorfman's dedication to specificity and detail keep the endeavor academic and personal, and Grant Herreid teaches us how to make 400 year old music come to life. What a joy.",
    "Must-take for anyone serious about a career in music after college. Baroque music is the bomb, and Grant and Toni are life-changing. Show week and tech during reading and finals is an absolute nightmare, though; time this course so you take it along with an otherwise light load or you will do poorly in your other classes."
