    "English 115 is a great freshman literature course. It allows students to improve their writing like English 114, but through the lens of literature. I would definitely recommend the class to another student if they would like to focus on college writing and have a strong interest in literature.",
    "As a whole I thought ENGL 115 was pretty similar to my high school english class. It mostly consisted of reading a book outside of class and then discussing it in class. I thought the course was very interesting and I like how it focused on a single topic. I thoroughly enjoyed each of the books I read in this class. I would recommend it to another student as long as they enjoy writing about literature. I don't think I entered this class fully prepared to write about literature; I was looking for a writing class that would help me more with scientific kinds of writing. However, I still enjoyed the class and definitely felt like my writing improved.",
    "It was a great class! The content was generally interesting, and class was very enjoyable. Professor Richards is lots of fun, and makes the 9 am time slot seem not as bad.",
    "This is a great class that leads you through literary jewels while also keeping in mind the larger humanitarian picture. Most of the in class discussions helped me in understanding the context of the books and also allowed for better appreciation of literary techniques. There is a small but significant amount of time spent on leaning how to write an argumentative essay and how to conduct research. With the interesting books and topics and an excellent instructor, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "ENGL 115 with Professor Richards was a fantastic course! Class time was interesting and engaging, assignments were challenging in the best way, and the readings themselves were so interesting. I especially loved the diverse range of perspectives we received from the literature we read--the authors were all of completely different backgrounds and I think it's rare to have such diversity in readings. Professor Richards is fantastic as well, she made class something to look forward to, even if it was at 9am."
