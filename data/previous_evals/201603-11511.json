   "comments": [
    "Basic intuition of game theory",
    "Knowledge: Learned how to model a variety of games, or interactions, that can occur between different players ranging from countries, to doctors and patients, to couples deciding between entertainment options. Skills: Using diagrams and basic mathematics to describe how various actors would behave in various situations, assuming rationality. Insights: Though rationality is a strong assumption for human beings, it gives users of game theory a systematic way of explaining\/predicting behavior in a wide variety of scenarios.",
    "Taking this course helped me develop my logical thinking, creative problem-solving, and communication.",
    "I got better at game theory...",
    "Learned a lot about how to model political decision-making.",
    "I'm not quite sure what I learned in this course. The basics of Game Theory I guess.",
    "This semester, in Game Theory and Political Science, I have applied economic models to represent and solve real-world dilemmas. The math used to substantiate normative claims in this classes has set the necessary groundwork for me to approach and model broader issues.",
    "I learned game theory but basic game theory and it was awesome.",
    "The course covers particularly basic theoretical models of game theory it from time to time frames this in political terms, but mostly works on developing skills of logic and rational thought in application to developing reasoned strategies in a series of different modeled scenarios.",
    "I have taken introduction to game theory, but this course brought the concepts of game theory to a new level by addressing them in real-world applications that are very relevant and thought-provoking. I learned more about decision making processes and the complex nature of the political system through the eyes of game theory. Skill-wise, I was challenged to think both theoretically and practically and to use a combination of logic and skills learned in class to solve problems. I now see game theory in an entirely different light and have the insight to think about the many facets of how decisions and strategies are made.",
    "quantitative reasoning, a lot more math than you think! She is a terrible teacher and you don't actually learn in class, so you have to teach everything to yourself.",
    "Fantastic introduction to Game Theory. Professor Beim made examples really clear and I developed a good understanding of how games are applied to political science.",
    "As an English major wary of QR classes generally, I entered this class worried it would be over my head. Instead, I found the course engaging, topical, and just the right difficulty. I learned how to think about games, game modeling, and how to apply game theoretic principles to bear on everyday life. The math was very light (only a formula or two to memorize) and the problem sets were always fun to work through. I think I developed better critical thinking skills and learned about a field which I previously knew very little about. As someone planning to attend Law School, this course was really on target in terms of the logic games and stepwise thinking it involved. I am happy I took this course as my final QR at Yale!",
    "My understanding of game theory concepts greatly increased",
    "im better at thinking thru decisions in almost every context now.",
    "I learned basic game theory (solving normal and extensive-form games) which I began to think about in relation to the world around me.",
    "If you have to choose between getting mauled by a bear and taking this class, choose the bear. This was by far the worst class I've ever taken in my entire life. This class was literally more useless than nipples on men. My God. The TA's were a literal joke. I don't think my TA ever actually gave a direct, complete answer to a question in section all year. But here's the fucking worst part of it: our section TAs don't grade our p-sets. Some other asshole apparently does, and we spend the first 15 minutes of section talking to TAs and getting points back. The p-sets were either too easy, too hard, or too fucking long to be useful. I went to every section and lecture, and I've never felt more lost in a class before. I swear to God Almighty that if I hear another TA say \"I can't really explain this because I don't know why, but you know what I mean\" I will.....I couldn't think of anything, but mark my words it'll be pretty bad. Fuck this class.",
    "Problem solving skills. General logical reasoning. Sometimes illogical reasoning.",
    "Learned very little.",
    "I gained an introductory general background in game theory. It was extremely interesting and I learned a lot within the classroom.",
    "I learned about basic and complex game theory and how to model political science questions. This course helped me develop my problem solving skills by understanding the various ways that a problem can solved through modeling",
    "I learned about various types of games and their application to political science.",
    "The class gave a good introduction to game theory in a political context, one that I intend to use in future papers as a method of inquiry. In analyzing the structure of institutions, I expect to use at the very least the intuitions I honed in this class and certainly some of the game structures we discussed. Some of the later topics I wish we spent more time on, as they offered skills more relevant to my studies.",
    "I loved this class. Very interesting material and well taught. The problem sets were manageable and the tests were not too hard if you paid attention in class and did the problem sets.",
    "This is an extremely interesting course as it links game theory with phenomena around us such as voting. By taking this course, one gets a flavor of how game theory could be used by many political players.",
    "In this course we used mathematical constructs as tools to understand how the human mind makes decisions.",
    "I think I have a (very) basic understanding of game theory, although I would not be able to apply it to anything except for very select, ultra-simple situations. I don't think I could use game theory in my broader decision-making processes, or when thinking about the news.",
    "I feel like this course really supplemented my perspective on the world. I feel like I consider decisions in a more quantitative, structured way and that I have gained a stronger insight into the theory of how people (especially bodies of power) operate.",
    "This class was a good introduction to game theory.",
    "I learned a new approach to solving strategic dilemmas within a specified criteria of framework conditions and assumptions.",
    "I learned an entirely different way of thinking about decision making and political science. While the class had a focus on quantitative reasoning, I don't think I was properly prepared for the level of problem solving using mathematics that appeared on problem sets.",
    "None. I learned nothing remotely practical in this course and the only interesting\/useful information most students could potentially get from this course, they would already know if they had taken a highschool level Econ course.",
    "As my introduction to Game Theory, I found it very interesting to look at decision making in a rigorous, methodical way.",
    "I developed insight in to an area of study and a method of thinking that I had not previously known anything about.",
    "I gained a lot of new insight into game theory as a whole which I now actually use every day.",
    "Before taking this course I knew only basic concepts like the Prisoner's Dilemma and utility. Now I feel I have a solid understanding of the basic ways to use Nash and Bayesian Equilibria to make decisions or understand outcomes. It was a cool new way of thinking.",
    "Game Theory is applicable even in social situations.",
    "I learned to model (political, economic, social) situations using rational choice theory.",
    "I came in only knowing what Prisoners Dilemma was and now I know about complex games. You really start with the basics of basics and end with super complex games."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lecture component was fine, but everything else was lacking. The feedback on problem sets from TAs was not very helpful, and neither exactly were the TAs. Standardized solutions should be provided for the psets and the midterm; otherwise, the students are left having to ask each other or the TAs who sometimes contradict each other. Not to mention, the TA that is grading your homework is NOT the TA that conducts your section, so the TA has to first interpret what the other TA wrote in order to help you. It is needlessly convoluted. There was a very large discrepancy between some of the psets and the midterm; the former could be much more difficult than the latter. Not to mention, the grading is done slowly. I find it absolutely ridiculous that solutions were not provided for the MIDTERM.",
    "There are no solutions to any of the psets which made studying very frustrating and made section overcrowded. It was not an efficient use of time nor resources",
    "This is a good course, but it often felt like we covered the most basic concepts in class, and were surprised by very challenging concepts on problem sets later without much guidance as to how to go about solving the problems. Because the TFs don't know the answers to PSets and couldn't figure the answers out themselves, the PSets were never posted online, and we rarely went over the concepts on the PSets in class, this class sometimes seemed impossible.",
    "Strengths: Introduces an important method in several fields in a way that is accessible to Yale students from all academic backgrounds. Weaknesses: First, I know it is tough to get really deep into a topic during 50 minutes, but I felt that sometimes we should have done more complicated examples in class so as to be prepared for the psets. Second, it would really help to have pset solutions posted. I know that this can be a cause for concern regarding future classes, but most econ classes do it, and it would really help clarify how to do the problems. My experiences attending two different sections were very different, and so I think having uniform solutions would help improve the coherence of the course.",
    "The course was organized very well, and I do not believe there were any particular weaknesses. At times our problem sets were related somewhat tangentially to our in-class work, which was frustrating because it made it difficult to complete the work oneself without going to office hours.",
    "Strengths: Weaknesses: TF's always seemed to be on a different page than the professor, and sometimes taught us things or used examples that were just wrong! The class had much more game theory than political science - in fact I don't really feel like I learned any poli sci from this course. The problem sets were a whole host of different difficulties and often didn't do a good job of lining up with what we were learning in class. We got off from the syllabus as well.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Beim is very sweet and if you go to office hours, she does a good job of explaining things. Learned a lot. Weaknesses: Problem sets often included concepts that either won't taught in lecture or weren't covered in very much detail during lecture. Also I found the textbook really confusing.",
    "This course would be better if what we were taught in class was better represented on the problem sets. Also, there should be written out powerpoint slides that are later posted on Classes V2. Finally, section should be optional and not mandatory.",
    "So the lectures were interesting and easy to folllow. Professor Beim is a good instructor, but the problem sets were a huge problem. It was like being taught the most basic concepts and then suddenly being asked to do graduate level problem sets. I'd definitely make the psets more reasonable.",
    "I think that this course could be improved by being conducted in a seminar format in which we focus more on applying the game theoretic logic and procedures to real-world issues that we choose to examine. Perhaps instead of a final exam, we could choose a current issue to model with a technique used in the class with policy production in mind.",
    "weaknesses: psets and lack of coordination between the TAs strength: game theory is pretty cool and so was my TA",
    "Strengths are probably that the course content isn't exceptionally strenuous, and that it yields a QR credit in the Political Science department. Weakness are plenty however the lectures were typically just about engaging enough to follow, but almost exclusively conceptual or theoretical with to little to know broader applications of the concepts; making the whole endeavour feel pretty useless. The sections were exceptionally poorly taught and run, as was the format of the assignments and assessments. The TFs clearly had little to no familiarity with the material of the course, and often gave conflicting advice for dealing with the problems sets (which ranged from absurdly difficult and time-consuming to disconcertingly easy with absolutely no rhyme or reason...)",
    "Strengths: the material itself is inherently fairly interesting, and Professor Beim taught it well. Weaknesses: the problem sets were disproportionately hard compared to the lectures and exams, and we were not given adequate support to complete them (you needed more information than class would give you, and the TFs struggled themselves to solve them, and even more to teach them). Overall, the TFs were not good at explaining game theoretical concepts, all gave contradictory information about how to write answers\/what we needed to know\/even what the answers should be. One exception: Ignacio was excellent.",
    "Pretty weak class. Very few concepts covered and PSets were hastily made.",
    "Major weakness was that some of the problem sets were just too challenging and there was no curve, nor were we given any insight into solving them. Many of them tackled problems we had never learned to solve in class, and we were specifically not allowed to ask our TF's for help. There was also a decent amount of vague information taught in the class, and the final was WAY off from the midterm in terms of what types of questions were asked and how we were supposed to apply our knowledge. Overall, midterm was very fair, final was somewhat unreasonable, and problem sets were hit or miss in terms of how accessible and educational they were. The professor, however, was pretty good, although she never posted notes and often covered concepts too quickly or too much so that there was an imbalance between what was taught in class and how it was expected to be applied.",
    "Should be curved, there should be practice problems, the answers to the p-sets should be posted. lecture should teach us concepts and how to do problems. not just show us examples. the TA's should know how to do the problems and communicate with the professor Psets should be what we learned in lecture",
    "The TA's taught very differently from each other, and I think the course would be helped by providing clearer guidelines to them on how to teach certain concepts, examples, terminology that is and isn't appropriate, etc.",
    "The course was not repetitive, though it moved a little slowly and I didn't always see how the previous unit 'built' on the next. The lectures were very straightforward and generally easy to understand but for the beginning of the semester (until students began to complain) the problem sets were incomparably more difficult. That said, there's nothing wrong with a good challenge, and really I wouldn't recommend changing much about the P-sets (except to make them of a more consistent difficulty). The strength of this course lies in the fact that most students taking it have little to no prior experience with game theory, so the course was refreshingly devoid of the pompous econ-major types who strut about as if they know everything. The class and the professor clearly understood what kinds of students were in the class, and met us halfway. One final note: I watched a few of the Game Theory lectures which Ben Polak taught several years ago, and while they were mostly comparable, it seems the class was dumbed down a bit since then. He was an equally engaging lecturer, but I found I was being pushed to do more math\/formulaic thinking when watching those earlier lecturers. I wonder if, in the future, the lectures could incorporate that kind of material. It's nice to have a few formulas to use, even if they do require a bit more math.",
    "T.A.s should be more consistent with the professor in terms of terminology used and problem solving techniques taught.",
    "Professor Beim is charismatic and a very clear lecturer. However, I didn't feel like the \"Political Science\" part of the course factored in enough (actually, it factored in on the psets, when we didn't really know what was going on). It would have been great to have more of the real-world application discussion in lecture. Also, sections were essentially useless. I would've been happy with a longer lecture and no section; sections didn't help at all.",
    "Start with TAs who actually fucking know Game Theory. That might help. Then have those TAs grade the p-sets for their sections, or AT THE VERY FUCKING GODDAMN LEAST put the solutions to the P-sets online or something. This class wasn't worth the pain of running to several TAs in hopes that one of them would give an explanation that wasn't useless. Also lmfao at question 6. I received whatever the polar opposite of \"clear feedback that improved my learning\" was.",
    "It would be really helpful to have additional problem sets and practice questions to help study for exams.",
    "Strength is the pset style that lets students dive into more difficult problems. Weaknesses were the TA's who didn't really know what they were doing, the sometimes overly-complicated problem sets that the TA's didn't even know how to solve, and the general lack of clarity about what you're supposed to know how to do for the class.",
    "The course is very disorganized - the textbook is terrible, there are no lecture slides, no practice exams, etc.",
    "I believe this course gave a good introductory background, yet there was a large discrepancy between the problem sets and the actual tests. I wish there were more cohesive expectations - the problem sets were far more difficult than the tests, which made studying for the tests in the correct manner quite tricky.",
    "The course, overall, could be made more rigorous and could cover more topics. This would have been made easier with a more accessible text book that could have supplemented the lectures more effectively. Moreover, the textbooks should be replaced given that (a) they were significantly above the levels of the lectures (b) were not necessary to do well on the exams. The lectures did not always offer a clear and systematic way of solving problems, i.e. solving for a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium. The problem sets usually instructed this, but there was no indication in lecture how we could rigorously solve these problems. Also, it would have been nice for Prof. Beim to have posted problem set answers. Losing points on problem sets could not be a learning opportunity because it was unclear what concept we missed. Additionally, we could have finished the syllabus if we did not spend two classes playing games\/doing case studies. It probably would have been more helpful to have one student volunteer to play the game with Professor Beim to illustrate the concept. Strengths of the course included the political examples used to demonstrate concepts and fair exams that tested course material thoroughly",
    "Good format!",
    "I understand that the topic is game theory and political science, but it often felt just like game theory using political examples--it would be nice if supplemental readings were sent out to provide some of the connections between the method of inquiry and the political science topics. Professor Beim was a great lecturer, and I found her engaging in class, though at times I felt we moved too slowly.",
    "It is fairly flexible and the course instructor did not necessarily stick to the syllabus which was great as it meant that the pace was amazing! Professor Beim teaches the material really well and is one of the best teachers I am yet to have as she always makes sure everything is understood clearly before moving on. A slight weakness is that the chapters referred to in the syllabus from the textbook contain a lot of material which we don't cover in class and one then gets confused if you are meant to know that specific information or not.",
    "The course itself was good, although I wish there had been a way to go further into more real-world political examples\/applications. Prof Beim is great.",
    "I think the course was very much what it advertises to be: An introductory game theory class with simple math that also addresses its role within political systems. However, I would've liked to see more on the political science side, as I felt that it was mentioned more as an afterthought as opposed to an actual component of the class. Maybe provide more detailed analyses of how these games we discuss play roles in the world instead of just using characters from political topics in the games.",
    "The lectures were good, but basic. The textbook was almost useless. The problem sets were much more difficult than the examples given in lecture.",
    "Strengths: very clear lectures - Prof Beim is great, provided wonderful explanations Weaknesses: Teaching staff seemed confused and provided conflicting information. Problem sets didn't align well with lecture content - some of them were too difficult, some were too easy.",
    "Weaknesses: very little structure, level of classroom material didnt properly line up with the level of the textbooks (mathematics in particular) and very few opportunities to do practice problems (which are very difficult to find online) Strengths: connections to some policy papers was interesting",
    "The material was very cool but the pests were at an entirely different difficulty level than what was taught in class so much so that certain homework problems were incomprehensible.",
    "I really loved some aspects of the class, but also hated many as well. There were hardly any office hours for the amount of students there were, and of them, many were not conveniently scheduled for problem sets, which led to a small study room in Bass being full with thirty students all trying to receive help, but leaving most unable to. Most of the TF's were willing to help in office hours and during section, but did not put in any extra effort outside of these, so getting extra help was extremely difficult. A huge issue was the complete lack of an answer key for the problem sets. This made is hard to find out the proper way to solve problems, especially when I had many of my answers marked wrong by one TF, even though my answer was correct according to another TF. An answer key, even one that was only accessible for TF's, would have made it much easier to learn material. Problem sets were much more difficult than material covered in lecture, but possible to complete if office hours were attended. However, I found myself just copying what I was told to do rather than actually understanding what to do. The greatest strength of this course is definitely Professor Beim. She's a great lecturer and teacher, and I found myself consistently engaged. The way the material was applied to political science was also very interesting to learn. I overall was frustrated with the class because while I loved the subject, the course was not organized well and I often couldn't get the help I needed, since there were only a few students struggling.",
    "Strengths: none Weaknesses: uninteresting, non-useful material that is poorly taught",
    "Professor Beim could definitely have taught this course better. The problem sets did not align with her lectures at all. During the first class, she realized a PowerPoint presentation did not work well, so she showed all her notes with a slide projector that made it difficult for students to follow along. If you take this class, I would recommend that you follow along with the class through the textbook and visit your TA during office hours to get a hand on those problem sets.",
    "I found the topics interesting, but often felt like the TA's were on different pages when it came to how best to approach certain recurring problems.",
    "There was not enough supplementary material (problem set solutions, exam solutions, practice problems, ect.)",
    "Professor Beim is great! She is a wonderful teacher and always willing to help and accommodate. The course itself is a fascinating window in to the world of game theory, and allows you to develop a different way of thinking. The weaknesses of this course lie mostly in the textbook and teaching fellows- if you dont get something in class, go directly to professor Beim, as the textbooks are fairly useless.",
    "The course didn't have clear notes after lecture and the textbooks had little cross-over with the material in lecture. The level required to complete the problem sets was also far higher than the level required for the midterms. However, section was taught very well.",
    "The schedule was not terribly clear. The syllabus said there would be around 8 problem sets and there were six. It would have been helpful if that had been laid out ahead of time. I also feel that some of the concepts that were harder to understand did not appear on the problem sets and that practice would have been nice. Practice problems were readily available. A weakness of this class is the lack of standardization across sections. Some TAs would not help with problem sets at all and some would sit down and solve the problems with the students. There's also the lack of standardized notation. It can be confusing if the professor draws one thing one way and your TA does something differently. The problem sets were consistently way simpler than they seemed, but still a fair amount of work. I was just confused and often felt I was overlooking things that I was not actually overlooking.",
    "The biggest weakness with the course was the lack of resources available for students. Lecture notes were never posted, solutions to problems were never posted, practice exams or solutions to practice exams were never posted. The complete lack of resources in addition to not following the textbook very closely made the class exceedingly difficult to study for. Some people even expressed this after the first exam, but nothing was changed.",
    "I think the course would really benefit from a collection of notes that students can reference, this could be a powerpoint or at least a write up of the notes that Professor Beim uses for lectures. I feel that a substantial amount of review time could be decreased or better spent if students could reference class notes that they may have missed or had questions about.",
    "the psets did not reflect what we learned in class. One strength was that Professor Beim is great at answering everyones questions and making sure we understand the material. One weakness is that often times students were very confused because TFs would contradict eachtoher or sometimes not be familiar with the topics being discussed so it was difficult to clarify questions."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely not. I had to take this course for my major, but if I wasn't required to, I would have withdrawn as soon as I got my first pset back. The problems were not immediately obvious; the poor organization was only revealed once we started getting back our homework. I'd avoid this class if possible.",
    "There are no solutions to any of the psets which made studying very stressful and frustrating, as they are a lot harder than the material covered in lectures. But if you want to learn about game theory, this is a good class to take.",
    "VERY hard problem sets, but very easy grading.... seems like the TFs have no idea what is going on, so that can be frustrating at times, but overall most people received good grades.",
    "Unless some changes are made in the future, I would not recommend this course to most students. If you are an econ major, you can get major credit for it, but there are certainly better courses in the major (same if you are poli sci, and I'd assume EP&E). Game theory is an interesting way to look at decision-making, but if you plan on using it in the future you will need something more in-depth anyway. And really, aside from getting credit, that is the only reason you should consider taking it, because Professor Beim does cover the basics well. This class will give you practice playing with numbers, but it really won't teach you anything earth-shattering. And given all the things you already must do academically, I'd recommend going for other classes that really do open your mind.",
    "Definitely take Game Theory if you are looking for an interesting and creative QR, or simply want to learn about an intriguing and very practical branch of mathematics.",
    "No. The difficulty of the class comes from the fact that some of the problem sets are ridiculously hard for no reason, while others are super easy, making it impossible to tell how much time to devote to a problem set in a given week. The class is incredibly poorly organized.",
    "Yes, just be ready to put a lot of time in attending professor or TA's office hours.",
    "The course was useful to introduce students to a new method of analysis, but wasn't particularly stimulating most days.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course to another student because it is rather poorly organized. Professor Beim is nice and clearly very knowledgeable, but she often makes simple concepts seem complicated in her explanations of them.",
    "The lectures themselves were good, and the TA\"s were insanely helpful, but unless the psets change, dont take it. The lectures were your expected intro level game theory but the psets felt like they were more appropriate for graduate econ students. They took hours and still everyone I know struggled to do well on them. It was definitely a huge stress.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, because I think that this quantitative modeling approach to problems is valuable for the demographic that this class reaches--political science and non-STEM, non-math\/economics students.",
    "Yes!! Cool course. Different. Get the PLSC credit AND the QR AND you get to learn game theory!!",
    "If you have any interest in actually learning about what game theory is, you should probably take this in the Econ department. This is just about fine as an easy QR, if you find a good set of peers to collaborate with for the problem sets because those can just be wildly beyond the taught material of the class. The readings will be insufferably dry and boring and ultimately no one does them because they also don't seem to be actually tested, though the course claims to do so. The administration of the class was very haphazard, and overall a distinctly negative experience to have to sit through preparing for this course. Would not recommend, if you can take any other QR.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student, which is disappointing because the material itself is inherently fairly interesting, and Professor Beim taught it well. However, the problem sets were disproportionately hard compared to the lectures and exams, and we were not given adequate support to complete them (you needed more information than class would give you, and the TFs struggled themselves to solve them, and even more to teach them).",
    "No. Pretty bad class, Beim is a horrible professor and it's really not worth your time.",
    "Hard to say - I worked hard, attended every class, and studied hard, and up until the final exam was doing great, but the final, which is 40% of the grade, was just unreasonable. There is also no curve, so there's a huge discrepancy in terms of fairness between grad students (who receive Pass\/Fail grades anyway!) and undergraduates. I did learn some things from the course, but only things relevant to politics, and I think there was too much focus on teaching how to solve specific problems than there was on how to think intellectually about the types of problems - which meant that if there were problems you had seen before, they were easy, but when you had to do types of problems that were not covered in class, we had no knowledge base of how to solve them. The professor was pretty good but her teaching style and refusal to post notes made classes somewhat difficult to follow at times and too focused on copying rather than learning. Take this if you need an upper level politics class, but I would highly recommend another game theory course if you really want to learn about how to think and problem solve. If I had not taken a game theory course previously, I would not be taking many new skills away from this class.",
    "Yes, take this course! Professor Beim is a great and kind professor.",
    "No absolutely not. The requirements for the course are ridiculous and no curve. Class does not prepare you for the psets or the tests. Problem sets can take you 12 hours to complete. I know more than 20 people who dropped the class. Very hard and doesn't seem like the professor wants you to do well or improve.",
    "Great introduction to game theory. Not very math heavy, and easy to follow if you attend class. But word of advise: attend every lecture as she doesn't post lectures, and go to multiple TA sections. They all teach very differently and it very much so effects your ability to solve problems.",
    "I thought Professor Beim was great and really engaging throughout the semester. One issue that I had with the class is that there seemed to be little opportunity to practice what we learned in class in the problem sets. The content of the problem sets always seemed to be something outside the scope of what we learnt in lecture. The exams were fair but seemed to cover just a small amount of what we actually learnt throughout the course.",
    "Are you an English major looking for an engaging, everything-you've-ever-dreamed-of-in-a-QR course with a medium workload and a lovely professor? Take Game Theory. No calculus is required, and the most you'll be asked to do is futz with a few formulas. The course is heavier on game theory than political science, but if you'e interested in politics there are plenty of ways to apply this class to your interests. I was taking a philosophy seminar at the same time as this course, and I ended up writing my final paper in the philosophy course using tons of game theory ideas I learned in this course. The professor is approachable, very smart, and this course has been around for a while so you know exactly what you're getting! Don't waste you time in a gutty QR on a topic of no importance. If you aren't an English major, and genuinely love math and logic games, more power to ya! This class will be a lovely time for you as well.",
    "Yes. A very interesting application of the concept of game theory to politics. The class is very easy, but interesting",
    "definitely take it if you're interested in making good decisions.",
    "In its current format, I would not recommend this course. The large lecture made progress feel very slow, and sections did not enhance my learning at all. Also it was lacking in political science applications.",
    "If you have to choose between getting mauled by a bear and taking this class, choose the bear. This was by far the worst class I've ever taken in my entire life. This class was literally more useless than nipples on men. My God. The TA's were a literal joke. I don't think my TA ever actually gave a direct, complete answer to a question in section all year. But here's the fucking worst part of it: our section TAs don't grade our p-sets. Some other asshole apparently does, and we spend the first 15 minutes of section talking to TAs and getting points back. The p-sets were either too easy, too hard, or too fucking long to be useful. I went to every section and lecture, and I've never felt more lost in a class before. I swear to God Almighty that if I hear another TA say \"I can't really explain this because I don't know why, but you know what I mean\" I will.....I couldn't think of anything, but mark my words it'll be pretty bad. But I'm not gonna be totally mean to this class. Here's some advice to whoever teaches this clown fiesta of a class: start with TAs who actually fucking know Game Theory. That might help. Then have those TAs grade the p-sets for their sections, or AT THE VERY FUCKING GODDAMN LEAST put the solutions to the P-sets online or something. This class wasn't worth the pain of running to several TAs in hopes that one of them would give an explanation that wasn't useless. Also lmfao at question 6. I received whatever the polar opposite of \"clear feedback that improved my learning\" was. Fuck this class.",
    "This class is rather infuriating. It is not intellectually difficult most of the time, but it is annoyingly specific and the logic is almost always circular. Half the time, you have to make a conjecture to solve a problem and then you go through the process of solving the problem and end up checking your solutions against your original conjecture, which you made up in the first place.",
    "Take this course for an easy QR or if you want to have a cursory understanding of the basics of game theory. It's fun to do the psets in groups and the tests aren't that hard.",
    "The course has pretty much no work, but you also don't really learn anything so the problem sets can be a challenge (because you don't have any idea what you're doing). The midterm was very easy though.",
    "Don't take this class. The material is kind of interesting but there is very little structure and no way to review for exams. There are no past exams or problem sets available to study, and we only have like 2 or 3 questions per problem set, so it is really hard to figure out what exactly you will be tested on. It isn't worth it.",
    "Yes, i would as a good alternative to the even more challenging economics version. Just go in knowing that there is a large discrepancy between expectations on the problem sets and what you might actually see on the test. Challenging but worthwhile course",
    "If you're looking for an accessible introduction to game theory that touches on ways to model various political science phenomena, I would recommend this course. You will be required to know algebra and some calculus would not hurt (but is not necessary). The exams are fair, but there is no curve. The problem sets are generally straightforward although some were significantly more difficult than others. Professor Beim is clear and approachable in the course, but try your best to find a good TFs. I heard many complaints overall about the TFs",
    "Definitely a really engaging and interesting course topic with a very reasonable workload. You learn a lot about rationality and how to determine what to do in a variety of scenarios, with a lot of real life applications.",
    "This is a pretty manageable EP&E course that counts for a QR. The material is interesting, though class can sometimes be a bit too slow. You'll have to make the political science connections on your own for the most part, but it offers a good method of analysis that will come in handy in the future.",
    "Yes, Great QR credit.",
    "This is a superb course and an eye-opener. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about human interactions!",
    "I would recommend this class to others as long as they know what they're getting into. At its best, it's a fascinating class that restructures questions of human behavior as mathematical models. For that reason it's definitely a good QR for humanities students looking to get one out of the way (that's me!). But it is definitely not easy. Make sure you get a good TF otherwise the problem sets will be rough.",
    "Definitely",
    "Thai is harder than you expect but also relatively interesting. The exams are pretty fair but problem sets can be grueling. Professor Beim is really nice and lecture is engaging",
    "If you are looking for a relatively chill class and are interested in the concepts of game theory but not necessarily the high-level math, I would definitely recommend it. It certainly provides an interesting perspective on the world, in my opinion, and allows you to understand some basic economic and game theory principles that provide the foundation for a lot of other learning.",
    "If you want an introduction to game theory that isn't too challenging, this course will deliver. However, it is a fair amount of work. The problem sets are manageable if you do them with a group or seek out a TF for help.",
    "If the TAs are better, yes",
    "The pros of this course include Beim herself who is helpful, kind and clear. The cons are the TFs who are not well chosen and, on average, have a very poor grasp of how to run section . This is exacerbated by the fact that they are not given the answers to the problem sets and have very different policies on how much they will help students with problem set questions in section. The P-sets are also too difficult and different from what is taught in class. (There are a lot of them, too.) You are allowed to do group brainstorms for the P-sets, which was needed since some of them in the middle were so convulated. The midterm and final are very fair, however.",
    "Very little work and not at all time consuming. You may it difficult to stay engaged though, as the whole course is pretty impersonal and understructured. Very accessible for a QR.",
    "I would never recommend this course. Worst course I've taken at Yale. Poorly taught material that has absolutely no practical application.",
    "Professor Beim could definitely have taught this course better. The problem sets did not align with her lectures at all. During the first class, she realized a PowerPoint presentation did not work well, so she showed all her notes with a slide projector that made it difficult for students to follow along. If you take this class, I would recommend that you follow along with the class through the textbook and visit your TA during office hours to get a hand on those problem sets.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a not too challenging QR with interesting applications!",
    "Do not take this course if you are looking for an easy QR! Do take it if you are willing to put in a bit more effort, and want a QR that is less math and more concept focused.",
    "Yes, especially if you're looking for a great QR credit. This class is engaging and challenging without being too difficult (though it's definitely not a gut). Take it!!",
    "A great introduction to game theory. There is no intense math in this course. Midterm, final, and according to the syllabus, \"about 8 problem sets\" (there were 6). Problem sets were not terrible but took a fair amount of time. The questions were often tricky and led to a lot of overthinking. It's a pretty good QR for people who aren't terribly confident in their math abilities. If you get stuck with something, ask your TA for help and they will usually be quite helpful. Professor Beim is very approachable and committed to making sure students understand the material. She is good at explaining things and can tell when people aren't getting it in the lecture. She's good at fielding questions during the lectures. This is supposed to be the \"easier\" game theory class. It might be, but this class is not a gut. At times,the political science side seemed like a reach, applying vague \"political\" scenarios to classic example games, but the class was enjoyable.",
    "This course could be very easy if you stay on top of the trickier concepts of the class. It doesn't really go into much detail on game theory or its most interesting applications, it is very much at the intro level. I think there are probably better rational choice theory courses out there for those who already have an economics background.",
    "Take it if you need the QR or love game theory (?)- it's not impossible but is not an easy\/gut QR."
