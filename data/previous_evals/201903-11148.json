   "comments": [
    "The strength is that the class is ambitious and encompassing in terms of subjects and topics included. The weakness is that the discussion is sometimes off and not enough engagement in generating animated class discussion.",
    "The primary strength of this course is its variety. It allowed us to survey all parts of 20th century Chinese history. Moreover, as the course had a mix of art historians, economists, international relations theorists, and general historians, the discussions were always a joy. In addition to this, both professor Tsu and professor Perdue chose their materials very well as all of the texts were both exciting and informative. The primary weakness of the course is that we did not receive any feedback for our 4 discussion posts on Canvas. Instead, we were given a deadline for the post to be up, but then told at the end of the semester to submit all of the posts to the instructors for review at that point. While I understand that both professors are very busy, it would have been nice to get some feedback as it would have allowed me to correct any errors in either my writing or idea formulation over the course of the semester rather than have everything subject to a single, end-of-year review.",
    "This course was very intellectually stimulating. But the course instructions (e.g., assignments and expectations) could be made more clear.",
    "Strengths: Lots of reading, wonderful professor that is dedicated to teaching"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the course material is important for learning the modern history of China.",
    "Despite the lack of feedback, I would recommend this course to other students due primarily to the fact that the course both draws in such a mix of students, and that it is taught by two professors who are both incredibly knowledgeable in their respective fields. As such, getting the chance to talk with both them, and my classmates, in an academic setting was a true pleasure.",
    "Yes, for those interested in Chinese history or China-related issues.",
    "Highly recommend. A must-take course for students who are interested in 20th-century Chinese history.",
    "Yes, it allows students from different disciplines to gain insights on China"
