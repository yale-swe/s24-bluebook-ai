    "Take this class because it's interesting. The curve is rough (you're in it with a bunch of pre-meds) but if you put in the time, you'll find that regardless of the grade you get, you will have learned so much.",
    "This class is great if you are interested in biochemistry. It starts from the basics: learning about different classes of macromolecules, then gets more complex: learning about different metabolic pathways. I really enjoyed the class and thought it was run by really great professors that are passionate about teaching!",
    "AMAZING CLASS. Take it! It's so interesting and detailed and related to daily life and medicine. The professors are excellent lecturers and the class is well organized. The only downside is the curve. The tests are usually too easy and everyone is smart and does well. The class was too big for our room too.. so people had to sit on the floor. These are all logistical things, but besides this, this class is meant for anyone interested in the details of reactions in the cells.",
    "Simon wasn't great Koelle is good but full of himself. It is good though, just don't take on a loaded schedule. Make this the priority because despite what the professors think it is a ton of memorizing. You NEED to memorize to do well; but follow that memorization up by thinking about the details.",
    "It's a solid course; it's taught extremely well and while you do have to work hard, you'll get a lot out of it especially if you're doing some kind of related research in a lab. The material can get dense sometimes, but the professors did a great job of keeping things interesting and relevant.",
    "MB&B 300 is a good introductory biochemistry course. I would definitely recommend it to any student who is interested in taking biochemistry, whether out of interest for the subject or to fulfill a requirement.",
    "Not a bad course. Fairly interesting, very applicable to MCAT",
    "A necessary class to learn the molecular details of biology. I can't say I was particularly thrilled by the class, but I definitely feel better prepared to have an intelligent conversation about these things, even if I forget most of the details next week. Dr. Simon and Dr. Koelle are the best possible teachers you could have for this class, and they've organized it incredibly well. They obviously understand the material very well, and much more importantly, are generally engaging and good at explaining this to students. Tl;dr- would recommend!",
    "I'd recommend it! You probably need to take it, but it's a cool class and if you study really hard you'll be A-Ok :)",
    "Yes yes yes, it's the best organized class I've taken here with awesome professors. Biochem sounds boring but this class really made it the best it could be. Also weekly homework are so reasonable and won't take you more than an hour or two as long as you go to the lectures.",
    "Definitely take this one if you are premed. Not an easy course, but good.",
    "Absolutely terrible teaching. I hated going to class. Exams were ridiculously hard and professors weren't considerate. I wish I had taken the MCDB version of the course.",
    "This class is very hard and tends to be taken by MB&B majors who have had a lot of exposure to difficult biology classes already, making the curve pretty difficult. If you're a non-biology major pre-med, you may struggle, but it has to be taken.",
    "So in terms of recommendation, I'm sure that anyone who's thinking of taking it is either a biochem major or pre-med who has to take it, so my recommendation doesn't mean much. Yes, it's biochemistry and you're going to have a rough semester no matter how easy a professor makes it because the material itself is just dense and sometimes difficult. However, as someone who's taken a biochem course elsewhere, I can definitely say that it could have been a LOT worse and the professors did a really good job with it.",
    "Introduction to biochemistry and the basic metabolic pathways that make up our bodily processes.",
    "You should take the course if you're a bio major or pre-med. You will learn SO much information about metabolism, proteins, etc. That being said, you WILL need to put the work in around exam time because there is SO much information for you to learn for each exam (and especially for the final exam). The problem sets are not time-consuming, which completely misleads you into thinking that the course is easy. It isn't. And somehow, the averages on the exams are super high, which is problematic because of how the professor's grade the class.",
    "MBB300 taught by Professors Koelle & Simon was a great course! I learned so much about biochemistry, metabolism especially, during this semester, and both professors were extremely clear and engaging lecturers. There definitely is a lot of material, so be prepared to study and remember a lot of detail for the exams. That being said, the exams are fair, and none of the topics are presented in a confusing manner.",
    "A lot of material but well taught",
    "Very interesting but it's a lot of work, easily one of the hardest classes I've taken.",
    "Principles of Biochemistry is a great introduction to modern biochemistry and teaches you a lot about overarching principles of scientific research in addition to biochemistry. It is a lot of work, but is definitely manageable if you do not procrastinate.",
    "This is a pretty good class that teaches SUPER COOL concepts. You'll want to keep up. Seriously. Trust me. The weekly homeworks sort of keep you on top of stuff but if you want to avoid having to cram for 4 days in a row non-stop (literally locking yourself in a room and studying for like 12 hours in a row) you have to keep up with the lectures (I would advise doing the reading. But it's possible to scrape by and not do the reading if you really know the lecture material well. like, REALLY well). The instructors are really caring which is so nice.",
    "I took this class for my major. It was one of the most difficult classes I have taken at Yale. The amount of information you have to know is so immense, and at times, impossible.",
    "great course.",
    "definitely a lot of work but I really enjoyed the topics (besides the details that I thought were irrelevant). The best science class I've taken at yale, and maybe even best class in general. After every class I was always like wow I love biology.",
    "Prof Koelle and Prof Simon are super enthusiastic and they really do bring biochemistry to life! The class was well-structured, and they both do a good job helping us understand the big picture even while retaining important details.",
    "This class is so so hard - I have no clue why previous years' reviews said that this was ok if you did all the memorizing. Also for one of the final exam questions we were literally never told the answer but were apparently told to look up more about the mechanism when we were in lecture? Anyhow, take it if you have to (i.e. premed) but form really good study groups. And be really proactive- learn every line on every slide after each lecture and do a little extra research on things that you think might appear on the exams. Also the curve is really harsh because students tend to do so well in this class. Obviously it's a great thing that there are students who do so well, but if you're the 50% of students that's not super genius ...it's extremely discouraging",
    "Strong introduction to proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and metabolism. The course itself is terrifically put together and well-taught (jointly by Professors Simon and Koelle), covering an impressive level of detail and breadth. As many others have mentioned, the curve is competitive with the class being saturated with premeds and intense biology majors, so don't be surprised by ridiculous distributions.",
    "This class is difficult and requires a lot of memorization and dedication. It can be interesting if you are interested in the subject, but will otherwise be a very dense class for you.",
    "This is a very straightforward class. They hand you the slides, you memorize the slides, and you take a test. Homeworks are weekly but easy, and the tests are fair although they may have a few oddball memorization questions on them. Going to section is certainly not necessary, and neither is going to class unless you want to hear the supplemental material at the end of every lecture. You probably do, since the professors are really good. Overall, not too bad!",
    "Before taking the course, I heard that it was about as painful as the MCDB Biochemistry course. I wouldn't say the course itself was painful. However, the exams were very difficult. Memorize everything on every slide for the midterms. For the finals, it's a little more broad concepts, but still need to know alot of details to do well.",
    "I would recommend it for pre-meds and those having to take the class for major requirements.",
    "They give you the lecture slides, so attending lecture isn't really all that important. Also know that as much as these (otherwise fair) professors like to talk about \"not memorizing nitty gritty details,\" you WILL have to memorize a lot to do well on the exams.",
    "Look, it's a tough class but you leave it knowing a lot about biochemistry, especially if you're preparing for the MCAT. It's taught really well and worth taking in my honest opinion. Good luck and just put in the time to study and you'll be fine",
    "The course is hard, but the lectures, lecture slides, and study guides are amazing. As long as you study regularly you will find it very rewarding. One warning for the textbook; the readings are very long, and try to scan and skim it as fast as you can after you've read and understood the lecture slides and study guides; don't try to read and understand everything in the textbook. Discussion sections are ok; but if you want more specific questions answered, just shoot the TAs an email and they must be able to help you; they may not be able to do that in the discussion section, however.",
    "Take MB&B 300, not only because it's a premed requirement, but also because it genuinely teaches you how to understand the chemical logic of pathways, and to integrate an understanding of chemical reactions within the body with the physiological impact and significance. It is still considerable work, but definitely worth the effort.",
    "if you have to take it, it is not that bad",
    "It's an incredible amount of memorization, which can be really stressful at times. Overall a lot of interesting information. If you're an engineering major like me, it's more memorization-heavy than you'll be used to, since it seems geared for premeds. That being said, still an amazing class with easy weekly psets and challenging midterms and final. The teaching style has been ironed out and is very effective - I learned a lot.",
    "I would say this class (compared to the MCDB biochem) is a balance between being better taught and having a harder time getting a good grade. Obviously it's filled with ambitious premeds, so there is basically no curve. It's really well-taught though, and it teaches you how to think like a biologist. If you want to have an easier time getting better grades, though, the MCDB biochem would be better, from what I've heard.",
    "people who take this class are required to, usually.",
    "Overall a good course. Both professors are nice, engaged, and enthusiastic. The first half (with Prof. Simon) can be a bit disorganized at times, and I feel like the class didn't always understand what was going on. The second half had more information, but Prof. Koelle really has his act together and it was generally clear and easy to understand. There is a LOT of memorization in this class (although there are probably fewer details than cell bio, there is more rote memorization), but the material is generally interesting, and the professors do make some attempt to minimize it (On the second midterm and final, you get \"cheat sheets\" for glycolysis and the citric acid cycle). I really liked the second half of the course, and the first half wasn't too bad, so overall I would recommend it.",
    "Absolutely don't take this class if you don't have to. It was the most stressful class I've taken at Yale, not because of the difficulty of material, but because the grading is the most opaque process I've ever seen. This class was the worst-taught and most anxiety-inducing course of all 5 I took this semester. Michael Koelle is very patronizing, the slides contain a lot of words but very little information. The TAs were not helpful at all. The tests were very poorly designed (I never had any idea what to expect) and tested the ability to regurgitate obscure information from the slides instead of actual concepts from the class. Performance of tests was entirely circumstantial - if someone had a week with multiple exams and biochem happened to be the second or third exam instead of the first, it was likely to drop them at least half a letter grade because the curve was not at all generous concerning tests. The way the exams were weighted was not at all clear, and despite the fact that I did very well on the second exam and felt confident on the final, I have no idea what to expect as I check my grade because I don't feel that my grade in this class will at all reflect how well I've internalized the material. Had I stared at class notes long enough to memorize the slides, I am confident I could have achieved an A without ever understanding a single concept.",
    "Biochem is great! It can be a little dry, but it gets the job done effectively and it's very well-organized. The workload consists mostly of studying--problem sets are pretty short. Professor Koelle is awesome: very clear and fair, with the right combo of no-nonsense when dealing with anxious premed intensity, but good-humored whenever possible in lecture. It would be a lot of work for a non-major science credit, but great if you're at all interested in the subject or if you need it for your major.",
    "Of the biochemistry courses offered at Yale, this is definitely the best one. It is hard but doable with a lot of work. The professors are good teachers and you will learn more than you ever thought you could. The exams are hard, so prepare in advance and don't be discouraged when your raw scores are lower than you would like.",
    "I would highly recommend MB&B 300 to another student! It was an amazing class, not too stressful, and so interesting. If you have any interest in medicine, biology, or chemistry, definitely take it! If you have to take this course for a major or premed requirements, you're in for a great class.",
    "Great class. A lot of studying, but definitely worth it - you really come out feeling like you've got a good grasp on the fundamentals of biochemistry.",
    "It is a really hard but interesting course. Study really hard during the semester and you will be fine-but please don't fall behind !",
    "If you have to take it, then take it but this is a very difficult course.",
    "Lots of material (and lots of memorization for the tests), but a worthwhile course. Professors Simon and Koelle are really great lecturers, and the material is interesting.",
    "Don't take it unless you really have to as while the workload throughout the semester is manageable, there is a lot of studying when midterms start and even more during the final.",
    "Detailed class",
    "This class is a good introduction to biochemistry, and you should not be afraid to take it as a pre-med or biochem major. It does require a substantial amount of memorization, but the overarching hope of the professors is that students leave with the guiding principles mastered more than the facts, and the topics studied are very interesting. The course provides lots of resources for you to study and do well on the material, and the professors are good, clear lecturers.",
    "Tons of work. Huge payoff if you can get past all of the facts you have to memorize. This course really brings together previous chemistry\/biology\/physics courses. When you get to the point where you are able to see the big picture, you will be so glad you took the course.",
    "This course is a difficult course that covers A LOT of material. If you need to take it, then there is really nothing you can do about it. Try to keep up with the material as you go along and constantly review, as this will be extremely helpful when the midterms and final comes around. I did not enjoy this class and would only take it if absolutely necessary.",
    "Lectures are interesting enough, but the exams essentially test your ability to memorize and reproduce minutiae from the lectures.",
    "You probably have to take it if you are pre-med.",
    "This class is challenging, but the expectations are fair. There is a lot of material covered, so it's really important to keep reviewing the material as the course goes on, not just right before the midterms. Otherwise, i thought that the lectures were well taught and the flow of content made a lot of sense.",
    "Students should take MBB300! The class should also try to get more non-pre meds to enroll because its so great.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in organic chemistry, cell biology and their intersection. You could not ask for a course taught by two better professors. I know you pre-meds out there (holla!) are required to take biochemistry, but Simon and Koelle actually make it an enjoyable experience. The homeworks each week are relevant and help you review the important material from the week before. The midterms require a lot of time studying\/reviewing lecture slides, but as the material builds upon itself, it isn't too bad. And it's rewarding to apply your knowledge on the midterms and finals. Enjoy this class - you don't get many like this in Yale STEM.",
    "Probably the vast majority of students are taking this because they have to. It really is not painful, and in parts can be very interesting, depending on your interests (the lectures are 65 minutes and followed by supplements that aren't testable - if you're in this class please please don't be one of those insolent kids that leaves before the 75 minutes because the last 10 don't affect grades. That is so rude and shows utter disrespect for the professors and for learning). Rant aside, professors Simon and Koelle each really grew on me over the course of their half semesters. They care about teaching and are very sensitive to students' concerns, e.g. extenuating circumstances and premeds' anxiousness about GPA. Each has made a significant discovery in the field of biochemistry, which is to say, if you find that cool, go talk to them about their labs! Nine homeworks that take 1-3 hours, two midterms and a final - optional textbook that can boost your understanding and scores if you have extra time, otherwise study the slides extra-hard. Good luck.",
    "It's a tough class. You have to memorize some and understand a lot of material, but I actually do feel like I learned and retained a lot of it. Both Professor Simon and Koelle are wonderful and great professors. Knowledgeable and fairly captivating. The PSETs are easy, but the exams are pretty hard, but there will be a lot of tryhards in the class, that start studying a week in advance and tell you that the exams weren't that bad, but they are if you're a normal person. Nonetheless, if you want to take biochemistry I would recommend taking it with Koelle and Simon.",
    "This is an amazing class. Not only because the professors are so attentive, kind and knowledgeable, but also the content is very interesting. Simon and Koelle are some of the kindest, most caring professors I've had in a science class at Yale. Definitely take this class if you're a premed because it really does help for preparing for the MCAT. However, you must make sure that you don't overload your semester if you're taking Biochem. There is an OBSCENE amount of information for you to learn. Cramming for a Biochem exam is one of the worst things I've had to do here, because the truth is if you want to do really really well on the exam, you need to memorize and understand every slide in detail. And it's a lot. Be warned.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course. If you're premed, this is obviously a course that you need to take and do well in, but I would suggest really trying to understand everything in this course. This course provides you with the foundations of life at the must fundamental level, and it is tremendously helpful to understand these things as a physician. If you're not required to take this course, I still recommend it, as it's truly fascinating to learn what life is at the most basic level, the level of atoms and charges. The professors and TAs are terrific. Koelle and Simon are great lecturers.",
    "This class is insanely hard. Some parts were actually pretty interesting, but as a whole it was pretty painful.",
    "This class was a lot of work, but I really enjoyed it. Both professors did a great job. Just keep up with the material and you'll be fine.",
    "If you're considering this class, you should definitely try to take it. Professor Simon is one of the best professors I've ever had. He was trained as a chemist before he started doing biochemistry research, and that shows a lot in his analytical approach to all of the topics we covered. He taught the first half of the class for us, which was mainly about the chemical and physical principles underlying biology, and this was the perfect realm for his teaching. Professor Koelle is also a great professor. He cares a lot about the students and explains everything clearly and thoughtfully, with emphasis on principles rather than details. During his half of the course (which is on metabolism), there was a lot more memorization necessary to be able to really engage with the concepts, but I think it was very worthwhile and I'm glad that I learned what I did. Also, the psets are once a week and don't take very long at all.",
    "I would recommend the class for anyone who wants to learn more about chemical processes in the body or has a scientific interest, especially in the field of medicine. It is definitely not a class I would recommend for someone to just take to learn some interesting things, you either go with it and do the work or you will have hard time following.",
    "MB&B 300a is a solid introductory biochemistry course that covers most of the topics necessary for a pre-medical student. Though the course does not go into DNA-related biochemistry, it does a thorough job of teaching about protein biochemistry. The course does an excellent job of combining memorization with application of concepts, and also makes sure to extend biochemical concepts to medicine.",
    "MBB 300 is a great class. You will learn a lot about the fundamentals of the science, and will come out of the class fluent in a whole new language. Simon and Koelle are great lecturers. Exams are fine and psets are a breeze.",
    "Most students take MBB 300 because they have to. That being said, the material is very interesting and relevant to anyone! It is a hard course - and not one to take casually - but if you put in the work, you will get a lot out of it.",
    "MB&B 300 is a well-taught course in biochemistry that can serve as an introduction to the concepts. The course starts out by building on the basic concepts of what lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates are and then goes on the discuss the interaction between these concepts in the example of metabolism. The course involves weekly assignments, which are nice way to understand some of the more difficult concepts covered in lectures. The 2 quizzes are easy to get 100s on, but the midterms and the final can be challenging.",
    "If you're taking it, it's because you have to and I'm sorry. Literally memorize every single word on every single slide and start early. The book is actually a pretty good supplement, and I would recommend reading the relevant sections either before or after class, especially for Professor Koelle's lectures.",
    "Awesome biochemistry class. There is quite a bit of content, but if you follow and keep up with the class, everything is organized in a pretty way so you can follow the ideas and concepts, and understand everything as a whole.",
    "The course is essentially split into two halves, taught by separate instructors. The second half is significantly more difficult. Be prepared to memorize at least one full pathway from start to end (though it's not as bad as it sounds, it is purely rote memorization). The methods of assessment are 2 midterms and a final with a couple quizzes throughout (quizzes are fine if you keep up with the material). The second midterm and final are pretty difficult do well on, even if you think you know the material taught in class well. It's a fine course that serves as a good introduction to the energy harvesting reactions of metabolism. Much of the biochemistry you see early on, though it can be informative, you will probably have seen from previous coursework, such as the intro bio sequence.",
    "Good course!",
    "The overall course was difficult, and at times the round about way of teaching physics with a biology integrated curriculum was frustrating. However, once I got used to learning physics from this form of teaching, I found it to be much more interesting and applicable, as I saw overlap with subjects like biochemistry, chemistry, etc. Understanding the physics side of things, for topics I was already aware of as a biology major was immensely satisfying. However, for those looking for a traditional High School intro physics course, this is definitely not the class to take. But, for those looking for a more integrative approach to physics with regards to other sciences, then by all means take 170.",
    "While I would recommend MB&B 300 to another student, I would also caution them that the class doesn't offer the support needed to do well in the class.",
    "I'd certainly recommend taking this course to any pre-med (if you're MB&B it's required) who is looking to satisfy their biochemistry requirement. It's a very thorough look at the biochemistry of proteins and metabolism, covering all the stuff that you've already dealt with in earlier courses, but doing so in greater depth and really elucidating the principles. Prof. Simon and Prof. Koelle are both quite good lecturers and really make the material manageable. Yes, it's definitely challenging, but you wouldn't really expect anything less from biochem. The two midterms and final are a challenge, but the week-to-week work from problem sets is quite light, so it most ramps up around the exams and otherwise isn't a colossal time sink. Definitely worth taking. That being said, if you're looking at the spring MCDB biochem course, that's also supposed to be good, and it's got a bit of a greater breadth and is much less crowded than this lecture, so it could be a good bet too.",
    "great class with knowledgable, engaging, and clear professors. I learned a great deal and am very happy to have taken this challenging, yet rewarding class.",
    "Take this class. Koelle and Simon are so good. My understanding of biochemistry increased a lot after taking this class, mostly because the professors and TA's are very receptive to students and have taught this class for so long. But be warned, prepare for some healthy pre-med competition.",
    "Out of all the biology courses I have taken, I think this one proved the most comprehensive, especially when discussing metabolism. I didn't feel as though there were concepts left out which would have helped me better understand the material.",
    "A lot harder and a lot more work than I expected. Pre-meds really are brutal. Don't get cocky, since the first and second midterms will have very different feels and may surprise you. Base the questions off of the style of problem sets from the two professors. MASTER the material. You won't be as successful as you want otherwise. Spend as much time as you can on this course. The amount you learn will shock you.",
    "I would recommend it for a student looking to fulfill the Biochemistry requirement for pre-med or a major requirement. It is a large course, but the professors are very understanding and helpful if you feel you are falling behind (it moves very quickly, so do your absolute best NOT to fall behind!). It also gets more interesting later in the semester as some applications to disease\/medicine are discussed.",
    "Only take this class if necessary. If you're simply looking to learn about the human body and how metabolism or channels work, take Physio. The grading in this class is so harsh and all the premeds are overly competitive so averages on exams end up being in the 90s. Problem sets are super easy and are able to be done the night before they're due (and you can drop one). The two quizzes are straight up memorization (amino acids and glycolysis) and are only worth 2.5%. The two midterms require studying much in advance because you need to know little details from every slide. Section is useless and TAs are unable to answer questions."
