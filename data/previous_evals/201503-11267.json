   "comments": [
    "I would take this course if you know you will be using the theory to inform your academic interests. If not, you might be bored. However, for me I am glad I took this course because I was exposed to a new literature that will help me with my studies in Anthropology.",
    "This course was not designed to consider what to do about language once we \"understood\" it. Professor Errington lays the foundation for such future consideration, and in so doing, offers us a fundamental initial engagement with language broadly.",
    "This class offers the best of both worlds: it blows your mind with hyperabstract philosophizing about language, then shows you how all those highfalutin ideas become embedded in social practices you take for granted. Professor Errington does an excellent job making some opaque texts accessible and pulling in real-world examples (everything from South Park to debates over campus climate). The readings are not overwhelming, and the only graded assignment is a final paper (and a rather short one, at 12 pages). I don't know if it was due to the composition of the class or the early morning meetings or what, but the discussion wasn't super lively in my class. Most meetings began with Professor Errington walking us through the readings, and then delivering spontaneous mini-lectures based on student questions. It's interesting and low-stress, but not the best if you want to engage in heated debates.",
    "This readings for this class were extremely interesting and relevant to current discussions on campus, but the seminar dynamic did not serve it well. Professor Errington is a laid-back yet thoughtful and organized professor who would give excellent summaries of the class texts in the form of mini-lectures, but the seminar conversation never quite flourished. As a small lecture, I would recommend this class; otherwise, you will get more out of the readings than from the class itself.",
    "Fantastic exploration of theories of language & culture. A great high-level point of entry into linguistic anthropological perspectives on discourse, publics, politicizing language, legitimations of speech, etc.",
    "Only take this if you're definitely interested in the subject. The first half of this class did not appeal to me, and doing the mountain load of readings each week was such a chore. It got interesting towards the end though!"
