    "Interesting course with an engaging instructor--take it if you like social psychology I guess.",
    "The Psychology of Group Life - or more appropriately, Inside the Hive Mind - is a fantastic course with an incredible professor. The course is a true Yale seminar, with students and the professor together shaping the flow of discussion. The course delves into fascinating subject matter, beginning with an exploration of the nature of groups across animal species, and then delving into an in-depth exploration of groups as they are formed by and affect humans. Professor Dunham is an extraordinary professor. He is open to wrestling with and discussing new ideas with students, helping them think about aspects of psychology both old and new, while prompting analysis and interpretation that is conducive to allowing students to actually engage and grapple with the material. Yale is lucky to have him. Any student with the slightest interest in the topic should absolutely take the course.",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in socialization, interpersonal interactions, and learning about how and why we form the groups we do, then take this class. Weekly reading responses are very open ended and allow you to voice your own perspective on various papers. Professor Dunham would always send a reply to the reading responses, helping you expand your ideas, which doesn't happen with most RResponses. Also the very open-ended nature of the final essay was a great way integrate my interests outside of the class to the material presented in class. Perfect way to finish one of the two senior requirement papers for psychology. The discussions were very open-ended, and I learned a lot not just from the professor but also my fellow classmates.",
    "Yes - having a better understanding of group life is NECESSARY. Also, just some great ideas and questions came from this class.",
    "This was a really cool class. Very different from other psyc classes at Yale. Heavily discussion based, small class list so there's a lot of back and forth between students and the professor. Really the only issue was the material; it was a little disorganized in terms of overall picture, but each of the classes was individually engaging. Take it if you don't mind doing the majority of the readings or talking in class. Totally reasonable workload, one midterm, a presentation on your final paper, and the paper itself. Really nice professor who is totally approachable.",
    "Excellent course that has a wide reach from tiny animals in a range of social structures to how humans developed and utilized social capabilities throughout our evolution. Halfway through the semester the focus is exclusively on humans, which is cool and pertinent. Lots of studies to read, but abstracts are usually enough (unless you are particularly interested in one or two, which definitely happens).",
    "Def recommend, it was super fun!",
    "Going into PSYC 416, I wasn't too sure what to expect because this was Prof. Dunham's first year at Yale. It turned out to be a really interesting class. Prof. Dunham is a really likable guy, leads good discussions, and cares about his students. The format of the class is a weekly meeting in which we discuss the papers we read for the week (scientific psychology papers on a different topic every week relating to group psych). The discussions were usually pretty interesting, although I will say sometimes the format of the class (2 hrs of discussion with one break in the middle) got to be tiresome. I think Prof. Dunham recognized this and tried to remedy it, so hopefully he will figure out something for the next time he teaches the class. We also had weekly reading responses for the papers. There was a shorter midterm paper and then a final paper as well. I thought it was definitely a good senior seminar. I didn't write my senior essay in this class, but Prof. Dunham seems like the type to really help you with that if that's what you were trying to do. This year, our class was quite small (10-11 people?) so discussions were nice because everyone could say exactly what they wanted to say. This might change in upcoming years, but something to be aware of.",
    "Take this class if you can get into it."
