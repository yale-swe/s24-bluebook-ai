    "I would recommend it if you are interested in spanish lit. Just know that you probably won't have much opportunity to improve your speaking skills. Not too much work: three 2-3 pg papers, 1 final 7-10 pg paper, and a midterm.",
    "I would recommend it to another student for certain. I would summarize it with its title: an introduction to modern spanish literature. It is nothing more and nothing less, but a great class despite it being a general survey.",
    "This class is really just what it says to be-- a survey of Spanish literature. It's not very helpful for improving your speaking ability, although you are asked to participate in class. For that matter, it wasn't hugely helpful in improving my reading ability, either, as the readings were kind of long. So this class might be more interesting\/useful if you are already fairly fluent in Spanish (unlike me). That said, the readings are usually interesting, Prof. Valis is very sweet and has some insightful things to say, and overall it's a good class. Take it if you want a literature class, but not if you want a Spanish-language-practice class."
