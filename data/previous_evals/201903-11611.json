    "I thought this class was a good introduction to the field of poverty alleviation around the globe. I felt like I have a better understanding of the some of the main poverty programs in developing nations like Cash Transfers and how they are impacted by poltiical environments.",
    "Mainly gained an insight into the fundamentals of poverty alleviation + development.",
    "This class teaches about many of the most important theories and approaches to poverty alleviation. We learned how poverty is measured - and should be measured as dynamic and multifaceted - and how these measures serve political ends. We read about different projects implemented around the world, including important CCTs and microfinance projects. Further, we learned about the role of institutions in effective poverty alleviation policy building. The semester-long \"project\" gave us the skills necessary to research poverty and policy in developing countries, and the class content gave us the tools to propose policy changes.",
    "I developed an understanding of the causes of poverty and what poverty actually is. I also developed an understanding of the methodological difficulties in evaluating poverty.",
    "How to measure\/define poverty, different poverty alleviation strategies and the complexities of implementing them"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked the discussion in this course- the people were passionate and interested. The course material is interesting and relevant as well. I wished there were more discussions in smaller groups, as class discussion was usually dominated by a handful of the same people.",
    "I thought the seminars did a great job of reviewing all the readings but never felt like they were anything more than that. Also, sometimes the readings did not feel like they connected too much to each other from week to week. I feel like this class could be improved by diving deeper into case studies of poverty alleviation strategies of one or two countries in class. I will say that this is partly done by the projects, where you focus on one developing nation.",
    "Strengths -- The material is really interesting, and Professor De La O does does a good job with the syllabus. Weaknesses -- Sometimes conversation felt forced. I wished everyone was a bit more engaged. Maybe no computers...",
    "The readings are all very relevant, and they touch on some of the most important topics regarding approaches to poverty alleviation. The seminar is very discussion-based, pushing students to engage with the assigned texts. Further, the memos assigned throughout the semester make the course load manageable yet still challenging. Feedback on memos could be improved so that students know what they are doing correctly and what aspects of the analysis they are missing. This could really push the learning experience to another level. This could also be done weekly through reading responses that receive feedback.",
    "The strengths of the course are that you get a well-rounded understanding of the causes of poverty. The group project to diagnosis and provide a policy solution for the poverty of a particular country provides you with an opportunity to develop an expertise in that country. And Professor De La O engages with students ideas and keeps the discussion lively. The big weakness of the course, however, is the topic of the conversation can often stay on just summarizing the readings and be a bit shallow. I would suggest spending less time summarizing and more time on the contentious debates surrounding the readings."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Professor De La O is great and the material is very relevant and interesting.",
    "If you want a good introduction to poverty alleviation in developing nations, I think this class is a solid start. I personally had little background in this field and felt like I got a lot out of the readings and doing the projects. I would not say this course is anything revolutionary, but definitely think it is worth looking into. Also, Professor De La O does a good job of discussing the material and providing feedback when needed.",
    "If you have any interest in poverty alleviation, this is the class for you! You will definitely gain an insight into the various ways people are tackling poverty around the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in development and development economics. Professor De La O facilitates great discussion and shows interest in what her students have to say.",
    "This class really opened me about to learn about how economics and politics plays such a big role in extreme poverty and policies that tackle extreme poverty and the like. The professor is so well-versed in this subject and knows how to keep the discussion going in a way that fosters learning and changed perspectives",
    "Yes, if they are interested in poverty alleviation but don't have much of a background in the field."
