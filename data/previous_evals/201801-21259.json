    "I don't think any, really.",
    "How the law should be viewed beyond the analysis of legal doctrine.",
    "This is a rare class where you not only learn law from multiple vantage points but also think and write as a legal historian.",
    "I learned critical methods for studying legal history. I also learned about histories of law in a diverse set of places and periods.",
    "How law works in society.",
    "Ability to critically analyze texts in legal history in different time periods and places. I enjoyed learning about such a wide variety of topics and taking into consideration what goes into having access to a legal document."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength of this course COULD be that it takes a more theoretical approach to history than other courses I have taken, but because the connections between the theoretical and the practical were rarely made with sufficient clarity, this actually ended up being a great weakness. I also think the geographic diversity of material could be improved as well as its thematic diversity. We looked at British colonial narratives WAY too much.",
    "Prof. De runs a great seminar, and keeps everyone engaged.",
    "The readings for this course are wonderful- carefully selected to help us gain insights for each weeks topic. The weekly reading responses really helped me think the selection of readings critically and comprehensively.",
    "The course was a great introduction to critical methods in legal history; I liked combining theoretical and historiographical work each week. I also enjoyed the comparative aspect of the course, as we learned about histories of law in many different places and time periods. A weakness of the class is that its diverse historical and geographical scope meant that it was harder to follow readings about places and time periods of which I had little knowledge. It might be helpful to provide optional \"background\" readings with brief overviews of, for example, the history of colonial Latin America.",
    "I loved the subject matter of this course, but one suggestion I have is just that the reading was very heavy, and quite difficult to manage while taking many other classes at the same time. I think discussion could have been more fruitful if the reading was lighter, and students were able to all reasonably complete it.",
    "Great readings, great engagement. Really can't think of many weaknesses -- maybe having a few focused questions each week could help discussion?",
    "Strengths: Excellent selection of readings that fit together very well to engage us in debate. Improvements: Maybe a bit more contextualizing before each week so we know how to approach the readings as the topics vary greatly and having a bit of background can be helpful in navigating the reading."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course as it is currently taught. It purports to be thematically organized by week, but it seemed that every week we would harp on few broad, nebulous themes that we were never fully able to understand as a class, so that at the end I don't feel like I really gained much.",
    "Great class, great readings, great professor. An excellent seminar!",
    "I recommend anyone who is interested in the intersection of law and history, legal thinking and historical thinking, judges and historians, and law as different channels in various contexts.",
    "Yes, this is a great class if you want to learn critical methods in legal history.",
    "Wholeheartedly! Prof De is great, and the course is wonderful regardless of your familiarity of law and internecine historical scholarly arguments.",
    "Yes! This is a fascinating course that prompted to think about the law in a completely different way. If you are not interested in becoming a lawyer this is still a very good chance to try something different and gain a new perspective."
