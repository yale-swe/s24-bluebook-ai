   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it not as a study of American Presidents but rather the institution of the presidency. It's intense and involves a lot of reading, if you aren't a political science major I would seriously consider if taking this course is right for you.",
    "This class offers a view of the presidency in a historical sense and then transfers into the professors rant about his view of our current political state.",
    "Yes, interesting material, new perspective on the presidency.",
    "No. Way too comprehensive and too heavy a workload for what the course is (200 level polisci lecture). Lecture is dry and grading is tough. Don't take it",
    "Yes I would. The class was fun and it was interesting. I feel like I really learned a lot. But the 60% final was a lot of pressure in the end.",
    "Definitely take this course! Skowronek is a great lecturer who clearly knows his stuff, the TAs were awesome, and you will learn genuinely useful information. I usually really dislike non-pset classes but this one was great: the material is really applicable to the present-day, you learn a lot about US history (even beyond the presidency), and the reading is for the most part interesting (although it can pile up if you don't stay on top of it so be sure to hit the ground running during the first week of classes). It's not a lot of work overall BUT the grading breakdown is a little weird since section is only 10% of your grade, the midterm essay is 30%, and the final is 60%. In hindsight it might have been a good course to take credit\/d based on grading breakdown alone, but honestly if you stay up to speed you will probably do really well so just take it for credit.",
    "This is a historical and strategic overview of the American Presidency, from Washington to the present day. If you're interested in American politics, or leadership in general, I think that it's a must-take. Skowronek is an excellent lecturer who covers both the historical evolution of the office, and the characteristics and qualities that lead to successful and unsuccessful presidents.The reading is interesting, and the work isn't too bad--one 10-12 page paper, and anin-class final. I'd highly recommend at least shopping it; coming on a whim was one of my best decisions so far at Yale. Be aware that if you take it, though, it's tough to rebound from a missed lecture. You've got to come all the time, and section participation is 10% of the grade.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in the subject matter. As a person who is interested in the executive branch and presidential power, I enjoyed it, but I could see how other people wouldn't like it. Just be warned that the reading isn't extremely interesting and the course is not about individual presidents. It's a study of the progression of the executive office itself.",
    "It's a great, albeit sometimes challenging course. The reading is interesting and you learn more than you thought you could about the presidency. I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. I already have.",
    "This class is not a historical survey of the presidents. Instead, it is largely a theory course of how the presidency as an office has evolved through history. It is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, by far. I would recommend it to any and all political science majors, but keep in mind that it is a challenging class with a heavy reading load, and you will get out what you put into the class.",
    "Interesting but more work than you think. Also if skowronek grades your midterm you're screwed bc he grades really hard",
    "I would definitely recommend that a fellow student take this class. Again, it is definitely a political science minded course so make sure that you like thinking about thingsin a political science manner if you take the course--the course is about the institution of the American Presidency, not a survey history of the American Presidents--but otherwise, the Professor and the TAs are awesome and the material is highly interesting. I think it was one of my more favorite classes that I have taken at Yale.",
    "Amazing course, with an amazing professor and an extremely helpful TA (Celia). Shop the course to hear, at least, one lecture. Only course I managed to attend every single class for. Skowronek is, [erhaps, the best professor at Yale.",
    "This class is not a trace of presidential policies. We do not evaluate too frequently whether or not what each president did was good or bad but the institution of the presidency itself. The primary focus is on leadership approaches and the relationship of the president to actual power within government. Skowronek keeps most of the historical material interesting and really explains well the modern theories. The readings are very manageable as are the assignments.",
    "Don't get scared away if you are shopping this class and you feel intimidated by the 60% in-class final and 30% 10-page midterm. This was the most worthwhile course I took this semester, and it is not even in my major. You will get a lot out of this course if you have a genuine interest in the American Presidency and politics."
