   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's a good class with a good professor and you are sure to learn tons of things you didn't know before.Advice: get started early on the final paper. Don't let it creep up on you at the last minute.",
    "Take this course if you want to gain some insight into the region. It was a great course that also sheds some light to the subject of national identity and the means by which nations become a reality.",
    "Take it only if you're really interested in Eastern Europe. For most of the semester it's very easy, but then you have a gigantic paper and final at the end. Snyder's lectures are great, but the readings are often useless, long and boring.",
    "Great class, you will learn so much about an area that is rarely covered extensively in American high school history curricula. Not a light workload if you do the reading. The research paper is long but very interesting. Go to lecture -- it's fascinating and will allow you to do the final without too much pain.",
    "History 263 is essentially Eastern Europe from the dawn of time until just before WWI. That said, you obviously can't examine EVERYTHING in this time and place, but you get pretty darn close. The first half of the class seems very Polish, and the section sort of a Habsburg\/Balkans mash, but it works.",
    "Great class. Really interesting, and really unique. Don't take it if you're only interested in Russia, because that's only like two lectures. If you want to know more about the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians or the Habsburgs, this is the class for you.",
    "Yes. Take it. Snyder is a brilliant professor and an excellent lecturer. Some of his lectures were absolutely phenomenal and I feel I learned a lot about a region many people know little about. That said, Professor Snyder is a bit intimidating and old-fashioned and does not engage much with his students, and sometimes his instructions aren't necessarily clear. However, all of the assignments for the course turned out to be very fair and reasonable.",
    "This is a really interesting lecture for someone who likes history courses. Expect to work hard, especially at the end of the semester as historically there has been a 20-page paper and 3-hr essay exam but this has not stopped non-history majors.My suggestion: shop the first class (very substantive and represent of the course lectures generally) and see what you think. The lectures are really fantastic and will be well worth your time.",
    "take this if you're already interested in the course material. the biggest problem is the assignment policy--all are due after the drop date. there' s a 20-page paper worth 25% and a final worth 50%. We weren't told section grades, so as of now I have no idea how I'm doing in the class. I wish there were some way to know before the drop date.",
    "Yes, if you want to know about its history.",
    "History 263 covers a huge span of time and consequently a LOT of information about Eastern European History. Yes, the amount of information is somewhat overwhelming, but Professor Snyder is one of the most incredible lecturers I've ever had, and he made all of the information incredibly interesting and memorable. It's quite a lot of work for a history lecture class, but it's worth it.",
    "This class is one of Yale's best-kept secrets! It's a phenomenal class. Snyder is a brilliant lecturer, EasternEurope is actually way more fascinating that you'd think, and the test material is very fair (as long as you come to lecture and keep up with the reading). The class has no midterm, but instead has a lengthy (5,000-10,000 word) term paper and a final. TAKE IT! {I'm not even a history major.}"
