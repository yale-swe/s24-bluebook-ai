    "I clearly learned the difference between different qualitative theoretical methodologies in the social sciences. I honed my own research questions and gained a clearer sense of what I want to accomplish with my personal research project, and how to go about it.",
    "I developed knowledge of the different theoretical frameworks of qualitative social science research and how to choose research methods within those frameworks appropriate for addressing a particular research question. I developed skills for conducting interviews, participant observation, and document analysis - as well as skills for writing a research proposal.",
    "Developing a proposal. Research methods",
    "Familiarization with research methods",
    "I learned the components of qualitative research and how to conduct meaningful research.",
    "I developed my research proposal and learned about the research process at the Masters level.",
    "I learned a lot about research methodologies. Amity presented really useful information in a way that was systematic and thorough - making a lot of intimidating information really accessible.",
    "Carrying out interviews Describing qualitative data Data scribing and analysis",
    "I learned a lot about the ethics of conducting research. This felt like a primary focus of the course. I also learned a bit about different methodologies but felt that this was somewhat shallow at times.",
    "Overview of research methods, development of some skills, reading papers",
    "I gained greater exposure to what research actually is, areas to watch out for, examples of effective work.",

   "comments": [
    "Very well! I am very happy that I took this course.",
    "They were very well aligned with my expectations and very useful for developing my final research proposal.",
    "I think this class could push us further by assigning more intermediate deadlines for proposal and set aside more time to receive feedback from peers. But overall, it has met my expectation.",
    "Very helpful course, met my expectations.",
    "This course met my expectations.",
    "I gained knowledge and skills that will be helpful in my summer project and social research in my career.",
    "I expected more of a \"deep-dive\" into the different qualitative methods. I felt that the focus could have been more evenly distributed between learning about the ethics of research and the methodologies of qualitative research. The course felt overly weighted toward ethics. I think this was visible at the end of the class. Student presentations were weakest in the methodologies sections of their proposals. Everyone used the same set of methodologies: interviews, participant observation, questionnaires...Overall, I would have liked to gain a better understanding of why a researcher might use one methodology over another or why they might take a phenomenological approach versus an ethnographic approach versus a case study approach, etc. etc.",
    "I thought there would have been more workshopping opportunities to engage with peers or with the instructor.",
    "This class provide comprehensive knowledge of social research's details."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was wonderful.",
    "The strongest part of this course is ample time for workshopping and feedback of research proposal components with peers and the instructor. The weakness was that sometimes classes were too packed with activities that we would be rushed through our reading discussions.",
    "This course surveys different qualitative research methods, the lectures are very informative and Amity allows for a lot of in-class discussions. However, this course is heavily ethnography -focused (most of the reading materials).",
    "I think the class was overall great, but sometimes the group discussions on peoples' papers were only mildly helpful, or we didn't get to everyone on time. Maybe more meetings one on one with the professor?",
    "I wish the course provided more opportunities to learn about mixed methods. I also wish there was less emphasis on indigenous studies.",
    "I would make several changes to this course: 1) I would prefer to have more frequent and firm deadlines for submitting pieces of the research proposal. These could begin relatively early in the semester. This would ensure that students get feedback throughout developing their proposals. Also, ongoing deadlines prevent students from leaving everything to the last minute. 2) It would be better to have the guest lecture about research funding much earlier in the semester (like, in September) so that students can process this information and apply it to their proposals. Best thing about this course: Amity does an excellent job of facilitating engaging and lively group discussions.",
    "It provided practical skills in social science.",
    "The strength of the course is the students who take the course. The people in this class are some of the brightest people at FES. The in-class workshopping of the projects always felt a bit forced and unproductive. I'm not sure how it can be made more productive. Perhaps have students share their work with each other outside of class might be more productive. It could be a bi-weekly assignment or something...All I know is that it wasn't a good use of class time. I felt that the assignments and readings weren't always that helpful in creating the final proposal. I would have liked if some of the assignments had been to actually read proposals and analyze them. The comparative analysis paper came closest to this, but I think it would have been more helpful to analyze proposals rather than fully published papers. I thought the class suffered from not have stricter deadlines. Also, forming the research question remained the hardest part (and still does!). I would have appreciated more guidance on how to form a research question. I think a lot of people struggled with that.",
    "Good class participation. Energetic lectures, more peer to peer interaction is always good. Those were some of the best times. My final project was not as ready as i would have liked, and I cannot figure out what i did wrong, or didnt do. Perhaps more specific instruction to students\/ more tight deadlines would help us in the end.",
    "I wasn't a big fan of the readings and didn't feel like I came out of the course with a set of new skills.... One book that I found helpful in interviewing was: Fujii, Lee Ann. Interviewing in Social Science Research: A Relational Approach. Routledge 2017",
    "Strength - engaging in deep analysis of real cases. Weakness - not much research seems current, favorite students were catered to. Mixed-methods were grazed over. Many assignments felt like undergraduate theory or busy work, not professional skills for applied field work.",
    "This class is very great in providing a comprehensive road-map of conducting a social research."

   "comments": [
    "The teacher is wonderful, the material is extremely useful and the culture of the classroom is supportive.",
    "Definitely take this class if you plan to do social science research, it is invaluable for developing your proposal.",
    "Take it ( or you have to take it)",
    "Don't buy the textbook because you'll never need it and get everything you need to know from lectures. Give yourself personal deadlines to get everything for your proposal done.",
    "This is an incredibly helpful class for anyone looking to do research at FES. It really gives you the space to understand methodology and to chew on what it is you really want to study while at FES.",
    "Highly recommend as social science provided more information in research studies",
    "I think this course is akin to an independent study where you develop a research project. The reason one might take this course is to take what would otherwise be a somewhat lonely and isolating endeavor and to do it with 15-20 peers. It makes the process more fun. You get out of this class what you put in. It's pretty loosely organized.",
    "pick a topic early, get started early.",
    "It is great and it will be helpful if you want to conduct a social research."
