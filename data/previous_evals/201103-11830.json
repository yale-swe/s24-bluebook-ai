   "comments": [
    "This is a great class. Most students in it are probably going to be science majors, but don't let that put you off if you aren't math or science oriented (I've never been good in either of those subjects, and I definitely don't plan on being a science major, but I still love this class). It's a relatively low-stress way to learn about a lot of fascinating fields of science and what's new in all of them. The professors who teach for three weeks at a time are generally very interesting, incredibly smart people (one of them is currently building a billion dollar satellite for NASA) who teach this class because they're excited about it.",
    "Definitely recommended. The topics covered are diverse and interesting, and the workload is barely there. If you just want an interesting fifth class, go for it. The actual information is necessarily not in depth, but it's great exposure. Of course, the modules vary in quality, but overall, most of the modules and professors are wonderful.",
    "Science 030 is a good class to add on to your schedule if you want to be more informed about advancements in a range of exciting scientific fields, and you don't like a lot of work. Homework comes around every 3 weeks or so, towards the end of the module, and you might have some more work if the current professor assigns supplementary reading. If you're a fairly independent learner, and you have a pretty good high school science background, then this class should be fairly easy for you. However, since you can't go very in-depth on a topic in the 2 class sessions before a problem set, it can be hard to do well on the problem sets since the professors don't hold office hours very often. Otherwise, you have to teach yourself a lot, and do some guesswork on the problem sets.",
    "Basically you only have work once every three weeks. The amount of work varies based on which module you're doing, and some are harder than others. Free food every Friday! Most of the topics are super interesting too. It's definitely a survey course, so if you want to learn anything in depth this is definitely not the class for you. It's a great way to get exposure to a lot of different professors.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone with any bit of interest in the sciences. The topics are incredibly varied, with everything ranging from Dark Matter and Energy to Cloning and Stem Cells. All of the instructors are very passionate about what they are teaching, and even with only 3 days per topic, you still learn quite a bit.",
    "Food and drink every week. Workload very manageable. Hardly any work in between modules, usually a open notebook quiz during the last module, and usually a p-set or readings. Some topics are better than others - really depends on your interest. Overall the course was ok. Could get boring sometimes (1.5 hr classes), but only met once a week.",
    "It is the perfect way to learn about contemporary topics in science without needing an intense background in science\/math. I would definitely recommend it, especially to those who are afraid of science. It is a very relaxed environment to learn.",
    "You sit around, eat food, and listen to extremely intelligent professors talk about interesting, cutting-edge science. Every once in a while, you have to do some reading or a problem set. For the amount of effort you have to put out in this course, the amount you learn is incredible."
