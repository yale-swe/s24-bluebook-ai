    "Take this class!",
    "Strongly. It is a great class with awesome readings and an even more awesome professor. Even if you are remotely interested in political philosophy this is the class to take. Readings: great and manageable (no more than 20-30 pages per week), lectures: great, some mind-blowing, prof Smith: really knows the material, engages with students and encourages in class debate, TA: really helpful especially with essays. In short, everything about this course was very, very good.",
    "This class was very back and forth with how I felt about it. Many times it was my most interesting class; however, there were times when I absolutely hated it. Professor Smith is a wonderful lecturer, but at times he made me scared to speak because of his sarcastic remarks. If you are confident in your philosophical thinking then you should be fine. The readings were not difficult, and you could totally do fine in the class without reading as most people did. Lectures were wonderful, discussions both in class and section were not so great.",
    "This class was interesting, but future students should be wary of Professor Smith, who made class uncomfortable and intimidating for students. While his lectures were interesting, he would not shy away from poking fun at studnets who answered questions incorrectly, which made the class not comfrotable for many. I did not usually feel comfortable asking questions, answering questions, or meeting with the professor outside of class. Professor Smith taught me a lot, but I never felt comfortable meeting with him outside of class to discuss things or ask for help on assignments.I found the grading on assignments to be inconsistent and not based on clear criteria. I would recommend this class only to someone who is really interested in political philosophy and who is willing to put up with the other drawbacks of the class.",
    "This course was an overview of many of the classic liberal political philosophers from the perspective of philosophy (as opposed to political science).I would definitely recommend it! I cannot speak from having taken the Steven Smith course, but this course had a discussion component during lecture that really added to it which is not present in the much larger political philosophy version.",
    "Yeah- it's definitely and interesting, engaging basic philosophy class",
    "Croon to discuss problems. The only weakness in the relationship between section and lecture was that I often felt we became out of sync.",
    "Take it! It was a very accessible and interesting introduction to political philosophy--a class that should be required for all political science majors and people interested in government.",
    "YES, OMG THIS PROFESSOR IS AMAZING!!!!!! YOU WILL LOVE THIS CLASS, HE'S VERY PASSIONATE, ENTERTAINING, AND BRILLIANT!",
    "This class was fine, but having taken it, I do not think I would do it again if I could start the semester all over. Smith did not seem particularly invested in the class beyond giving the lecture twice a week, and if you have never taken philosophy before, this course did not do a great job introducing the mode of philosophical thinking--you kind of had to figure it out on your own.",
    "Take the class... maybe. It is really a great class that isvery interesting. The online discussions are pretty fun if you read. It is a much more interactive and interesting than the steven smith political phil class. The only problem is that you do more writing in 178 than you do in the other and the other has a writing credit. 178 doesn't.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course to another student -- the assigned reading is much less than most of the humanity\/social science classes, but the professor pushes you to delve deep into the philosophical questions! Great discussions in class as well!",
    "I would recommend this course to any one with some experience in philosophy or an interest in politics. However, if you want to try this course for a taste of philosophy, you might want to consider taking \"Introduction to Philosophy\" first instead.",
    "If you're deciding between this class and Steven Smith's intro to political philosophy, definitely take this one. I shopped both and I can tell you that while you'll fall asleep in the other one, Matthew Smith will make you want to come to lecture every day.",
    "I would definitely recommend it with Matt Smith. He makes the class very interesting. You should do the reading.",
    "A good, philosophical intro to political philosophy. Not for those interested more in politics than philosophy--the abstractness would be frustrating. Four papers through the term, 2, 3, 7, and 10-15 pages respectively. Reading load is pretty light.",
    "This class is in depth and can be very stimulating for someone who is interested in the topic.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants to read the big political philosophers before they graduate from Yale. It's worth it. Do not take it if you think it will be a gut. The class is not that easy. A fair amount of writing is required. The forum posting is kind of a pain and becomes more of a chore than a medium for discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with an interest in political systems and in philosophical thought, and to remember that this course does focus in on the philosophical side. A student especially interested in analyzing any modern day political applications of many of the thinkers may be frustrated at an approach more based on the ways in which the ideas were argued and how these arguments can be dissected, reconstructed and rebutted rather than in thinking about how one could see them come to fruition practically. That said, this was a highly enjoyable course in many ways, and the texts were well chosen and classic. Very good introduction to main backgrounds in political thought, and had very exciting contemporary selections at the end as well. Lectures were very entertaining and exciting--attendance was always excellent, although a large class. Section well run.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. The course covers all of the big political philosophers, the ones you hear about all the time, so it was wonderful to finally understand what they thought.Matthew Noah Smith is the man, and made lectures awesome.Section wasrather horrible, but it is only once a week and worth the suffering.Workload was not too bad. Do the readings when they are assigned so that you do not need to cram right before the papers.You need to do 10 posts on the classesv2 forum which are not as atrocious as they seem. They take some time and thought, but you just have to do them. I recommend doing them earlier on when no one does them so that you have more easy subjects to write about.",
    "A good introduction to political philosophy but also philosophy as a discipline \u0097 reconstruction of arguments, how to form proper objections to arguments, and close reading of classic texts in political philosophy. You cover the big names and their ideas in political philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Mill, Marx...), and I liked how the class traced the development of certain themes across texts rather than treating each text solely in the context of itself. That is, I liked how we compared and contrasted each philosopher's ideas on certain key similar topics. I thought that Professor Smith was a strong, entertaining lecturer, and I think he had a good momentum throughout each class. I also appreciated how the class (which was small enough in our case, around 30) was allowed to respond to his prompts and ask questions in lecture. Shop the class and see if you like it\u0097it doesn't change much throughout the semester. I discovered that philosophy wasn't for me, and this is definitely a class in which you have to do the work to get anything out of it (and since NOT doing the reading is an option in this class, you can go through the semester and learn nothing). I think one who participates fully and takes advantage of Smith's entertaining and interesting lectures by preparing well for each class will enjoy it, especially if that student is inclined to enjoy the subject.",
