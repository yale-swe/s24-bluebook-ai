    "Very challenging class but really teaches you a lot and worth it",
    "I highly recommend the course for both IR and IPE students. Frankly given that IPE research can be quite technical and challenging, I think that it is very difficult if not almost impossible for students to master the material without taking a course of this sort. This is especially true for students aiming to take the field exams in either or both of the subfields. We wrote a number of field essays and got a lot of helpful feedback -- and I think this was very helpful preparation for the exams.For those that think that they want to do IPE research, this course is essential -- you get very good training in evaluating the literature and conducting independent research in IPE."
