   "comments": [
    "This course was really great for analyzing different types of media in one context and honing writing skills withing that same multimedia context",
    "This course has an incredible syllabus of books and films that were such a blast to read and watch and definitely expanded my cultural horizons. I learned a lot about the history of the gothic and the themes that have influenced\/informed it over years and still keep it relevant today. I learned how to approach literature with different lenses and analyze and write about it in new ways.",
    "My writing has certainly improved. I've learned to draw more interesting conclusions, sharpen up my analysis, refrain from doing too much narration, and be more comfortable with taking risks with my choices. I really loved this course.",
    "This course is a good introduction to gothic literature and films and shows students how to analyze films and close-reading of texts.",
    "I developed skills in writing essays about gothic texts and developed insights about these texts through lecture and section.",
    "I learnt to better appreciate the themes and literary devices used in Gothic fiction, and also improved my close reading skills.",
    "Just some interesting stuff about Gothic literature that helped broaden my interests",
    "I learned to view literature, not only gothic literature, as a deep reflection of people. The gothic texts were examined were often incredibly absurd but upon analysis, there were obvious clues that the author left to better understand ourselves. Generally, I learned a lot more about the gothic and how to analyze film.",
    "There was a good amount of writing practice, and we also learned quite a bit about the Gothic novel, Gothic tropes, and literary theory surrounding the Gothic.",
    "You learn about the gothic novel, its history, can what defines the gothic.",
    "I can confidently explain the difference between horror and terror, something that I never really knew was real.",
    "I learned how to write slightly better and learned more about English scholarship works.",
    "This was my favourite class this semester! Professor Klemann, thank you for being so inspiring in class and so welcoming during office hours",
    "writing, analyzing film and text",
    "A greater appreciation for the pervasiveness of the gothic and its history. We also developed our skills at constructing arguments and pushing interesting ideas.",
    "I greatly improved my writing skills in this class, along with my understanding of what \"Gothic Literature\" truly is.",
    "I learned so much about writing, literature, literary critique, film analysis, novels, poems, short stories, humanity, life, art, history, authors - as a senior who thought her writing skills were \"college level\" I still learned so much!",
    "I learned about a genre of literature I didn't really know existed (gothic literature) and the conventions that go with it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was very great at covering a wide range of Gothic texts as well as various forms of media. I think the writing was just intensive enough to help me solidify certain aspects of my writing that I needed to work on. The only thing I would recommend is a more cohesive workshop opportunity, which I think would be of great help for all students.",
    "The course is too dense. I really missed out on delving deep into some extremely important texts, because we raced through them in a single 50-minute lecture. If it were thinned out to about 80% of what it was this semester, students would benefit by being able to devote the time these texts deserve.",
    "Syllabus is marvelous. Professor Klemann is quite good and gives really interesting lectures. I wish we had more time to delve into the material, but thats the challenge with just two 50-minute class meetings a week, and also she did a solid job talking about the writing assignments as well and how to approach them. There were plenty of writing assignments, but they all were clearly explained and seemed fair and relevant. Perhaps a bit more of a coherent history of the gothic and its evolution of the years would be helpful, but not at the expense of any of the amazing works we read\/saw.",
    "I think some of the sources don't mesh with the arc of the course as well as some of the others. For instance, I didn't really feel that Inception or Metropolis fit in with the theme of the rest of the readings. However, I know that Prof. Klemann had a lot of potential sources to choose from, and I think she did excellently overall.",
    "This course has a really great syllabus and works. The analyzing of films was wonderful. There was too high expectations for workload. We would have papers due and multiple readings for class.",
    "I thought this course was especially interesting in regards to the literature chosen and the way in which it was presented. Throughout the lectures, Prof. Klemann and the TFs were always presenting multiple ways of reading the texts, something that I think is rarely done. It opened up many possibilities as to how to interpret a text, and helps to emphasize the ability of literature to evoke all sorts of reactions, dependent on the reader.",
    "One weakness of the course is the fact that it's a lecture course and not a seminar; I know that it's because so many people wanted to take it, and I'm very glad I was able to take it because it was a lecture, but I didn't feel like I was able to discuss the texts as in depth as I would have liked. That being said, the lectures were very insightful, and the reading material and films were great.",
    "I wish I could say this course lived up to the fantastical title. After taking this course, I realize how huge of a genre the \"gothic\" is, and I think the class reflected that as it didn't always feel totally focused. I think the reading list can use revision. I didn't feel like some of the works (notably, Northanger Abbey) fit into the overall course. Also, while the lectures were interesting, I didn't find them particularly helpful for the course assignments. Two major strengths I'd point out about this course are 1. some of the readings were really enjoyable, and I loved how gothic film was incorporated -- I think that was my favorite aspect of the course. 2. the assignments facilitated improvement in my literary and academic writing.",
    "Strengths: Wide variety of material from films to novels to short stories, the lecture combined with sections for an English class was very helpful Weaknesses: The material was sometimes brushed over too quickly.",
    "This course should have been a 114 course. There was too much of a focus on writing and not enough on the course material, which was disappointing as I took the course to learn more about the material.",
    "Professor Klemann is very enthusiastic and a good lecturer. She's clearly passionate about the subject, and does a great job engaging the class. I loved the assignment structure -- unlike a lot of classes, where the biggest assignment is due at the end of the course, the most intense paper occurred in mid-April. This was great timing, and I think it gave the class a chance to complete the assignment more thoughtfully. I would recommend changing the name of the course. While the title this year was certainly catchy, it's really more Gothic themed, and I think a more subdued title would be more appropriate. I would also recommend changing the section sign ups -- it is very difficult to do the on paper version we did this semester.",
    "A strength is that it is interesting material, however, a weakness is that there was a lot of reading that was unnecessary to the class.",
    "There is heavy material work at times which can make one feel overloaded, but that may just be me. Sections seemed awkward; I suggest doing some sort of group activity\/project early on so people can become more familiar with each other and easier to talk to. I see this helping conversation as the semester goes on.",
    "I had never taken a lecture English course before so that may have colored some of my experience but overall I thought the course was well designed. nothing really sticks out either way. I thought some of the tools the professor used to keep people engaged in class were a little heavyhanded but effective. However, at the end of the day, I don't think I gained too many skills outside of being able to talk about gothic literature in a niche crowd.",
    "Strengths: The reading assignments, TAs, and writing feedback. Weakness: The prompts for the assignments were often very convoluted and slightly unclear as to what we should actually prepare for an assignment. Very difficult (although rewarding) class for non-English major.",
    "this course is absolutely amazing! great mix of resources, great breadth of material while remaining focused around central themes, all of the materials were fascinating and added to the course, great format - ZERO weaknesses",
    "One of the best parts of the course was the multimedia aspect to the course materials, it wasn't just books, but also included movies and art. While I thought the pacing for many of the books was fine, I found that I couldn't actually finish Northanger Abbey in the time allotted. Also, there were too many TA presentations, or at least it felt like the TA presentations took up a very large chunk of the class and didn't seem to fit into the big picture of the class as well."

    "This class has a wonderful reading list that I had been waiting to show up for most of my time at Yale. The class is definitely tailored to improving underclassman writing skills and was a bit tedious for me as an upperclassman English major. Professor Klemman is very engaging and makes lectures pretty fun though. Take it if you love the reading list, but be prepared for LOTS of writing instruction.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who doesn't mind doing a bit of reading and who is interested in analytical writing.",
    "If the courses syllabus appeals to you, definitely consider it! Especially if you havent actually encountered many of the works before, despite having heard of virtually all of them, you should take it. The books and films are wonderful. Lectures are quite good and provide interesting new insight into the works. Youll always be left wishing for more time. Professor Klemann brings partner discussion and class brainstorming into her lectures, which is generally pretty nice, even if it can feel like a pain in the moment. Lots of papers, and they arent always super easy, but aspiring writers can push themselves to succeed. Or you can take it credit\/d\/fail like I did and simply savor the syllabus without stressing on the writing.",
    "Absolutely. The format was unique for an English class, and I felt like the course was suitable for people with all varieties of English backgrounds. As a non-English major who had only ever taken one English course before, I felt like I fit right in. The course material is very interesting, Professor Klemann picked excellent TAs and is excellent herself, and I really do feel like I learned a lot. The work was reasonable and left a lot of room for students to pursue their interests.",
    "I would recommend this course. Being that it was the first year the course was offered there were some kinks, but the backbone is great.",
    "I would highly recommend this course- it is a very interesting collection of texts, ones that are seemingly disparate, but through Prof. Klemann's metamorphic definition of gothic, she was able to link the texts in a convincing and fascinating manner. The incorporation of horror films as well as other pieces popular culture makes the course current and entertaining, elements that make it even more enjoyable.",
    "YES",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course; the books and films are fantastic, the lectures are interesting, and it isn't a ton of work but I feel like I did grow a lot as a writer. The strict word limits on the essays were tough to work with, but I really had to learn to condense my writing and make my arguments more effective.",
    "Yes! Gothic fiction is very interesting and this class does well to keep it accessible.",
    "Love this course.",
    "Yes, because it was interesting. Lecture was more about broadening your interests and ways of thinking than learning new material.",
    "This was honestly top three classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Keenan was an amazing lecturer and the syllabus was excellent. Great fifth class, super interesting and engaging, a joy to go to every Monday and Wednesday morning.",
    "Only if you are an underclassmen who really needs to work on your writing technique.",
    "I would recommend the course! It is quite interesting and well taught. Professor Klemann is a great lecturer, and the course is challenging without being overwhelming.",
    "This class was okay, however, the lecture style of an English was not good, and I would recommend taking an English seminar instead of this class.",
    "Totally recommend! All of the material is great, and you always learn something new and interesting with each lecture.",
    "Yes!",
    "yes",
    "I really enjoyed everything we read and everything we learned about in class. It is a huge topic to cover and it ends up being impossible to define the gothic, but it was fascinating to track the history of the genre and learn more about analysis.",
    "This is certainly not a gut writing credit, and I took it hoping it would be one. However, I also took it knowing I like horror and all things gothic, so I truly enjoyed my experience and made it through the difficult nature of the assignments of the course. Don't take this class if you're not remotely interested in the assigned reading. If you are, take it because Professor Klemann is a great lecturer and provides many interesting insights to the material.",
    "ABSOLUTELY one of the best courses I've ever taken at Yale - I learned a ton, I had fun, totally different from any other course because it is so interdisciplinary, creativity always encouraged, Heather is AMAZING and I left every class having learned something new and actually excited to do homework",
    "I recommend this to a student who likes English classes but not the typical stuffy old white man English classes so prevalent at Yale (Though this course does have its fair share of stuffy old white men, the framework makes it feel different)"
