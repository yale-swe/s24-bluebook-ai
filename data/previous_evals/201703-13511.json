    "I learned about the diversity of other research students are doing and gained a few pointers on how to a grant proposal.",
    "Identifying strengths and weaknesses in designing a research project",
    "I learned how to think about and design my research, and how to write an effective research proposal.",
    "I gained knowledge in how to pull together and write a research proposal.",
    "- Find questions - Form hypothesis - Present my ideas to someone outside my area",
    "I developed skills to define a scientific problem for research, do the preliminary investigation, develop a research proposal, and present the research plan. Meanwhile, I polished my writing skills and cooperated well with a team.",
    "The knowledge and skills of my research methods has improved significantly. Since we were expected to criticize, it has sharpened my sensitivity to assess a research in particular",
    "I learned more about proposal writing and where my strengths and weaknesses are in writing and presenting.",
    "Gathering ideas and presenting it into a proposal. Writing successful proposals to get funding.",
    "The structure of an academic proposal",
    "This course helped develop my knowledge about proposal writing, planning research projects, and communicating my ideas to other people. Writing, reading, and communicating were all skills that I practiced in this course. My greatest insight from the class was the difficulty of writing a good proposal that convinces people to fund your research.",
    "I got to practice reading scientific papers and proposals."

   "comments": [
    "It did not align with my expectations. I did not feel that the class helped me develop the topic for my thesis.",
    "I was expecting more advice on how suitable my methods were, but otherwise I think it aligned very well.",
    "It matched with my expectations.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights that I gained in this class were exactly as I expected them to be.",
    "Mostly as expected.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights I gained in this class was much higher than I expected.",
    "It does align with my expectation",
    "I feel like the beginning of writing the proposal was a bit rushed. I also did not expect to read so many papers that I had trouble connecting with the ultimate goal of the class.",
    "It was as I expected.",
    "Very well up to the expectation",
    "I expected that I could gain systematic directions on how to prepare for a new project, including how to select and read literature, but this class didn't meet my needs and it just offered a broad framework.",
    "Most of this course align well with my expectation. But one thing to note is that I expected to learn some skills about how to do literature review but did not learn much about this.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights I gained in this class aligned well with my expectations.",
    "The class is focused on developing your own proposal, which I did do. However, there was a lot more busywork in the beginning of the semester than I expected--this time may have been more productively used to conduct a literature review of our prospective research area, for example."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course needs to include and allow time for students to do an extensive literature review on the topic of their choice.",
    "I thought it was very useful to practice reviewing proposals, both of established faculty and of our peers. It was also very helpful to get feedback on our proposals from the instructor and our peers. Less time could be allotted to reading about the various components of a proposal. Most of all, I wish we had done an annotated bibliography or some kind of formal literature review assignment before we started writing our proposals.",
    "There was a lot of time dedicated to research techniques that we wouldn't be using. Being exposed to other techniques were good, but I think we spent too much time on that.",
    "I think the additive method of building the proposal was very helpful.",
    "Strengths were: -Talking about how to create novelty in your work -Writing a research proposal that is applicable to wide audiences -Created accountability to finish a research proposal Weaknesses: -More focus on individual research proposals as opposed to rather open ended assignments that did not funnel back to each of our interests.",
    "- Strength: systematic, step-by-step guidance in shaping a quality research proposal - Weakness: a little bit fun-raising oriented; prefer more guidance on how to read journals, how to find the gap, and how to form hypotheses",
    "The course covered a lot of valuable practical knowledge and skills that would benefit my future work. All of my work in the course received clear feedback.",
    "Strength: robust, intensive, critical Weakness: too much meddling with researching as our skill rather than giving enough freedom to strengthen our research",
    "Strengths - this course forces you to focus on what you want to study and provides examples of successful proposals. It also highlights what strengthens and weakens your proposal. Weaknesses - The first few lectures did not hold much meaning to me for proposal writing. I would have rather used that time to learn how to develop my own ideas. Also, the final presentation would have been more helpful if we did it before turning in our proposals. Finally, most examples of papers in this class were ecology based, which does not connect to all students.",
    "The class should pay attention to details rather than just framework.",
    "The strengths of this course are: (1) interesting discussions, (2) student presentations about their research proposals, and (3) helping students develop a plan for their projects. I can't think of any real weaknesses. And I don't know how the course could be improved.",
    "the organization of the class was problematic and there were several exercises that felt like busy work that was taking away time from writing out actual proposal.",
    "I appreciated the independence that we had during the proposal writing process, although a few more \"checkpoints\" between the proposal summary and the full proposal due date may have been helpful in order to stay on track. I also appreciated the timely feedback we received. The main thing I would improve is the system for peer review and feedback--I felt that we were often reviewing and being reviewed by students so far outside our own fields that their insights were not very helpful."

    "This course is perfect if you're looking for general feedback and peer review of your proposal.",

    "Actively work with your adviser and not always follow the class's guidelines\/ways of doing things if your adviser is asking for something different",
    "Work with your advisor closely and get started early on reviewing literature for your proposal."
