   "comments": [
    "I thought it was good overall, but sometimes it would have been helpful to have more concrete connections drawn between theory and applications.",
    "I really liked the class. It gave me a different, more conceptual perspective on concepts that we have seen on 500, helping me understanding them better. It was always a pleasure to come to class, and I've learnt a lot. In terms of weaknesses: - it felt like the class was focusing more on depth than on width. We went very deep into some topics and did not approach others. This type of class might be more useful at the end of the quant sequence, when we are better equipped to deal with these deeper themes and questions (and less in need of an \"overview\" of tools and methods we often encounter in papers). - the quantity of problem sets (and the feedback we received from them) seemed insufficient to get enough practice to grasp the concepts we were going over in class. - i liked the conceptual focus of the class, but a few more concrete exemples and applications would sometimes help",
    "Additional practice problems to immediately follow materials covered in the textbook would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: Logical progression, wide content, etc Weakness: Not quite enough practice with the content, at times slow feedback",
    "Professor Aranow is wonderful. He is fair, clear, kind, and passionate about teaching. This course is far superior to PLSC 500 - the organization is better, the content is delivered in a way that makes more sense, and the assignments are reasonable. I also love that this course was organized around a textbook - this is very helpful for those who are not naturally auditory learners.",
    "I struggled to understand many of the concepts taught in this course. I frequently felt that the instruction was designed for and addressed to students with a much greater background in statistics than I had, even when it was revisiting concepts taught in the previous quantitative methods class last fall. Concepts I thought I understood after that class were muddled and less clear here. Even though the class instruction was structured around the textbook, I often found the book and the class dense and inscrutable, and could only understand concepts based on resources I found online or in the textbook used for math camp last summer. The current structure of the quantitative methods sequence does not make sense. Many of the same concepts were covered in both classes -- in fact, the first course covered more methods than the second. They do not build on one another, and at times the second class confused and obscured concepts from the first. These courses really should be restructured to be cumulative and taught in such a way that there is not such a significant gap in the expectations for the students' levels of comprehension.",
    "Fundamentals learned from this class is great. The book makes it easy to follow.",
    "I don't know how important it is to understand the deep theoretical questions that surround statistics. I think that learning more about how statistics is misapplied in the field would have been more productive as a first-year student."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. You learn a lot of important stuff.",
    "Yes, but it would be even better later in the quant sequence.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in conducting applied statistical work in the social sciences.",
    "Yes I would to any other poli sci student. Seems entirely necessary to learn this content in order to call yourself a political scientist",
    "It's required for the quantitative methods track, so if you need to check that box, then I have you guess to bite the bullet, but otherwise I would not recommend this course.",
    "Yes. Anyone who needs to do empirical analysis in the future should take this.",
    "Yes, because I think it is important to understand how we think about statistics. However, I would recommend this course for after one has encountered more statistics in the field.",
    "Absolutely. Changed the way I think about statistics in the social sciences, and my sense is that I could have taken the same course elsewhere and come away with a much shallower (and maybe even incorrect) understanding of the material. I'm a total convert to agnostic statistics. Loved the course."
