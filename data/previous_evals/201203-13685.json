    "The small class facilitated a close relationship between the students and the professor and TA. Professor Montagnini took a genuine interest in the students and their questions.",
    "The best aspects of this course is a really good introduction to ecology of related topics. It does not put too much attention to species, terms, but include necessary ones.",
    "I liked the diversity of topics covered, ranging from savanna ecosystems to sustainable forest management. I also liked the order of the lectures, with the ecological and ecosystem-specific lectures making up the first half of the course and the management-based lectures making up the second half of the course.I really appreciated the professor's willingness to answer students' questions and her encouragement of student participation, which greatly increased my learning in the course.I liked that the final assignments were a presentation and paper, allowing each student to focus on a single topic of interest to apply the course's concepts.I greatly enjoyed the guest lecturers, as well."

If the lectures were made a bit shorter, then there would be more time to present the material and for students to digest it.The study guide for the midterm was not as helpful as it could have been, with many topics on it that were not on the test.While the requirements for formatting, etc., were made very clear, expectations for the type of argument and the kind of research for the final paper and presentation were not very clear. It would have been helpful to have more details in regard to whether, for instance, the students were expected to simply perform a thorough literature review, or if they were expected to also make recommendations and\/or do a thorough case study analysis, etc."
