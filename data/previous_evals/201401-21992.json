   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you have a project, lab, and professor who you want to work with. I was deciding if I wanted to enter academia\/research when I took this course. I decided that research is fun and engaging but not for me.",
    "Definitely recommend it if you have the time to spend on it! It's very time consuming but worth it when you see your results at the end.",
    "Yes; find a good lab that you're interested in. 8hrs a week is no joke though.",
    "If any of you are trying to decide if you want to do research for you senior requirement credits or write a paper in senior seminars, I highly recommend doing research. It was a great experience!",
    "Research is what you make of it if you find a great PI that will support you throughout.",
    "It depends on which lab you work in but mine mostly consisted of data entry.",
    "Definitely! Not too much work. Just a hands on experience of what it's like to work in a psych lab.",
    "I have really enjoyed my past two semesters of Directed Research. It has been such a valuable experience to plan and carry out an independent research project under the guidance of a grad student and faculty advisor in a lab. The experience can be very time-consuming (giving students a taste of what it's like to do research beyond their time as undergraduates). In the end, it is an extremely worthwhile learning experience that I would highly recommend.",
    "Great way to gain valuable research experience. Also great way to fulfill your senior writing requirement for the psych major and\/or write your thesis if you're into independent research. Make sure it's a lab you like and an advisor who will actually meet with you.",
    "Fabulous way to get experience in a lab group as a class credit!",
    "Definitely recommend! Great opportunity to get hands on research experience.",
    "Really wonderful opportunity to engage with current research on topics of personal interest.",
    "A good course if you are interested in research.",
    "YES. definitely. you learn how to do research!",
    "It all depends on your lab and how much responsibility you are given! Obviously a great chance to get empirical research experience though. My lab was a huge time commitment and could be redundant, but when you get into a schedule and habit of working in lab and it ends up being a very positive experience overall.",
    "Only useful if you are currently doing or would like to do research for credit,",
    "An opportunity to research in a particular field and on a particular project, take this course if you want to learn whether or not research as a discipline is for you, or whether or not a particular lab is for you",
    "You'll likely only take this as a psychology major, and it's a different experience for everyone, but go for it.",
    "Yes. It really allows you to see what research is like while also earning credit for the course.",
    "This is the course to sign up for if you are doing research for credit. There are no class meetings or anything - you just figure out your research schedule with your P.I. and write a 20-page paper at the end (or 10 pages if you're getting half a credit). This can be a lit review or a discussion of data you've collected, depending on what kind of work you've been doing and how far along you are with your project. Research is definitely a worthwhile experience if you find a lab that suits your interests and a P.I. who is a good mentor.",
    "Yes--this course is valuable to gain hands on learning experience that a traditional course cannot provide. I had the opportunity to apply many of the concepts and skills I learned in other classes!",
    "Take this course if you have a specific interest in psychology research, and an advisor or lab in mind with whom you want to work. Start planning and applying for IRB approval as needed early!!"
