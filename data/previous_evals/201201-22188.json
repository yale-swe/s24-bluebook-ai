    "It is a good course teaching the second half of single variable calculus. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I'm going to miss our class - thanks to our amazingly nice teacher and small class size, we had a lot of fun and were able to express our frustrations and misunderstandings openly without shame. It was tough - we had to fly through the material quickly since my section only met twice a week. Everything that my peers had mentioned about the difficulty of the material and the final exam was true...what a challenge. I'm so proud to have made it through this course, as it's definitely one of those classes that - if you stick it out - makes you feel so much stronger. The course bridged well from the Math 112 curriculum and introduced just enough of series to be barely manageable. The weakness was that the course was so broad that by the end of the semester my brain was truly overloaded with new material...which took a toll one quite a lot of students by the time of the final. You really, really needed to know EVERYTHING for the final. I had never seen any of these concepts before and learning so much in so short a time was at times truly overwhelming.",
