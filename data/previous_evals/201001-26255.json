    "(+): help students understand various health care issues in perspective of health economics",
    "the class ended up being more of a literature survey course and did not focus on health economics at all. We ended up just discussing articles in class, which would sometimes be generalized into theories, but way too much time was just spent regurgitating articles.",
    "I really liked this class, it was appropriately targeted for someone like myself who's taken other econ classes at YSPH but is definitely not an economist. Interesting readings connected the topic of the week to broader health issues, and class discussions were usually enlightening.",
    "I really appreciated the format of the class with lecture in the beginning, followed by the opportunity for group discussion on the week's readings.",
    "The class offers a great opportunity to discuss health issues within an economic framework. However, I wished we had more just straight lectures about economics and health not just discussing examples. Also, although weekly assignments were a good idea the content of them could have been improved.",
    "I would have liked to learn more about the actual methods of health economics rather than focusing only on the topics. For example, it would be been really helpful to have a class on exactly how to run an instrumental variable analysis. This way we could walk away with some tangible skills in health economics.",
    "The course was a little slow and it would have been nice to spend more time learning advanced topics in econ and econometrics rather than just doing literature reviews every week.",
    "I enjoyed the course a lot. I think that the strengths are that we read contemporary economic literature and learning new econometric methods such as the IV. I thought that the problem set was a really good exercise and i think adding 1 or 2 more of those types of problem sets would have also been a good addition. I think the weaknesses of the course tend to reflect the students - if the students were prepared for the class, then it tended to not go as well. I think the weekly preparation sheets helped in keeping most people honest.",
    "covers a variety of topic in health econ",
    "This class was a lit review. I was hoping for more explicit instruction from the professor. I could have been given the reading list at the beginning and learned the same thing. I didn't get to learn many advanced health econ principles.",
    "The course was not what I had expected. Although meant to be discussion, it ended up being more seminar-like, which is difficult when discussing extremely dense readings and complicated topics. The readings as a whole, were not all that exciting. Some topics were very interesting, while other articles were very tough to read through and accurately understand. I think other articles (less dense and more interesting) could have been incorporated. But I loved how Susan changed the topics discussed every week, as that did make it more interesting in reading through all the articles. And it also introduced me to economic issues from a new perspective and got me thinking about topics from an economics viewpoint, which I had never previously done.",
    "Good course. I learned a lot and it was very useful. I liked the informal lecture and class discussion structure of the class. There were a lot of readings, but I thought they were useful and relevant. I thought the assignments were challenging, but I enjoyed being pushed and challenged."

    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0(+): Very good at motivating students to work and study. Has a good leadership skill.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0She is extremely great at providing feedback and our final paper and presentations were great to have and were definitely my favorite part of the course. She was really helpful in helping us to narrow our topics down and making sure that they were appropriate.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0I thought she was great- good explanations\/breakdowns of more complex topics, on point and no nonsense, but also came across as really nice.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0She is a great professor!",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan was a nice and laid back professor. The information about the course was not always communicated effectively, like her expectations for presentations or meetings about the class. Also assignments got shifted around sometimes without much prior notice.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0I think that Prof Busch is a no-nonsense who (appropriately) will engage in a dialogue which critically assessed the issues. I think a lot of professors are afraid to tell a student that they are wrong and that only ends up diluting the experience for everyone. Prof Busch was very good at making sure that this did not happen.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0good interaction with students",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is a nice person, but I wish she was more structured and instructive. Meeting with her one-on-one was helpful.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0I really admire Susan and enjoyed my conversations with her, but unfortunately the class was not conducted in the best manner. The room set-up was not condusive to conversation, the lights were always half on, and she taught the class sitting down, reading off of her notes.Unfortunately, it was difficult the first few weeks as she taught us information and a brief run through of econ, when we did not have her notes to follow her with. It would have been helpful to put her ppt up on the screen for the first few weeks, and then switch to seminar\/discussion when we got past hte basic information we needed to understand. Otherwise, Susan was open to discussion and differing ideas and encouraged people to express their viewpoints. Unfortunately, she did not provide us with a break in an 1 hour and 50 minutes class, which was quite painful with a morning class mid-week.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0I thought she did a very good job with the course. She provided feedback and I was impressed that she took the time to meet individually with all students in the class to discuss their final papers."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, for MPH student this should be a required course to understand the whole issue about the current health reforms etc.",
    "Good intro to health care economics, some more advanced stuff but nothing overwhelming, workload well spaced out over the semester.",
    "Review a wide range of health economic theory and research on topics in health policy and healthcare management.",
    "Overall good course, but I wish there were more concrete economic concepts discussed.",
    "A topical review of health econ issues.",
    "I would recommend it to students who are interested in an application of economic concepts to public health issues. I don't think that the course is appropriate for students with just a fleeting interest in economics... it really should be for students who have strong economic backgrounds.",
    "good class, covers a variety of topic in health econ",
    "I recommend it only if they were looking for a lit review of health economics.",
    "Not the most interesting course and the format is not the best, but some of the topics discussed are quite relevant. If the format was changed to make a more dynamic class (or format being altered some weeks), it could become a very relevant, and worthwhile class.",
    "Great course. Great instructor. A lot of reading and work, but totally worth it. I learned a lot and felt that it was very relevant and applicable to my MPH program and to my future job in health care (whatever that may be). I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students!"
