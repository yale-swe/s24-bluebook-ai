    "L5 Chinese was an entirely different experience than L1 and L2 Chinese at Yale (I took L3 and L4 at Harvard Beijing Academy over the summer). We had homework everyday, but it was more of self-preparation and advanced analysis or translation than it was busy work. In class, I often found myself surprised by the complexity of some of the topics we discussed: abortion, adoption, the AIDS epidemic, the Long March, etc. Funnily enough, I could tell that my speaking abilities decreased over the course of the semester, while my knowledge of content and vocabulary increased. Sometimes L5 felt like a class of rote memorization, which was a bit unfortunate but, retrospectively speaking, necessary to learning the language. L5 Chinese was a lot of daily work, and class required intensive preparation in order to perform well, but doing the work was really therapeutic in comparison to work for other classes.",
    "I improved my conversational Chinese skills, and I learned a lot of new vocab.",
    "This semester, I developed a wider vocabulary and greater written skill in Chinese especially.",
    "This is a fairly straightforward Chinese language course. There is work every night and a small quiz most days but not all. Every night's hw was a bit different but I averaged about 1 hour a night (sometimes a half hour, sometimes more like 2h). The tests were challenging though not impossible. The teachers, Zhang and Li Laoshi, are caring and thorough. Great class! If there is one criticism, I did feel at points that this course overemphasized character learning and writing. They could change this by reformatting the exams. Because writing characters was a major part of the exams, students mostly studied characters. I could have been pushed to write more Chinese. My readings improved a ton, but my speaking remained steady, with no big improvement.",
    "In addition to general knowledge of Chinese language, such as new vocabulary and grammatical patterns, the textbook and course also covered modern social issues facing China such as the impacts of the One Child Policy and gender equality issues. Toward the end, some of the textbook topics seemed a little strange, but at this high a level I am not sure what other way there is to cover the necessary vocabulary. This course also focused much more on speaking than the Chinese I took in high school, which made adjusting to course participation more difficult; by the end of the course, I think my ability to use the language in conversation and dialogue had improved somewhat.",
    "Furthered my skills in Chinese language and grammar, was also helpful in developing insightful knowledge about the current state of Chinese society."

   "comments": [
    "Solidified vocabulary and reading comprehension skills, but the daily homework workload was too much, so that it conflicted with other courses\/commitments, and I think what I learned in this course could have been learned in a more efficient way (less quizzes).",
    "L5 is well-formatted and well-taught, and because there's a regular pattern to the schedule of learning new lessons, doing certain homeworks, taking daily quizzes, writing biweekly essays, and taking oral and written tests, you get into the swing of things very quickly. It's a large amount of work, especially because class takes place every day, and you need to be prepared if you don't want to embarrass yourself in front of the teachers, but this is just an intrinsic property of learning intermediate to advanced language. The quizzes and exams are all fair, and the TA's really help you prepare for the oral exams.",
    "I believe that more emphasis could be placed on obtaining spoken fluency.",
    "This is a fairly straightforward Chinese language course. There is work every night and a small quiz most days but not all.

My readings improved a ton, but my speaking remained steady, with no big improvement.",
    "The course is good at emphasizing most aspects of Chinese language, such as speaking, listening, and reading; my knowledge of Chinese improved in a well balanced manner. The rigid structure of the course also allowed me to plan my study schedule more efficiently. It was helpful to fall into a routine such that I would be forced to engage with the language regularly. The content of the textbook was sometimes strange, but this may have been necessary in order to target the vocabulary that was covered. I wish there were more emphasis on writing characters, both simplified and traditional, although in the technology era a lack of emphasis on this vital aspect of Chinese language seems inevitable. I also wish we had more practice using the vocabulary and sentence structures outside the context of the content that we learned in the text of each chapter. Often, the vocabulary and sentence patterns were taught too closely with the content of the chapters such that I failed to gain an understanding of the variety of contexts in which the words\/patterns were applicable. I also wish there were more of a Taiwanese perspective in the teaching of the course, as I felt this sizable portion of the language community was largely ignored and content related to other Chinese-speaking regions was left out.",
    "Weaknesses: - Exams seem very arbitrary and strange: for example, there is a pinyin to Chinese character translation section that doesn't seem very useful or have a purpose beyond testing rote memorization - In-class lectures seemed to focus too much on the content of the reading passage, and not enough on grammar points or usage of new vocabulary. Strengths: - Course is structured very well and well-planned so students know exactly what to expect every day - Everything counts because every thing is a small percentage point, not a huge single weight on the final"

    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody taking the Chinese pathway at Yale or looking to further their previous Chinese studies from elsewhere. The topics we discussed in class were varied and complex, and it was exciting to see our conversations develop further and further as we touched on more interesting topics. The pieces we read in class from our textbook were not always fictional stories - towards the end of the course, they became historically related pieces that were much more engaging and thoughtful. The teachers do their best to spark conversation and get everyone involved in talking and participating.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in mastering the Chinese language and understanding further its culture.",
    "I would certainly recommend CHNS 150 to any students seeking to continue Chinese language study from l4 at Yale.",

    "I would recommend this course because of the strength of the professors, teaching methods, and funding that back the department.",
    "I would recommend the course only if you are willing to put in the effort required. Even if you are coming back from a Light fellowship program (as I did), it is a LOT of work, I would say about two or three hours every day. Think carefully first about whether to take this, and if you do, I would strongly urge you to first Credit\/D it (you can always just switch to letter grade later). That said, if you do decide to continue in the course, know that there will be a huge, almost unmanageable and insurmountable, amount of vocabulary and grammar that you will need to MASTER to do well on exams. For exams, knowing how to use every single vocabulary and in what context is definitely more important than knowing the technicalities of all the grammar points (if you just know generally what each grammar point means then you'll be fine). One positive is that writing characters isn't emphasized very much at all, for example, during exams, there are very very VERY few points taken off for writing characters incorrectly even if you have a lot of them incorrect. Knowing the vocabulary, which I mentioned before, is far more important."
