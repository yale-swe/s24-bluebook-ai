    "Any chance you have to take a class with Greta - TAKE IT. She's incredible. You absolutely will not regret it. But this class in particular was amazing - it's discussion based, so do the reading! The thing is, you'll actually want to do the reading, because it's so interesting - it's a perfect combination of foundational texts that you should really read anyway at some point, and stuff you've never heard of that's equally mind-expanding. Basically, no matter what your background is, if you come in with an open mind, you will learn so much. Take this class!",
    "YES. This class is fantastic for anyone interested in thinking about trans studies, Greta is an angel, the other students who take this class tend to be amazing people, definitely take it.",
    "A fabulous introduction to transgender studies, taught by an equally fabulous professor. As Yale's first transgender studies course (I believe?), this class sets a wonderful precedent. Combines foundational works that are pivotal to the discipline with more flavorful modern\/postmodern works. There were students from all different disciplines in the class, and the course material (as well as Greta) really facilitate everyone having unique, constructive contributions to make. Seriously though, Greta totally rocks and makes this class worth it. Workload is manageable and interesting, discussions make you feel like you get stuff out of them, screenings\/meetups are fun, and there's a lot of freedom for the Midterm Paper (annotated bibliography) and Final Paper (topic of choice extending midterm).",
    "I would summarize it as an excellent start to opening up Transgender studies at Yale. I would definitely recommend it to any and all WGSS majors and anyone who is interested in Queer theory in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it was a thoughtful entry to topics that can be contentious and often seem esoteric to many people, in and outside of WGSS contexts.",
    "This class is an introduction to the new but rich field of transgender studies. The class guides students through in-depth readings of key texts of transgender studies, almost all of which are by transgender authors. This class is NOT \"trans 101\" - you're not going to learn \"what trans people are.\" Instead, you're learning about a discipline and a methodology, a field of scholarship within gender studies. This class is an excellent way to engage with scholarship by trans people, which is hard to come by in other classes. I'd strongly recommend this class to all WGSS majors, and to anyone else who is hoping to critically broaden the scope of their studies.",
    "Whoever you are, TAKE THIS CLASS! Greta is an amazing professor, so don't pass up the chance to take this class if she offers it again. The readings are all engaging and thought-provoking--whether you have no experience with trans studies or you fancy yourself an expert, you will find the work meaningful and engaging. This is honestly the best class I have taken at Yale to date. JUST TAKE IT.",
    "I would characterize the course as a highly informative, broad survey of interdisciplinary writings concerning issues of gender and transgender. It is a course that I would highly recommend to any student interested in gender, sexuality. LGBTQ, or women's studies. In fact, I would consider it an essential core course for anyone with these or similar interests.",
    "Definitely take this class if you care about any aspect of gender! A lot of reading sometimes, but pretty easy to get by only reading some of it and still engaging pretty well.",
    "Take itttttt! Yale has needed a Trans Studies class for so long, and this one is great. Greta is an excellent discussion leader and is readily available to help in whatever way they can. The class was pretty self-selecting, so everyone in it was very interested in the topic, and most people had some background knowledge, but I feel like if you're considering taking it without knowing anything about Trans Studies, it's comprehensive enough that you wouldn't feel lost."
