   "comments": [
    "I'd definitely recommend the class. It's perfect for anyone looking to learn how to speak intelligent about current economic issues.",
    "I would recommend this class. The workload is VERY reasonable (I wish more professors gave short papers throughout the year rather than one behemoth during finals) and the stuff is interesting, although the readings can be dry. Swenson is an awesome guy and is happy to let class discussion go wherever you want it to go. Especially good for the discussions about agriculture and pharmaceuticals!",
    "Yes would recommend for anyone interested in economics and politics. This is a great class for you to understand how these two forces converge. You will also end up learning a lot about the history of American politics and market regulation, especially if you are willing to do some extra research for your short papers. Overall, this was a very interesting class with engaging readings and a very fair workload. I thought our class discussions were intellectually stimulating ande enjoyed writing the 5 short argumentative papers - I think that writing these papers was a great learning experience and I appreciated Professor Swenson's feedback",
    "I would recommend this course to others only if the interested student has yet to be exposed to collusion between private enterprises and public government; the course provides a good understanding of the pattern of corruption in the U.S. system. However, if students are looking instead for a more in-depth examination of key issues of such corruption, I would only half-heartedly recommend this course, since the breadth of the material covered meant never delving too deeply into any one issue.",
    "Perfect for both in and out of class majors. Do the readings or lecture can become dry due to the fact it is discussion heavy.",
    "Good course, very interesting readings."
