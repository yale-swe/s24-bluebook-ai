   "comments": [
    "I would say that the course is excellent for understanding the applications of group theory and good for getting an introduction to coordination chemistry research. I would recommend it for anybody interested in researching inorganic chemistry because the material covered could have direct implications on their research.",
    "Good course to get introductory idea about coordination chemistry or inorganic chemistry. Highly recommended to students who are interested to study metal chemistry.",
    "Sure, very helpful",
    "The course is an introduction to group theory and the application toward transition metal complexes. Familiarity with the transition metals as well as learning the trends surrounding complexes will come in the second half of the course which looks at the actual chemistry of these metals (mainly the first row since organometallics covers the lower rows mostly).Yes, I would recommend this course if interested or possibly interested in transition metal chemistry.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student, especially if their area of expertise is not focused on coordination chemistry in research. This course is great for providing a general overview of the field that will undoubtedly be useful in all of my future chemical endeavors.",
    "This class surveys coordination chemistry with an emphasis on the following subjects: applications of group theory to molecular orbital theory and spectroscopy, ligand field theory, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of reactions involving coordination complexes."

   "comments": [
    "Made me study more about inorganic chemistry, made me feel that I need to study more.Gave me a basic idea of how to think about molecules containing metal, which I never had before as organic chemistry student.",
    "help a lot.",
    "This course greatly increased my knowledge of both coordination chemistry as well as chemistry as a whole. It was an excellent experience and provided me with a breadth of study.",
    "Although I had previously encountered many of the topics in my undergraduate work, the level of detail and clarity of explanation in this course reinforced (and in some cases, built on) my knowledge. I anticipate that this course will be very useful in my research."
