    "This class covers most of the major existentialists from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche to Sartre and Camus. I recommend it for anyone who has taken both ancient and modern history of philosophy.",
    "This is easily my most favorite class. The reading list alone makes it worthwhile: Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Camus, Sartre. Honestly, it does not get any better. Except that it does because Scott Edgar is great. He lectures, but also allows students to question and challenge and generally discuss during class. The lectures complement the readings nicely and often clarify the more difficult points. Section is great because the topics are so interesting. Really, if you have even the slightest inkling towards philosophy, this is a great way to engage in one the more fascinating schools.",
    "I honestly just took this course to fulfill my Hu requirement. I did pretty well on the midterm essay, so I didn't drop the course. However, I didn't do most of the readings and it caught up to me by the term paper. Even so, I will probably get a B or B+... so the grading isn't too harsh. If you're not interested in philosophy, do not take this course; there are easier ways to get an Hu. The reading and analysis is not overwhelming, but it's just a bit too intense if you don't care about the subject matter at all. The professor was pretty good.",
    "PHIL 327 is a class with a wonderful reading list. If Camus, Sartre, Dostoevsky, Heidegger, de Beauvoir, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard are the types of author one is interested in reading, this will be a great class. It was awesome to be able to read these authors in the context of each other and begin to see threads spanning through existentialist philosophy that carry into the world today. The writing (2 3 page midterm essays and a term paper of 8-10 pages) was fair and even fun. It helped me understand the thinkers more. The exam was fair and reasonable, no surprises. Plus, Scott Edgar is an informative and funny lecturer. If you have even a passing interest in this class, you can't go wrong by taking it.",
    "I wish I hadn't taken this course Cr\/D because Scott Edgar was FANTASTIC and the course was soooo interesting -- definitely one of my favorites at Yale thus far. Edgar is a wonderful lecturer with a great sense of humor and he really really cares about his students. Likewise, he was able to present really confusing philosophical principles in a clear light. All in all, the class was amazing and I 100% highly recommend it to anybody who wants an eye-opening class that will make you think critically. Again, Scott Edgar is an amazing professor and I just wish I hadn't taken the course Cr\/D so I could take advantage of his wonderful teaching skills more (he's also sooo nice)",
    "Professor Edgar made the class really, really interesting! Take it if you want to figure out why the hell life has any meaning in the absence of god. The readings are all worth doing, every single one. Grading was kind of harsh, but I don't expect the same TA will be grading next time around. Also, the final was kind of awful.",
    "After the first lecture, I thought this would be, more or less, a self-help course for English\/Lit majors who take themselves too seriously. However, it did pick up towards the middle of the semester. The readings are interesting, but dense (Sickness Unto Death, Being and Time, etc.). Lectures tended to be a bit cursory, only covering the really large concepts, and readings tended to gloss over the finer points, as reading excerpts are wont to do. That said, it's an interesting topic, though somewhat elusive, as Edgar seemed reluctant to put his foot down on anything as far as possible interpretations of the readings and what Existentialism really is.",
    "TAKE. THIS. COURSE. Best course I have taken at Yale, hands down. Professor Edgar is the funniest, most engaging professor around, and the readings are unparalleled in their intrigue and style. We read The Plague, No Exit, an excerpt of The Second Sex, and SO MANY other amazing readings that no one can live without. If you have any interest in understanding yourself, the world around you, other people, religion, or life in general, you need to take this class. Professor Edgar is hilarious and the readings are truly enjoyable. I'm so sad this class is over. Make sure you take it!!!",
    "You learn about existentialists. It's pretty great.",
    "Yes. Amazing syllabus. Important material. Beautiful arguments. Professor Edgar is a very clear and engaging professor who explains the material well. Talking about this material in section was always a blast. The TA, Tom, is a tough grader, but go talk to him about your essays early, and you should be fine. Amazing class.",
    "Yeah, i'm glad i took it. Prof Edgar makes this class.",
    "The best philosophy course I have taken at Yale. Maybe even the best course I have ever taken at Yale: the material hang together well, the reading was not too heavy, and the course finally focused on something that is REALLY relevant - how do you live your life properly\/well\/authentically? How do you realize your humanity to the fullest? As for Prof. Edgar: extremely structured, extremely precise, extremely nice, and with a subtle humor that constantly made me chuckle. Sometimes I was the only one in the class. Anyway, Scott Edgar must get a teaching prize. I took Gonzales-Echevarria's Don Quixote class, and if he could get a prize, then Edgar deserves ten of them. Far superior.Take this course, it will change your life.",
    "It's an absolutely phenomenal reading list, and the short papers aren't bad at all. A lot of whether you like this course depends on whether you like Professor Edgar - he's a good lecturer who doesn't put on a show, but never reaches the end of any given lecture and will leave your questions a lot more open than you thought they were before you raised your hand to ask them. Shop for a day or two and see if you like Edgar's style or don't before committing to this course as the way in which you'll read these texts.",
    "What an excellent class. Really gives you a lot of perspective as far as your own life and your own decisions in life. I recommend this to everybody, and plus, Professor Edgar is the bomb. He's so engaging and makes the material come alive.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend Existentialism. It is a fantastic class, extremely interesting and worthwhile, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Edgar is amazing, very smart and helpful but pretty chill. The class has a lot of reading, but most of it is really interesting so it doesnt seem that bad.",
    "You can predict what it's going to be about: the world is a-moral, meaning it has no morals, and humans want there to be morality, so there is a constant struggle with that. You will not get answers. You will find a bunch of people trying to get at answers, but they seem to be going about it all wrong.",
    "Definitely. Great readings, professor and TA. It's on one of the most interesting philosophical traditions too, in my opinion.",
    "It was a course on major existentialist thinkers and their relationship to one another. I would highly recommend the course.",
    "Yes, i would."
