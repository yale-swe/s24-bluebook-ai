    "I definitely learned a lot about heat transfer, heat exchangers, fins and other devices in this class and it gave me an intuitive understanding of the topic. If you are not doing ABET MechE, take this only if you are really interested in the topic.",
    "A demanding professor. Workload can get to be a bit high at times, but he's also an incredibly caring professor. It's easy to get extensions with him if you've been having a rough week, provided that you actually turn in the psets within a reasonable time. Also, he's always willing to make time for his students to go over concepts, psets, etc. Don't overload your schedule when taking this class. Your success in the class depends on how much time you put into it.",
    "Probably required for ABET... So take it. It'll be one of the harder classes you take in terms of material, but it's worth it",
    "It's a lot of work, but you will ultimately learn the material. You'll learn some very important analytical and mathematical techniques, but it won't be easy and will sometimes be frustrating."
