    "I'd definitely recommend ENGL 129 even if you're not an English major. It's a great way to expand your literary horizons without getting bogged down or overwhelmed.",
    "This course is a great overview of western tragedy from the Iliad to modern works. Aside from Iliad, everything is a play, which may or may not be your cup of tea, but I found it very useful, both for the length and to keep things consistent for comparative analysis. There are only four or five papers, so not too much of a demand for writing as far as writing credits go; however, there is A LOT of reading, so be prepared if you have other reading-heavy courses. Professor Lindskog is very good about meeting with students to discuss papers, and also understanding when it comes to extensions (if you have a real reason other than having forgotten to start it when you should have). Her teaching style had a nice mix of guiding the conversation and letting the students take the reins. I would definitely recommend taking the course with her.",
    "Lots of reading but a good class. A lot of sad plays though so be prepared.",
    "Yes! Definitely a course worth taking if you're even the least bit interested in tragedy. A lot of reading and writing though, so be prepared for the workload!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with a passion for reading, as the glass does require a lot of reading. As long as you enjoy reading, the content is interesting enough to make you love the class."
