   "comments": [
    "This is one of the only classes where I had a strong understanding of all parts of the syllabus by the end of the class. I attribute this to the ease and relevancy of the material as well as Professor Simons's clear explanations and activities to reinforce our knowledge.",
    "Macro economic studies.",
    "I learned how to discuss international commerce.",
    "I learned the foundational material of Macro. We learned some simple models and foundational identities. Not a lot of material was covered in the course. I would say it was more about depth and understanding how principles arose than it was about covering every Macroeconomic thought ever.",
    "This is a good introduction to macroecon. I think the lessons were instructive and engaging. It makes you think about the way the world works.",
    "This course is an introduction to macroeconomics, and is mostly theory based (not math like micro).",
    "I developed a broad base of knowledge about macroeconomics by taking this course. I learned how to analyze macroeconomic trends to determine effects on supply and demand of labor, credit, foreign currency, etc. In addition I learned about countercyclical macroeconomic policy development (both monetary and fiscal), and its effects on economic fluctuations. This knowledge and these skills helped give me a good insight into what macroeconomics is all about and made me eager to continue taking more macroeconomics classes.",
    "I learned about how large scale economic factors influence each other.",
    "I learned more about economics trends, credit markets, the forex market, and why certain countries are more prosperous than others.",
    "I got a very good understanding of the general overview of economic metrics, international finance and financial crises.",
    "Economics has always been a major interest for me, and this course furthered that interest. It has shown me how economics can be used to really analyze and create possible solutions for some of life's most challenging problems.",
    "Basic macroeconomic concepts regarding employment, production\/GDP, central banks (like the Fed), credit systems, international finance, and financial crises (course emphasized the Great Recession). The course definitely brought to light subjects that I found interesting and that I look forward to learning about further in other economics classes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was structured well and presented engagingly. The textbook was easier (than in past terms, right?) which I think was appropriate for an introductory course, especially for kids like me whose high schools didn't offer econ classes.",
    "I think that Katrina Simons is very personable and engages students with the material. I think sometimes earlier material could be reviewed after it has been tested.",
    "I like the seminar format of the course. Accountability for readings would improve student participation I think. That could be more quizzes or reading responses, but at the moment, no one does their readings. That said, I really liked the textbook for this course (especially compared to the intro micro seminar book).",
    "This course was engaging. I enjoy the lectures and buzz groups and the ability to ask questions. The textbook was very clear and easy to read. I think the problem sets and first two exams were too easy, making studying for the final difficult, especially given the relative complexity of the final compared to all other tests and practice.",
    "The course is kinda dry at times, although I really enjoyed the discussions of the American and European financial crises in 2007 you do at the end of class (you get to synthesize everything you've learned during the semester).",
    "The strengths are that it is very well-organized, and the expectations are very clear. The slides that we read every day had clear information, and the tests were very fair, directly based on what we learned in class and what was in the corresponding chapters of the textbook. The only main weakness was that with the curve, it is very difficult to do well.",
    "I felt like it gave a sufficient baseline understanding of macroeconomics but we learned word for word to the powerpoint which was word for word in the textbook. Oftentimes I just read the textbook beforehand and lecture was just regurgitating the exact same thing. I also felt like we were just learning concepts without learning overarching trendlines and connections.",
    "Classes could have been a little more engaging and videos could have been used.",
    "Lectures sometimes go very fast. The curve is crazy which is very annoying. The \"seminar\" format is definitely more engaging than a lecture though.",
    "This course gives a good presentation of the information of macroeconomics. Making the powerpoint presentation slides available before the lecture was a big help. My favorite part of class, however, was the \"buzz groups\". I wish we had more of them. I learn best when I'm really engaged in a group environment in the classroom, whether that's through class discussions, group activities, etc. I think more active participation could be added to make this course better. There was perhaps a little too much time spent passively listening.",
    "A strength of the course comes from the generally interesting material that is covered. There was a lot to discuss throughout the semester and I always looked forward to lecture. I also enjoyed the presentation of the material -- Professor Simons lectured from PowerPoints that resembled material from the textbook. She also would upload the PowerPoints onto ClassesV2.",
    "The seminar style intro macro was more engaging than the micro lecture I took last semester, and there was more student discussion although almost al the material taught in class came straight from the book"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Even if they're not a math person, this course is a good way to learn about a lot of the economic forces that shape the world we live in.",
    "Yes I would. It's a straight forward course that helps you learn macroeconomics.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who actually want to learn the material. The seminar format forces students to come to class and engage with Macro.",
    "If you plan on taking Econ at Yale, take the seminar with Professor Simons (macro or micro). She is clear and passionate about the material. She encourages and answers questions that further your understanding of the course. You are engaged with the material in a way the lecture won't do.",
    "You're probably taking this class because you have to, so go for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are interested in economics, especially the more overarching themes of economics that macroeconomics focuses on. Even for someone with no prior experience with this subject, it was still possible to understand the information thoroughly and do well. While introductory microeconomics might turn some people away from taking this course, I think this course would appeal to a much wider base of people.",
    "I would recommend this to another student if they have to take it. For example most people in the class were doing it for their major like me. If given the choice between this and the lecture I would probably still choose this one because the lecture is easy not to pay attention to or skip but you're held more accountable here.",
    "You should definitely take this before moving on to intermediate micro, because it covers a lot of material that AP Macro does not cover.",
    "Yeah I think macro is an interesting topic and I liked the seminar. Just know the curve is intense.",
    "I think economics is a subject that will benefit anyone, and I think the seminar format creates many more opportunities for personalized learning.",
    "I would recommend ECON 111 to other students considering between ECON 111 and ECON 116. I feel like I've learned more from the seminar-style lectures than my friends taking ECON 116. We definitely go further into some subjects than the large lecture class (ECON 116) and the presentation of the material was effective.",
    "Take the seminar over the lecture! More likely to show up to lecture and less likely to fall asleep"
