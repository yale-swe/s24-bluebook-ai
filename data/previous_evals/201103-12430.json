    "If you want to learn Indonesian you will take this course. So you don't really have a choice. That said, I enjoy going to class.If you are considering whether to learn Indonesian at all. I would recommend the language on the grounds that(1) It is a very logical and straightforward language, so it is good for people like me who are weak language students(2) There are nearly 300 million Indonesians. There are almost no Americans who speak the language. Hello supply and demand imbalance!",
    "I would certainly recommend taking this course to cultural expand a students knowledge of labguge",
    "I think this is a very valuable language and if you are prepared to commit yourself and are good at self-motivation, I would recommend this class. However, many people in the classes do not seem to put much effort in the language and do not concentrate in class, which is very frustrating if you want the class to move quickly. To get around this, Pak Indriyo encourages us to get involved in the language table, the Yale Indonesia Forum, panels, etc - so there are plenty of opportunities to learn."
