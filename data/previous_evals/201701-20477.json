    "I learned how to think holistically about the human body and how its systems interact and evolve over a lifetime, and how they fit into the greater picture of land and sea life. I now have a clear mental picture of the relationships between major groups of animals, like sharks, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, and how their organ systems and differences developed.",
    "This class teaches about Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy. If you are interested in this topic, take it. If you are not interested in this topic, do not take this course.",
    "I developed a strong basic knowledge of the anatomy of so many animals!! It is amazing to see how structures are derived from one another.",
    "dissection",
    "I got to learn about organ systems of so many types of animals, something that I had never done in such detail",
    "Great preparation for medical school. You learn not just the anatomy but also the evolutionary logic for why certain anatomical structures exist.",
    "I learned about the evolutionary and developmental relationships between almost all parts of organismal anatomy across the bilaterian phylogenetic tree, particularly for vertebrates.",
    "Great overview of vertebrate anatomy and some evolutionary biology."

   "comments": [
    "The subject matter is interesting, though sometimes it's a little unclear where we're going or what the goals are. Some of that might be a lack of imagination on my part to slow down and think, why is he presenting this like this? Whenever I do, and remind myself that the goals of the class are to start with the ancestral and embryological origins of structures to explain where they come from, and then how they develop from there, it's more clear, but perhaps more frequent reiteration of that would help. Altogether, the course is very well-structured when you look at it, and the material is fascinating.",
    "This course had a very simple and straightforward style of teaching - lectures with no assignments and no follow-up. This did not work with my learning style. Had to learn everything outside of class. A lot of self-studying. Unclear lecture slides, unclear expectations. Spent a lot more time on this class than would have liked to, but largely because the curriculum as so broad.",
    "The lecture while very interesting was very dry. The midterm format was greatly changed from the practice midterms, so it made me feel unprepared going into the tests, and as there are only two midterms (one at the midterm drop date and one on the final drop date) these were an incredible source of stress because they carried a lot of weight and we could not see our grades. The midterms were so specific that while I felt I learned a lot from the class and lectures I was very unprepared for the tests.",
    "This course is very well organized and accessible. By far the best lab I have taken at Yale! The lab reports were a bit redundant and time consuming, but I am thankful for them as they offset low exam grades.",
    "This course is great at getting you to learn lots of material about the body, and compare it across phyla However, I felt that at times there was just too much information thrown at me, and I had to spend time alone or with other classmates trying to find out what was actually relevant. I think the reason a lot of people didn't ask questions during class is because we didn't know what to ask in the first place. I wish the class could have been more organized when it came to the actual comparison of anatomy. It felt as though we jumped back and forth a lot between different animal groups.",
    "This class is basically memorization. Coming to lecture isn't super helpful.",
    "Strength was that the course covered the lecture material in an order that made the learning progression easier. Weakness was that there weren't many opportunities in class to question the material or discuss any points of confusion.",
    "Honestly I wish it had just been tested more frequently. The breadth of information was pretty massive for there to only be two short midterms. Why have a final on material that was tested the week before?",
    "The lectures were relatively interesting and the professor was great. However, there was a lot of information to memorize and no sections or homework, so there was very little guided review\/practice of the material. A bit more structure to involve students in learning would be helpful.",
    "This course used to have three midterms and no final and was switched this year to having two midterms and a final the course is clearly designed for the former layout and is not suited for the latter. The incredible amount of detail, vocabulary, and information involved in the course would have been much more manageable divided into thirds than taken all together. The biggest weakness of the course is the amount of memorization expected of the students. I felt that the majority of studying for this class was rote memorization of diagrams and scientific names if the course was more distilled to the concepts, which are there but are overshadowed by the volume of labels\/terms, it would be much improved. The class is doable if you stay on top of the work and put in the time, but studying for it feels like a test of rote memorization skills, which was frustrating. In addition, Prof Wagner's lecturing style is extremely dry and he speeds through dense lecture slides with lengthy, new words and concepts with no pause you don't really understand them until looking back over them later.",
    "The class could definitely have been split up into more midterms so that each midterm did not have 700 slides to review. This is the first year that they did two midterms and a final. Having a midterm one week before the final wasn't super useful; definitely would've been better to split it up into three or four midterms. SOOOOO many slides to review for each exam. Also, not much information was given on the format of the exams or what would be expected of us.",
    "Lectures are pretty dry. I was frustrated with grading for the course. Although Professor Wagner tried to be fair, it was very hard to gauge how I was doing in the class because the second exam was not graded before the final. I also did not think the final was representative of larger course themes."

    "This course is a very good investment. The amount of work you have to put in to it is low. If you go to class and absorb the material you basically only have to study for the midterms and final. And you get to learn some very interesting material that's cool to know about the human body and animals we see in the world. As a non-science major with only an AP Bio background, I found it pretty accessible, though I could understand it being a bit opaque if you never go to lecture and aren't a bio major of some sort. Gnter is low key hilarious and extremely knowledgable about the material. Hidden gem!",
    "This class teaches about Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy. If you are interested in this topic, take it. If you are not interested in this topic, do not take this course. Have a clear and strong base understanding of biology and evolution before entering this course.",
    "I can't say I recommend it unless you have to take it, then study hard. I really did like the professor and material but it was too stressful.",
    "Yes! This is an engaging, learning centered course. I am so impressed by how well integrated and well planned this lab was.",
    "Only take it if you are required.",
    "Would recommend for any non-E&EB majors who are thinking about medicine.",
    "I would pass on this if you don't need it. It's not tremendously difficult, and thelecture material is actually interesting too, but the delivery just sucked the life out of everything. Also the tests are kind of a gamble.",
    "No I would not",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students unless they have to take it for their major the accompanying lab course is great, but the lecture is very dense and dry.",
    "No. Do not take this class. Its straight memorizationnothing conceptual to unify what you have to memorize. The tests were completely random, information was presented in a disorganized manner, and there were no unifying concepts to help with memorization.",
    "Only take this course if you're required to. It's not very interesting and the assessments require you to have a crazy amount of information memorized. Professor Wagner is a nice guy but was not clear in explaining what was expected of us for exams. The class could definitely have been split up into more midterms so that each midterm did not have 700 slides to review. This is the first year that they did two midterms and a final. Having a midterm one week before the final wasn't super useful; definitely would've been better to split it up into three or four midterms. SOOOOO many slides to review for each exam. Also, not much information was given on the format of the exams or what would be expected of us.",
    "This course will give you a strong overview of vertebrate anatomy and how vertebrate traits evolved. Take it for the content but be aware that the exams are difficult and it is hard to tell how you are doing in the course. Overall, I found the class to be a little more stressful than it was worth."
