   "comments": [
    "Wonderful class - you really learn a lot. You know what you're getting with Christine - an amazing amazing lecturer with so much passion for material that even it is boring to some degree, you're never falling asleep in class, just because of her passion.Carol: I've been in Carol's class before (MCDB120) and you know you are getting a solid, clearly organized lecture each class. Her tests are always applied knowledge, not just regurgitated information and it makes for more interesting classroom experiences.Overall: highly recommended.",
    "Good class. Don't go into it thinking it's a gut class, or else you might be surprised after the first midterm. But you might be able to rescue yourself later - I guess we'll see.",
    "Worth taking. Absolutely.",
    "I think Microbio's a good survey course. You do learn the details of some cool things like pathogenesis of E. coli and Salmonella, etc., as well as how bacteria divide and move.",
    "This is an interesting course. It requires a lot of studying for exams",
    "Do not take the course unless you're incredibly confident you can do well. It is incredibly discriminative in what are considered good answers to exam questions without providing any information on what good answers are before exams. If you're one of those people who can naturally produce answers they like (like the swarm of responses that are probably calling this course 'easy'), you'll probably flourish. Otherwise, it's just not worth it.",
    "It's definitely interesting as a pre-medical student to study microbes and diseases from this perspective. The teaching is not always crystal clear but the material speaks for itself, most of the time. Definitely one of the better biology classes I have taken.",
    "Take this class. It will revolutionize your world. Not a huge time commitment. Don't buy the textbook, it's not necessary. Microbio is cool. It's my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far. Be sure to take the lab with it--it'll revolutionize your world that much more. Excellently taught by Bascom-Slack and Jacobs Wagner. They are incredible.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone looking for an interesting and not too hard upper level bio",
    "This class is really a hidden gem in the MCDB department. More people should take this class. I took this class even though I am an MB&B major and have all my biology prerequisites. You definitely have to know your information for the test, but it is low stress, and a lot of the information expands on stuff you already know. Especially if you took biochem. Some of the grading is kind of arbitrary, but this happens all the time. Professors are chill.",
    "It's a pretty interesting biology course filled with a lot of useful material. As a non-bio major, the class was kind of tough, but not impossible. Knowing about how microbes work has actually been enlightening.",
    "I wouldn't take this class if you can find a more interesting bio course.",
    "Lots of memorization. more work than reviews said it was. it also did not necessarily blow me away. the professors were quite good. too much memorization. first exam is tough. know your genetic screen!!!",
    "Microbiology is a good class for science majors. The pre-meds can be a little annoying when they ask questions (participation can add up to 5% to your grade...), but the professors were both gracious and usually answered questions succinctly. The grade is two tests and a final, with a couple mini-quizzes thrown in. The quizzes were actually helpful. You don't actually have to buy the book, as all you are tested on is material from the lectures.",
    "Interesting topics, but the lecture tended to be dry. But overall a good bio class. So yes.",
    "Good bio elective \/ pre-med class, material is detailed but tends to focus on \"big picture\" questions in exams, not an incredibly easy class either - medium \/ medium high difficulty",
    "I would recommend this class. It gives you a nice overview of the different concepts in microbiology. The exams are only on the class material-don't bother buying the textbook. The professors are very clear and very enthusiastic. The class is smaller than a typical biology lecture class, so questions and comments were encouraged. Overall, pretty solid.",
    "A great upper-level bio course. Both lecturers are very talented, and the material synthesizes (though doesn't draw to heavily on) stuff you learn in biochem and intro bio courses. The tests are quite specific, but quite fair.",
    "I would definitely recommend MCDB 290 if you're looking of a biology class with not too much work and with a real-life application to medicine.",
    "Not a lot of work during the semester, but a fair amount of material to study for exams. The material is generally interesting, but lectures can be a little dry.",
    "Definitely take it - it's not too hard and what you learn you'll see all around you in the world - bacteria and microbes are everywhere so it's definitely worth learning more about them.",
    "Good class full of interesting material, overall strong professors, definitely not a gut class but not overwhelming workload. You leave feeling like you've learned the material and that will actually be useful to know, and I think that although Christine was the slightly stronger teacher, both were overall excellent. Class size was definitely a lecture but small enough that you could talk to both professors if you wanted, so a great bio class.",
    "good course overall",
    "MCDB 290 is an introduction to various topics in microbiology, but it looks at those topics in depth and you're expected to know details. But don't worry; the details make it interesting. The material at the end of the course about infectious diseases was especially cool. There werealso two guest lectures about viruses by a doctor from the med school which were interesting and changed things up a bit.",
    "Microbio is a fun, interesting class! It is also not very much work. Definitely recommended.",
    "Interesting material.",
    "If you are a science person or pre-med-check this course out. It is one of the most interesting biology courses I have taken at Yale: learn how plant tumors work, the molecular mechanics of the flagella and be able to explain bioluminescence. The work load is very manageable, even if the tests are pretty challenging (make sure you put in a good amount of study time)-especially because the class was filled with crazy pre-meds this year.",
    "This is a worthwhile course to take if you are interested in the subject",
    "Pretty standard MCDB course. It's a solid course, so if you like microbes, then this is the class for you. There are 2 exams, 1 final, and no sections. Carol and Christine and really nice and generally good lecturers. Also, since it's a smaller class, it's possible to get to know them more intimately than larger MCDB classes. The only con in my opinion is the late class time at 1pm. It'sawkwardly in the middle of the day, which may be an issue if you're working in a lab. Other than that, I think its better than a lot of other spring mcdb courses."
