    "You better really like Number Theory -- or be a senior with a job already \/bitterness",
    "This is a hard class on elementary analytic number theory. It covers all of the (mostly disjointed) stuff that is absolutely fundamental to a number theorist, then delves into things more interesting and less sensical. Problem sets are quite lengthy, and often hard. Take iff you have a strong interest in the theory of numbers.",
    "Alex Kontorovich is teaching this course next year, so note that any evaluations of this course will not be relevant, as Kontorovich may have different styles\/approaches to the material. Shop Kontorovich's version before deciding.It's pretty interesting material, and as Gauss said, \"math is the queen of the sciences, and number theory is the queen of mathematics\". Gauss, then again, was a number theorist himself. This class will certainly be a heavy one unless you have a good background in the material. Having never see modular arithmetic before, I was learning a lot and felt somewhat behind the rest of the class.",
    "The first half of this course is a good introduction to elementary number theory. The second half, which was dominated by the proof of the prime number theorem was a bit tedious, as it involved a lot of equation manipulations. That being said, Amanda Folsom is very nice and very well organized in her lectures and homework assignments. Be warned though, that the homework is often quite time-consuming."
