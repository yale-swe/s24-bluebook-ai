   "comments": [
    "Professor Joseph does a great job of introducing students to numerous Latin American revolutionary movements and rapidly achieving a level of depth that made the seminar extremely informative.",
    "I learned so much in this course about the political history of different Latin American countries. While for some of the countries you only have 1 or 2 weeks to learn about them, the readings are well-crafted enough that you learn a lot and will be prepared to go on and do more reading of your own \/ be an informed reader of the news related to that country.",
    "A good survey of the politics and history of Latin American nations set in the period typically understood as \"the cold war,\" with an emphasis on the role of the U.S.",
    "This course is an insightful challenge to grand strategy-type narratives of the Cold War I learned in high school and in a previous Yale course that centered around US-USSR relations, diplomacy, etc. and only considered Latin America insofar as the Cuban Missile Crisis and a few incidents of \"proxy\" conflict were concerned. It is also a course that challenged me to think about the meaning of revolution, and how it evolved in different national contexts in Latin America. I definitely feel like a have a super solid foundation to continue studying Latin American history, esp. the region's political history.",
    "I learned how to synthesize and reflect on the history that I learn and read about. I learned how to understand and evaluate a situation or historical moment from multiple perspectives. Finally, I learned how to analyze U.S. intervention critically, as well as buffer stereotypes I had about revolutions and Latin America.",
    "I learned a solid amount about each country studied, and could identify common trends across Latin America",
    "Interrogated preexisting historiography on the Cold War, meaning of revolution, revolutionary violence, and indigeneity thoughout the 1960s through present-day. Used film, novel, press coverage, and secondary readings to inform analysis.",
    "A sober take on a part of the world we dont get nearly enough exposure to at an absolutely critical time.",
    "Learned the relationship between the US and Latin America during the Cold War, with the study of revolutionary governments and processes.",
    "I learned about the history of revolutions in Latin America, how and why revolutions begin, and their consequences for various countries. We spent a week on most countries, two on Venezuela, and two on Nicaragua.",
    "This course involves a lot of writing, and you get very detailed feedback on your first assignment. You leave the course with a strong ability to synthesise and bring different material sources together in writing."

   "comments": [
    "The assignments were really engaging and helped synthesize the course's information. I sometimes found, however, the jumping from country to country a bit rapid and felt greater stress on thematic connections or a more coherent chronology of the semester would have been helpful.",
    "There were too many students in the classroom -- I appreciate that Prof Joseph wants as many of us as possible to be able to take the class, but it would have been much better if it was a class of 15 instead of 20+. The films we watched each week were wonderful and enhanced my learning.",
    "strengths -- really good coursework (readings) BUT the class could benefit from more specific entrypoints for discussion",
    "The syllabus goes country by country, spending one or two weeks on an individual one. I appreciated this - I think it allowed us to study the history of each country in-depth and understand its historical peculiarities, and then be able to compare each one as we went through the course. The one thing I will say about that, though, is that if you're particularly interested in one country that pops up near the end, you might not get to study it as much as you'd like. That said, you could also make your final paper about that subject, and Prof. Joseph is super great about helping you with your paper. The movies were, I think, a net positive - some were sort of boring to sit through but some were really great and offered good discussion material. One thing that I think would make the course more interesting would be more investigation into how colonialism shaped Latin American political history (though we did talk a lot about US intervention\/neoimperialism).",
    "The variety of sources assigned each week (movies, newspaper articles, interviews, scholarly articles, etc.) made preparation for class engaging and kept class discussions lively. Also, the journaling assignment was one of my favorite aspects of the class because it allowed me to write on the topics that were most interesting to me, as well as make connections between classes and materials from many different weeks. I would have liked to have more debates or in-class simulations. Further, I would have benefited from smaller group discussion times instead of discussing as one big group for the majority of class.",
    "Great professor, little room for improvement",
    "Strengths: great course packet\/readings, engaged and extremely knowledgeable professor, always a lot of content to discuss each section meeting. Weaknesses: not many, this course is extremely well-curated and organized, sometimes there is not enough time to cover all assigned readings\/films, background knowledge on some countries is assumed which can be a little difficult if this is your first history course on Latin America.",
    "The biggest strength is Professor Joseph. Warm to everyone in the class, he insisted on pushing the dialogue forward while also letting students drive it.",
    "Strength: Gil Joseph is the most knowledgable person on this field and he will make himself fully available to you and he gives a lot of time and care. Which is invaluable and deeply appreciated. Weakness: seminar discussion was weak because there was little to no push back. Some people said stuff that made zero sense and they were not forced to justify their answers; conversations were not building onto anything sometimes but just people saying statements for the sake of saying statements.",
    "While a great course for the study of US and Latin American relations, this class did not delve as much into the grassroots aspects of revolution. Reading of more contemporary research that focuses on the working class experience would have been good - despite the course intentions, the class focused a lot on US policy and attitudes. The course also covered some countries in a single day, which hardly did them justice.",
    "Its a good coursethoughtful readings and weekly films, and Gilbert Joseph cares. The weekly student presentations were rote or insightful depending on the presenters, but people always worked hard on them. You get what you put in to the class. The discussions were sometimes fun\/dynamic and at other times lacklusterperhaps that could be improved by following the veins of conversation that people were most excited about, instead of switching between discussion questions often (as Prof Joseph does to cover more areas).",
    "This course has a lot of breadth. Which is both a strength and a weakness. You get a general sense of the nature of this period of Latin American history and the region's relationship to the United States, but you don't get to really explore the details of each country and scenario. Which, is fair, for entire courses could be designed around just one country's revolutionary history. Nonetheless, as we moved on week after week, I was often left feeling a little dissatisfied with my understanding and exploration of that week's country or case study. Another strength of this course is the journal component. It requires a lot of time and self-motivation, which is often difficult to find mid-semester amidst the craziness of other classes, but it is a worthwhile exercise. It allows you to explore the material in a more personal and specific manner, delving into topics and ideas you might not have had the chance to speak of in class. Essentially, I think it allows for more detailed exploration of the material, which compliments the more \"general themes\" nature of the course. After handing mine in, I was left with the desire to continue it through the rest of semester, not just the first half. Another great component of the course are the films. One of my favourite aspects of my week was getting to sit for a couple of hours Sunday night and just watch good films. We didn't discuss all of them, but having them in the background of discussions was always useful and I think gave the class a more nuanced perspective of the material. Finally, although I definitely enjoyed the material and thought it was very complete, I do think it was very US-centric. Especially in the first half of the course, there was a lot of Grand Strategy and a lot of the class's conversations focused on those kind of themes and US's role within Latin American history. This was probably also the product of the students' interests. And I understand that the course is about integrating both histories and trying to understand them as complimentary, but sometimes I felt we sacrificed some Latin American narratives to make room for the US ones."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Professor Joseph is outstanding -- truly an unparalleled combination of brilliance and being down-to-earth. You'll gain a lot of information that is relevant to politics and revolutionary movements outside of just Latin America.",
    "Yes, but know that you will sometimes feel frustrated by the class conversations. partly because there were so many people in the class, it was hard to get the conversations beyond surface-level re-stating of the readings. But-- the readings were chosen very well and you will learn a lot.",
    "yes for the information!",
    "If you can handle a serious reading load and write two 15-20 page assignments, without a doubt, yes (the other major course component is a presentation which isn't too bad). Put simply, Professor Joseph is great and super well-respected in his field, the people that I had with me in the course were thoughtful and intelligent, and I'm walking away with a lot more knowledge and understanding about Latin America than before.",
    "Would absolutely recommend. This class changed the way I think about history, who writes it, and the ways in which the US has overlooked the reality of many revolutionary situations in Latin America. THe readings are fascinating, and you will be challenged to think in new ways and from new perspectives about Cold War Latin America.",
    "Absolutely, this was one of the most eye opening courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, amazing class that has been taught for a long time",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The subject matter is fascinating and essential to any student either focusing on the Cold War or 20th century in the major or simply trying to get a better grasp on contemporary Latin American politics. The course is a lot of work, but the readings are varied, engaging, and well organized for student learning. A great history seminar!",
    "Yes! If you get the chance, should absolutely take. Best course I took this semester.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn a lot about latin america. No, if you are not independently motivated\/if you dont have some sort of background knowledge on the region.",
    "I would if they wanted a light course on Latin America. I felt that the course did not engage deeply with the history of Latin America, as many of the discussions and readings did not involve disagreement on historiography or historical philosophy.",
    "Yes! Professor Joseph is somebody that every history major should get to know.",
    "If youd like an overview of South American revolutions, this is a good course. Gilbert Joseph is an expert in the field and a devoted teacher. The weekly films were eye-opening. I liked the two debates very much. But Joseph knows so much about the topic that he intervenes in discussion a lot. He doesnt lecturetheres certainly room to participatebut I felt the momentum of the discussion was often curtailed. Perhaps that was specific to my class. I was underwhelmed by the class compared to the laudatory reviews.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. It has a very interesting and well composed reading list and film series, and the professor is very able at handling discussions and allowing everyone a place to speak and keeping the conversation flowing and interesting. I very much enjoyed my Tuesday afternoons in this seminar. Both writing assignments were very open in regards to the prompts, giving students the opportunity to tailor them to their own interests within the material."
