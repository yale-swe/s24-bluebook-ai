    "For a design student, I would recommend Colloquium to someone with a clear idea of what they wish to pursue as a senior project. Delving into research can be really fun, but it is also time-consuming and requires significant focus. Despite the seminar setting, the work will be very independent and it is really up to the individual student to get as much as they wish out of the class.",
    "If you are interested in taking a class which lets you explore your own ideas about architecture research, take this whether you are a thesis student or not. Indeed there is a double standard in how the DUS treats design vs. thesis students, but for its part the class is great independently of this issue."
