   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I would say I mainly learned about the process of design - which makes sense, given that this is the first studio in the major where you design from scratch. So I feel like I really developed my ability to iterate ideas and drawings, and then to express them to others. On the practical side, my Rhino abilities improved immensely (lol), and there were less specific expectations for models, so I think my understanding\/use of materials really blossomed.",
    "Gained design experience, a better handle on the tools of architectural design, and improved my design process.",
    "This semester offers way more insight into the actual design of a building rather analyzing subtexts and implicit meanings. It's still quite a bit of work, but if you engage in your projects it can be very fun and rewarding.",
    "Iterations make you unleash your inner designer if you let them. learned some rhino, too",
    "I felt that I learned more in the past semester than in the previous year. This course helped me develop my drawing, model-making, and designing skills and also has made me more competent with many important computer programs.",
    "First design studio course for arch major. Steep learning curve and you begin to develop your 'own style.' Ask the TFs for help. THey're so helpful.",
    "It's hard to summarize what I learned in this course because it wasn't necessarily about the course material. Of course I learned about the design process, but also about time management, when to follow suggestions vs. disregard them (for my own mental health). I learned about balance and when to find an acceptable finishing point. I learned about pushing boundaries, teaching myself new fabrication techniques, and gaining confidence in presenting my ideas.",
    "I learned an immense amount about design through precedent study and personal exploration.",
    "Learned how to think critically, but also to explore each assignment with an open mind. This course was an opportunity to develop the basic skills we learned last semester. I learned a lot about my own creative process and the importance of scrapping early ideas for new and improved developments.",
    "It was fantastic to start working with more original designs. That in itself carries with it a new skillset regarding how to develop ideas to the point that they can be communicated to others. Apart from technical knowledge about software and modeling, this was one of the broad takeaways of this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the main strength of the class, especially coming out of analytic model and drawing arch, is the open-endedness. You can actually just design whatever you want, and the amazing teaching staff (another strength) will help you develop your ideas, rather than force you into doing things a certain way. I'm writing this the day after final review and can't think of any weaknesses in the class itself, so take that as you will.",
    "Strengths - studio community - very fun experience - lots of design experience - Great professors - the TAs were always there for us, 24\/7 Weaknesses - even though we've discussed this a lot, there is still way, way too much work expected of us -- I slept so little in the last 3 weeks, that I've been chronically exhausted for the last few days, even though I've been sleeping enough. The workload is a huge strain on our mental and physical health. Especially before critiques, the workload can get so high that regularly skip meals, sleep, classes, and work for other classes in order to complete work for studio.",
    "I think one downside to the studio-style courses is confronting the differing opinions of your professors, TFs and TAs. That there are so many faculty to talk to, but many times you'll receive advice from one that is then dismissed by another due to personal preference. It's not a huge problem and understandably inherent to a course formatted this way, but it would be nice if stylistic expectations were a bit more uniform.",
    "Strengths: it doesn't let up. You can't half-mass this course and expect to get anything out of it. You might get away with it if you use harmless materials to make models and make them non-moving. But studio is meant to occupy your every minute, that way you can get the most out of it.",
    "The course is paced very well, with each assignment building off the knowledge gained in the previous one. The main weakness is the ambiguity with assignments and the desires of the professors. Students were so unsure what the professors wanted most of the time that they actually did not produce some of the required final materials under the assumption that they were not important, choosing instead to make other things.",
    "I loved this course. Despite hearing from previous students about the horrors of junior studio, I actually found the level of intensity perfect. I thought Bimal and Rosalyne were incredible and found a great balance between criticism and praise.",
    "There was a period when we had a bunch of pit crits in a row when desk crits, or a combination would have been helpful. Otherwise, no weaknesses really.",
    "I think we got a high level of personal attention and the professors were committed to our understanding and success.",
    "One on one attention and engagement with teaching staff",
    "The professors are incredible; they are so passionate and helpful, and they made the course enjoyable and productive. The workload at times can seem unreasonable, but if you learn how to manage your time it is possible to make it work."

   "comments": [
    "Moot point as long as it's only offered to arch majors, but - yes. Amazing way to get to know your own creativity, amazing teaching staff, close community.",
    "Yes, but only if you are very sure that it's what you want to be doing, and that you are able to commit yourself to it.",
    "I recommend this course if you have the time and money for it. It will work you if you care about the quality of your work and your growth as a designer. Honestly you can put together two triangles and call it a floor plan but the randomness of that frustrates me, as it rarely comes from an intentional organization of circulation + function + aura\/mood\/language. I spent over $1500. That god they increased the reimbursement from $100 to $350 per semester.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone outside the major, but I will speak highly of it to those planning on pursuing the major.",
    "Yes, but of course if you're looking at this then you already have to take it.",
    "Yes -- it's rigorous but extremely rewarding. The teaching team is INCREDIBLE and genuinely wants you to succeed. You'll develop relationships with your classmates that go far beyond studio and you'll feel proud of not only what you accomplish, but what you see your friends accomplishing alongside you. It's tough, exciting, frustrating, exhausting, enjoyable, and ultimately my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "We designed a kit of parts, a monument, and a multifaith center, with smaller assignments leading up to each. A great introduction to the design process. The class was reasonably paced for a studio class, and a lot less of a whirlwind then analytic model. As a whole, only a few people pulled all nighters. The teaching team of 5 ensured that we got diverse feedback, and the professors and the TFs were very helpful.",
    "This class was the most enjoyable requirement I have ever taken. I urge incoming juniors to approach it with an open mind, and to appreciate the professors, as they are wonderful and truly make the experience.",
    "If you're in design, the decision is made for you (it's the right decision, by the way). If you're not, it couldn't hurt to try to sweet-talk your way in, because studio classes offer one of the most productive intellectual environments I've found at Yale. Having the chance both to analyze precedents (at the beginning\/middle of the course) and to design original works (at the middle\/end) in the same semester is a great opportunity to develop style and the confidence to realize one's ideas concretely."
