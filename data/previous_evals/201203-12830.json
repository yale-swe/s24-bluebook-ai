    "If you have to take it,get it out of the way as soon as possible. I wish I did it freshman year rather than sophomore.",

    "I obviously recommend it if it's the next course in line for the language requirement.",
    "Take it if you have to",
    "I would recommend Spanish 130 to another student who needs a language requirement. I think it is hard because it meets every day, but there is no doubt that you will learn the language.",
    "I had to take this class. I hated every minute of it. But if you have to do is, Lisette is a good person to do it with, she knew how miserable I was and still managed to help me get through it. You can do fine on the class on everything but the quizzes - they're miserably difficult and require having poured over the vocab for hours. God I hope I got credit for this course.",
    "I would recommend it. You probably need it to finish your language requirement and it's a good class to finish with. Or if you're good at Spanish, this could be an easy 1.5 credits.",
    "You learn all about Spanish grammar and some culture. I would recommend it if you want to learn Spanish to speak it."
