   "comments": [
    "take it. read the books. enjoy it for yourself. expect to be lectured most days, but maybe explaining what you want out of the class to the professor will make him realize he should allow students to talk more.",
    "Professor Jackson is a great guy, but I wouldn't recommend this class unless the format changes a bit. The seminars were too much like lectures and not enough like discussions, and some of the book choices were a bit odd. I took the class because I wanted to read Machado de Assis and Jorge Amado and it's a good concept for a course, but it really needs to be more discussion-intensive.",
    "Interesting course that provides a survey of the literature of former Portuguese colonies. Actually a lot of work if you want to do the readings. Prof. Jackson always provides good insights.",
    "If you take this course, you will have the pleasure of reading literature produced in cities that you may never have heard of. The class is strongly thematic, but the paper assignments allow you to explore questions that you see in the novels even if they're somewhat outside of the world cities theme. Professor Jackson is excellent, and you should expect to enjoy the class if you take it. One caveat: There is quite a lot of writing and a final besides, but there is also a lot of room to make it interesting for yourself. Overall, I strongly recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the history of the Portuguese empire- you get to read some really great literary works. Don't take the course if you're looking for a lot of discussion- it is pretty much a lecture, just with 10 people in it.",
    "Take it!",
    "The readings are very good, and the papers are very open ended so you can make whatever you want of it. Prof Jackson is very passionate about what he teaches and is the sweetest man ever, but he talks A LOT and does not leave much time or opportunity for students to participate in class. However, if you don't mind having a seminar that is more like a lecture, take it, the topic is very interesting.Also, disclaimer: the title of this class is World Cities and Narratives. But be warned, for most of the lectures, and for what is expected of the paper, the class is a lot more focused on the literature than on understanding the cities.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who are interested in this course material specifically. I did not expect the class to be so narrowly focused, yet I felt it would have been an enormously informative, compelling course if I had realized the true degree to which the scope of the course was defined. Nonetheless, I would recommend Professor Jackson as a professor for any course.",
    "If you're interested in the subjects or need an English credit, this is a great course."
