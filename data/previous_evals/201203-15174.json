    "Excellent. It is what courses on China should be like!",
    "Yes I would. It gives the student a good understanding of Chinese politics and foreign relations posture.",
    "Overall this was a very interesting, relaxed seminar course on current topics related to China's international relations. The discussion was always stimulating, mainly because of the other students in it. I would recommend this course to another student, though I think how well the class goes would depend to a large degree on the other students in it.",
    "It is a good course that surveys the various issues concerning China's IR. However, be prepared to play a major role in directing the discussion because the vast scope of the course might potentially result in a less focused discussion."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with the theoretical foundation I needed to move forward on my research and provided invaluable opportunities to see how well key IR concepts and theories apply to China and Asia.",
    "It was definitely very helpful.",
    "I am writing my thesis on recent Chinese economic activities in Africa and this course provided a new background for me on the IR philosophies grounding Chinese behavior, which was very useful. I also benefitted from the discussions on China in Africa that occasionally arose during class sessions."
