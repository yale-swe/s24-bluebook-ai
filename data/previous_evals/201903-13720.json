    "Obviously, how to use R. But beyond that, the course gradually builds on itself so you understand the basic mechanics of R and then how to apply that to statistical models and finally how to translate that into highly customized graphics. I feel like after taking this course I could process very large datasets and glean useful information from them. I would recommend a stats course to couple with this (that's honestly just life advice, everyone needs to understand stats) but it will help you to make sure that you are setting up your models correctly.",
    "Very helpful overview of how to learn R - I loved the swirl lessons.",
    "I developed more confidence and competence in R, as well as a nice refresher on statistical analysis.",
    "Programming in R",
    "The ability to use R (with a degree of confidence)",
    "Skills in R! Which are essential to me!",
    "I learned the basics of R in a statistical context and feel confident that gong forward I will be able to use R for many things and build on the base of knowledge I gained in this course.",
    "Course is a comprehensive introduction to how to use the statistical computing software R, covering basics, statistical analyses, and how to create graphics. Upon completion, students will be fluent enough in R to conduct statistical analyses and create publication-ready graphics on their own.",
    "R, statistics, programming, creation of graphics",

    "Excellent introduction to the fundamentals of working with R language and how to utilize environmental science statistics through that syntax",
    "I feel infinitely more comfortable working with R having taken this course.",
    "Comprehensive knowledge of the R coding language covering basic commands but also including tools to analyze grouped and continuous data, create informative graphs, write functions and loops. In addition to R coding language, I also profited a lot from the guidance on how to decide which statistical tests\/procedures to use depending on the data and research question at hand.",

I am really glad I took this class.",
    "Exceeded my expectations! For reference, I learned more about how to use R in the first week than I did in an entire semester of Regression Analysis, another class that uses R.",
    "They aligned pretty well. I got a lot out of the class for each of the skills listed above.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very practical, the course is very systematically set up so everything builds on itself. A lot of it is also self-directed making it super flexible. Weaknesses: Could be really slow in class at times.",
    "The lectures were pretty dry and not very additive. My attendance tapered off as I realized I could absorb the material better by just following the swirl lessons.",
    "Strengths - Quick and helpful feedback; purposeful homework and labs. Weaknesses - None!",
    "It's just perfect",
    "The strength of this course is that it gives you a well-rounded instruction in using Base R. The regular recaps\/SWIRL lessons\/labs ensure that you stay up to speed with the content. I don't have any suggestions for improving this course.",
    "Simon has done an incredible job putting together the SWIRL classes and matching them with highly organized, very informative lectures. I'm in my second year here at Yale and this is the best class I've taken so far. It was 100% designed to maximize student learning. I really, really appreciated that. I learned so much.",
    "Strengths: -the combo of lectures, swirls, and labs were perfect to guide me through these topics and reinforce them through supported practice -Simon and Andrew were incredibly helpful and responsive to questions -the Friday bootcamps were personally very helpful- even if I didn't have any questions it was nice to work there on R and know if I ran into an issue I could ask someone's opinion -I loved that the whole course was designed around teaching us and giving us a chance to practice concepts without penalizing us for making errors (ie, swirls don't penalize mistakes, and having the chance to resubmit labs after getting feedback) Weaknesses: -the only recommendation I have would be to require students to turn in a first draft of their project since (and this is my own fault) I got busy with other classes and pushed back working on my project until right before it was due. The project proposal was a perfect way to get us started thinking on it and then I would have benefitted if after the first week of working on projects in class, we had had to turn in a \"progress report\" of sorts",
    "Course materials are terrific and all of the exercises pose practical value. Class is set up to be extremely time efficient, and none of the work is extraneous. I also really, really appreciated how the homework allows for students to resubmit until they get the correct answers, without actually posting the answer keys -- this is a terrific method to push students to really learn the material. The main portion of the class that could be improved is the in-class lectures, as they cover the same content as the SWIRL lessons (class preparation work) but do not really add much content apart from allowing students the chance to ask questions in person.",
    "Strengths- very organized, clear expectations, plenty of time to get help from professor and TA, grading very quick with lots of clear feedback Weaknesses- none",
    "I like the format of the course and appreciate the extra resources (e.g. SWIRL lessons and bootcamps) that serve to meet students where they are at. The course seemed to adapt to people's different approaches to learning how to code. R is not super user friendly but Dr. Queenborough made the material digestible to students in very organized, systematic, and elegant ways. Compared to many coding classes I have taken at Yale, this course was stress free but very organized and informative.",
    "I really enjoyed the SWIRL lessons and the labs. It was useful to have something to work on every week and be able to submit labs multiple times. However, I did think the class was a little monotonous at times, although I acknowledge that it is difficult to lecture about a software.",
    "simon does an excellent job providing clear and understandable objectives as we progressed through the material. He was very thoughtful about pace and knew what to focus on when during the lectures. There was also ample time to get one on one advice and guidance during and after the class meetings",
    "Overall, this course is very effective at teaching you how to code using R. That being said, I felt as though the SWIRL lessons were more conducive to my learning than the lecture itself-- for me, this is a skill that has to be learned through practice (passive listening isn't the most helpful). However, the class sessions were very useful in providing a space to work on the SWIRL and weekly labs, and as a time to ask questions and get specific help from Simon and Andrew, who are both very knowledgeable!",
    "Strengths 1) great course material, especially the website 2) very effective teaching, especially through the swirl lessons and lab assignments and feedback 3) great availability of the instructors for help and advice 4) reasonable structure and sequence of course contents, building on the knowledge previously taught 5) very open-minded in terms of the topic choice for the data analysis project Weaknesses 1) sometimes swirl lessons and lectures were a bit redundant; maybe lectures could focus a bit more on the theory behind the commands or the \"when to use them\" than the actual coding",
    "Great",
    "Course is very well-designed, allowing you to progress or learn at varying speeds.\/",
    "Strengths - the SWIRL lessons and the help of Simon and Andrew Weaknesses - occasionally the homework problems were poorly worded which resulted in a lot of wasted time and frustration from trying to interpret what it is asking for. However, Simon and Andrew are super responsive in clarifying what they're asking for so when in doubt, ask Simon or Andrew!",
    "The swirls lessons are great, and the level of engagement required to finish the weekly assignments keeps the information fresh in one's head. The lectures could be improved. The professor needs to be more engaging and speak more loudly.",
    "Strengths: SWIRL Lessons were helpful. Liked the guided self learning methodology of the course Weakness: Final Project was not much value add especially if you don't have a data project of your own which you were already working on",
    "I enjoyed the weekly SWIRL lessons to get hands-on experience with R. I never really figured out a good way to keep notes, whether for the SWIRLs or the in class lectures, and sometimes it was tricky trying to go back and figure out what was done in a SWIRL because the output wasn't stored in the same place as the code. This isn't a huge deal, but it might be worth brainstorming ways to help students keep track of all the information and different coding options.",
    "Amazing course. Good structure and availability of instructors. I wouldn't change anything about this course.",
    "Intro 2 R and SWIRL were MAJOR strengths in this course. It made learning R a breeze and I felt like I had all of the resources at my disposal. Additionally, the Friday boot camps and access to Andrew and Simon for questions helped me troubleshoot. I don't think I have any strong thoughts on how to improve this course. I thought it did a great job of reaching its goals."

   "comments": [
    "If you think you will ever be analyzing very large datasets, take this class. These skills are very valuable and give you a lot of confidence that you can tackle big data questions. Go to class (even if you feel like you can just do the lessons outside of class) because you get one-on-one help from the professor and TA and go to the class sessions when you are just working on the project to make sure you stay on top of it!",
    "Worth taking!",
    "It is helpful to have an intermediate or higher understanding of statistics coming into this class.",
    "Take it!",
    "Make sure you do the SWIRL lessons before.",
    "If you want practical, useful knowledge about R, that will actually help you become more skilled in R, take this class!!",
    "Take it! Keep up with the work and attend the Friday bootcamps and you will do fine.",
    "If you plan to use R in the future, this class is highly worth it -- much more so than Regression Analysis. If you have a schedule conflict, it could easily be taken as an independent study.",
    "Great start to learning R. Best to make some friends in class or have friends take the class with you too so that you can study R concepts with each other too.",
    "Stay after class in the available extra time to get help with assignments Begin assignments early",
    "Definitely take this course if you look for a beginner friendly course in R programming. You'll learn very practical and marketable skills.",
    "Bring in your own data if possible. It is more compelling and motivating to work through assessment on a topic that you are intimately aware of and understand than a random dataset",
    "Depending on your learning style, you might get more out of the homework and SWIRL than the lecture itself. For me, it was more helpful to come to class having already started the homework and completed SWIRL, so that I could ask specific questions.",
    "The class is especially valuable if you have a dataset in mind that you want to analyse, but even without that it is a great class to be introduced to the R coding language. Use the opportunity to submit assignments early, the feedback is quite valuable and correcting your assignments according to the feedback greatly improves the learning experience. Also make use of the boot camp, even if it is just to motivate yourself to be productive, it is a great atmosphere and you can save yourself a lot of time by just quickly asking a question when you're stuck instead of struggling on your own to find out how to move forward. Do the swirl lessons before class, so that you can clarify any question in the respective lecture.",
    "Take it if you are a beginner",
    "Take it if you want to learn anything related to stats, stats presentation, or coding. Or if you just want to learn something new!",
    "Take it! It is difficult at first but so worth it in my opinion.",
    "Take it if you plant to do any data analysis.",
    "Find a group of students to lean on with questions about labs and the topics being covered in the class. Go to Friday boot camps with questions and start your final project early."
