    "Human Emotion is the worst class I have taken at Yale so far. I feel like I have learned nothing about human emotion having taken this class: basically the class teaches you what you already intuitively know about emotion but veiled under a new vocabulary. I had never taken psychology before, but I did not feel lost at all since at times it seemed like the course was aimed at second-graders. Prof. Gruber seemed like a really nice person, but all she would do was pretty much just read what it said on the slides and show us videos. On the other hand, the guest lecturers were quite good, especially Provost Salovey and Prof. Bloom, and even the TA guest lecturers outshined Prof. Gruber. And although most people were taking the course as a \"gut class,\" there was actually a lot of reading for the course if you chose to do it all and I had to do a lot of study for the midterms since you basically have to memorize a lot of stupid things, like the \"three levels of happiness\" or the \"three themes in emotion and psychopathology,\" which you then have to regurgitate on the test. I guess the most interesting thing I learned about this semester is the trolley paradox, which Prof. Bloom talked about in his guest lecture on Morality and Emotion. But now you can go look that up on Wikipedia and spare yourself from taking this course.",
    "AMAZING. Lectures are interesting and well organized. Occasional guest lectures mix things up. I learned so much from this course. June is amazing--every strength, no weaknesses!",
    "I would definitely recommend Psyc 131. The lectures are always very interesting and the workload is not hard at all.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in human emotions, and you won't have to worry about grades or workload, because it is all manageable if you are interested in the topic. It is a large lecture but all the teaching fellows are great and are extremely helpful during office hours.",
    "Awesome. Really. Great tests, great lectures, good homework, well organized. Definitely worth taking if you're a psych major, still worth taking if you're not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I don't think it's quite as easy as other classes you could take at Yale, but it's engaging and fulfilling. The material is really interesting, and Prof. Gruber makes it fun and easy to learn. She's one of the sweetest, most enthusiastic professors you'll meet at Yale. Take the midterms seriously, do a decent project, and you'll get a good grade.",
    "Id recommend it! its a fun class!",
    "Very good intro course, the professor was lively and kept lecture interesting. Covers a lot of material, and can get into scientific technicalities sometimes, but overall worth taking. Fair exams- the professor wants you to do well.",
    "Yes, definitely. Amazing professor, amazing material, amazing TAs.",
    "It's an interesting class, the professor is fun, but I was much more excited about it during shopping period than I was when I was actually taking it. You'll probably like it if you take it, but don't expect it to be amazing.",
    "Yes, it's a good overview course.",
    "Good overview of Human Emotion. Nice introduction to Psychology. Definitely worth taking.",
    "I think it's a really interesting class. I wish I had taken it Credit\/D\/Fail, as I did not feel the inclination to work in it--I would much rather have just sat and absorbed and studied a little bit-- and had to anyways. It was also the kind of course where you could get away with not doing the reading.",
    "Human Emotion is a great class! It is both fun and interesting. Professor Gruber is a great lecturer and she understands how to engage the students. Overall, this is a fun and rewarding class.",
    "I would only recommend this class to a fellow student only if he or she is interested in human emotion. That may seem like a silly statement, but I thought I'd take the class on a whim, having not taken a psych class at Yale and having been told it would be a gut (it wasn't quite). It turns out I'm not very interested in the subject of the course, so forcing myself to study was a challenge.For a student who's into this stuff, though, it's a great course!",
    "Definitely a good intro course. Take it if you have an interest in Psychology. The tests are tricky, but passable but you will want to study early for them!",
    "Good fun course, not that deep, fairly easy.",
    "Take it. A lot to memorize, but inherently interesting so it's not difficult. Will learn more than any other psychology class.",
    "Great class if you are looking for an overview of how emotions work. Take it with June Gruber, she is spunky and enthusiastic and amazing. Study hard for exams.",
    "This class is a broad overview of different topics related to human emotion. The material is interesting and it isn't hard, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is worth getting up before 9 AM.",
    "I would recommend Human Emotion if you are interested in the topic, and willing to sit through big lectures about it. But, the lectures are pretty interesting, and the professor seems to be enthusiastic about the topic.",
    "definitely recommend it. not the gut that everyone thought it was going to be, but interesting regardless and definitely applicable to every day life. work load is pretty easy- 3 midterms, no final, a paper\/project, and we had to do 5 out of 12 reading responses. readings are interesting but not totally necessary",
    "A great first time class. The topics are interesting, especially all the psychology related stuff. I was surprised at the extent of cognitive science material about the brain etc which I found quite dull. The lectures are very good, she puts up the presentations later so it is easy to study for the exams. If you want to do well, you have to actually study hard and do the readings. So it is not an easy class, there is a lot of work. The exams were hard but not impossible, and the project was fun.",
    "A great class, very interesting and rewarding. Learn about yourselves and why you do what you do and feel what you feel. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. One of the best and fairest survey courses offered at Yale. No curve balls and the work load is more than manageable.",
    "Yes. It is an interesting class but not the easiest.",
    "Doesn't seem like a lot of work till exams roll around. Hard to describe what exactly we learned in that class. Pretty fluffy intro - take it if you need the So credit. It was way too early in the morning, though.",
    "Take it. Great class, funny examples, slides easy to follow.",
    "A must-take for any psychology major, and a great choice for anyone looking to just have another class in their schedule! Tests are slightly tricky but definitely fair, and the material is fascinating and applicable to everyday life. You'll definitely leave the class thinking about everyday interactions in a different way.",
    "No. Sure the syllabus looks easy. [No final, some short papers]but the tests are awful. Plus Professor Gruber thinks she's being really cool and lenient which makes it all the more annoying.",
    "Definitely. The class was awesome and the tests were material from the lectures. No real outside reading was necessary.",
    "The material in this class is very interesting. The reading is VERY boring, but Professor Gruber's lectures were very good.",
    "Great class, interesting and fun. Reading responses are not a big deal and the exams are fair. Short answers on exams are really detailed though, with definitions of concepts, all its parts and examples for each. Take time for the paper\/project and you will get a lot out of it. Take it!",
    "Recommend with reservation.",
    "Human Emotion had the classic lecture set-up, but Professor Gruber remixed that relatively unexciting form with videos and in-class demonstrations that literally brought to life the words in the textbook. Although some of the work could get monotonous, even with the daily 9AM music wake-up calls with songs related to the day's topic, the guest lecturers provided the assurance that students were learning about the field of emotion from a wide array of experienced experts--creating the perfect foundation for any future emotion study.",
    "Basically its 3 tests and a paper. I would definitely recommend this as an easy, yet interesting class to take. The work is overall pretty minimal.",
    "Definitely take it with Prof. Gruber. Very fun class, even though it's at 9am. I was never bored in class and a lot of the material was really interesting. The guest lectures were great as well and I was able to apply several of the topics to my other courses. the workload is great; reading questions, 3 midterms each worth 25% and a short final paper with an outreach project, or a longer paper option. Prof. Gruber is really nice and understanding. You won't regret it.",
    "This is a fun class that will teach you everything you ever needed to know about human emotion. I'd recommend it.",
    "Take it if you need an easy class, but beware of the exam questions!! The prof likes to ask tricky questions like \"which of the following is the least likely to be the best answer\" (ok, that's not a real example but you get my point). No section, 3 exams, 1 paper\/project. Lecture slides are posted online.",
    "If it's not at 9am, then yea! It's a lot of fun. Not so much learning.",
    "Definitely take this course. This was the first time it was taught at Yale and usually that means that there is significant room for improvement but that was not the case at all. Professor Gruber is a joy. She's really fun and engaging. Since the class was at 9am she played music videos for us every morning to get us pumped and awake. The material is extremely interesting and applicable to many parts of psychology. However, you should not be deceived by the fun, lighthearted nature of the class because the exams are tough and you have to study to do well. The professor provides you with a list of things you need to know for each exam which is helpful, and rare at Yale. You have the opportunity to do a really fun, creative project during the course and Professor Gruber will love you if you run with it and do something truly unique. Enjoy!",
    "Great course for lecture. Professor Gruber is really fun and presents really interesting material. Be careful because tests require memorizing every detail in order to do well.",
    "This is a fairly interesting survey course in psych. The individual lectures are all very interesting, but don't necessarily link together very well.The course requirements are pretty light, so you won't spend too much time worrying about this class.I learned some cool things about human emotions.",
    "Definitely reccomend this course! It was a great survey course in human emotion and other aspects of psychology related to it that spanned across areas in clinical, social and developmental psyc.",
    "A good course. No final paper or exam, which was really great. Not a ton of work. A fair class in terms of grading and tests. You don't get a lot of opportunities to comment about the material, but Professor Gruber does a great job at teaching the material and making it engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think everyone should take it because it is almost a life skill to learn about your own emotions as well as others.",
    "Fantastic course that was one of the best I have taken so far. Take it if it is offered and it will help you appreciate your Yale education that much more.",
    "Yes, although maybe not if you've taken many other psych classes.",
    "It is a very interesting topic and would recommend to any student. The only thing that I wasn't thrilled about with this class was that it was at 9am",
    "Take this class.",
    "Good intro course-- it has a lot of overlap with other psych courses though so I wouldn't necessarily take it if I wanted to learn a bunch of new material.",
    "PSYC 131 is an easy but interesting class. The three-exam format means that you're done before reading week, although this can be frustrating if you are taking other intro-level psychology courses that also follow the three-exam format. Final paper is pretty easy, but work hard on it so you get a good grade. There are some crazy curves (4%) on the exams, which can be tough if you don't study. My advice: if you take the course, it will be an easy 5th course, but DO THE READINGS and STUDY FOR THE EXAMS. The exams really aren't hard if you study. There are a lot of athletes in the class, and tons of seniors who take it C\/D\/F. If you want to learn about emotion and stuff, it's cool, but by no means the best course here at Yale.",
    "While I'm sure that this class would be a comforting environment for Freshmen just entering Yale, the overall content and teaching style were frankly insulting to those of us who expect more than cute videos and \"flame effects\" from a class. Not recommended for juniors, seniors, intelligent sophomores, and anyone who cares more about learning than fulfilling distributional requirements. The content barely goes beyond material covered in Psych 110. I'd give this one a pass, unless you're going for an easy credit for a distributional requirement.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter, take this course. It would make a good 5th class, as it is a pretty relaxing work load. Professor Gruber's lectures are interesting, and you can get away with skimming the reading (have to go to lecture though!)",
    "Absolutely. Take it!",
    "This is a very fun class and the readings are excellent. At times, the treatment of the material seems superficial, but that may not be a bad thing or an intro course. Professor Gruber is very entertaining, but can be sort of polarizing: my friends and I loved her but I know a couple of people who did not. I learned things that I apply in my life every day, especially as a person with a mood disorder.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have not already taken Emotional Intelligence, unless you want to review the same material, which is alright as well.If you had a choice between Emotional Intelligence and Human Emotion, I would take Emotional Intelligence though. That class has more of a focus, and allows more interaction in the class.",
    "Take it!",
    "Took this class for kicks as a physics major, and it satisfied.",
    "Not sure. If you have taken an intro psych course, you have taken this class.",
    "I recommend the class, it's not to hard and you learn things that will help you in life.",
    "This class is very cool. I liked all of the different areas of study. I definitely would recommend this class.",
    "Definitely take this class!! Pretty easy but you still learn a lot. Well taught - make sure June gruber is teaching it. She's a fantastic lecturer. Worth taking at 9 am. 3 tests, one paper and no final. You don't need to be a psych major to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Though you do have to study a bit before the exams, it is a fun class.",
    "Yeah take it. It's fairly interesting and not too bad in terms of work required. If you've taken Emotional Intelligence, it'll be a pretty easy class since there is so much overlap. The two classes even use the same textbook, so you can save money there.",
    "It's ok, not that mind blowing, but also not to difficult and occasionally interesting. Also no section is nice.",
    "This is a classic Psych gut. There are a bunch of hoops to jump through, but as long as you jump through them, and memorize the slides like you should, you'll do well. The class has an 'outreach' project, where you make a video about how important emotions are - that should really say it all - you don't need to be smart to get an 'A' you just need to do what you're supposed to.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "Definitely take this class. Interesting material, great professor, manageable workload.",
    "Psychology 131 is really interesting. I would recommend it to another student, particularly if that student were a freshman or a sophomore. I think the course is especially well suited to underclassmen, because it is very friendly and relatively straightforward.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was a fun introduction to human emotions. The professor is great and the subject matter is interesting. It is a course structured to help you do well (3 non-cumulative exams).",
    "I would recommend this course... best Cr\/D course out there",
    "If you're cool with giant lectures, but with interesting subject matter and a fun professor, take this class. I thought it was easy but interesting, but you'll probably have to show up to lecture every time to do really well. There are 3 non-cumulative tests and no final, and just one paper with an extra \"project\" (music video, newspaper article, brochure, etc. really easy). Professor Gruber is great and really cares about her students, and very much about the subject she is teaching. You'll learn a decent amount and it won't be a pain. Some overlap with Intro to Psych, and I would recommend taking that one first because the concepts will be more familiar by the time you get to Human Emotion, but I know people who did just fine without any Intro to Psych background.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is pretty basic. It's interesting if you haven't taken much psych, but if you have you'll just be frustrated by the lack of depth. Dr. Gruber didn't say much that you couldn't find in the assigned reading or on wikipedia. Grading on the exams was pretty generous though.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a nice overview of this branch of psychology.",
    "It is very useful because it helps you understand emotions you experience and to cope with them.",
    "Psych 131 is a great class that provides a lot of interesting information of the large variety of areas that emotions affect in our daily lives. Professor Gruber is a great lecturer and the readings in the class are very interesting and relevant. Work load is also fair. Definitely a great class!",
    "This is a great class if you're looking for a class to round out a busy course schedule because there are only 3 non-cumulative exams and no final exam (huge plus). However, it is NOT a gut class. The exams are pretty hard if you don't study...but if you do study, you will do well because the exams come right from lectures. Prof Gruber even hands out a study sheet before each exam so if you don't do the readings for the class, you still know what from the readings is important for the exam. Prof G is also a great lecturer, she makes the class very interesting and fun to attend even though it's at 9am!Overall, great class, but don't take it if you're also going to take psych 110 in the same semester because some of the concepts you learn overlap.",
    "It's an interesting overview of of human emotion, and the lectures are pretty interesting. The exams are harder than expected though, and the lack of section is unfortunate. I would recommend the class, just don't expect it to be a gut!",
    "Its a good intro psych class for people who are either interested in psych and want an easy good grade, or for people who are not that interested in a lot of psych, and looking for a social science credit",
    "YES!! This was one of my favorite classes! You learn A LOT! This was one of those classes where I'd actually talk about the material with my friends in the dining hall. You should definitely study well in advance for the exams because they cover a lot of material. Overall the workload is pretty normal, three exams, reading response questions (which aren't difficult and you only have to do five) and a paper\/project. Professor Gruber is great, she really makes the material interesting and even though the class was at 9am I wanted to go. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone.",
    "A great course on the influence emotion has on various realms of psychology -- consumerism, mental illness, love, all that kind of stuff. It's really interesting stuff, even if you're not super into social psychology. Fascinating material presented incredibly well. Take this class!",
    "A solidly good course.Prof. Gruber is great - very cheery with is helpful early in the morning, and she plays music to wake us up. You can tell she's excited about the material and wants to share it with you. Also a good lecturer.Material-wise, it could have gone deeper but was a pretty good survey of the field. Most of it felt kind of intuitive - I would've been interested to delve into more specifics of certain areas to learn things you wouldn't guess about emotion psych. Learned a pretty good amount though and the work wasn't too intense.On the whole, I found the material interesting and genuinely enjoyed lectures. A good balance of work and fun.",
    "Human Emotions is a great class if you have an interest in psychology or think you might. The lectures and the material is all very interesting and applicable, and you will rarely be bored which is great. I would recommend it because its an enjoyable experience and the work load isn't bad.",
    "I would summarize this as a pop-culture intro psych course with steady work, but not too much. I'd definitely recommend it to become more emotionall-intelligent.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to almost anyone. Be wary that it is by no means a gut and that there are oftentimes thirty pages to be memorized to effectively prepare for exams. June Gruber is an excellent teacher and the classes are always informative and fun. While it is a difficult class it is worth it.",
    "Yes, because Professor Gruber makes the course fun, and the grades are evenly and fairly distributed",
    "YES TAKE IT! Whether you're a Psych Major or not. The material is highly interesting, and tests really aren't very difficult at all, abd very straightforward and fair--the mean grades were always at least in the mid to high 80s. I think anyone can enjoy it--and she plays music videos at the beginning of every class--what's not to like!",
    "I recommend shopping it for sure, and taking it if you're interested in the material and don't mind taking a large lecture course.",
    "Human Emotion is an eye-catching and interesting topic and you are likely to find that the lectures are much of the same. However, be warned that the grading of the course (3 tests, 1 paper and some reading responses) is very harsh and makes you question why you loved this course to begin with and if you really are understanding the material. I would recommend this course to a fellow student if he or she was prepared to spend several days studying the detailed material of it.",
    "Take it! Fun lectures. Moderately easy course. Interesting material. Easy to get a good grade if you learn the lecture slides.",
    "It's a very solid, very standard psych class. Which means that if you've had other psych classes, you'll hear the same information you've heard before. That being said, Professor Gruber is great, and it's a much better course than something like Social Psych. The workload is relatively light and the papers are graded easily.",
    "Definitely take this!! One of the best intro courses in the psychology department. June Gruber is amazing and the material is easy to digest and fascinating. Be sure to keep up with the readings though because you will find that the exams will cover a lot of material.",
    "Amazing course, strongly recommend!",
    "june is great, the class gets a little tedious at times, but it's very simple and straightforward, worth it",
    "I would not recommend it if you want an easy fifth class.",
    "Easy psych credit and interesting material. A little redundant at times.",
    "Very fun and exciting information. Class was fun. June Gruber is really cool. Graded kind of hard but its worth it.",
    "If you are at all interested in emotions, or have a general interest in psychology, definitely. If you're looking for a fun social science req, definitely.",
    "Yes, if you're a psych major or need a social science credit. Or maybe a fifth fun class or something. I think it was a good, fun course. Easy. Some things felt kind of bullshit though and definitely a little fluffy. But it was engaging and some the topics were really interesting.",
    "Definitely recommended! Very interesting class material. One project and three non-cumulative exams. You will want to attend lectures!",
    "Easy until the tests, and then you freak out.",
    "Do not take this class. Too easy, too much of a waste of time, absolutely nothing new offered that you couldn't get from Intro Psych or a glance through a textbook.",
    "Psych 131 is a great course. The work load is minimum; however, I do suggest that when it is time to study, to review the material thoroughly. The guest lectures in the class are great, and the studies are relevant.",
    "take it. easy class. easy tests. not too much work. fun and interesting. good class.",
    "A very fun course; I find myself applying a lot of the stuff that I learned quite often in daily life. Just think: Sternberg's theory of love and the things that you could do with that.",
    "No, you don't learn anything substantive",
    "Take this class! It's amazing! I was hesitant to take a 9 AM class but Professor will wake you up with a music video at the start of the class, and an interesting\/engaging lecture. You will get from this class what you put into it. I fond the readings extremely interestng but they are not always necessary to read because she gives you a study guide for each exam and the slides are posted on line.If you're a Psych major, take this class! If you're interested in Psych at all, take this class! If you want a 5th class that isn't too difficult, take this class!",
    "Take it if you are a psych major. Its not as easy as people may think.",
    "Great class even for the non-major! I learned a lot of practically applicable information on human emotional development and behavior that I find myself thinking about in everyday life.",
    "Take it, it's such a fun class. Not a gut, but not intensely difficult. I learned a lot and will take away a bunch from the course.",
    "I'd recommend it. It was pretty interesting and Professor Gruber is very nice. The work for the class isn't too bad either.",
    "Definitely worth taking, just that it's early. But all athletes were here so you know what that means.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in an introduction to psychology focused more on human emotion than cognition. this class is not a gut, but it is relatively easy if you study.",
    "yes. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "yes i would. its a very fun, interesting class that helps you understand how people feel and behave.",
    "I would, but only if you don't mind large classes. This semester, the class had at least 200 students (or if not quite that many, it sure seemed that way), so the class is highly impersonal. Professor Gruber and the TAs are accessible, but just not always available. The coursework is very interesting and there isn't too much reading, so I would recommend it if there's a fleeting interest for emotional psychology but perhaps not if there's an intense desire.",
    "Really fun interesting class, not too much work, and the work you do have to do is interesting!",
    "Yes! Professor Gruber is very passionate about the subject, and she finds different ways to share that passion and engage the students during the lecture.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone and everyone. Great class.",
    "This was a pretty cool class to attend. I really wish I had taken it Cred\/D\/Fail since there was a lot of reading that I couldn't keep up with and I just have a low tolerance for 9am classes. If you can deal with those 2 things and attend lecture 2x a week, then you're set. The material was really interesting and insightful and I would have enjoyed it more if I had Pass\/Failed it.",
    "I would definitely recommend to a friend. The class isn't incredibly difficult, and the material is interesting if you're into psych.",
    "This is good if you like psych, and the prof tries hard to make the subject material fun and interesting.",
    "Great class.",
    "Solid gut class, though watch out, because it'll creep up and destroy your GPA if you aren't careful. Very hit or miss, especially for science majors.",
    "Human Emotion is a very broad topic, and so there was not really enough time in the semester to study any particular aspect thoroughly. That said, it was a fairly shallow introduction, and the teaching style was not very professional. It felt like Professor Gruber was trying very hard to be liked, to the detriment of the class. I would not recommend this class to anyone who wants a really in-depth look at human emotion. It was an introduction to human emotion, but we probably learned about as much in this class as you do in the corresponding unit of any other introductory psych class.",
    "This was an interesting class covering a wide range of fascinating topics without too bad of a course load. June Gruber is one of Yale's most cheerful professors and one of the few that can effectively liven up a 9 am class. Overall fun class, even at 9am.",
    "The 9 AM start time was brutal, but Prof Gruber is engaging and the subject matter fascinating and well-presented. It's quite a bit of work--consistent work, which may be a positive or negative for people, depending on your preference. 3 non-cumulative tests, 1 project\/research essay, 5 reading responses.",
    "YES! Professor Gruber is awesome.",
    "A very broad perspective on human emotion, probably a class that every Psychology major should take.",
    "A good class with an amazing teacher. However, the work load was a bit high so be prepared for that.",
    "Human Emotion is a great class to take if you are NOT a psych major - the ideas are new and useful and cool. It's a sinch if you are a psych major - very few of the ideas and materials are novel, making it a bit of a refresher, somewhat easy, and somewhat of a bore."
