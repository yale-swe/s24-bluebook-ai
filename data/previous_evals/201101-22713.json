   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to anyone who is interested in pursuing anthropology or any other field where ethnographic research is a requirement\/an advantage.",
    "This class is disorganized. Class moves without any direction and thus I felt lost a lot. I took it as a requirement, but I would not reccommend. Prof. Allen is nice and extremely helpful in office hourse, but as far as leading a class, needs a little more work. I never was sure what the assignments were, what was going on in class, what the readings were, or when things were due.",
    "Great class to think about your senior essay topic and get a good proposal done. You'll have to write a proposal anyway, so why not do it in a class with support?! Really good class with a really good and committed professor.",
    "Only take this class if you want to speak and engage with other students... unfortunately our class lacked participation on a lot of the days which was too bad. It's better when everyone is is dialogue with one another. I definitely recommend it for those looking for what is probably considered an 'alternative' anthropology syllabus but definitely shouldn't be. you read really important texts (faye harrison, kamari clarke, sherry ortner, trouillout, renato rosaldo) which are CRUCIAL to any anthropologist especially those working in the 'third world'.",
    "I was disappointed by this class. Some interesting readings in the second half of the semester, but lots of dense anthro theory throughout that is pretty unhelpful if you're not an anthro major. Prof. Allen is a wonderful person but very disorganized as a professor. He does push you to think critically about your own ethnographic research (especially from a postcolonial perspective), but this course definitely does not provide the foundation in ethnographic methodology you need to actually conduct fieldwork.",
    "Critical Ethnography is a great course if you're an incipient Anthro major interested in asking some of the trickiest and most devastating questions of the discipline (What can we really learn from ethnographic research? How can anthropology break away from its legacy of colonialism? How do power structures produce and privilege certain sorts of knowledge? etc). The reading is terrific. At the same time, though Jafari Allen is brilliant, personable, and fun, he's quite disorganized; what you get out of the course is highly intellectual but not so tangible. If you really want to learn techniques of ethnographic research, this is not the course for you. And if you're the kind of person who needs things like quantitative feedback on performance or, um, a syllabus, you might want to try this class Credit\/D."
