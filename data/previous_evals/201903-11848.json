   "comments": [
    "Its just Spanish, take it!",
    "Get rid of Supersite, it did not help learning and causes the textbook to be way more expensive than need be, serving as a barrier to students.",
    "The class is very good at drilling conjugations and sentence structures into your head, but can be somewhat mechanical as a result of the type of the course. The practice of verb quizzes at the start of every class was very helpful in making me constantly practice and I did notice a benefit in my fluidity of conjugation as a result. The only way the course could really be improved would maybe be a change in the main book we read, battles in the desert. While interesting, the novel was somewhat of a mix of poetry and straight literature and I personally feel that a more straightforward novel might be a better fit:",
    "The super site is a really bad way to evaluate anyone honestly or even well. If someone wrote an answer that was correct, but not the exact wording or punctuation of the teachers correct answer, would get 0%. Really quite useless and frustrating, and absolutely must be improved, fixed, or done away with in order for students to receive accurate grades, that reflect their spanish speaking ability. not grades that reflect their ability to guess what the teacher wrote down as correct.",
    "Strengths: Good incorporation of various Spanish media into course material Weaknesses: A lot of busy work.",
    "The strength is that, even if you dont try, you will definitely see your Spanish skills improve significantly. The assignments are generally fair, and the readings are really interesting. The weakness is the workload. This class meets every day and gives homework every day. Though none of the assignments are particularly difficult, it takes a ton of time to finish each one. It can also be difficult to keep track of the assignments due each day."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Spanish is so important",
    "If they had to take it for a requirement",
    "Aside from being a requirement for some people, the course was genuinely very helpful for mastering Spanish and was a good use of my time. I think its a necessary but maybe not super exciting step in learning a valuable skill so would recommend to anyone who wants to really be able to speak a useful level of Spanish.",
    "If youre taking Spanish, then yes.",
    "While you probably dont have a choice on whether to take this class, I recommend taking it in a semester without other classes with a lot of work. This class is a lot like high school in that theres a ton of busy work, but the tests are still challenging and the standards are really high."
