   "comments": [
    "This is a good survey\/intro course. It is well organized and the readings are interesting. I would certainly recommend it.",
    "This class is very basic, introductory material. Also, it is not a gut. The grading miraculously got very strict this semester, which was surprising for a class that is filled with obvious material.",
    "Yes, this was a great class. Average amount of reading and the rest of the course load was fairly light. Interesting topics, readings and lectures. Would recommend.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are very interested in sociology and are willing to put in a fair amount of work. It is not as easy or interesting as it seems to the casual observer.",
    "Eye-opening on the question of sex and gender in the states. Gives you a new perspective on what is a given vs what is produced in society.",
    "I didn't take this class looking for an easy A, but if some of you are, I just have to warn you that this is NOT it. Most people have gotten B's on the assignments, B+'s for the lucky ones. That being said, if that doesn't bother it's an interesting class with some fantastic readings.",
    "Eye opening, interesting class, but make sure to be thorough in your writing",
    "I recommend this class as a very general introduction to sociology, but if you have taken any other WGSS course or any other sociology course, then you may find this a bit repetitive. The class basically gives you a history of sexuality studies and ideologies, and then the rest of the class is centered on discussions of how gender is constructed in society.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to students who do not plan on being sociology majors. I now know how to think of the world in terms of social constructions, but I felt that some of the concepts in this class were frustratingly elementary.",
    "This class was pretty groovy. I dug the subject material and I reckon it significantly altered my perspectives on issues such as the role of women in the workforce and other 'portant subjects like that. My worldview has been broadened by this course, and in my opinion that's pretty far out.",
    "This class was pretty good, I'd recommend it. It's kinda basic if you're familiar with the ideas of sex and gender, but I still think it's a good class to take. Almeling's an all right lecturer, but she gets the information across very clearly.",
    "I would recommend it. Grading is kind of hard, so I might recommend Cr\/D\/Fail. But the class material is interesting and Prof. Almeling is a very good lecturer. She goes at a reasonable pace so it's never an overload of information.",
    "Its a really interesting course if you need to fulfill your sociol science requirement. Do not take it, however, if you have no interest in sex or gender studies because you'll have a negative effect on the rest of your section.",
    "SOCY 134 is a course on how gender influences society and vice versa. As an intro sociology course, it does a nice job of introducing sociological methods, terminology, and thinking. If you are interested in this subject, you will love the class. Don't take the class if you can't stand powerpoints.",
    "A good class to expand your knowledge about the subject matter. A lot of reading ,but workload isn't too bad.",
    "Take it!",
    "I recommend the course.",
    "I REALLY enjoyed this course. The readings were diverse, interesting, and useful in re-constructing the ways in which I experience, understand, and evaluate sex and gender in society. The class has literally altered the way I see the world. I genuinely feel that every student at Yale should take this course, because its content is THAT important in informing the ways we experience life, relationships, and culture.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone legitimately interested in sociology. Otherwise, I would not recommend it. It's not really worth taking if you're not genuinely interested. It's not as much of a gut as people might say.",
    "Pretty good course with interesting material, though it was sometimes disappointing how quickly we moved from one topic of discussion to another -- more breadth than depth, but certainly a solid introductory course, and a good way to get acquainted with the core concepts in sociology.",
    "Take it if you're interested in gender and sexuality studies. The subject matter is really fun\/engaging. But don't treat it like a gut if you expect to get an A.",
    "Yes- it is a very enlightening and seriously fun course. Anyone would enjoy it."
