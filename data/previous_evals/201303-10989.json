    "My goodness, genetics lab. What an adventure. We swatted flies and smeared yeast, ran gels and crushed bee's legs. Genetics labs is a massive emotional roller-coaster. In weekly lab meeting, which would often run about 4-hours, I felt like I was always about to mess something up (fly in wrong vial, yeast in wrong segment, wrong chemical added to PCR), which is to say it was stressful. Also, this is one of those labs where they want you to think for yourself, which is a good think, but helped genetics lab make you feel the nice combination of both stressed out and stupid at the same time. There were only 5 lab reports in the whole semester, but were some of them beasts. I think I probably spent about 20 hours average on the last 3 labs. Each. Maybe more. To top it off, sometimes they would have these little dinky pop quizzes at the beginning of lab that would sometimes be really easy, and sometimes be impossible. What's the upside? Actually a fair amount, after you come to the terms with the work\/stress:class credit ratio (.5 credits, as with all labs). First, you actually think for yourself in this lab, as opposed to many others (looking at you, Chem116). You also get exposure to many model organisms (yeast, flies, arabidopsis, etc) and genetic techniques. You will never look at a fruit fly in the same way again. Also, after slaving away at the lab reports, you will understand the material better, and it so happens that the lab reports reinforce important concept from genetics lecture (MCDB 200). You need to know how to map a gene -- lecture won't really teach you -- but oh boy will genetics lab teach you. Because you do it like 4 times per lab times three labs. The grading scheme is unclear, and you are just told that it's curved at the end and that's that. Labs get a number grade back, but who knows what they mean. The course is taught primarily by Dr. Dawson, who I found fairly unpleasant. Dr. Leiserson is nicer. Overall, genetics lab is a lot of work and stress, but you feel like a genetics boss after.",
    "Great lab! Reports are every other week, and take some time, but aren't too bad. The lab also was really helpful in understanding the course material.",
    "I thought that this was a good lab -- I came away having learned a lot, and in some ways I felt that it was more helpful than the genetics lecture. I took the lab a year after having taken the lecture, and my advice to other students would be to take them concurrently; in lab you get a lot of practice with chi-square tests and data analysis that will help solidify the material from lecture and may help you solve problems on the lecture final. However, if you are thinking of taking this keep in mind that it is a LOT of work for a half-credit class. We had five lab reports throughout the semester. Four of them were 1500 words, and one of them was 2500 words. And that doesn't even include the tables and figures, which also take a long time to make. As someone who is a slow writer, I found that this class was very time-consuming. There are also four pop quizzes throughout the semester, but for the most part these were relatively straightforward. Dawson is a good professor and he seems like a pretty nice guy. Overall, I would definitely take this course again, and it's certainly one of the better labs I've taken at Yale. But it may not be the best class to take alongside other work-heavy classes.",
    "Overall, this lab was extremely helpful in solidifying the concepts in genetics lecture. It is a lot of work though, so be prepared to set aside time for it. However, if you do it, you will get out what you put in.",
    "This is a great lab course. The lab write-ups are long and tedious, but I felt like I got a lot out of the class, especially on how to write a scientific paper. In addition, the lab solidified a lot of things we learned (or theoretically should have learned) in lecture. Both Professor Dawson and Professor Leiserson are great. The labs can be long, but I actually enjoyed lab periods. They really try and teach you how to run an experiment yourself, unlike chem labs where you're just following a protocol the entire time.",
    "If you need a bio lab, take this one! Genetics lab is taught by amazing professors, and because the sections are so small, you really get the opportunity to learn a lot. I never dreaded coming to lab, and with the experiments you do, you get to see results that really demonstrate what was going on in the experiment (unlike in some chem labs where reactions happen but you can't really see a difference in reactants vs. products).",
    "I would highly recommend this lab course to anyone taking the Genetics course. As a matter of fact, I would even recommend the Genetics MCDB 202 course just so that a student can take this lab course. This may have been my favorite class at Yale so far. I loved working with yeast and flies and Arabidopsis throughout the course, and I found that this lab gave me a huge advantage in the lecture class itself because of its reinforcement of the concepts from the lecture. The professors are great, and the labs are well-organized. Most of the lab reports are very long, but I found that they improved my lab writing skills so much. The lab class is very chill in comparison to other lab courses I've taken which makes the course all the more enjoyable.",
    "A great lab to take; it will make the genetics lecture final significantly easier, and I felt I've learned more in this lab class than from the lecture. I've learned and applied so much, and would definitely recommend to anyone else. It's a significant amount of work compared to other labs, but in retrospect it really isn't bad and is well worth it.",
    "Take it if you have to, not that bad of a lab.",
    "very helpful to take in addition to the lecture course. covers all of dellaporta's stuff in a practical way.",
    "It's a great lab that supplements the material in the lecture very well. It helped me gain a better understanding of Genetics and definitely helped me do better on the final from MCDB 202. Highly recommended lab course. It's also pretty fun working with flies.",
    "This is an interesting course. It it thought provoking, but also a challenge. This class is a lot of work, and is hard, but you also learn a lot. I would consider it one of the more interesting labs, but also one of the more challenging labs.",
    "Absolutely. Great lab, especially for those taking it with the lecture course."
