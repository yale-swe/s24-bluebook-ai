    "The more of the reading you actually do, the more you will get out or the course. The essay assignments are rather dull, but they seem to be department assigned. Try to write about things you find interesting, especially for the research paper, and it will make it more enjoyable. Meeting with the professor was always very helpful and will help you better understand what he wants\/prioritizes in assessment.",
    "What you would expect from an english class. I recommend it to other students only if you are interested in the topic.",
    "It is a really interesting seminar, particularly if you are interested in the First Amendment. Take it!",
    "The class goes through some of the most fundamental pieces of work from scholars who write about free speech, starting with John Stuart Mills (whom I am so glad I had the opportunity to read) all the way up to modern writers like Catherine MacKinnon (who was actually in my dream last night..weird) and Judith Butler. We discuss the works in class, focusing on critiquing and analyzing their logic. The paper topics follow a similar format to class discussions. And we ended with a 6 min oral presentation. I would recommend this class for sure. But make sure you are interested in and invested in talking about speech. The readings can be long and dense. But overall it's a great class and \"speech\" is a broad umbrella under which many interesting topics fall! And the class does put an interesting lens on modern day events."
