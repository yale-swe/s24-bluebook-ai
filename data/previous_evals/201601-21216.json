    "This course provided a thorough grounding in the metaphysics and epistemology of Hume, one of the greatest English philosophers - and likely one of the greatest philosophers in world history. Along the way, we touched on semantics\/linguistics, moral psychology, and critiques of religion. Professor Winkler was an excellent instructor who was clear, prepared, and accessible to students. He led interesting discussions and had detailed handouts. I would strongly recommend this course."
