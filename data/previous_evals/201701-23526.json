    "This was the best course I've taken so far at Yale. Rick is an incredible professor and I wish he taught more. All of the readings selected were fantastic, and the structure of the syllabus clearly demonstrated an amount of care and thoughtfulness not often seen with other faculty. Rick brought in alumni to work with us on an interesting and innovative final project. Even his exams were interesting and strangely fun to complete. This course is a must for any student interested in coastal issues.",
    "This course has such great potential. It is the only course on this topic at FES, and the professor has a wealth of insider experience and knowledge about the field. He is eager to facilitate learning and is very invested in his students' success. The main thing I would change is the format. Student presentations on course material were not helpful to prepare or listen through. For many of the lectures, it was essentially a student teaching the class with some guidance from the professor -- I would have much preferred a lecture from Rick himself. Similarly, in a three hour lecture I would also hope to have more guest lecturers. That is, the first hour could be a lecture by the professor, the second hour could be a guest lecturer visit, and the first hour could be devoted to discussion. Or, the first 40 minutes could be lecture from the professor, the next 20 minutes could be a student presentation to present the guest lecturer, then an hour of guest lecturing, and then an hour of discussion. Or something like that! Also, perhaps Rick could collect student questions\/comments about the reading material and use those to guide discussion. Basically, I think the format could be more dynamic, more engaging, and less reliant on student lectures. The final assignment, a testimony to Congress, was useful. The midterm was somewhat useful, though I think a policy memo (or two) would have perhaps been better suited for the content of the course."

    "This class was amazing. The readings were all fascinating and incredibly well organized, complimenting each other perfectly. I came away from the course having a very thorough understanding of the policy process and coastal issues.",
    "The readings Rick chooses are terrific. There are a lot but it's worth getting through all of them - you will learn so much.",
    "Rick's explanations positively brought the field of coastal policy to life for me. I had very little exposure to this field prior to taking this course, and it provided me with an understanding and enthusiasm of the policy process which exceeded my expectations. All of the readings were well selected, interesting, and relevant. 10\/10.",
    "Enjoyed the opportunity to meet the two guests. Also enjoyed the opportunity to write the testimony to congress. The professor's lectures and his book were very interesting, and the flow of the content\/syllabus was solid. I also appreciated the extent to which current events\/political conversation were brought into the course.",
