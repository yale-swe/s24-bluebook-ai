    "SOCY 160 is great to start preparing for your senior thesis!",
    "If you're a SOCY major, you have to take this class. If you aren't a SOCY major, there are probably better classes for you to take. But as a SCOY major, this is a GREAT class. It's a requirement, but it is such a fun class and you learn so much. Take it!",
    "Solid methods class, very focused on sociology majors though",
    "Overall, I would say this course gives you a solid overview of research methods both in their theoretical and practical sense. I wouldn't say the subject matter necessarily lends itself to a \"hands on\" classroom environment, but I think one of the strengths of the class was how interactive Professor Smith made most of our class meetings. While some may have found the activities \"cheesy,\" I personally think those are the lessons that we will remember the most as we go on to work on research projects of our own. I can honestly say there was never a dull moment in socy 160. There are only 2 things I can think of that could help to improve the course. Sometimes it felt like the guidelines for assignments were a little vague, and maybe it's just my fault for maybe not paying more attention to docs posted online, but it may be of benefit to outright explain some of the requirements for assignments--specifically what is expected for the senior thesis proposal. Secondly, I usually don't mind if a class is let out a little bit later than scheduled, but I unfortunately had to catch a class right after Methods that was across campus. Future students may find themselves in the same boat and would probably appreciate being let out of class on time. Otherwise, I have to say I really enjoyed this course and looked forward to it throughout the semester.",
    "It teaches you how to do research and you write a proposal that then can serve as the foundation of your senior thesis."
