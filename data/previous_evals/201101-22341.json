    "if you are interested in the japanese economy, this is a good class to take. you are free to explore topics of your choice. a lot of the class time is spent on students' presentations. the workload is very reasonable.",
    "Class material is quite interesting if you follow up with the readings. The professor tends to go on random tangents. The workload is pretty light. It can be a good class if you put in the effort.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It is completely up to you to make the bulk of the learning experience, but the professor gives you great support.",
    "Having an interest in what's going on in Japanese economy is enough."
