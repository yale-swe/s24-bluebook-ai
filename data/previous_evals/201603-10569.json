    "Weakness: meets everyday, teaching pattern becomes habitual Strength: student engagement, small classes.",
    "While the course was mostly fine, I do think there could be a little more emphasis on oral and listening practice, especially involving materials designed for native speakers. While these might be a little difficult, without any exposure its hard to really get a feel for the language. The weekly tutorial is also certainly inadequate for conversation practice.",
    "Strengths: Very high student participation and variety of mediums used to teach. Teachers very enthusiastic about the language. Weaknesses: None."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Would recommend if you just came back from Light Fellowship like 95% of the other students in the class. Professors teach with the assumption that everyone spent the last 2-3 months in China doing Light, so if you are coming from L4 after a summer of non-Chinese-related activities you're gonna feel really bad \/ really far behind for most of the semester. You do get to learn how to talk about a wide range of topics including serious and relevant things like politics, etc, which is great.",
    "If you want to solidify your knowledge coming back from HBA or another Light summer program, I'd say go for it. It's definitely a good way to keep in practice. While the progress you've made certainly won't be as marked as over the summer, you will, without realizing it, improve your Chinese over the course of the semester. For those not coming back from a Light program, be forewarned that the class will mostly likely be significantly more difficult and involve a fair amount of catch up, especially in terms of oral proficiency.",
    "I most certainly would. My mandarin improved tremendously."
