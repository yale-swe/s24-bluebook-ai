    "I'm still not always sure why we go to these lectures.",
    "Have speakers outside of academia\/ research.",
    "Might want to survey students to pick topics that a majority are interested in.",
    "Very interesting lectures this semester.",
    "I think that a lot of the topics covered were very interesting and pertinent to SBS, however in some instances it seemed like the speaker did not understand the audience - especially the Psychologist who spoke about genetics and learning disabilities.",
    "I think the talks were generally interesting. I think the attendance was surprisingly poor (particularly when the talks were not job talks). It seemed at times that the seminar was competing with other talks within YSPH which perhaps affected attendance, so that is something that could be considered when planning the seminar time in the future. I also would have like to attend some of those competing lectures, so keeping the time in mind would also allow students to attend talks of interest in other departments.",
    "I liked the diversity of speakers. There were both researchers and practicing epidemiologists, so it was great to hear ongoing projects in both areas. One suggestion that I've made in the past is to have an opportunity for PhD students or postdocs in the department to present their research as well. It would be really nice to know what research our peers in the doctoral program are currently pursuing.Also, I think it would be best to split the SBS and CDE seminars (or at least have more of both). I actually would have liked to have had more CDE-specific seminars, the number of which were limited due to the alternating nature of CDE and SBS seminars.",
    "I didn't feel that any of the guests were relevant to what I want to study. The man who talked about education was very good though.",
    "I would like to see more speakers who work in sectors of public health outside of academia\/research.",
    "The topics were varied and interesting.",
    "Speaks helped us to expand students' view of the public health. All speaks were very interesting!!",
    "good",
    "It would be better if the guest lecturers were more directed at SBS public health in the workforce - ie a combination of research and people working with organizations, the government, etc.",
    "great exposure to research outside of YSPH",
    "Excellent course that provides students with an opportunity to envision what career path they would like to take.",
    "I like the SBS seminar series! I thought it was a really great group of lecturers this semester from across the University.In the future I think it might be nice if the seminar series could incorporate more speakers who have careers in SBS -- I would LOVE to meet more people outside of the university who work in the field (especially outside of the research field). Also, it would be a great networking opportunity for students.",
    "some seminars are interesting and relevant"
