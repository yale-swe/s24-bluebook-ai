   "comments": [
    "This was a fantastic course that surveys the current literature on the fundamental challenges facing Africa today. The readings are thought-provoking and totally manageable, and class discussion was just directed enough to let us run wild!",
    "This is a sit back and listen class like I thought it was going to be. It's more involved than that. It requires reading the literature, analyzing it to see if the research was done in the best way and discussing this in the class.",
    "Each week you look at different problems facing African countries and proposed solutions. The course teaches you about Africa, but also how to read and understand research papers. I would definitely recommend it; Prof Carlson is great.",
    "Take the class if you are at all interested in the problems relating to Africa's development and democratization-many of which can be applied to other countries as well. The readings were very well chosen and interesting. I wish there had been a little more variety-instead of reading only primary sources that were all research studies. However, it was a very good, informative course, and Prof. Carlson is awesome.",
    "I thought it was a good course to give an outline of current thought\/ literature on development and democracy issues in Africa. It was an interesting group of people from white poli sci boys to girls from Africa. Carlson did a good job directing discussion, but I wish we came up with some answers to some problems! I also wish there was a bit more theory involved AND some history of how development has gone in the past",
    "This was a good class. It started off a little too slow in terms of content, but definitely picked up towards the later part of the semester. Professor Carlson is great at what she does, but how much you like the class will definitely depend on who your classmates are, as a lot of it is discussion based."
