By the time class rolls around, the material is no longer fresh in my mind. I also hate to get too far ahead and mix up course materials, so I don't move to the next module until after class. That leaves me with only a couple days each week where I can realistically do the work, leaving me feeling crammed and rushed every weekend.",
