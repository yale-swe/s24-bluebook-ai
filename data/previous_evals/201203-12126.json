   "comments": [
    "It's a very solid anthropology course. Professor Brotherton is great and you read about a wide variety of issues relating to this topic. There are reading responses each week, a presentation on that week's reading once a semester, and a final paper on a topic of your choosing. The discussions didn't flow that well sometimes because people just wanted to get their own points in, but overall it's a very interesting class.",
    "This is a great class to take but be aware that there is anthropological theory discussed in the coures (which can be very heavy for a lot of non-anthro students). The course load is pretty heavy (lots of reading, presentations, reading responses) but definitely worth it since everyone comes to class well prepared. I would definitely recommend this class if not strictly for the interesting subject matter, than for the opportunity to study under Professor Brotherton.",
    "It's a great class. The level of discussion can sometimes seem intimidating to those who are not senior anthro majors but it is a growing process. The books are really interesting and the reading can be a lot but it is enjoyable. There is a lot of theory in the beginning which can be difficult to get through and boring. You also do not have to write reading responses on all of the reading.",
    "Yes, take this course! Professor Brotherton is a GREAT professor and the discussions are always really interesting.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interesting in medical anthropology. The discussions were always lively and interesting. Everyone was very involved and knowledgable, but the discussions were friendly and not intimidating. The evaluation format is very fair with reading responses, a presentation, and a final paper. The readings were all very interesting.",
    "Class about how the idea of the body is constructed in society, how this definition is policed, and how it have come into the gaze of biomedicalization",
    "An interesting, fairly low-key, and consistently engaging seminar. Brotherton is great to work with and great to learn from. Depending on your interests, at least some of the readings will speak to you and intrigue you, and the books are especially good in the range of their approaches and theories. The work load is very manageable as long as you are a good reader.",
    "Super interesting, and perfectly accessible to non-anthropology majors. Brotherton is a totally excellent one-on-one advisor on papers and the like, and his syllabus is very well crafted. It really benefitted from only being undergrads. Only problem was that conversations could get super side-tracked sometimes because the seminar leaders\/professor needed to have taken a slightly more active role. But overall, super good."
