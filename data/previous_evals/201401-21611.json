   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a lecture that has room for participation for those who want that. It is a class that one could get through without doing work, but the more you put into the course, the more you get out of it. Because there is no final exam, some people did not do the readings, but they were all really compelling and provided a full view of the topic from the first day until the last.",
    "I really enjoyed Intro to Public Opinion with Professor DeCanio. He was very funny, smart, and a great lecturer. This class didn't require too much work except for the final paper, which took a bit of time to complete. It was actually an enjoyable paper to right, though. This class gave me a deeper appreciation of the nuances and complexity of political science, and it was a good opportunity to read a survey of literature from some of the brightest minds in the field, including our very own Professor DeCanio. I really grew to appreciate this class by the end of the semester. Great class overall with a fairly low workload until the essay, which is worth a large chunk of your grade. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 249 as an easy class for which you don't have to do that much work, but is very interesting nonetheless. I actually feel like I learned a ton from class participation.",
    "PLSC 249 is a multi-perspective approach to the historical and theoretical study of American governance and legitimacy through public opinion. Every class focuses on a different scholarly article on the nature of modern politics and how voter opinions matter--or don't. The class is a small lecture, but is heavily based on discussion, so expect a lot of back and forth between students and DeCanio. If you want a lecture level of work and participation with a seminar level of intimacy, this is the course for you.",
    "Yes, great course. Very broad. Come out with a great understanding of the coursework.",
    "Public Opinion is a great fifth class. Not much work but the material is legitimately interesting. There are only a couple big ideas for the entire course. There is a final paper, but I actually enjoyed working on it, and Professor DeCanio is an excellent lecturer with an underrated sense of humor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "If you are looking for a low workload, stress free, interesting class, take this! All you have to do is write a 12 page paper at the end of the semester. Make sure you do the readings because there are pop quizzes on occasion, but they are very basic and very minimal, just look up a summary and you'll be good to go.",
    "I would summarize PLSC 249 as an interesting political science class in which you can learn a lot and also enjoy yourself. I would definitely recommend it to students of any major.",
    "Light workload, but you will get something out of the class.",
    "I would say that PLSC 249 isn't exactly an \"intro\" 'course to public opinion. The topics and information are pretty specific to a niche field of public philosophy. It's a good class overall and I think as a political science major this has definitely helped my understanding of politics in the long run. However, that's if you do the reading and the work. If you don't, then you're wasting your time.",
    "This is a very chill class. You can essentially skim the readings and get by, and as long as you go to class, you'll get a great foundation of them by the time the class ends. Start your final paper early and go over your topic with your TF and with Professor DeCanio, since it's worth so much of your grade.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. You come out of it having learned and thought a lot. Lectures are also very interesting.",
    "A good 5th class. Can be as much work as you want it to be. This year Professor DeCanio gave out pop quizzes worth 20% of your grade, so you pretty much had to show up to every class. But the quizzes were super easy, so it didn't make the class stressful. The lectures are pretty interesting and if you start working on your paper early enough you'll be fine.",
    "not acutally a gut if you have to go to class but reasonably manageable"
