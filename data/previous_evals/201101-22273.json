    "You do short video assignments that work within certain skill areas in documentary filmmaking. You watch a feature film each week and discuss it. And eventually, you put all this knowledge and experience into creating a 10 minute film for the end of the term. If you really delve into this stuff, you will learn an incredible amount about life. Take this class. It's one of those classes that will stand out among other Yale classes as one that actually gives you tools and ways of thinking that will help you in your real life.",
    "Yes, even if you aren't necessarily interested in documentaries, you will be after taking this course. It is great for learning narrative storytelling.",
    "This was the best course I took this year, and probably the best one of my Yale career. I absolutely loved every minute of it. I originally had been turned off by the filmmaking courses I had taken, but this course rekindled my love of film and has made me really consider a career in documentary filmmaking. Sandra will push you. She will work you. And after all the hours and though you put in, she will probably tell you that you don't exactly have a masterpiece. It's scary but at the end of the class you will thank her for it, because you will learn from your mistakes and never make them again. You'll watch some great movies, and the people in our class really bonded as a group in a way I've never seen in any other class. Absolutely take this course. It would be a shame to miss it.",
    "Take it. You'll have fun if you have any interest whatsoever in filmmaking",
    "This was WONDERFUL CLASS. God, I loved every moment of it. The films were so amazing and inspiring and thought provoking at the readings were given in just the right amounts to be do-able and also extremely helpful. Sandra is an excellent professor and we all loved her. Don't worry about not having a ton of experience in final cut pro. You can learn as you go along as long as you have the will and the drive to be inquisitive about it.",
    "One of the actually good practical film courses. The professor is wonderfully blunt and in your face and you will learn A LOT."
