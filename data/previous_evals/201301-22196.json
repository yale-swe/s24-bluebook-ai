    "Professor Kapustin. Need I say more?",
    "It teaches you to think in an interdisciplinary way.",
    "Take this class for Prof. Kapustin - wonderful professor, very thoughtful and engaged. The material was interesting if you like political philosophy, though a bit disjointed at times.",
    "Pretty great. I liked both assignments, the readings were chosen well and the really treat was the seminar. Kapustin did a great job teasing out and presenting what mattered.There can be a good amount of reading but you can get a lot out of it by only doing a subset of it, and this was my first philosophy class but I thought it was great subject matter to start with and Kapustin really was great.",
    "It's a good introduction to the philosophers Kapustin chooses. The reading seems like a lot, but it's not overwhelming. Prepare to be challenged by other students in the class because there are some pretty intelligent philosophy buffs out there. Take a ton of notes: Kapustin is a wonderful source of information.",
    "EP&E 215 is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Kapustin is one of the best professors I've had at Yale, and I found myself looking forward all week to our classes just so I could hear him talk about the material. I would highly recommend taking it with Kapustin.",
    "Kapustin is simply amazing. If you are an EP&E major, and have to take Classics, definitely try to take it with him! The discussions are always great, and he is a fantastic seminar leader. His comments on your essays are always thorough.",
    "If you're an EP&E major, you have to take this class and you should definitely take it with Kapustin. Kapustin brings a lot of enthusiasm to the class and is a fair grader who offers insightful comments on written work. The material is not entirely straightforward and the reading list is lengthy, but Kapustin makes the class great.",
    "Great class take it !!",
    "I could not have imagined a better class with which to finish my yale college experience. So many of my intellectual disappointments with my undergrad education were made up for with this class."
