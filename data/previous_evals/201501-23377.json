    "A fantastic fifth course. The room was packed during shopping week but the class eventually dwindled down to a small lecture. I can see why some people lost interest--the first half of the course was on ancient philosophical roots of the idea of \"multiple worlds,\" which got a little dry and repetitive. But just be patient and stick it out through the mid-term because the second half of the course is awesome. Picture learning all the cool, crazy ideas about life in the universe, utopias on Mars, alien invasions, and UFOs, without any of the complicated math\/science of astronomy. This course also featured visits to the Beinecke, movie nights, looking through telescopes at the observatory, and a great guest lecture by Debra Fischer about current progress in the search for extraterrestrial life. You'll learn a lot about the role of science fiction in popular culture and how different political and social contexts influence speculation about life outside of Earth. Dal Prete's lecture slides were very clear and easy to study. Easy mid-term and final plus one 10 page paper on a topic of your choice. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who can fit it in their schedule.",
    "A fantastic, fun and extremely engaging introduction to aliens in culture! I would absolutely recommend this course!",
    "It's a good class but make sure to take careful notes during lecture so as to study well for midterms and finals-- or else you'll just be confused.",
    "Yes. Great class and very interesting. Not too much work",
    "It was a random somewhat fun class that was low stress",
    "Yes--it is a new look at aliens.",
    "Would highly recommend this course, MUCH more than a class simply about aliens. A lot of interesting history involved.",
    "You learn about the history of aliens in human thought. You will start in antiquity and go to almost present day."
