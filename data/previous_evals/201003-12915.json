    "Fun class, a lot will be determined by your class mates b\/c it is so discussion heavy. That's how you should shop it.",
    "Take it! Especially if you have no background in this stuff, you'll learn a lot. I think how the class goes will be determined in large part by who's in it, as our class was pretty small, so look around during shopping period and see how you feel. Prof Quintman makes the material pretty easy to understand and the readings will expose you to lots of different practices and perspectives.",
    "I would recommend it. The class is interesting, as are the readings. And, Professor Quintman is incredibly interesting and engaging.",
    "This is a very outlandish and interesting class. If you're interested in Buddhism, take it. Really do."
