    "Documentaries and the Environment is a good class for someone who enjoys watching documentaries, because (surprise, surprise) you will spend a LOT of time watching films over the course of the semester. There is a film screening each Monday night that lasts atleast 2 hours and in addition you are required to go to three outside films. However, all of the films we saw in class were REALLY good and you'll definitely learn a lot about many different issues from watching the documentaries. In addition, the class covers questions about documentaries as vehicles to transmit information, in other words you'll learn about the different roles\/goals\/modes of documentaries. The class only meets once a week but for almost two hours (!) so class can get pretty hard to sit through by the end. Overall though, I learned a lot from the class and saw a ton of great films. Definitely shop this class!",
    "Rather chill class. Get to see a lot of good films, and thought the textbook was worthwhile too.",
    "Yeah.",
    "It is a survey course on American documentaries and you will watch both popular documentaries and ones you have never heard of. I would recommend this class if you havent taken seomthing in film and would like an introduction.",
    "This course's greatest strength is its syllabus -- these are important films that anyone interested in sustainability and the environment should see. It is vital that we consider how information about these issues is communicated, and this class presents an opportunity to do so.",
    "The discussion portion of the class could be rather dry at times, but the screenings were always fascinating. The Environmental Film Festival at Yale was a fantastic end to the course.",
    "It's a film studies seminar about the rise of environmental documentaries and how they affect the film world and the environmental movement. The films shown in class are excellent and influential films. This was the first time it was taught, but I imagine in future years, it will be a bit more focused on how these movies function in societal awareness and change. Right now it was a bit too focused on the film studies aspects of the films... perhaps more micro than macro. If you're interested in communicating environmental issues to mass audiences, take this class. It's important, and you can really make of it what you want. It's a great platform for thinking about how our world can change using the power of film."
