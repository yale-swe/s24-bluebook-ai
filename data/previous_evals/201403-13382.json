    "Good class to get a little intro to each of the modules and matlab programming. Would recommend.",
    "I took this class because I knew it'd force me to learn MATLAB. It worked perfectly for that! However, it's not all that much more enlightening mathematically\/biophysically than whatever you could find online. Sections include: statistical analysis, linear algebra, diff eq, Fourier transforms. Lecture quality really depends on who's lecturing, but Liz and Yong are great! If you want to learn MATLAB and will be motivated enough to teach it to yourself in the context of some cool biophysical problems, go for it.",
    "Wide swings in quality throughout the year, and it might be a bit much to dive in without background in the math concepts covered, but I certainly did learn a lot, much of which is extremely relevant to actual research in biochemistry and biophysics.",
    "The material is interesting but complicated. Better organization would have been helpful. Also, while it is not essential that you know matlab, it is VERY helpful. The class is a lot more difficult without matlab experience.",
    "This class promises to be good and cover a lot of material, but just glosses over the basics of each topic and isn't actually useful. I don't feel like I learned anything. Class started out easy, but then Fourier transforms came around and I was screwed. I took it credit\/d and am afraid I failed. Hopefully this class looks good on my transcript, but I don't really think t was worthwhile. Berro is very kind and good natured but confuses himself working through problems and proofs. He manages to make things more confusing than they need to be and makes class feel like a waste of time. Liz is great. she is actually a good teacher, but her part of the course (stats) is incredibly basic. My shitty high school stats class covered as much. Xiong teaches Fourier transforms. I really enjoyed the lectures and felt I had learned a lot, but when I tried to do the homework I realized I didn't actually know anything. Class wasn't much work. it's whatever."
