    "I would. Hala grew up in Palestine and can offer primary evidence of the situation in the Middle East and why Arabs think the way they do.",
    "Hala (Prof. Nassar is perfectly fine if you call her that) will tell you in the first meeting that she doesn't want you in the class if a) you are a freshman; b) you don't know the geography of the Middle East; and\/or c) you don't know the last 100 years of history of the Middle East. Don't try to fake it - those are all quite necessary. If youdo know those things, though, and you want a really rigorous look at Arab society\/culture\/thought, I can't imagine a better class than this one. Hala is passionate without proselytizing, and that is extremely rare in this area of study. Best class--and best professor--I've had at Yale, hands down.",
    "This is a survey of Modern Arab Thought and is not an intro course. Freshman and Sophomores should not take this class. There is a lot of dense reading that can be very theoretical at times and you may feel like the readings are very disconnected from the reality of Arab life for many. Nonetheless, it is an important class to take if you want to enter the field of Middle Eastern studies."
