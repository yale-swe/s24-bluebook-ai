    "For anyone interested in science and policy, this is an incredibly useful, applicable class. While some of the topics will be frustrating because there is rarely a \"right\" answer or approach, this is appropriate given the collaborative nature of synthesizing science for policy.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone interested in the interface between science and policy. It will change how you think about the role of scientific knowledge and how science becomes translated into actionable policy.",
    "A really interesting examination of the boundaries between scientists and policymakers. Definitely take it if you're a scientist interested in policy applications, or if you want to work for a government agency that relies on scientific work. The course is only in its second year, so they're still working out some bugs, but all in all, it was an intense intellectual experience and very worthwhile."
