    "Professor Rose-Ackerman is amazing at leading class discussions, is very erudite and simply an expert. I enjoyed this seminar, and woke up in time for a 9:25 class willingly each time!",
    "Good EPE\/polisci seminar, that introduces the ethical challenges and functional issues that firms face when conducting business in foreign countries. You have the opportunity to follow a specific MNC and trace its interactions with these themes throughout the course. Biweekly reading responses and a final term paper comprise the course work, but definitely get started on the paper early because you will need to do a good amount of research. Professor Rose-Ackerman is warm and very helpful during office hours, and she is engaging in section. She will challenge your comments in class if they are not well supported so make sure you do the readings!",
    "Ethics & Multinational Business is focused on the ethical intersection between business and society. Multinational corporations have amassed incredible influence\/power in our society, and this course focuses what role that influence\/power should wield. Do corporations have societal obligations? Do we as a society have to regulate a corporation and to what extent? And how can we impose ethical standards on corporations operating in several states (each with different legal systems)? Given the importance of the material this class covered, I would certainly recommend it to another student (especially those interested in business\/politics\/philosophy that want to engage with economics in a manner that will feel relevant & applicable).",
    "This course really makes you think about morality and business practices. If you have a great group of classmates, the discussions can have an engaging amount of depth. I would've liked to walk away with more concrete ideas about how to apply these to sorts of moral arguments and reasoning to real life. When all my classmates and friends are CEOs of multinational corporations, they're going to be grappling with these very questions. Hopefully, this class makes you all the more prepared to make the right judgement."
