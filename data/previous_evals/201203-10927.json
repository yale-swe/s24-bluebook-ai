    "I would recommend this to students in humanities and social science who needs to historicize his\/her research",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend it to my fellow students, even if that person does not major in history. Because I think the class is not only instructive in terms of historical knowledge, but also helps a student in his\/her self-fulfillment. It is moral education at the same time.",
    "yes, I would recommend it.",
    "This is a good course to give you a well-fleshed-out exploration of the foundation of memory studies as it applies to history. This is not a good course to challenge and upset your notion of what history is and what it does beyond the rather trite understanding that history is a discipline that constructs narratives as well as discovers them, and that \"language frames everything.\"",
    "I would recommend this seminar to every student who works on oral history and testimonial literature.",
    "Winter takes the promiscuously used term of \"memory\" (now very in vogue in the humanities and social sciences) and erects some pretty strict boundaries around its use. Students are invited to challenge him on his takes, and to bring in their own research interests as example. You will find yourself jotting down every word Winter says--he has a way of putting the thorniest and densest concepts into eloquent, but commonly understood, english."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me a good understanding of memory, a key term for my research, from different approaches.",
    "I am very much interested in microhistory and the way that small entities encapsulate history. This class was extremely helpful and relevant. For instance, I used to use the word \"memory\" in historical studies very liberally. But this class has driven me to discipline the use of this word every time I try to use it in a historical paper. And this is very important, because it means that I am thinking more critically about what I study. This is just one example. This class was helpful to me not just in discipline methodology, but also in introducing me to a variety of subject matters in which history and memory play a role, and that opens doors to new subjects that I would like to study further in the future.",
    "As a student of literature, I found the discussions to be fruitful and fascinating, and the paper I produced is one that I am extremely proud of, but I cannot point to a great deal of readings that we did over the course of the semester that significantly expanded or contributed to my personal academic project--Arendt and Chartier probably being the two notable exceptions.",
    "A large portion of the primary sources that I work on are testimonial literature, travel accounts and other personal documents. This seminar helps me tremendously in examining this sources critically and see things from another prospective."
