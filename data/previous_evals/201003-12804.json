   "comments": [
    "Visual Thinking is the Yale equivalent of elementary school art class - through a series of projects (that are very loose and open for interpretation), you get to make whatever you want and call it art! Fun, but maybe not the most valuable.",
    "I would summarize it as an exciting artistic adventure and a delightful way to pass a semester.",
    "Definitely. Even if you're not an art majof but just like art in any form.",
    "It's basically whatever you want it to be. If you were really lazy it could be your fifth class gut, if you dedicated your time to it, it could turn into an outlet of expression. The class deserves respect even when it sometimes does not seem to since you're cutting out shapes and working with cardboard. I'd recommend it since you get to meet and work with a lot of interesting people.",
    "Visual Thinking is a requirement for all art majors and runs through many different ways of considering creation and vision. The class with Anna Betbeze was much better than I expected, considering evaluations by others who had taken the class. It's not highly demanding. You can become as engaged in the assignments as much as you want. Anna also emphasized working in groups, which was a good experience you might not get in any other art class. The media ranged from sculpture, to photography, to photoshop design, to film, to set design. I can say it really opened me up to media I would not have otherwise tried out- and some of these I really liked. This is a great class, especially (it seems) if taken with Anna.",
    "If you are not an art major but want to take an art class, take something else - Visual Thinking is probably not what you are looking for because it surveys different media and doesn't delve deeply into any one area. If you are an art major, then you have to take Visual Thinking. So I guess I'd recommend it. MAYBE YOU'LL LOVE IT!",
    "Definitely. It was super fun!",
    "It's a really easy class, and you get out of it what you put into it.It's pretty easy to half ass stuff if need be.",
    "Visual Thinking is a series of arts and crafts projects that \"challenge\" you to think in different ways, or really just to express your artistic impulse in different mediums. I would recommend this class, but really only with Anna Betbeze.",
    "Only take it if you have to. For me it was a blast from the past-this is essentially a high school art course. The projects are derivative and end up speaking more to the teacher's cool ideas than the students' creativity. But it isn't that time consuming!",
    "As this class is a requirement for the art major, if you're not an art major you probably won't be able to get in. But if you are an art major, you have no choice. For a required course, it can be very fun. Take it with Anna--she's great.",
    "As everyone knows, Visual Thinking is required for art majors, but that doesn't mean that non art majors should be intimidated. In fact, this course requires no technical skill, only \"visual thinking.\"",
    "If you're an art major, you have to take it, so try taking it with Anna! She's lovely. You get out of the class what you put into it."
