   "comments": [
    "A good introduction to issues in life history and reproductive biology, as well as the primary literature on many of these topics in humans, specifically, all from a perspective centered in evolutionary theory. Even if you are not directly interested in reproductive biology, it is great because these concepts are really important to evolutionary biology more generally (via fitness). And the course does a great job of tying detailed findings to the big picture and, in doing so, getting you to think \"evolutionarily.\"",
    "I would say that this class is helpful if you're ever interested in doing work with hormonal biomarkers in lab, and\/or if you're interested in human reproduction. I would definitely recommend this class to any student who fits into those categories. I would be unlikely to recommend this class to someone with no biology background - or even no endocrinology background, as it is assumed you have some understanding of the relevant systems. But, for most biological anthropology students interested in humans and primates, this would be a useful class."

   "comments": [
    "I am kind of surprised by how much this class generally affected how I think about evolution. Even though I don't expect to do much research on reproduction, I think it did provide something of framework for studying natural selection and in any species.",
    "I believe this course helped to prepare me for future lab work with biomarkers, and will allow me to better understand why and how different lab methods work. The knowledge gained from this course will also be relevant as I decide which direction to take my dissertation research, and as I prepare for my qualifying exams."
