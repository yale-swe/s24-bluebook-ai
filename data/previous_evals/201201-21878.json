   "comments": [
    "Check the course description. I'd recommend it.",
    "Great class that is pretty easy but will not be the same without Professor Mayhew. Not much reading and what there is is interesting.",
    "Mayhew is retiring from teaching undergrad lecture classes next year. So if you missed the boat, you missed the boat. But if Mayhew is teaching a seminar class, definitely take it with him. He is a living legend in the poli sci department, an excellent mentor, and a walking encyclopedia.",
    "If you are thinking about going into Political Science, then you should take this class.",
    "it isn't that much work and it is definitely interesting if you want to learn about american government and poli sci in a not too intimidating class. professor mayhew is really knowledgeable and smart and it was fun to listen to him talk.",
    "Definitely, great course to take if you are at all interested in american politics.",
    "Take it if you need a writing credit otherwise, don't",
    "I knew nothing about American politics before this class. At times, it was challenging but overall I really enjoyed the class.",
    "good class to take for a writing credit...forces you to learn about necessary politics even if you do not know much\/do not have a great interest in the field",
    "A little dull, but it's got some fun components. Take the writing intensive section if you can. Not too much work except for the papers which are relatively easy. Mayhew is boring, but extremely knowledgeable and prominent in his field.",
    "Don't take it WI unless you're a strong writer, don't take it if you're not doing it WI.",
    "Take it for the WI. Material is cool but a lot of it seems like fun facts. It definitely changed some of my views on politics and govt. structure though.",
    "If you're looking for a low-stress writing credit, you should consider this class. The amount of reading was relatively light and the topics we covered were interesting. You'll come out of the class with a greater ability to understand national elections. That being said, I found Professor Mayhew - while obviously brilliant - to be quite hard to follow along with during lecture. I had to look through my lecture notes after to really figure out what he was actually trying to say. All in all, it's not a hard class, but it definitely wasn't my most engaging or intellectually stimulating class at Yale, either.",
    "Great writing credit to take. Can get by only by attending sections. Though there is a final ID exam for which you need to know the readings. Despite the final, overall very manageable.",
    "Material is interesting. The lecture is boring. Do the readings, go to section, and write your papers in advance and you will do well.",
    "Take this course if you're really interested in elections! Otherwise, it can be a lot of information that may be hard to wade through. Definitely take it WI, though! It's the best way to go, even if you don't need the credit.",
    "This is a bad course. The material is not taught well even though it is interesting. Mayhew's lectures are very boring and the TAs are not good either.",
    "Great class to take for a writing credit. 2 papers and half of a final. The course load is very manageable, with one or two readings assigned each week. Lectures can be a bit dry, but most people don't even go.",
    "Take it for the writing credit. Don't take it if you aspire for a deeper understanding of poli sci.",
    "An overview of theories in policymaking, elections and party ideologies in the United States. Emphasis on historical accounts and trends. Must take for anyone interested in the field.",
    "There's not a lot of work for this class. The TA Peter is great.",
    "No.",
    "Yes, for a writing credit, make sure you get a good ta",
    "Only if it's the WR and if you can't fill your WR another way.",
    "Great way to knock out a WR credit. Not too much work and actually interesting if you are even somewhat interested in U.S. politics. You'll put in a fair amount of work before each of the two 8-12 page papers but that is about it. The short 1-hour final is actually pretty chill to study for.",
    "I would summarize it as a great intro class into the American two party system. Big emphasis on the senate. Take a writing-intensive section!!!",
    "This is a very standard political science class. Material covers basic (and somewhat boring) theories of how elections and the legislative process work. I took it for the WR credit, which I would recommend. The grading was somewhat harsher than I expected, but it's still not a bad way to get a writing credit - only 2 8-12 page papers (this makes up the majority of your grade) and then a shortened final with short answer questions but no essay (this was only about 20%). You can do well without attending the lectures, if that matters to you.",
    "Very easy class and probably the easiest way to get a WR credit if you don't like writing. Interesting material, especially during an election year, although lecture is pretty boring.",
    "I took PLSC 226 to gain a better understanding of American politics, but am not sure I would recommend it solely for that purpose. The lectures were a bit dry, and the course just did not seem that cohesive. As such, I'm just not sure how much I learned content-wise. If you do take the course, I recommend taking it WI - I think you're forced to integrate the ideas of the readings more than you would otherwise, and of course it helps you develop your writing skills. The course would also make a decent 5th class, as the work load is light.",
    "As one friend put it to me, the course was a series of \"fun facts.\" The course was certainly interesting, and I do have a better understanding of a lot of concepts related to party ideologies and policy making, but the course didn't change my life."
