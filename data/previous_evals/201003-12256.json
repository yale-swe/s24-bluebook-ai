   "comments": [
    "As far as theory classes go, it's not too bad. You have to like Bach a lot. It's a little frustrating because the grading can seem arbitrary and it's unclear how the grading system corresponds to letters...so I actually have NO idea what grade I'm going to get in this course. The other annoying thing is that the work is not distributed evenly throughout the course. Very little work at the beginning of the semester, and three major projects at the end, all crammed into a three and a half week period, which is rough. You may find yourself spending hours just trying to fix one passage of your fugue...and never really getting it right in the end. Sigh. In conclusion, I'm not really sure how I feel about the course. I don't know if my frustration comes from the course itself or from trying to write fugues.",
    "This class is the study of counterpoint through Bach. It is a pretty good class, a decent amount of work, and probably more of a focus on the technical nitty gritty and less on what makes Bach's compositions themselves better than contemporaneous others with equally well executed counterpoint than one would hope, but even so you'll learn a lot, and its a good class.",
    "It's a fun course although pretty challenging. It made me realize again how bad I am at music theory. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the compositions and lectures. I would definitely recommend. If you don't like Bach, take it anyway. You will see actual proof of why Bach was such a genius.",
    "It's a great class if you think counterpoint is an important skill and\/or that fugues are fun. You certainly learn a lot. And there's constant small assignments, so the workload is not too heavy, and the difficulty increase is incremental. I do recommend that you take some course that teaches you basic Species Counterpoint before you take this, though, or you'll flounder a bit in the beginning.Professor Harrison is quirky. He'll put you on the spot often, and it's hard to know what his reactions will be to your work. If you've had him before, or you're okay with always being a little unsure of things, this won't be too major a drawback.",
    "It's a good theory course to take if 1) you didn't mind the species counterpoint part of MUSI 209\/210 whatever it is now and 2) you like writing model compositions that will never, ever sound good compared to Bach. Prof. Harrison is somewhat quirky but engaging. The class assignments take a good deal of time but aren't horrible.",
    "If you ever wanted to learn to write a fugue, here's your chance! There's no other opportunity here to spend this much time writing fake Bach, so far as I know. Professor Harrison takes you from a counterpoint refresher all the way to a final three-part fugue. It's a wild ride.As with any class of this sort, it's very difficult for the professor to really inculcate an idiom into you in just 13 weeks. Still, I found I had to do a fair bit of outside work getting familiar with progressions and sounds until I felt I was ready to write my final assignment. Just a thought.Also, Professor Harrison's manner is occasionally condescending. I know it's usually supposed to be funny, but sometimes it rubbed me the wrong way. He's a nice guy at heart, I expect, but he puts on a semi-ironic 'expert' persona which I didn't think really added to the class.All of which is just to say - if you want to get better at this stuff, this is for you! I'm way better now at moving notes around, and that's what I wanted out of this class.",
    "If you want to learn the analysis and composition of counterpoint from one of the world experts on Bach - and how could you not? - then this is then class for you. You'll study a number of Bach pieces in great depth, and then you'll have the opportunity to compose your own invention and fugue in his style. Professor Harrison is a great instructor and tremendously helpful outside of class as well. Take this class!",
    "A very interesting and fun course. Composition assignments aren't exactly easy, though, so beware.",
    "This was my third 300s level theory, and I'd recommend it as the best way to fulfill the theory requirement. Non-majors who've taken 211 would enjoy it too, although they might consider credit\/D. Dan Harrison has this course down to a science - just the right constant flow of model composition and analysis assignments, gradually building in complexity until you are actually ready to write a fugues and write about fugues. Yeah, it's a lot of work, and he'll put your assignment up in front of everyone to critique it, and if you don't know what's going on in class you'll be embarrassed. But it's the only way to acquire some pretty necessary fluency in Baroque counterpoint. Harrison also has an adorable sense of humor. Lastly, it's just a lot of fun to appreciate fugues - especially in the last few classes, as he takes you on a tour through some of the major Bach organ fugues and then surveys post-Bach fugues, which is a nice chill reward at the end of the semester. Harrison promised us, and I can attest: you will have a moment or three of transcendent awe.",
    "Tonal Counterpoint is a demanding theory course. Take it if you are really willing to commit to it. It was an extremely rewarding experience for me."
