    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is doing research related to cancer, even if it is not on the biology of cancer. This class provided an overview of the history and important discoveries in cancer research. It also presented new areas of cancer research.",
    "Absolutely- a must-take class for anyone considering research involving cancer biology...",
    "A great overview of many components of human cancer. This course looks at the history of the disease and discusses how current understanding of the cancer has led to the available treatments today. This class also serves to shed light on how our knowledge of cancer will improve over time and the future that we have the power to direct and change.",
    "A good summary of cancer biology. It covers all of the basic areas you might be familiar with from undergraduate cell biology courses, but delves into some of them in more depth. I'd recommend if you are interested in cancer biology, although beware the final term paper, which is harder to do than it first sounds!"
