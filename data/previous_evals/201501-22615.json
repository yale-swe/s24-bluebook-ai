    "This class is what you make of it - I took it credit\/d and sailed through without learning anything, but I feel like some people really dove into their case studies and the material.",
    "This is a fantastic class that is underrated. Kalyvas is absolutely brilliant. If you have any interest in civil war or what is going on in the world today, take this class, and even if you don't -- you will learn so much that applies to things beyond the immediate subject matter.",
    "This class is a useful survey of the causes and characteristics of civil strife.",
    "Absolutely YES!! If you have the chance to take this course, take it!! Professor Kalyvas is absolutely incredible, and you will learn a ton. His lecturing style is engaging but serious; and the fact that his lectures aren't scripted at all makes a huge difference in the way the information gets across. His complete mastery of all the material he presents (and lots of material beyond that) is clear and makes everything he teaches even more interesting. I understand civil (and international) conflicts so much more deeply now. The material is interesting from so many points of view: political science, international relations, psychology, history, etc. Seriously, take it.",
    "In class you learn about every cause and dynamic that affect the people involved in civil strife. At home, you look at these topics through the lens of one specific war you've chosen to research heavily.",
    "An interesting class, but it does get somewhat repetitive. Might help be have a preexisting interest in the subject",
    "Violence and Civil Strife is fantastic! You will learn oodles about civil war theory and hundreds of civil war cases simply by listening to lecture. The weekly responses were painless, but effective - you will know know your civil war case from all possible angles. The course itself covers the causes, development, entrenchment, and conclusion of civil wars, with a particular focus on rebel governance, recruitment, and administration.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who likes to write very academic papers. There were a lot of them. In class we discussed general theories about violence and civil strife and each week we had to write a paper on how the theory related to the particular war we had chosen. This meant I read 5 or 6 books on my war throughout the semester which was a lot of time but really interesting. The best thing I learned from this class was how to know if I understand something, and usually it takes quite a lot of reading before I do.",
    "If you are looking for a theory-heavy political science course about theories about civil wars, this would be a solid class. I had hoped we would gain specific knowledge and learn about conflicts, and that very much didn't happen. It was a 40 person lecture in wlh, and part of our grade was supposedly based on participation- we each focused on one civil war case the whole semester, which was cool to be able to in theory become experts on the case, but it very much depends on how much work you want to put into it. 2 single-spaced page memos each week were our only assignments, and based on our own research, there was no assigned reading. That made the workload mane gable, but also had no idea what my grade was all semester because the memos were graded very leniently, but with few comments on how to improve. Prof kalyvas said he would get to know us over the semester and we would contribute with knowledge of our civil war cases, but only a few kids dominated the \"class discussion\" and he definitely didn't get to know all of us. We also spent 30+ mins at each class's start of his explaining international news, which felt like a waste of time. I felt that I didn't not yet much out of this class, and that we just did not learn very much because he didn't teach with any real urgency or explain things with much enthusiasm, and we weren't getting evaluated along the way. The final paper was to compare our case with a shadow case, which was interesting, but again had not very clear expectations. It ended up being a frustrating class, that I would not recommend.",
    "This class made me much more interested in the subject than I ever anticipated when first shopping for it. Props to the professor and the TF. Also, the weekly assignments may seem tedious, but they really are helpful and quite manageable."
