   "comments": [
    "This is a really enjoyable class. We spent the whole semester working on and extending a single project, so by the end, you actually have something nontrivial. Much, much less work than Professor Ford's other class, operating systems. Indeed, this class is pretty chill while still quite interesting.",
    "Building Decentralized Systems is a great course -- the problem sets for the course build on each other, which gives you great experience for software development. The problem sets are also a lot of fun -- you build a decentralized chat client with a number of features that is supposed to interoperate with all other students' implementations, which is a cool experience. The only disappointing aspect from our year is that we only had three psets (the last two were cancelled), and the topics taught at the end of the course weren't presented in as much depth as the topics taught at the beginning of the course.",
    "I definitely recommend this class, together with Computer Networks.",
    "Really fun course on a diverse set of topics. Not terribly organized or integrated, but Ford is a great lecturer and the psets are fun.",
    "This class is pretty fun. Relatively straightforward average CS workload. Decent way to get some C++ experience if you take the time to code using best practices. Note that your code won't be assessed for memory leaks, etc., like it was during 323.Make good design decisions early in the course so that you can continue to implement future portions of the project, rather than just adding legs to a dog and calling it an octopus.Overall, an interesting, straightforward class. If there's something else you're dying to take though, I'd choose the other over this one.",
    "This is a good class. The first half is hard, and the second half would be hard if there were psets as planned. The topics are interesting, and the presence of a final project, rather than a final test, is key.",
    "Take it; this is a pretty good course with a light workload (especially if there are only 3 problem sets). Walks you through lots of networks-based systems (BitTorrent, Chord, Tor), cryptography (Diffie-Helman, BitCoin), CDNs and recommendation systems. It's pretty much the best survey of practical network-based programming problems out there. Bryan Ford is a good lecturer, and while he goes on tangents, PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS! You'll get more out of it. Lots of overlap with Computer Networks though.",
    "The class was very OK. Since Ford canceled 2 of the five assignments it was really not anunbearable amount of work (the first three assignments did require a significant chunk of time, however). The concepts that you cover in class are generally interesting, but there was no incentive whatsoever to pay attention after the midterm.",
    "An interesting and fun elective to take. You build a simple peer to peer chatting system and enhance it with functionality like file sharing etc. There is also a fun final project at the end that would be as much work as you decide to put in. Besides the labs and the final project, there is one midterm that contributes toward the grade.The course ended up being less work than advertised since two of the five labs ended up being cancelled. The first half of the course required a lot more work than the second half due to the labs getting cancelled. Overall, it was a good CS elective that was both fun and not too much work.",
    "The assignments in this class are very interesting because they are focused on incrementally building a chat client that will culminate in a final project at the end of the semester. I believe I came out of the class with a strong understanding of networks and decentralized systems.",
    "Definitely worth it, and I learned a lot. Only issue is you'll need to be patient as the class can be inconsistent in terms of work level, responsiveness, and it does get a teeny bit repetitive at the end. Overall, very good class.",
    "Good and fun course that requires some programming but is not overly difficult.",
    "I highly recommend the class. Ford is a really engaging lecturer and I think the subject matter is super cool.If you're looking for super structured, its not perfect. He'll jump around a bit in lecture, and we didnt end up getting all the assignments he said we would. But its not that important, because theres no final (just a not too bad midterm and then coding projects), so just enjoy learning the stuff during the lectures.I think the material was really interesting to work with, and the projects you do are really cool.Definitely recommend.",
    "Interesting lectures covering very different and current topics. The labs are fun and worthy doing.",
    "Yes, great elective with not too much work (this class is very front-loaded). If you've already taken a crypto class and\/or a networks class, a lot of the material might feel repetitive, but if not, the assignments and the final project are really enjoyable and satisfying without being too hard to manage.",
    "Great course with probably the most interesting and applicable topics of most electives offered at Yale. Professor Ford does a terrific job teaching the material but he tends to disappear around half way through the semester and stop assigning problem sets. There is not a lot of guidance for the final project either so it could be difficult to determine what is expected. Otherwise the class is quite enjoyable.",
    "An interesting class that covers useful information, while not being that hard. The course seemed to be graded too easily though (everyone got 100's on the assignments) which means it's hard to differentiate students and final grades will probably be arbitrary.",
    "A great course for learning decentralized systems and a chance to build out a pretty cool app for chatting. You learn to work with GUIs and also build on previous code, so the final product is more impressive."
