    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Teaching Fellow was Jonathan Sites.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan is an outstanding TF. He was always and immediately responsive to my questions, concerns. His comments on my papers #1 and #2 were very helpful. Without being overly directive, his evaluations pointed the way for me to understand how to focus and create a more effective final outcome. He was brilliant as a section leader. He framed the thesis for the discussion, then encouraged and achieved full participation from the section members. Dan is one of only two TFs in my experience that I rate a \"10\" out of a possible \"10\". I speak for several of the section members who felt that Dan performed at the level of a full professor, well above a doctoral candidate. His knowledge of the material was comprehensive, detailed, unfailingly illustrative of the point at hand.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0My teaching fellow was Jonathan Smith. He was truly the best teaching fellow I have had while at YDS. He provided great insight to the material and encouraged participation.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0First, Daniel was superb in his function as Teaching Fellow. His ambitious, energetic and deep understanding of the material is truly what makes Yale what it is.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0My TF was not actually Daniel - it was Jonathan. But his name wasn't listed and I wasn't allowed to submit this without checking a TF box.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0He is good, both personally and academically. His attitude is excellent, and I was learned from him a lot.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0I clicked this option only because the system would not let me submit it without it. But my TA was Jonathan Sites.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0My teaching fellow for sections was Jonathan Sites, not Daniel Bohac. Jonathan did an excellentjob of encouraging and moderating spirited dialog and leading a diverse group of learners deeper into the topics at hand. As a new TA, he was honest about what he didn't know, but also very knowledgeable in the arenas where he had studied, which allowed him to facilitate sections with the authority of a fellow inquirer.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan was always exceptionally well prepared and ready to improvise in class. He had a knack for breakign down complex topics and making teaching analogies on the spot. He is a natural teacher. He negotiated a particularly contentious section with a colleague who became upset with some language that was being used with grace and maturity. I am thankful for encountered him and it was an honor to be in his section. I look forward to seeing where his vocation will take him and know he will in dramatic ways to our world that deeply needs passion and talent like his.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan was an excellent TF who had a great way of leading class discussions and encouraging students in his section to engage with the material.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0knowledgeable and passionate about his subject matter and teaching. Very engaged and available. I must say he makes NT fun to learn.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Strengths: Really knew the material. Very confident presentation of material. Involved\/engaged everyone in section. Written comments very helpful. Gave clear and helpful instruction on assignments. Weaknesses: None",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0My tea hint fellow was Johnathan Sites",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0he is the best and most pedagogically gifted TF i've had at yale. and, finally, a TF who actually has a mastery of the materials. he is a \"keeper\" in terms of future YDS professors.great temperament too. i usually despise sections. i always looked forward to attending his section.he is exceptional!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Actually, my TF was Jonathan, but his name isn't on here, so I had to select Daniel. Also, I am declining the next question so as not to throw off any statistics. Jonathan was fantastic! Loved having him as my TF.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0He made my course. Dan is outstanding. I was a bit worried about having discussion section on Friday mornings...he made each and every one of those meetings interesting and engaging. He has a deep love for the material and conveys that to his students. He was always quick to get back to me via e-mail and was great in our one-on-one meeting about the last paper. Dan made this one of my favorite courses this at YDS.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan is an exceptional teacher. He welcomes questions, and encourages thinking. He facilitates discussions and handles occasional 'difficulties' with an ease that allows the class to continue learning. THAT is a gift. He can keep a section interesting - even when all present are exhausted. His comments on my papers were informative and helpful. Dan is one of the highest caliber Teaching Fellows I have had. In any class. And he made himself available very frequently - as well as responded to email questions and concerns very promptly. He made an exceptional class even better. Thank you!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0(Jonathan was my TF. The course evaluation does not include him as an option, nor will it let me submit my evaluation without checking the box for a TF)",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan is the best T.A. I have ever had, at Yale and elsewhere. He is very knowledgeable and has a clear enthusiasm for his studies, which carries into the classroom. He is also incredibly kind, helpful, reliable, and tuned-in to what is going on his discussion sections and what his students need in order to learn well.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Daniel was not my Teaching Fellow, but the oce system forced me to select one.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Mine was Johnathan Sites. He was clear but had a hard time running conversation. I think with a bit more experience he will be great",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0My teaching fellow was JONATHAN SITES. (But for some reason it doesn't allow me to choose him above. I really enjoyed our sections, Jonathan is great!! Besides learning a lot in section, his comments on my papers have been very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Daniel has no weaknesses. He was a perfect TA and is ready to have his own class. Don't let Daniel slip away after he graduates. It's clear he has much to offer students and the academy. He had brilliant control over the classroom- he encouraged participation, kept conversation on track to explore the points we needed to learn, paused when something unexpected needed to be discussed and went more in depth whenever possible. My only regret was that time did not permit more of his personal insights. I loved learning from him and look forward to seeing what's in store for his career.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan is a great TF. He is funny, and reveals himself to be a great motivator. He is great at explaining things, and makes students feel that their contribution is valued. For a TF, he shows that he has above-average knowledge of his field. He grades assignments on a timely manner, and make valuable comments on them. Frankly, I believe that YDS should give him a chance to be a lecturer (maybe in the summer for now). He is already a great assset for YDS.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0My Teaching Fellow was actually Jonathan Sites. Johnathan was helpful, clear about what was expected and always gave helpful feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0There's a glitch on this site. Daniel was not my TF; Jonathan Sites was, but his name doesn't appear on this interface. Jonathan did an excellent job navigating tough waters with our section. We never gave him a particularly hard time, but he did have to figure out how to honor divergent voices in the class (i.e., the more radical voices who valued feminist\/queer\/otherwise contextual interpretation, vs. those who were more historically-critically-minded). He did this with grace. He always had a tight agenda during section, and facilitated rich discussion. Section was enjoyable with him.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan was awesome!!! No complaints",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0My teaching fellow was Jonathan Sites, who was wonderful but was not listed as an option here.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Daniel was an excellent TF. He made our sections lively yet focused and full of learning. I also greatly appreciated his input and comments on my writing. This helped me craft (what I hope was) a strong exegesis, as well as helped me identify in the exam where I strayed and can improve. I am VERY hopeful to have Daniel next semester as a TF for Intro to NT 2!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0very good",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0I was not in Dan's section",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Daniel was not my teaching fellow, but his was the only name available to check.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Awesome TF. Great at leading section, amazingly helpful at helping prepare for tests and papers. Great at giving feedback.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Unfortunately, this survey would not let me respond to the TF I had. I did not have Daniel.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Daniel was not my TA so I answered the following questions by placing my TA's name in the box-Jonathan Stiles. I would rank Jonathan's overall performance as outstanding",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0I did not have Daniel Bohac as my TF. I had Jonathan Sites.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Friday sections with Dan was the highlight of my week. His classes were fascinating and he brought such enthusiasm and insight to all class material. He is a gifted teacher.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0I love Dan! He is smart, hilarious, and a highly effective instructor. I really enjoyed him as a TF.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan was awesome. He made section engaging and interesting and added to what we were learning in lectures and readings.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan Bohac is well on his way to being a gifted teacher - enthusiastic, compassionate, agile on his feet in seminar, descriptive in his oral and written feedback on student work are all appreciated! I also want to highlight one particular instance in our section with which Dan handled with maturity and skill: the Jesus Seminar discussion. One student voiced objection to the levity of tone in the discussion of this aspect of New Testament studies. Dan respectfully entered into dialog with a student who could have become belligerent. He guided the discussion in a different and in a constructive manner. It was a moment of real testing of Dan's skill and, in my opinion, he passed with flying colors!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan is one of the best teaching fellows I've had the privilege to work with at YDS. He engaged and led the discussions with few difficulties with clearly a great amount of care and work in preparing for each session. He engaged students throughout the semester and was always engaging\/personable.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Daniel crafted analogies, discussion exercises, and special worksheets to help everyone understand the material better. He did a good job accounting for religious difference within the room. When one student started crying because she felt like sacred text was being disrespected, I thought Daniel handled things really well. He set aside his exercise for the day and opened up the room to a more personal discussion of how students \"know\" Jesus. I will always remember that class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Great TF, really insightful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0I had Jonathan Sites, not Daniel, but his name is not available to choose. Jonathan was a wonderful TA. He was clearly invested in helping us do well in the course.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Daniel was not my teaching fellow, but the survey would not submit without selecting a teaching fellow. I will submit the alternate form for Jonathan."

    "Jonathan showed complete knowledge of the subjects. And while being perhaps the youngest person in the group, he earned our respect and leadership of the group. He was tactful in allowing everyone a voice while not allowing anyone to over take the conversations. We were a group that included some older and very knowledgeable individuals, but Jonathan showed his gentle yet firm leadership, steering the group to fruitful conversations.",
    "Jonathan was a fantastic TF whose energy was greatly appreciated in the Friday morning section. He did an excellent job of setting a good tone for section discussions in which disagreement and debate could occur, though always in a charitable way.",
    "excellent discussion and material covered. excellent energy. good preparation of material.",
    "Super nice. Had difficulty in getting information across to us.",
    "Jonathan was great at encouraging discussion and making people feel comfortable. He was also quite knowledgeable and his comments on my written work were very helpful and appropriate. He was very approachable. I wish he was going to be a TA for the second half of the class."
