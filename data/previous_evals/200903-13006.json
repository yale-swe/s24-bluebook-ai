    "Though I think they increased the workload slightly in response to previous evaluations, this is still about as easy a language class as you can find at Yale. Seemaji and Swapnaji are both good teachers. You can get an A in this class with fairly minimal work (the unit quizzes every Friday are the bulk of the studying you'll have to do), but unless you are somewhat proactive you can also get through the entire semester without learning very much.",
    "A great class. Its really interesting and a lot of fun. I enjoy going to class and I feel like I've learned a lot of Hindi.",
    "YESSSSSSS, it was a really fun class. The professors are really nice, it's an easy language to pick up, AND we get to watch cute songs and movies while learning the language at the same time!",
    "Hindi is an extremely interesting language, and this class gives a great introduction to its basics. By the end of the semester, you will be able to pick out Hindi phrases in a movie and even communicate on a basic level. The workload is very manageable, especially when compared to other language courses, and the assessments are fair and not stressful. Overall, I would certainly recommend this course!",
    "Yes, it's fun and the instructors are very nice.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn Hindi more than just as an idle wish. It is easy to fall behind if you slack on studying in one particular week.",
    "Absolutely. A great language, a great teacher, and a caring and non-stressful environment. What more do you want?"
