   "comments": [
    "PLEASE TAKE IT! It is one of the most thought-provoking courses I have ever enrolled in. Sure, the reading is long, and sometimes abstruse, and sometimes just plain incomprehensible, but the professor does a phenomenal job of steering classroom discussions, so that the meanings behind the readings slowly come out.It really changes your view of the world, especially by making you doubt everything that the media spews out into the world. I recommend it!",
    "Oil and Empire is a class that will make you think differently about everything you seemed sure about. I liked that about the course because it makes you challenge information that you previously would take at face value. You have to be prepared to do the reading, because theres no way around it. If you are interested in the Middle East and its modern history, this class is definitely recommended.",
    "I would recommend it full heartedly regardless of interest in the Middle East. I learned about so much more than just a region; both within the topic and how to research, critically read, etc., critical skills for future semesters.",
    "HIST 042 is a history class about how oil impacts the narratives of different countries. It is very interesting to learn about because it applies to everyday life. Also, this class challenges your views and makes you really think about oil and how it affects the world around us. HIST 042 is a great class to take as a freshman because it teaches you skills that you will use in the future, on different projects. It is a challenging course, but the professor is always available and willing to help you with anything. It is also a small class, so you get into really good conversations about the reading.",
    "This is a great course. You'll learn a ton about the way the United States maintains its oil supply across the World, and it's really eye-opening. It requires a lot of reading, but nothing unmanageable. It's by far my favorite class I took this semester, and a must-take for anyone who wants to learn more about oil's influence on the world.",
    "This course has changed the way I look at the world and think about current events. It is an incredible survey of the history of oil, neoliberalism, and the effect of imperial powers such as the United States on oil-rich areas. The course does entail a heavy workload - but it is absolutely worth it.",
    "Oil and Empire was exactly what it sounds like - an analysis of the history of oil and empire and the interconnectivity of the two topics. No matter what grade I get, I would never have traded this course for another, as the things I learned could not have been learned anywhere else. Our class became a family, and Professor Bsheer is unlike any academic that I have ever come across. I could see Oil and Empire having a very long waiting list next year, and I am just glad that I got to take it this year. I had seniors saying that they wanted to take the course, and our entire freshman class is familiar with it because of how much the eighteen in the course loved it. I don't want to be dramatic, but I really think that Oil and Empire changed my life. I am now even considering majoring in history because of it.",
    "I would recommend this class to all future students.",
    "Yes, because of the reasons mentioned above.",
    "This class destroyed my sense of the United States as a force acting for justice around the world. Nothing exposes the embarrassing anti-democratic underside of US foreign policy like an exploration of the history of US oil interests.",
    "While Oil and Empire is a history course, it also involves lots of interesting discussion of political science, economics and even current events. Aside from the fascinating subject matter, it was a great way to develop quite sophisticated writing and research skills. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this course. Take anything Professor Bsheer offers.",
    "This course was incredible, although difficult. We read a lot of dense materials that really changed the way I viewed the world, and the discussions with the other students and professor were fantastic. There is a fairly considerable amount of both reading and writing: the weekly readings are fairly difficult and the end of term paper is expected to be well researched and detailed. Every week was fascinating, and completely worth the work. I'd recommend this course for anyone, history major or not, and think anyone will enjoy it."
