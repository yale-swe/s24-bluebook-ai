   "comments": [
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would not recommend that a non-CBB student take this class. The class is very unorganized and not helpful in terms of material learned.",
    "I would highly discourage everyone from taking the class as is, especially non-computationally-focused students. The majority of the material was not useful or well-communicated. Most of the professors and TAs (except Corey), communicated (unconsciously or not) that they did not care about teaching a quality course. As a result, the students were apathetic and had no reason to put in any effort, either. If you're looking for a solid introduction to how bioinformaticists think and how to apply informatics ideas to biological problems, you will be sorely disappointed.",
    "I'd recommend 752; it was a very nice overview of computational techniques applied to questions in biology. There is some programming entailed, so you should probably know at least some basic scripting.",
    "I would recommend the class for someone interested in getting introduced to basic concepts in CBB.",
    "I will recommend it if he\/she would like to have an overview of the field.",
    "I would recommend it to any CBB student (see responses to 1+2)",
    "Only if you have advanced knowledge of computer science and math through linear algebra and differential equations. The course can get very technical, but the broader concepts are interesting.",
    "Good course for an overview of Bioinformatics and Methods"

   "comments": [
    "this is a required course and I think it will help me understand research.",
    "It didn't. I expected to learn useful bioinformatic methods to help with my wet lab research, and instead, I felt like I lost knowledge by not having the time I spent in class to read journal papers or do lab work.",
    "This course is outside of my discipline and I was hoping that it would prove useful background of a field that I will likely interact with in the future, but this was not the case.",
    "The papers we read each week as part of the discussion section were very good, and the programming assignments provided nice grounds for practice in scripting. The early sections on alignment constitute material that every bioinformatician should know. Given how comprehensive the course really was, it was nice in that it enabled the student to know what is out there.",
    "It accelerated my exposure to a broad category of topics relevant in CBB. They contributed to my research by providing the fundamental elements to some of the methods I'm using and will be using in the future.",
    "It provides a toolbox for bioinformatics. Even though is is non-exhaustive, it serves as a good starting point.",
    "I do not yet have a dissertation\/research, but I'm sure the skills and knowledge I gained in this course will prove to be helpful in the future.",
    "I gained a good grasp of bioinformatics concepts, if not the technical details, so I'm happy that I fulfilled my goals for taking the course. I do not use bioinformatics in my research but may in the future.",
    "Gained better understanding of statistical techniques"
