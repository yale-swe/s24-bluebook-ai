    "1- I think there could be a bit more readings. Those that were provided were helpful.3- The personal reflection journals did not always help me grasp the concept presented that day.9- The field trip planning and execution was a great exercise in leadership.",
    "The field trip to Washington, DC allowed the students to learn about the work conducted by different organizations and institutions and to engage in really interesting conversations with leaders from different environmental projects and organizations. Being able to have these conversations and to learn from others' experiences help me to reflect about the importance of being a leader and\/or member of a team and how these roles can really influence the outcome of a project or program."

    "Being able to understand how an organization works and different leading roles by working as an organization inside the class to organize the field trip. The experience of organizing the field trip, having regular meetings and following up the tasks was helpful to learn more about each person's working style and leadership roles. The field trip was a very valuable experience.",
    "Great teaching, great content, excellent opportunity to practice teamwork skills and meet brilliant and nice people",
    "The professor! He has been one of the most delightful professors to study under for his gifted characteristics of pleasantness, kindness, approachability, insightfulness, and care.",
    "The concepts of systems thinking is an interdisciplinary tool, and Prof. Oliver does a fantastic job on teaching how to understand and use this tool. The student is then left to apply the framework to its analysis and even in other classes. My understanding and enjoyment of my agriculture and economics class was enhanced by the use of systems thinking.Secondly, the experience of making an organization to travel to Washington DC and meet with great leaders from the environmental sphere in the NGO, private and governmental areas was a memorable experience filled with life lessons."

I even once asked him to write a letter of recommendation for me with very short notice and he did so without any trouble. He is very laid back, and that creates a great atmosphere in the classroom that is very conducive to learning. For these reasons and more, i think Professor Oliver is one of F&ES's greatest assets.",
