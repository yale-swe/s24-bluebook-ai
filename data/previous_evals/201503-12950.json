   "comments": [
    "A great course for general understanding of music theory. I would suggest that anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of music, even if they don't plan on taking any higher level courses, to take this class.",
    "I absolutely loved this class! Would highly recommend for those very interested in music and\/or composition, & if you can, definitely take with Quinn.",
    "This is an amazing course. Take it with Ian Quinn if possible!",
    "Take it!!",
    "I think that the course had a fairly steep learning curve, but this was fairly advertised to prospective students, and the frequent quizzes for the first part of the class greatly helped in the latter part. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of tonal music.",
    "Music major prerequisites aside, I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in gaining a much deeper understanding of music theory than they previously had. Overall, this course was an interesting, thorough introduction to many aspects of music theory that go beyond that of a high school theory course. I would further recommend this to any student interested in learning to write music, though I would advise them that it is not an instruction in writing per se."
