    "Wonderful course--so fascinating! It was always enjoyable and never felt like a burden or a lot of work. Michael Frame is amazing--not only taught about math, but many lessons about life. So glad I was able to take a class with him before graduating.",
    "Why not?",
    "Yes. Take it. Though I wish I utilized the tutor for a few problem sets so I recommend going if you feel unsure. Midterm is easy. Problem sets were often not.",
    "Take this class if you want a not-too-hard, somewhat boring QR credit. Maybe not the most useful or applicable, but pretty easy and weirdly satisfying. Also, Frame is a god. Although this class could be different if Frame isn't teaching it anymore.",
    "For someone looking for a fun way to get a QR this is a really great class. It is fun and very visual and pretty easy to keep up with.",
    "I think this class has a really interesting topic and the teacher is awesome, but it is a little boring, especially when things start getting conceptually more difficult because then most people stop paying attention.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a challenge at times, but absolutely manageable. Both the midterm and final are open notes, and there are only 10 problem sets for the course.",
    "Definitely take it, while Michael Frame is still teaching it. This will probably be one of the best classes you take at Yale.",
    "I took it for a QR credit. Sort of wacky. But Michael Frame is delightful and charming and wonderful. Weekly problem sets, midterm, final. Make sure to take it with friends.",
    "Workload very manageable but lectures get a bit boring and are crucial to understanding the material. Only 2 tests: midterm and final and weekly homework.",
    "Do not take this class looking for an easy QR. (Check out planets and stars!!!). Take this class ONLY if you are genuinely interested in learning about fractals, and if you like (or at least don't hate) math.",
    "Seriously, great course. Don't worry about the math -- if you can take a log you'll do fine",
    "im not really sure. it was ok. and somewhat interesting. but not as much as an easy class as it is often made out to be. i think take it if you are genuinely interesting because a cacl class or another QR might be easier\/better.",
    "If Professor Frame teaches it again, I highly recommend this course. To be honest, I took this class more because of Professor Frame than because of fractals, but I was not disappointed on either level. Everything you may have heard about Professor Frame is true - he is brilliant, incredibly caring, and so talented at explaining complicated things as simply as possible. Also, one of the best parts of the course was the \"Mandelbrot stories\" he would tell at the end of each class; I often thought this class should be retitled \"Fractal geometry andamazing life lessons.\"Fractals themselves are also way cooler than I even imagined; my mind was blown several times this semester. This course was designed for non-math, non-science people, which I think is a plus - everything was made very accessible - although if you're really into the nitty-gritty stuff of math, you should consider taking the higher level fractals course; the relative shallowness of this course may disappoint you. The workload was also very very light; I spent maybe 20-40 minutes per week on the problem sets. That being said, this is not a gut course and you do have understand the concepts to do well (don't be fooled by the \"open note\" policy for the exams; you still need to study).",
    "Professor Frame is simply an inspiration -- the best lecturer I've ever seen, and more willing than almost any other professor I've encountered at Yale to dive right in to the timely, and exciting, interdisciplinary applications of the subject he\/she teaches. What a humane, thoughtful, funny, passionate, brilliant teacher. With no intention of taking additional math classes at Yale, I nonetheless leave Fractal Geometry with more respect, and perhaps more appreciation, for the deep and beautiful ideas and principles at work in higher math.",
    "YES! TAKE IT! Math 190 is a great course for one to see the fun side of Math, and the intricate ways in which it is tied to a lot of things around us. Further, Prof. Frame is clearly one of the greatest Professors you'll have. He's a wonderful person in heart and mind. Honestly, I took the partly because I just wanted to take a class with Prof. Frame. Further, his life lessons are priceless.",
    "This is definitely not a gut class. While the level of math needed may be easy, the concepts are difficult to grasp. Overall though, a good course. Michael Frame is a wonderful professor.",
    "Fractals is a great class for a non-science major. The workload is not too heavy, lecture is lively with Frame, and the material is diverse. Some of the material is simple and some is pretty complex, but Frame does a great job of covering it all. I would definitely recommend taking the class because you get to learn from a pioneer in the field of fractal geometry, who also happens to be hilarious. He's both brilliant and has a fantastic sense of humor, which is pretty rare for a professor, especially one in a math class. I really can't say enough about how awesome Frame truly is! Take it!",
    "A basic covering of a lot of ideas in fractal geometry. It was wonderful, not to difficult but still interesting. And Frame is truly wonderful.",
    "Professor Frame is trying to give a one semester introduction to a field that him and Mandelbrot devoted their lives to, and as a result of this I found it difficult to engage in the majority of the material. It was generally easy to grasp each concept, but I found it frustrating to not know where the material was coming from or what it's ultimate application was. This is the nature of any intro math course, but be prepared for Fractals to not be quite as cool as it sounds.",
    "The math really isn't hard and a lot of the lecture doesn't end up being reflected in tests or hw, usually lectures are just explanations of fractals in the real world. Take the class if you're interested.",
    "A great class, in a subject of Math that is interesting and not too well known.",
    "I would absolutely 100 percent recommend this class. The material is probably completely new, but Frame is the greatest teacher on Earth. He makes this class. The problem sets are very doable, and the tests were very fair and open notes. But more so than anything, if you have the chance to take this class with Frame you undoubtedly should. He loves what he does, and he loves teaching even more.",
    "This class is a little deceiving. It seems like it will be an easy QR, but took me a ton of time and effort, though I managed to do well in it in the end. Professor Frame is a saint, though, so if anything, take it just to get to know this amazing man- and be sure to go to office hours as much as you can to spend time with hime",
    "If Michael Frame is teaching this class, take it. He is just the best. If he's not teaching this class, it's also probably worth taking. It's a great way to fulfill a QR and the information is cool.",
    "Learn the basics of Fractal Geometry without needing much mathematical background. The course is interesting and not difficult. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend Fractal Geometry. You will discover a new way of thinking about mathematics and approaching problems. Don't expect to be able to construct a coherent thread through all of the topics, but enjoy each on its own and make sure you fully understand each problem set.",
    "A must-take.",
    "If you really think that fractals are interesting, then you will love this class. The math isn't complicated but some of the concepts are a little more difficult to wrap your mind around. I think it can be very fun at times, and Professor Frame makes it worth it, but at the same time if you don't like or understand math it can be very exhausting.",
    "Yes, this is a great QR class! The material is interesting, Frame is so kind with a great sense of humor, and the workload is reasonable. It is worth going to lectures and paying attention, even if just for the jokes and Mandelbrot stories.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 190. I learned so much about an interesting topic I knew little to nothing about before taking the course, and Professor Frame is one of the best professors I\u0092ve ever had.",
    "Take this class only if you have an express interest in fractal geometry, and then, only if Frame is teaching it.",
    "Math 190 is a fairly interesting class and definitely not the gut class some people believe it to be. Lecture was a little dry at times but overall, interesting subject material. Michael Frame is a wonderful professor and human being. He's very inspiring and he'll definitely be missed. Take this class only if you're really interested in the material.",
    "Yes. Professor Frame is the best.",
    "Yes I definitely would! The class didn't measure what you memorized (i.e. the formulas and the processes) but it focused on you actually understaning the concepts and how to problem solve.",
    "Take it if you have an actual interest in fractals. If you take it just to fill the requirement, you'll get through, but you'll probably end up hating the topic.",
    "It's easy if you can pay attention.",
    "If this class is offered (with Michael Frame teaching), TAKE IT. It's unbelievably well-taught introduction to what is certainly one of the most groundbreaking branches of science and mathematics in the last century. I completely recommend this course and not only for a QR credit. I took it for that reason as a senior, and I'm incredibly glad that I did. I'd never have actually taken this class otherwise, and what a shame that would have been. And make sure to write down Professor Frame's jokes. It's nice to stumble upon them while studying for the exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to math majors and non-math majors alike.",
    "I'm not sure I'd recommend it from a teacher less wonderful than Frame. The material in and of itself is only interesting up to a point. However, it's a manageable - though not gutty! - QR, something incredibly useful if you're not a math person. If Frame is teaching, though, go for it.",
    "The class, so I was told, is one for humanities major to get rid of a QR credit. Well -- it's certainly no CALC 120, but I wouldn't call it a gut class, either, what with the content we cover really complex and, often, difficult. The workload is indeed minimal, though -- problem sets go quick, and the only two exams are a midterm and final.",
    "Basically, you learn what fractals are and learn about how to make them and interpret them. I would recommend the class.",
    "This course was a chance to imagine yourself in the world of mathematicians, even if you don't like math much. Prof. Frame is a fantastic human being, and he sneaks in some life lessons along with the course material. Also, fractals are mind-blowing.",
    "The content is really interesting and so cool. It was great to have those moments in class. Because it was simplified for non-math people, a lot of the explanations were cut out which makes it more difficult for people like me that need to know how and why things work the way they do.",
    "Fractal is amazing. It's the sort of thing you would never be able to learn, or have the interest in learning, outside of Yale \u0097\u00a0but it can actually change the way you look at the world. Frame's kindness, commitment to his students, and dedication to the field are well-known; his stories and jokes are funny and heartwarming; and the math itself is simple yet interesting enough to be worth it. Go to his office hours and get to know him!",
    "This course satisfied what I wanted from a QR credit- not a lot of stress and a manageable work load. Professor Frame is an incredible person and his tidbits on life, mortality, and cats made my day! While lecture could be rather boring and the concepts difficult to understand, Frame made it all worthwhile. Seeing as the course will unfortunately be taught by someone else, I'm not so sure I would recommend it as the material itself was not that interesting. Frame really made the class.",
    "I thoroughly recommend this class. Even though I am not a math person, Professor Frame made it very easy to follow and the material was genuinely very interesting. Learning about the application of Fractals and just about Professor Frame's outlook on life made it a class that found myself looking forward to. Just a final recommendation though: yes, the material was interesting, but it was Professor Frame who made the class what it is.",
    "Learn about fractals, what they are, their applications (although not how to use them in real world examples) and the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. This is a pretty interesting albeit specialized topic. It was very cool to see the real world uses of fractals, such as in virtual world creation, but like said earlier you're just learning the basics and don't get too involved in that, so it does feel a little pointless. However, it was a great qr credit and frame is a great teacher, so I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes. I highly recommend this course to any student. Whether you want to major in the maths\/sciences or in the humanities, this course will be engaging and fun. The work is not extremely difficult, and there is not a huge volume of it, but the course is interesting because the concepts are challenging and offer you a whole world of mathematics to explore if you choose. It's not just a study of self-similar shapes--the course moves well beyond that. It includes interesting applications of fractals to modern science, technology,finance, and many other fields as well. To get to study Fractal Geometry in the place where it was founded by Benoit Mandlebrot is an incredible opportunity, as is the opportunity to learn from Professor Frame who is an incredible teacher and a wonderful person. Frame will introduce you to a world he loves--the world of fractals and I think anyone taking the course cannot help but be intrigued by a topic that the professor is so passionate about.",
    "Highly recommended. The material is quite fascinating, and getting to play around with shapes is a lot of fun. Michael Frame is one of the best math teachers I have ever had.",
    "It's a crime that this course has not been put on open courses because every one should be able to enjoy this absolute gem. Fractals are a fascinating new field of math that needs much more research to be fully understood. Frame is better than the hype, a sage of both math and life. Not a gut, not a bore, and definitively not something you can pass up with Frame.Here's a great article about the class and Frame's story:http:\/\/www.yaledailynews.com\/news\/2011\/nov\/08\/curious-geometries\/",
    "I took fractals to fulfill my QR requirement. I didn't particularly enjoy the material -- I'm still not entirely sure why fractals are important to life, and when I'll ever encounter them after this class. It was also not ultimately an easy class, though it seems like it will be after the first few lectures and the first problem set. So it was a lot of work to put in for not a lot of gain. That being said, having Michael Frame as a professor made EVERYTHING worth it. He is the sweetest man alive and is interesting to listen to, and spends time to make sure people feel solid on the material.",
    "YES, please take take take this course even if you have no interest in math. You won't regret it and you will walk out of the class with a completely new perspective of the world",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend MATH 190 for the wide ranging applications and fascinating areas covered in the subject material.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are not a math\/QR person, and you are looking for a QR credit that does not involve traditional mathematical processes. I enjoyed this class because you learn completely different ways of looking at or analyzing images, and you gain skills in a branch of mathematics that you (most likely) had not previously considered. It is not all looking at \"pretty pictures,\" but it is the kind of math that would appeal to a non-math person.",
    "It is a solid way to fill QR for non-mathy people, and the workload is pleasantly light. There is very little you need to come into the class knowing. On the other hand, that means you have to learn a lot of new stuff that is exclusively relevant to fractal geometry without being familiar with any of it beforehand. The subject matter isn't always interesting, but I imagine it's more interesting than most mathematics.",
    "Interesting math course to take if you're not into math. The concepts are fairly easy to grasp when you are cramming before the final. Go to office hours! They help.",
    "Absolutely take it. Michael Frame is a phenomenal and caring teacher and a wonderful human being. Fractal Geometry is unlike any other math class or discipline in math - you come out of the course with a new appreciation for nature, order, and how we can understand the world around us.",
    "The class is a quick introduction to the study of fractals and though it left me with many more questions and only a few hints at answers, the subject and its implications on almost everything from pacemakers to computer generated images of Mordor is fascinating. I would definitely recommend the class to someone who is looking for a not too strenuous work-wise but still very interesting math class.",
    "A very interesting Math class to take, not just for non-Math majors seeking a QR. Though it isn't too technical, the course is conceptually challenging and rewarding.",
    "Mathematics 190 is a great course that I recommend to anyone who is interested in Math but does not want to major in it. It is not a very hard course and there is not much homework, but one has to study regularly in order to do the homework and not to have too much to learn for the final exam. I did not really know about fractals, but now I do know a lot more, and I can say it is a fascinating part of Math that has many applications in different subjects.The best part of Mathematics 190 is probably its instructor, Professor Michael Frame. Professor Frame is one of the best instructors I have ever had. He is extremely knowledgeable about Fractal Geometry, of course (he worked with Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot, one of the highest figures in Fractal Geometry), teaches very well, is really funny (he always tell jokes in the middle of the class), and is a very inspiring teacher. At the end of every class, he would tell us about a story of his life or his view of the universe, which has inspired me a lot and that, I hope, I will never forget. Just try this course and I am sure you will like it!"
