    "a good introduction to the philosophy of history and political theory",
    "Professor Slanski is the best fall H&P instructor. If you are lucky enough to be in her section, keep your spot! She was kind enough to invite us over to her home for dinner - an excellent reprieve from the stress of reading period - and brought in candy on multiple occasions as well. Her methodical explanations of dense and difficult Greco-Roman texts helped make the material much clearer.",
    "DS H&P is a strange but fascinating course, a weird amalgamation that isn't really history or politics but rather, an examination of the course of thought throughout Western time. It takes some getting used to, but is very rewarding. Discussion sections with Slanski are fantastic: interesting and engaging, great for clearing up issues with difficult works.",
    "This is a course that examines the evolution of political thought rather than a history course in the traditional sense. Students should have a keen interest in political theory, the formation of city-states, different models of constitutions, etc., otherwise the readings can be dry. That said, it is an integral component of the DS trio and dovetails nicely with Literature and Philosophy.",
    "It was a survey of all the important political works in the Western canon. I would recommend it.",
    "This is a great class. Professor Slanski is serious and tolerates no nonsense, but she is also kind and sensitive to various student opinions.",
    "A study of the development of classical and Judeo-Christian political thought as affected and molded by historical writing."
