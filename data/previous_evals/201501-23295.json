   "comments": [
    "Take it! I really enjoyed the class. While you may be daunted by the workload (decent amount of reading and 5 papers), Professor Sorkin gives you the opportunity to rewrite your papers, which always improved my grade. You do actually have to do the reading though. I was somewhat nervous coming into the class because I expected to be surrounded by former Jewish day school students, but there was a wide range of experience represented (and an interesting cast of auditors). Some previous knowledge of Jewish history\/terms might be helpful but definitely not necessary. Overall it was a great class, and I'd highly recommend it!",
    "Summary: A broad overview of major themes in modern Jewish history, examined through a variety of specific documentary sources. Yes, I would recommend HIST220-01 to another student.",
    "Take this course! Whether you're 100% Jewish or just like to eat Bagel Brunch at Slifka sometimes, this course will totally blow your mind with new insight, every week. A whirlwind introduction to the history of the Jewish people, rooted in close considerations of historical documents. Also, a great balance of coursework, spaced throughout the semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. I think it would be of particular interest to students of religious studies or other students such as myself, who are Jewish, but do not have a deep background and want to learn more regarding the factors that have strongly influenced modern Jewish history and culture.",
    "Great history class. Interesting classes and readings. 5 short papers. Sorkin's great."
