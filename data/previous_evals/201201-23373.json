    "I feel that the use of the analityca software, by and large, is not completely relevant to the course material and learning experience.",
    "5. I appreciated that the instructors were so open to comments to improve the class for next year.",
    "There was some variety in quality of instruction amongst the different instructors. The pace was generally good, but towards the end I felt it was repetitive.",
    "This was a hard course to teach, given the complexities of these linkages. I came away with a solid understanding of the concepts taught and with some ideas for future paths toward sustainability. All in all, I got what I wanted to get out of the course. I would recommend it as compared to other integrative frameworks course offerings.",
    "Analytica was a waste of time. Too much work, too little value added. The course load overall was big on \"busy work\" - assignments that added little in the way of knowledge gained but took an excessive amount of time.Karen Seto was an excellent instructor with great lectures. Graedel moved very slow, but was okay. Rob Bailis was not very good.",
    "Question 7: Karen Seto is an excellent lecturer and teacher, the classes she taught were exciting and fascinating. However, both Bailis and Graedel were dry and didn't engage the classroom well."

The best thing about this course were the debate sessions where we could truly experience the differentiated opinions from the instructors and pierce.The discussion sessions were also a highlight to this course.",

   "comments": [
    "More effective way of conveying expert's knowledge to students",
    "Too broadreadings often were too long and too academic (difficult to absorb)Analytica program - almost pointlessAssignments - a bit disconnected and expectations not clearly explained",
    "This course needs for the instructors to enhance their lectures with the students reaction papers to make them a more integrated element of the learning experience.Also to try to coordination with the invited lecturers to focus on the linkages side of their issue not so much on the theoretical content of their contributions.",
    "Pace could be a little faster -- some of the lectures were repetitive",
    "While I appreciated the Analytica assignments, the pace of learning the software and the depth in which we learned the software, I felt a lot of that analysis could have been achieved using Excel. Given that Analytica is a paid software program, I suggest teaching analysis using software everyone has access to (like Excel) so that we may use this gained knowledge when we enter the working world.In addition, I felt as if this course was very much a survey course of sustainability and environmental issues that it might be worth offering it in the fall semester to first years rather than spring.",
    "Clear requirements for assignments, particularly the poster. I think most students would have focused on more areas and giving particular solutions if that was pointed out as necessary for a good grade,",
    "Figuring out the best \"take away skill\" for the class. I didn't find making a poster to be all that useful towards my future, nor the use of analytica. Figuring out something that is not too much work, but that you get something out of will be challenging. Excel? Public speaking? I know that the global resources relied heavily on using excel and I did not hear great things - it wasn't all that organized and turned into busy work. If you go the direction of excel, it really needs to be well thought through.",
    "Level of effort put into Analytica and the fact that most people will not use it ever again. It was very interesting and useful software, but in the end it represents only one specialized tool out of a broad universe of information technology tools.",
    "Rubrics and expectations for assignments need to be communicated and shared before things are due. Also, of rubrics are designed where an average or good is a 60%, that grading style also needs to be communicated before hand. This was the case with the final project grading scale, based on a conversation with the TAs.",
    "The amount of work.",
    "The classroom atmosphere is dead, there is no discussion.Also the Analytica assignments were not related to class-work and also nobody uses that software in the real world."

I think the amount of work scared some people off, and I know a few individuals that gave this reason for not taking it, which is sad because it was a very useful course.",

Its a great topic and covers some valuable topics, but wastes too much time on homework and reading responses rather than helping you process the readings in a way that gives them meaning. Karen's lectures did this really well, but that was too small a part of all the things involved in this course.",
