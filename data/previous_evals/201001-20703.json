    "an advanced-level \"introduction\" to continuous time finance and asset pricing. for econ students interested in this course, the focus is very different from economics courses in terms of the types of questions asked and answered. thetools you gain will be valuable in helping you approach economics problems, but the course is very much focused on finance-and-not-economics questions. that said, because there are no problem sets, it takes more work than usual to develop the tools covered in class.",
