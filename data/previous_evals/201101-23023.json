    "Normal Spanish class, great professor, don't expect a seminar.",
    "Wonderful course you have quizzes throughout the semester that really help you get a grasp on the readings and then two take home essay prompts for your midterm and two take home prompts for your final. Prof. Anibal is a wonderful professor that assigns very interesting readings and lectures beautifully on them in class.",
    "Sure- pretty chill class to take and learn a lot.",
    "Definitely. It is a great class in a subject area that is often neglected in the Spanish department.",
    "Yes! It's interesting and the work load is not too terrible.",
    "I recommend this course. I took it Credit\/D which meant that I did few of the readings. Some readings were short (and quite good) while others were quite long. This is disappointing in a literature based course but because his lectures are so thorough (at times a bit repetitive) I did fine on the quizzes and essays. The midterm and final are take home!! Overall very interesting subject matter that I enjoyed learning about from a man who is very interested.",
    "If you are interested in any Caribbean literature, or the correlation between music and literature, take this class. If you want a class where you won't have to speak a lot of Spanish take this class. If you want to improve your Spanish essays, take this class.",
    "See previous answers."
