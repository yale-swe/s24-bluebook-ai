    "Yes, this course is essential for any aspiring Hebrew Bible student.",
    "I would summarize the class as a good overview of the historical critical project in Old Testament studies. I think any Hebrew Bible student at YDS would be doing themselves a disservice by avoiding it.I would recommend students plan their semester around this course and its heavy work-load. The majority of my work this semester was spent preparing for the week-to-week demands of this class, and while the pay-off was well worth it, a student taking the class with other difficult classes would have a very hard time.",
    "It is a good introduction to Hebrew Bible scholarship, if you are willing to complete the considerable workload. It's an important class to take if you plan to continue in this field."
