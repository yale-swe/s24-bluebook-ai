    "a strength of the course was that it mixed practical information with real discussions and a broad range of material. I enjoyed getting to talk about the way simple things matter in exhibits, like labels, and also talk about more complex issues of peoples' engagement with an exhibit. a weakness of the course was that the classes weren't always planned well enough to cover everything we were supposed to talk about. I also would have appreciated a bit more feedback on assignments as we progressed through the semester so that I could be sure I was doing the assignments correctly and improving my work. Additionally, some of the students outside the department had a bit of a harder time finding and accessing the materials they needed for assignments. both of these things could be easily rectified in the future with a little bit of foresight."
