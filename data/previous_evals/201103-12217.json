    "You spend the entire semester reading letters from Hamilton and Jefferson on different subject and your write a primary source paper. Take it if you're interested in the topic - she's a hard grader and the letters are hard to read. But if you like the time period, this is the best class you could take!",
    "This is a great class with very interesting readings and one of the best professors at Yale. You should definitely take it.",
    "Hamilton and Jefferson is basically a semester of reading the letters of Hamilton and Jefferson. If you love working with primary source material, the Revolutionary Era, and are willing to invest yourself in the final paper, then this is the class for you. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The research paper writing process is excellent and reading the letters is fascinating. But I would suggest that you read some background on the period before taking it. The biographies Professor Freeman assigns during the first two weeks provide a good intro but you'll enjoy reading the letters far more if you have some additional background too.",
    "This class involves reading many many letters written by Hamilton and Jefferson and then exploring their characters. The class culminates in a seminar paper that is beautifully taught.",
    "Take it! Joanne Freeman is the nicest, coolest and best teacher you will have at Yale. The information about Hamilton and Jefferson is amazing and offers a whole new perspective on Early America and the Founders as well.",
    "Yes. You'll learn a ton about the founders and you'll write a good essay. A lot of work though--the essay demands some attention. Professor Freeman commits to providing real feedback, and in doing so raises the bar for the students.",
    "Professor Freeman had a great energy in leading seminar, and her feedback on writing was much welcomed. But I found that despite the rave reviews for the course, I was not as interested in the topic as I had thought. Make sure you want to spend an entire semester on Hamilton and Jefferson \u0097 for me, reading their letters and writings got old after a few weeks, though Professor Freeman does a good job of explaining the excitement of the time period and the significance of their work.",
    "This is an amazing course because you learn so much about a time period simply from reading letters and discussing them. Joanne Freeman is an amazing professor and everyone should try to take a class from her if possible. The class culminates to a 20 page paper so just start thinking of ideas early on."
