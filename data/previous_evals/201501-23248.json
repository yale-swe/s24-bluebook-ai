   "comments": [
    "Honestly, this course is completely unrealistic in how much work they give students. This course assigns WAY TOO much homework per night. Not only do you have homework to do each night, but you also have to do the activities for the next day's class, AND study a little every night if you want to do decently well in this class. This is absolutely ridiculous how much work was assigned -- it is as if the professors think we don't have any other classes or obligations. In addition, this class moved super slow in the beginning and then moved way too fast in the end. If you have to take this class, take it with PROFESSOR ALEXANDROV. SHE IS AMAZING! Super engaging, receptive to students needs, chill but sets high standards -- literally the best teacher you could ever ask for. She also took her own time to meet with me outside of class every week to strengthen my skills. Hands down, the best teacher ever in the Spanish department!",
    "Professor Alexandrov is great and I would highly suggest taking this course with her if possible.",
    "I would but i can only speak for my specific professor. I felt that the course itself could have been better organized.",
    "This is a solid Spanish class. Professor Alexandrov is AWESOME and really helped make the class more vibrant.",
    "I felt L3 was a bit easier than L2 in terms of grammar concepts, because a ton of grammar was packed into the very end of the semester in L2 and then L3 is mostly review. However, the tests are more challenging and it's harder to do well on them, the grading distribution is different in this class so you could score a bit lower and still do better overall. Still, it's not an easy class but if you work hard and talk with the teacher you can definitely learn a lot and succeed at the end. Careful of the online homework site; it's really confusing and sometimes you accidentally miss due dates.",
    "This is a writing-intensive intermediate Spanish course with material covering advanced Spanish grammar. I would recommend this class to someone who wants to improve their Spanish skills, especially their writing skills."
