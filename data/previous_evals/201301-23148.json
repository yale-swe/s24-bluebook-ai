    "It's the required senior project. As long as you find a good mentor, it'll be a good project. It's also great for learning valuable techniques to put on your resume.",
    "It's research... You do however much you do.",
    "Senior project class for BME. Do something crazy - lots of resources that are pretty unique\/should be taken advantage of!",
    "Senior projects are pretty fun, just make sure that you work with a good professor and plan out your term early.",
    "I would recommend",
    "Research for credit--for seniors, this includes writing your thesis and making a 15 minute presentation on your research.",
    "Since this is a senior requirement, I'll just add a few suggestions: attend lab meetings, ask questions, and don't start your project too late.",
    "Excellent senior thesis course. I enjoyed working with my advisor and Professor Duncan was great for advice and assistance, as was the rest of the BME faculty.",
    "Research for credit in the BME department -- it's run pretty well, and it's not too high-maintenance. You send Professor Duncan a short summary of your project around the 2nd week of the semester, then a one page update by spring break, then a written report and\/or presentation by the end of reading week. It's nice to get credit for your research if you're not getting paid, so I'd recommend it. The quality of your experience pretty much depends on your actual lab, though, and is basically entirely independent of this course."
