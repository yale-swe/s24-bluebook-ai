   "comments": [
    "Despite its title, the course focuses mostly on the 2008 financial crisis, looking at its causes, effects from economic, political, sociological, and historical perspectives. The Great Depression is considered as a point of comparison. That being said, this course offers a truly comprehensive study of the crisis from a wide variety of angles. It's an event that has greatly shaped our own lives, and is extremely useful to know about.",
    "Developed a greater understanding of financial crises, what they bring and the reasons behind them.",
    "I gained a much better understanding about the mechanics of the Great Depression, 2008 Recession, and economic crises in general. Not only this, but as someone who is not an econ major (but has taken many econ-related classes), this class definitely increased my economic literacy and the writing assignments provided great opportunities for placing opinions on crisis in their proper historical perspective.",
    "I absolutely loved the class. I learned a tremendous amount about the structural causes of the Great Depression and financial crisis, as well as how to include economic analysis and historical perspective in my writing.",
    "Macroeconomics",
    "I learned a lot about the historical context of financial crises."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Fantastic professor with very interesting readings and reasonable assignments Weaknesses: None",
    "Perhaps spending more time going over the timeline of the crisis and understanding its causes and effects before discussing specific readings. It's very complicated material, and I didn't always feel I had a strong understanding of the crisis itself.",
    "The course has two main strengths: 1) The professor truly facilitates the discussion. If the topic is relatively complicated, he takes time to explain\/make a summary of the key concepts. He also comes up with great and insightful questions during the discussion. 2) The readings are well-selected. A diverse range of ideas are represented in the weekly readings. This helps us approach the topic with a multidimensional perspective. The course has no real weakness. My only constructive feedback is that the professor could consider leaving 1 or 2 weeks in the end of the semester for the topics students found\/find most interesting and want to learn more about. China But even without these, the topics we covered were very interesting and engaging.",
    "I think an inherent struggle that any professor may have with a class such as this is balancing the needs of students coming in from different backgrounds. Our class exhibited pretty diverse levels of econ knowledge, and at times it seemed as though there was a lack of balance in the class between those that knew quite a lot and those that knew quite a little about economic history. That being said, there is only so much a professor can do to alleviate this and, granted this class was new, a really rigid definition of what the class would cover was not realistic. I think Fertik did a wonderful job soliciting and listening to student feedback, and he really did let the students determine the overall trajectory of each discussion, stepping in when we lost focus or it was evident that some technical clarification was needed. The reading responses were very helpful in digesting the material and the papers were great opportunities to delve into historical and modern intellectuals' opinions on the economy: why it works the way it does, how it should be, etc.",
    "The material was great. Although some of the reading can be dense, I truly learned a lot. As someone without a lot of knowledge about the topics at hand there were times I struggled to follow discussion a bit. A bit more focus on outlining the main arguments of readings or important terms etc would have been very helpful.",
    "The discussions in seminar were very good and well led by Professor Fertik. As well, the seminar was very well taught in terms of teaching me the specifics of the two crisis. The class was excellent, but one small improvement could be a bit more focus on the crises in Europe (rather than just the US).",
    "Professor was great. Content and the timeline of the course should have jumped around a bit less."

   "comments": [
    "100%. A really excellent professor with strong readings and a super reasonable workload. It's a lot greater focus on the more recent financial crisis than the Great Depression so if you have even any remote interest in American\/European economic history this is a fantastic course.",
    "Absolutely. Prof. Fertik is great, and clearly puts a lot of effort into designing the course and preparing for meetings. And It's a WR credit without too much writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you are interested in economics and want to learn more about the Global Financial Crisis, this is a great opportunity for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics or global affairs generally. Not only do you come away with a greater economic literacy and understanding of two defining economic periods in American and World history, but you get to learn about how questions of economics drive incredibly influential human social movements: The EU and the contemporary populist revival as two very interesting focal points. Really interesting class with a knowledgable, caring professor and incredible flexibility in terms of your main papers. Definitely a great WR credit. Definitely do the readings.",
    "It was an amazing course that really helped me understand the financial history of the US. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It was extremely well taught, I learned a great deal about subjects I'm really passionate about, and it taught me important writing and debate skills.",
    "Yes if you want to learn more about macroeconomics",
    "Yeah, you definitely should take more than introductory economic courses."
