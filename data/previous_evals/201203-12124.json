    "Great intro class, got me pretty interested in film. You each some pretty great movies",
    "Its a great class to take for a writing credit. Most of my peers loved every minute, while I was a bit bored in some of the minutia. Nevertheless I would recommend it to any film buff!",
    "No, I would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommened intro film to anyone. Film studies is much more work than you'd expect. If you don't already have an overwhelming background of film, you will be lost. The films are almost all art cinema, and the reading is not at all applicable to the course even though you have to read it. I strongly recommend that you choose anything else besides FILM 150.",
    "Very good class that gives you the materials you need to start thinking critically about films. The film screenings are fun and cover many of the great films! Definitely recommend, especially if you like writing about film.",
    "I would recommend film studies to another student who is interested in film. I don't think that it is an exciting gut class. If someone is looking for a humanities credit I think that there are other classes that are more engaging.",
    "Definitely recommend this course! Lots of reading at times and a substantial amount of writing (it's a WR credit - what do you expect?), but very interesting material.",
    "I would recommend Film Studies 150 to a student that was interested in Film Studies. If you're not particularly interested in the subject matter I would not recommend it because it's a lot of work and the type of work itself is not particularly easy.",
    "I think its a good class that's necessary to understand the basics of film.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Prof. Gregg is great, not too much work if you go to Lecture and some great movies.",
    "Definitely would recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a great way to get a writing credit, and makes you appreciate films even more.",
    "If you're looking for an easy gut-like WR course, I wouldn't recommend FILM150 unless you have a relatively easy schedule. While the material in this class isn't too tough, you do have to attend both a screening (or watch the movies on your own) and a section every week. Papers aren't graded too harshly, but you do have both a final paper and a final exam which is kind of annoying. If this doesn't sound like a lot to you, you're probably a less lazy person than I am.",
    "Intro to Film Studies is an interesting and engaging writing credit course for all the cinema-philes at hear, as well as anyone considering starting out on a path towards a Film Studies major. Ron Gregg provides interesting examples that tie into our learning of film theories from the beginning of cinema to contemporary time. You will come out of the class with not only a greater appreciation for the art form of film, but with an increased ability to analyze and come to academic and logical conclusions about what you see on both the movie screen and in real life.",
    "Film Studies is a great course, even if you don't want to use it towards your major. It successfully allows you to learn how to watch a film, what to look at in a film, and gain film literacy and a better idea of the film industry.",
    "Great class, especially if you love films and\/or are looking to fulfill a writing requirement.",
    "This is a wonderful course. That being said, it does take a lot of time if you want to get something out of it. In addition to 2 hours of class and an hour of section, film screenings can take up to 3 extra hours. In addition, there are a lot of readings (though you can skip some of them). All in all, however, I really loved the course and enjoyed watching and writing about film. Highly recommended if you have the time in your semester.",
    "If you take this class, expect to do a lot of writing. There are 4 papers and a final exam in addition to the online responses you may be expected to do for section. (The course is a writing credit, though, so that's probably fair.) Also expect to spend a lot of class time on this course - the hours spent at screenings, lecture, and section can add up if you're very involved in other activities. The extensive readings are frankly non-essential if you have the general idea behind the philosophy.By no means, however, let these things dissuade you from taking FILM150. You'll get an introduction to some of the most famous films in cinema, as well as to some lesser-known ones that formed the basis of important cultural\/political movements. Professor Gregg sets up awesome opportunities with special screenings and guest actors\/producers\/writers, so if you're a cinephile you will be falling all over yourself to go to optional class meetings. It's also extremely cool to have access to 35mm prints of famous movies.This class is a successful survey course - definitely worth it if you're interested in watching movies with a more critical eye!",
    "It is a class that teaches you about the fundamentals of film analysis and you don't need any prior experience. It is rather time consuming wit the screenings and all, but definitely a course worth taking if you are interested in the subject.",
    "GREAT overview of film techniques (cinematography, editing, mise-en-scene, etc.), film criticism (some major theorists, and big movements in film history), and films in the basic canon--you'd miss a LOT by not actually attending the screenings. Also a really fun way to get a peek into the wider film studies world at Yale (updates about cool advance screenings going on on campus, for instance, or learning how to use the Film Studies Center to rent movies for class OR fun). Beware, you'll never watch movies in quite the same way again, which is both a good and bad thing.Beware, though--this class is a TON of time for an Intro course (lecture twice a week, section, screening, FOUR writing assignments with drafts and revisions each, AND a final); that's the only thing that kept me from taking it my first 3 years of college, since I knew it wasn't going to be my major. It would be great if there were a WR OPTION (sections that did the four assignments vs. others that only did one review and one analysis, maybe). If they don't change it that way, it's a stupid course to take Cr\/D (lots of people do, since it's movies) because you still have lots of things to turn in.",
    "yes, take it, solid intro course. not too much work, easy writing credit, very interesting for those who like film.",
    "I would recommend Film Studies to another student as I think it was a good intro course if you like film. The films were for the most part really enjoyable. The lectures and section were sometimes tough to get through though. Also, beware that there is a final paper and final. The two were due two days apart and I found it rather stressful.",
    "Good intro class, especially if you need a writing credit. Although I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly enjoy the actual material we covered in class, I feel that I was given some important tools for the analysis of film. The writing credit is good if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just looking to get it out of the way, but if you actually want to become a better writer this probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be very helpful.",
    "This course is great. Itis very basic though not in a bad way but you spend the course learning the rudimentary skills of film studies - mise en scene, genre etc. stuff you need maybe if you are a film studies major (as this is a major requirement) but if you aren't going to be a film studies major I'd take a higher level class - it's more interesting. All being said you watch interesting films and the reading can be pretty interesting. I don't think two films should be shown on one night sometimes a screening would take more than three hours on one night.",
    "Yes. Definitely take it if you're interested in film and are willing to write some papers.",
    "Take this course. Ron Gregg is a really cool guy and you will enjoy the films throughout the semester. For a WR credit, it's a moderate amount of work, 4 writing assignments during the semester (3, 3, 5, 10 pages).",
    "If you're looking for a writing credit, take this class. It's not a lot of work, and the material is interesting and applicable. I find myself thinking when watching movies now, OHH the cinematographer just did this so that we could feel this. It really changed the way I view movies (and I can finally understand why sometimes there is a big discrepancy on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes). The only thing that did get a little annoying was that there was so much meeting time. Lecture 2x a week, section, film screening that lasts anywhere from 1:30 hours to 3 hours - ain't nobody got time for that. I ended up missing some of the screenings, lectures and didn't do any of the readings and I did well. I would even recommend this class if you're not looking for a writing credit - Ron Gregg is awesome. Make sure you get a good TA tho!",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who might want a writing credit.",
    "Very good background in film technique, style, theory, and history. Like any survey course, you will cover a lot of ground quickly and without going too in depth. However, the course gives you enough material to learn more about topics which interest you. That being said, you can be successful without doing all of the theoretical reading in the class.The course is a writing credit and is largely populated by freshmen, so a good deal of time was spent in section teaching writing. We had to turn in drafts for every paper, and the due dates were often before the final due dates listed in the syllabus.Lectures are fine, and the films were awesome. Know that there are a lot of screenings (not just every Tuesday), and you will want to go to these evening sessions less than you think you will.Overall, very good course.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's very useful and interesting if you're at all interested in film. It might be a bit of a change of pace to actually analyze movies, but the course itself is not hard. There's a lot of reading, so technically the course load is very heavy, but I honestly did not do any reading, attended lectures and sections (which are mandatory) and I got by with the work. Not a gut class, but it's useful for every day life, may extend your interest in cinema and the film studies' major, and you get a writing credit out of it.",
    "It is a broad overview of the history of film that incorporates a variety of films, speakers, and readings to create a compact class. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, it changed the way I watch movies, TV, and the world in general.",
    "Great class - a bit of work will go a long way to improving your analysis of films.",
    "Yes absolutely. It's a fun WR credit and I've improved in my writing more so than in any English class.",
    "Intro to Film Studies is extremely time consuming, but the work is fairly easy. If you're ready to give up your Tuesday night to watch the movies on the syllabus (and don't find lecture overly tedious), go for it - you'll learn the basics of film and watch some great movies to boot. Just know what you're getting into - 7-10 pm screenings one night a week, two lectures and weekly section, four papers and a final.",
    "Intro film is great. Movies are great, writing is really interesting (and there isn't _too_ much). If you keep up with all the reading and the movies, it can be a lot of work. Worth it.",
    "Great class if you want to learn about all the choices made in film production. Professor Gregg's lectures are interesting and well-focused, and he always has clips to illustrate his points. He does tend to ramble a little, though. My favorite part of the class was watching all of the films on the syllabus. I loved seeing the movies on the big screen in WHC. The papers are fairly painless, and since you have to turn in drafts you won't put them off until the last minute. The readings are interesting, but with all the other time commitments demanded by the class, I found myself neglecting these the most. The final is not hard as long as you go to lecture, watch the movies, and know the basic terms that professor Gregg introduces in lecture. Nothing not discussed in lecture is on the final.",
    "YES - definitely. It's a great introduction, you learn a lot and you have fun learning. The films are great and, it is a good way to fulfill your writing requirement: you write film reviews and analysis papers - it's not too tedious.",
    "Fairly intense introduction to film. Studying film is difficult because it's something that's so automatic and something we've been doing since childhood. It's a great course and Professor Gregg brings in so many interesting guest lectures (Gary Newman from Fox TV) and premiers movies (Bruce Cohen came to premier 'Playbook's Silver Lining). Most of the film's you will watch will be foreign and in black and white but you live the class with a much better understanding and appreciation of how film is an art film as well as a medium for scholarly study. It's also a pretty cool way to knock out the writing requirement: 2 film reviews, 1 short film analysis, and a final film analysis.",
    "Good class, you watch interesting, worthwhile films, and the workload is not too heavy",
    "There are many easier writing credits but this one can be very enjoyable if you like films. Just know that with the lecture + section + screening, it gets pretty time consuming.",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro to Film Studies to another student as a must-take course before you leave Yale.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but definitely worth the time you put into it. The films are fun and interesting (for the most part), and the reading is pretty interesting. The essays are easy to write and the lectures are really interesting.",
    "Film Studies is a great intro to the history of film making as an art and business. If you are at all interested in film, even if only for entertainment, this course would be a great one to try. I would certainly recommend this course to anyone.",
    "This is a great survey course in film studies. It is totally worth taking this course to fulfill your writing requirement. Prof. Gregg is very nice and helpful, and his lectures are both interesting and insightful. Try to make it to all the screenings. The films are all great, and you'll have a much easier time following her lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a lot of work - four papers, weekly screenings, and a lot of reading - but it's worth it. The class is a WR and I definitely think I improved my writing in it because the papers focus first on finding a voice and then on crafting an argument. I would suggest attending the weekly screenings because it's easy to fall behind on the films and if you can, try going through the reading. It makes lecture easier to understand. Go to lecture!!! Gregg is great and makes a lot of arguments in class that will 1) make sure you actually take something away from the course and 2) prepare you for the final. The class teaches you how to see movies not just for their narrative and plot but for their direction, cinematography, editing, use of sound, etc. The class makes you analyze film as you would analyze literature and that makes it really cool. Many of the movies come from the British Sights and Sounds list so you'll get to see classics too. Just be prepared. The course is a lot of work. But if you put a lot of effort into it, you definitely get a lot out of it.",
    "It's a good way to get a WR credit. You watch a lot of great films, and learn new ways to analyze them. If you can commit to watching the films each week (I usually skipped the screening and downloaded the films on my own), then it should be manageable. If you can watch the recommended films as well, you will come out of the class with a deeper appreciation of film.",
    "VERY easy way to get a Wr. The final paper is a bit out of the blue as it's quite a bit longer than the others and you only get around the same amount of support in writing it. Still, if you're a freshman or a slow reader it's a good way to get through a Wr. You write on the films and, though you need to look at the readings for the sake of understanding lecture and talking in section, the actual writing is on the films and so as long as you show up or watch the films before section you'll have a much easier time writing the papers than in most humanities classes. Especially if you're the type to write a paper having done none of the class's readings.",
    "Great class, great films. A fair amount of writing (two ~5 page film reviews, an 8 page paper, and final, 10 page paper) but these are more interesting to write than ordinary papers. Lectures sometimes go on a bit too much, but the topics are different each week and it's wonderful to see and talk about so many good movies.",
    "A great, clear introduction to film, that really reveals so much to the film we know. Some of the best movies and critics to illustrate the key concepts of film. A great class to take, no matter what major, as it will change how you view films, forever.",
    "Intro to Film Studies is great, whether one is looking to further pursue film studies or not. Either way, it will deepen your appreciation for any film you see during and after the course.",
    "Intro to Film Studies is a fantastic class and a great survey of the field. Be warned, however, that it's by no means a gut if that's what you're looking for. This year, we had two 1,000 word film reviews, one 7-8 page paper, one 10-12 page final paper, and a final exam. But you're able to turn in drafts of most if not all of the writing assignments, which is extremely helpful.Aside from the work, this was an very enjoyable course. Professor Gregg is one of the nicest professors at Yale, and the films that you watch on a weekly basis are carefully selected and clearly important in film history. Yeah, some might be boring, but most are great. Plus, you might get to be part of a couple special screenings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we saw Silver Linings Playbook the week before it was widely released in theaters. I came into the class worried that film analysis might not have much substance, but I've come away interested in taking more film studies courses. If Annie Berke is a TF for the course next year, she's wonderful.",
    "Take it whether or not you are\/want to be a film major. I'm a science-y person, but LOVED THIS COURSE! Just take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in film as art or an entertainment.",
    "Great to learn about the Film Classics and a good introduction to Film Analysis and Film Review. Lot's great people come as guests to lecture themselves and make themselves open for questions. A lot of knowledge can be attained by paying attention to those particular lectures. The course requires a lot of reading which can be hard to keep up with. So strategy-based reading is recommended.",
    "This class is a very broad overview film history course which will probably be redundant if you have any film history background. There is a ton of reading, though you can probably get by without doing most of them. For a WR it's not too much writing, but the grading is harder than in other classes I've taken.",
    "Film Studies 150 01 is a great class for anyone who wants to know more about the film industry or the history of film. Anyone can take this course even if they are majoring in another subject. If one gives an honest effort they will do well in the course. I would recommend this course without reservation.",
    "FILM 150 is a decent introduction to film. Be aware that this class mainly focuses on how to analyze a film rather than familiarizing students with any canon of significant works or directors. You will come away from this course well-versed in various film genres\/techniques\/technical terms. As a prospective film major, I personally would have enjoyed a course that delved more deeply into specific directors and groundbreaking works of cinema that everyone should be aware of, but I definitely don't regret taking this course. Professor Gregg is very friendly and a good lecturer."
