    "A good class to learn about cultural, racial, and gender identity, in both the context of a family and in a broader scale.",
    "I would recommend this course for students interested in a good overview of the concepts of gender, culture and identity",
    "A really good course about WGSS. A ton of readings, but a vast majority is very interesting. Definitely do the readings, though, because she will call on you if you haven't spoken in class. A good class to take if you like discussions. The content in very South Asian heavy, so for someone looking for a more East Asian slant (like I was), this will not be that.",
    "I wouldn't. It's a twice a week lecture that barely has enough to talk about in each class. With some better organization, it could be better.",
    "A great course on how family, gender roles, societal norms and culture all intersect, especially in the context of U.S. and Asian households. It is a great course with very interesting readings and film assignments. I always enjoy the reading and the films."
