    "Danilo is sadly leaving - if he ever comes back, absolutely! This course is outstanding.",
    "Most unfortunately, this course is unlikely to be offered ever again, as Professor Petranovich is taking a fellowship at Princeton next year. It was a refreshing respite from Yale's liberal indoctrination, and provided a fascinating overview of the conservative intellectual tradition. This class was more than just weekly readings and discussions; we had prominent people like George Nash and Bill Kristol come visit our class, for example. Everything you want from a Yale course. Hopefully another professor will come along and be brave enough to take up Professor Petranovich's cause.",
    "You shouldn't miss it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any conservative at Yale or anyone who wishes to know more about conservatism in America.",
    "Come one, come all! Political science majors and political science novices alike! If you've ever read \"God and Man at Yale,\" and wondered what motivated the fiery figure of Yale's history, this is definitely the course for you!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who really wants to understand American Conservatism and its history.",
    "If you are interested in learning about American conservatism, then yes, take this course!"
