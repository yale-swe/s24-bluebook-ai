    "I definitely would. A wonderful junior seminar, we read really interesting books, the discussions were great. This is why you should be an American Studies major...",
    "An excellent course where you use contemporary texts as a lens for how humanism has taken shape in a globalized world, how liberal Americans identify with this concept, and how it has shaped American culture and politics. I would highly recommend it because the readings are great, Amina was great, and it has provided me with more tools for my continued scholarship in cultural studies.",
    "I would highly suggest this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Though it was a bit disorganized, I'm sure this will be fixed the second time around. We read some great books and discussions were always interesting.",
    "American Studies 390 is a seminar built to analyze America's relationship with the world through the lens of contemporary literature. I refer to things I've learned in this class pretty much every day now, and I highly recommend this class to anyone who lives in America. I presume, that's a lot of you."
