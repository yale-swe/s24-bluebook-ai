    "Yes - if that student was part of the Clinical Psychology Graduate program, this is a required course.",
    "This class was well-designed to meet the APA requirement and I could recommend it to others.",
    "This course is useful, especially for those of us who didn't major in psychology in college.",
    "I would recommend this course to a junior graduate student as it provides a good basis from which to move forward with your clinical research and training. It was interesting to learn about the historical perspective of our field and how trends in research and practice have influenced one another.",
    "This is a course each student must take! More than worth it!",
    "Broad survey of the history of psychology from a sub-field of ancient philosophy to its present clinical practice. Generally a good course, would recommend it.",
    "Good overview over the field of psychology. I would recommend taking this course.",
    "A thorough review of major historical developments in the field of clinical psychology. I would recommend this class to another student because it gave a historical perspective, which is not typical of most psych courses."

    "This deepened my knowledge by helping me see a broader context for my research and studies.",
    "This course helped me to connect aspects of the history of psychology that I hadn't previously understood, and in particular to see how those movements connected with larger philosophical and cultural trends that I was more familiar with. In that way it helped to broaden my own base of knowledge and complemented my research interests in other fields.",
