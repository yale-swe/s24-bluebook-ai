    "you need to have some background to take this class",
    "This is the only required course that you absolutely cannot place out of, even if youve taken an imaging course before, so get ready to take it. If the course hasnt been significantly altered from when I took it, be prepared to have to do a lot of outside work to pull the concepts together. Youll basically need to attend the problem sessions in order to figure out what the problems are asking, and will need to decipher a lot of the context surrounding the lecture material on your own. If youre able to put in the time, the material is really interesting and you can get a lot of good information out of this course, but my guess is youll have a lot of other stuff going on during the term and wont have the time to extract the context necessary to get what the professors want you to get out of it.",
    "Good course. Attend all the problem sessions because they are extremely helpful. Professors are always available for assistance. I would recommend the course to students interested in imaging.",
    "It contained lots of biosensing knowledge and gave us the overview of biosensing.",
    "It took a lot of time and effort, but you'll be ok. Might not learn a ton, though.",
    "A good course for engineering study."

    "This class gives me some overall picture of the bioimaging field. I think it's very helpful.",
    "There was a lot of great information on metabolism and things that are tangentially related to my work (since I do majorly in vitro work). I also utilize fluorescence a good deal and it was good to get more insight into the processes here.",
    "Very helpful to my research",
    "I don't think this class helped me a whole lot, but I guess now I'll sort of have an idea of what the imaging people are talking about in the first few slides of their presentations before they completely lose me.",
    "Good."
