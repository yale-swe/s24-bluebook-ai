   "comments": [
    "This class, especially with Schneider, will extend you a lot in French. This is a good thing - you're not at Yale to get a 4.0; you're here to learn. Take it, but be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "You will learn a lot in this class but it requires work. As a physics major, I didn't search for a distributional requirement that would take most of my time. You should know that this class took more than double the work of some others and that is not just because I came in knowing slightly less than the rest of the students. It is intimidating how Prof. Schneider will stare at a student and expect them to say something even if a question wasn't asked.",
    "I would recommend the class to any student looking to strengthen their conversation and grammar skills.",
    "Whether you want to improve your speaking skills or get on track for the French major take this course. And take it with Mme. Schneider, she's great! The material is fun\/entertaining and you will walk away knowing French much better.",
    "I would recommend French 150 highly but don't take it with Professor Colvin. Any other professor would be better.",
    "Schneider is demanding but with her you're guaranteed to learn a lot of French and do well on the final.",
    "I definitely recommend taking French 150 with Prof. Schneider! The class is really helpful for developing high level proficiency in reading, writing and speaking. The books are intriguing and the films are terrific.",
    "Yes definitely. Especially if you are not sure if you want to learn a bit more about grammar but still read french literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It is a challenging course that has a considerable amount of time commitment. It is a well taught course and I definitely felt an improvement in my French language skills. Take it with Mme. Schneider!!",
    "I would highly recommend this class as an important next step for students that have taken L4 French. Many of the students in my section were freshmen who placed in and they seemed to think the class was the right fit. Try to find a section that is a little smaller in order to give yourself a greater opportunity to practice your oral skills."
