    "Signals and Systems is an overview of exactly that. You solidify your understanding of Fourier Series and Fourier Transform in discrete and continuous time. You also learn about Laplace and Z transforms and sampling. The material isn't too hard to grasp.This class is the best with Prof. Belabbas. It goes at a much more manageable pace!",
    "Fourier series, transform, laplace, Z, feedback.",
    "As a BME imaging major, I would recommend this class to anyone considering that path. This class is fundamental, and its not as scary as the name sounds.",
    "Great class. Take it as long as you've taken 202. Really helpful in teaching all forms of fourier too, which is useful in other classes. Laplace and Z is taught well too, which also helps outside EE."
