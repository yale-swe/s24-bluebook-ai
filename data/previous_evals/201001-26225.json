    "I enjoyed the variety of guest speakers - it kept the class interesting and allowed for a variety of perspectives. I also thought there was a good amount of discussion and involvement of the class in lecture.",
    "Seminar based - I learn more that way. Bought different speakers in every week.",
    "Exposure assessment is a worthy topic for an EHS course, but the material gets diluted by the repetitive guest lectures. (All except for 2 or 3 of the classes were guest lectures.) While the guest lectures themselves ranged in quality, and many were good, each lecturer felt obliged to include introductory information on a range of topics. Obviously, they don't know what we have learned and some in the class had different backgrounds, but the vast majority of this small class had previously had Toxicology, Environmental Epi, etc. This resulted in a fair amount of time being spent on topics we already knew, leaving less time for learning new information. There is also a trend of repeating the same guest lectures across multiple EHS classes - at times this felt like the EHS seminar all over again, a series of interesting but disjointed lectures. Dr. Leaderer is a good professor and an expert on exposure assessment - I would have prefered to hear more from him on the topic.",
    "Good material, although sometimes a bit of overlap between lectures.",
    "The strength of this course was the opportunity to hear about different aspects of exposure assessment from people who currently work in the field. That said, given the guest lectures, the weakness of this course was a great deal of repetition among speakers or with other EHS classes."

    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer makes exposure assessment very easy to understand and his lecturing style is clear and interesting. I only wish he had taught more of the lectures himself - I enjoyed his presentation of the material.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Very good",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer is a wonderfully kind person and an expert in his field. The structure of his course, however, is a bit disjointed. I would have prefered to hear more from him during the semester. Perhaps he could give an introduction to the topics for each guest lecture (before they arrived) or teach more classes in between the guest lectures. A more cohesive structure with less repetition from the guest lectures would have been useful.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Leaderer knows the material well.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0What I appreciate most about the instructor was his willingness to assist students with questions and his effort to present a variety of topics in exposure assessment.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Great professor."

   "comments": [
    "The course is structured like a seminar, with a different guest speaker every week. Good overview of environmental exposure assessment and related topics, such as risk assessment, toxicology, regulatory issues, etc. I would recommend to students interested in any of these topics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student. It was very useful to learn the different facets of exposure assessment, and I'm sure I will use much of what I learned. The assignments were relevant and helpful in gaining mastery over the concepts.",
    "Teaches you how to assess an environmental exposure. Yes, I would recommended this course.",
    "This course is very little work and has a few very good lectures. EHS students are required to take this course, but for others I think there are more useful courses in the EHS department I would recommend.",
    "Good and useful.",
    "This course provides a good overview of the variety of fields and topics involved in exposure assessment."
