    "This class is a very interesting introduction to a lot of problem solving techniques that you may not have come across before. I would recommend this class to another student based on how interesting the material is and how much we learned this semester but this is NOT a gut class. The problem sets are extremely difficult, I spent every Sunday and Monday night at the homework sessions as well as at weekly office hours and still struggled to get the problem sets completed on time. I also have no idea of my grades in this class for the semester. If you're looking for an interesting QR credit that will deal with math concepts that you may never tackle in another 110 class then this class is definitely for you. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a gut class and\/or need continual feedback on your performance then do not take this class.",
    "Absolutely. Like almost everybody else, I took this class because I needed a QR credit, and because I expected it to be easy. It was NOT easy. In fact, Intro to Quantitative Thinking may have challenged me intellectually more than any other of my courses this term--but it was also my favorite class. Lectures are engaging, often funny, and, best of all, interactive--Adam usually does an amazing job explaining incredibly difficult concepts, but if you don't understand anything, it's perfectly acceptable to call out and ask him to clarify. He engages the class in discussion and theories and usually leads us to conclusions rather than telling us the answers. Don't take this expecting a gut, though. Problem sets are frequent and are incredibly difficult--you will almost certainly have to go to office hours every week to solve them. But Quantitative Thinking will change your perspective on math and your own confidence in your abilities to deal with it. It's 100% worth the effort it requires.",
    "This is a worthwhile, interesting course that exposes us humanities-folk to different ways of thinking and problem solving. The class was interactive, had impressive breadth and pace, and managed to get into serious mathematics without much buildup. Always interesting, the work was sometimes just frustrating--it was hard to get any of the homework done, for instance, without direct help from somebody. Even so, it will expand your brain and is a worthwhile path to a QR credit. Adam Marcus is fantastic.",
    "This course is excellent and a must-take. Professor Marcus is hilarious in a sarcastic way and a fantastic teacher, always willing to help. The course material is kind of off the cuff whatever Adam's thinking about at the moment, but it's a good thing (we went from watching Jon Stewart to the concept of dual infinities and sets with no area). The problem sets on average were very difficult, though extremely rewarding once you finished them, and group work was encouraged. A love of logic and puzzles really helps you appreciate this class (I also was concurrently taking a computer science class, which tied into the problem solving more than you'd expect), though is totally not necessary with all of the resources Professor Marcus and the TFs make available. Take it!",
    "This class is hard work. It's a great QR to take because you learn a lot of things that you would otherwise never learn elsewhere. But again, be prepared to work i.e. turn up to homework sessions on Sunday\/Monday nights, visit TA's office hours, and of course, turn up to class. There is a weekly pset that you certainly cannot complete without help.",
    "I was dreading taking QR course and while I am still nervous about the final (you never have any idea what your grade is, which might be a con), I've found it do-able. That is, do-able with lots and lots of help from Adam, the TF AND the peer tutors. I'm talking three times a week or more. The strength of the course is that the professor is very accessible and will help you understand math, which we know can't be said for many QR courses. The con is perhaps that the course is very haphazard and you never really know where you stand, if you can do the work yourself, if you're learning math. In the end I think so but the uncertainty is uncomfortable.",
    "I don't recommend it - it's very disorganized. I have no idea how I'm doing in the class and my final is in a week.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The material was very over my head, and I think I would have benefited more from a basic math class. Don't take this if you just want an easy QR. It's not easy and at times very frustrating. It was also very different from last year, and Adam makes up the material as he goes, so you never know what to expect.",
    "Despite whatever form AMTH 110 took in previous semesters, this was NOT a gut course. Per week, be prepared to spend three hours in class, four hours in section, one office hour, and additional time working on your weekly problem set. The balance to all of this is that if you stick with it, you will be able to understand really neat concepts that will blow you away. Adam cares deeply about the material and the students, just be ready to do your part and put in a lot of work, too.",
    "i liked it a lot and thought it was very interesting...",
    "it is NOT an easy QR.",
    "This is a wonderful math credit for people who want to take something unusual, interesting and reasonably challenging. Weekly problem sets are manageable if you go to the homework sessions and they never take more than three hours. Adam Marcus is an amazing professor and it's worth taking this class to hear him speak three times a week.",
    "Yes, but ONLY if the # of students is small. If it's large, then no. You won't learn anything because the class will be entirely different with half the football team in the classroom.",
    "This class was very interesting but sometimes the concepts were difficult to grasp.",
    "If you are not a math person I recommend taking this class. Adam Marcus understands if you have problems and does a great job getting you through it.",
    "yes!",
    "Applied Mathematics is not an easy class by any means. While it is for non math majors, we did a lot of advanced calculus. At times I think it would have been easier for me to just have taken calc 112. However, Adam is an awesome professor- he's very smart and funny. There are weekly problem sets, we had an essay project as a midterm, and a final. The problem sets were all but impossible, I spent about 7-10 hours per week working on them- and could rarely do them without asking Adam for help. The class was very difficult, but there was always help available.",
    "Intro to Quantitative Thinking is NOT a gut. Seriously. Many people came to lecture at the beginning of the semester expecting to get easy A's by doing nothing; that is not the case. Every problem set requires a few hours to complete, and you need to be able to go to either a) the homework sessions or b) weekly office hours to complete the problem sets. No one ever did the problem sets without help from the professor or TA OUTSIDE of class. It's a great course for people who are afraid of Math. If you put in the effort by going to homework sessions and meeting with Adam and the TA, you will certainly be successful in this course. Adam likes to see participation and effort. Of course, you need to be able to do some work, but if you put in effort to learn the material it will pay off at the end of the course when you find out that you were doing math major-level problems the whole time.",
    "This is not an easy class. It's not a ton of work. In that your time commitment will not be big. You can always get your homework done in the homework sessions he sets up. But the time you do spend doing it will be frustrating and hard. Really really frustrating.",
    "This class is NOT a gut. But it's great. You'll work hard, you won't understand everything but you'll walk away with a fuller understanding of mathematical concepts and better problem solving skills.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It is not a gut course, it has a huge workload and is nothing but confusing.",
    "awful. do not take this class...try something with actual numbers in it.",
    "I am not sure how to describe the work we did in this class, but it was vaguely mathematical I guess. The material taught is can be confusing, especialy if you miss class. The homework isn't too hard, as the TA will basically walk you through it, but the p-sets are actually impossible to do on your own so expect to spend a lot of time at office hours. The class is definitely not a gut and was frustrating for me many, many times over the semester--no one that's in your class will understand your notes, etc. and this kind of made me feel like the class was a waste of time. But, if you go into this class knowing how theoretical it is it won't be as frustrating. I highly suggest taking it with a friend.",
    "Listen to what Adam says at the beginning of the semester, e.g. \"this is NOT a gut class. This will be one of the hardest, most frustrating courses you ever take.\" He is telling the truth, so be aware of what you're getting into. Although the class is advertised for those who aren't that great at math, find another QR if you're not willing to struggle on a single homework problem for two hours.",
    "I would it really makes you smarter through critical thinking.",
    "You never know what you are going to get for sure, but essentially you will learn extremely difficult mathematical concepts in an accessible manner. This is not a class about right and wrong unlike most at Yale but about process. The idea is to come away at the end of the semester with a new way of looking at things-especially mathematical problems.If youput in the time, you will probably not think that for 3\/4 of the semester and towards the end realize just how much you have learned, and how it has changed your approach rather than the outcome.",
    "If you're considering taking this class, you're probably terrified or traumatised by math in some way. This class may help you with this. Adam is a really great professor, very funny and so incredibly willing to help you (going to his office hours was really useful). He approaches teaching the class in really strange methods and you'll probably never be able to explain to your friends who actually do math what you're doing in the class. Just be warned that the problem sets are really hard (definitely go to the homework sessions or office hours) and take a lot of time and stress, and the final was definitely traumatic, but it's worth very little of your grade, so your cumulative work throughout the semester is way more valuable, which I really appreciated. So take this class, but be ready to put a lot into it, and then it can be a really valuable experience.",
    "The problem sets are really hard, but the homework sessions really help, so it's not that bad. Plus going to class is fun and Professor Marcus is a great guy.",
    "This is an interesting course in problem solving but is very time consuming and demanding.",
    "If you want to lose yourself in very obscure math, take it. Otherwise, find a different class.",
    "AMTH 110 is a great QR! Contrary to what some people say, it is not easy. The problem sets are every week and they are complicated, but there are lots of resources to help you get them done. The course offers an alternative way to learn math and is great for non-math pople.",
    "If you're any good with logic, go for it. But Adam makes us solve problems in...odd ways. It's definitely challenging, but I don't think it's worth the stress. We never knew how we were doing, we could never gauge our grades b\/c he took FOREVER to give us back our psets.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to any student who is willing to work hard and think in different ways.",
    "This class has grown to be exceptionally more challenging than it had been in past years. If you want to puzzle things out and feel rewarded for looking at things in new ways, take this class. If you just want to know the answer, don't bother.",
    "If you don't mind QRs and are willing to work moderately hard, disregard this... Otherwise, don't take this class. \"Oh man it's called pleasures of counting it's gonna be easy.\" wrong. very wrong. If you need a QR, take Movie Physics. If you need another one, well I don't know what to tell you. But don't take this. For your health.",
    "If math is not your favorite subject and you are open to surprises, this would be a good class for you.",
    "Definitely. This class is such a fun exercise in problem solving. It was more like a discussion section than a regular class.",
    "A great way to fulfill a QR IF you are willing to put in the work. NOT A GUT. Super interesting, and very, very, very difficult. Even if you totally suck at math (as I did), but are willing to put in a little effort, this class is totally for you, as Adam asserts \"it's not how much you know, it's how much you grow\" that is important. I did a lot of \"growing\" this semester, so hopefully I will get a good grade."
