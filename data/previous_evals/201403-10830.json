   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if they want a good theoretical background.",
    "This course is more theoretical than applied and introduces that key basic concepts for econometric work. I would recommend it for students who plan to do econometric work later in their careers and who want to understand the intuition behind regression analysis.",
    "It's a bit challenging but worth it if you're interested in research. Starts from the basics",
    "You need to have a solid background in Econometrics as the course moves ahead very quickly.",
    "I would not recommend Econ 558!",
    "Econometrics is a necessary course for our IDE program. That said, I would strongly dissuade anyone who isn't required to take this course from putting themselves through a semester of fruitless frustration.",
    "I would not recommend ECON 558 as it is in between the undergraduate and Phd level of economics courses. I also feel that the lack of structure makes the learning process much harder than reading a textbook for example. I would not recommend this course to students with no prior knowledge of econometrics as the main reason my performance in the course was acceptable was due to my knowledge of undergraduate econometrics.",
    "Yes, it is a very useful course"

    "I have a much stronger theoretical backing to understand literature.",

    "The course was very frustrating and I cannot see how it deepened my knowledge. I don't feel as if I've learned anything - instead the class has increased my level of frustration.",
    "I believe that learning linear algebra was useful and helped me in grasping many econometrics concepts, but the same concepts could have been explained without invoking matrices. I also found that the material most useful to me was taught very quickly and I don't feel confident about my knowledge about these last couple of lectures.",
    "This course teaches me the fundamental knowledge and tools in conducting in development economic researches."
