    "You will study novels written by Charlotte, Anne, and Emily Bronte and will work on your 20-25 pg. final paper. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class - even if you think you don't like the Brontes, I promise - Professor Peterson will make everything interesting!",
    "I would not recommend taking it if it's offered at 9:25am again because it's a long class and if you don't get the reading done, it's really hard to contribute. Overall a great class on the Bronte's and Peterson is super helpful with the long paper at the end of the term.",
    "If you like even one novel by one of the Bronte sisters, take this course!! The reading and workloads are reasonable, and the content is fun and engaging.",
    "If you enjoy any of the Bronte novels I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Peterson is wonderful and the work load is not too heavy.",
    "You end up with a greater understanding of the Victorian period, these female authors, and their place in the canon.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Peterson is great, and I now feel that I have a good sense of the Brontes' works."
