   "comments": [
    "Don't take it if you're looking for an easy QR. Extremely challenging.",
    "Yes! The class was very fun and interesting.",
    "Ugh no.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ115 with Professor Berry to any student interested in how the economy works. If you have never taken an economics class this is a great way to start, and Professor Berry makes the concepts applicable and clear.",
    "As many have said, the lectures are boring and the tests are pretty hard. Psets take serious work, but I guess it is good general knowledge to have in the future.",
    "It's worth taking this class. I'm a science person with no interest in ever working on Wall St. I'm also a junior. So there were moments, I felt like I was overwhelmed by freshman who plan to go into consulting or finance one day. But, it was still worth it. Berry is a great professor and makes things very clear. Sometimes he goes a bit slowly and reviews everything, but you'll be grateful he does if you ever miss class or if the material becomes tricky. I always left class feeling like I had a firm understanding of the material. Also while I think economic literacy is important no matter what you're interested in, I also enjoyed the class and it gave me a new, interesting way to look at the world.",
    "If you are ready to do the work, it's a great class. Sometimes PSets are tricky but fun. I would recommend the class because Econ is an essential part of one's life and education.",
    "Don't do it unless you have to.",
    "Definitely take it with professor Berry! The material's pretty interesting, the workload is minimal (one pset\/week), and it somehow changes the way you think\/plan your life\/maximize the utility of things. The course's quite pertinent to society as well, as Professor Berry brought up examples of real social issues, such as immigration control\/Obamacare\/pollution, etc. throughout the course. Just the appropriate amount of information, and the math involved was pretty simple. Professor does quite an extensive review of the previous lecture at the beginning of every class, so lectures usually move at a pretty slow pace.",
    "Take ECON 115 if it is required and if you are vaguely interested in economics. It's a good introduction to a field that you will quickly find is more applicable to all aspects of our lives than we would like to give it credit for.",
    "If you don't really know anything about econ you could, but if you don't think you are going to major in it there are probably better courses you could take.",
    "Definitely worth taking with Berry. Very engaging lecturer. Good way of reviewing previous material and explaining. Also drops two problem sets. Doesn't explain the math \/ logic best but definitely a good class and a good way of teaching material",
    "It is an interesting subject, but it was taught poorly and graded unfairly. Avoid Berry, beware of shitty TAs, and prepare to teach yourself the whole course and face hard exams.",
    "Yes! Not difficult, just optimization. You do not need calculus just 7th grade algebra. We only worked with lines the whole semester, finding their intercepts and intersection points.",
    "i wouldnt recommend it unless you have a genuine interest in econ or need to take it for something",
    "Econ 115 is a solid introduction to neoclassical microeconomic theory. The subject matter is neither particularly enthralling nor particularly accurate, and I think much more time should be devoted to market failures than actually was, particularly in light of 2008 and the patent failure of standard microeconomic theory to capture much of anything about real world economic phenomena. The professor could have brought in more real-world examples and empirical data to make the theoretical models more interesting and better illustrate their numerous flaws. Organizationally, the class was good. Take this class if required for a major; if you're looking for an interesting QR credit, look elsewhere.",
    "Use a tutor!",
    "I think everyone should take this class, but you will only get out what you put in. This class in particular.",
    "ECON 115 is just something you need to have taken. It has broad applications too. I saw parallels between economic modeling and ecological modeling.",
    "A solid survey of basic micro. You should take it; Berry is a good lecturer and a cool guy, it's not particularly hard as long as you go to lecture and do the problem sets, and even if you have no intention of being an econ major (which I do not), it's good foundational knowledge to have in order to be a politically\/economically literate person. You're at Yale, might as well take an econ course taught by a world-class prof. Even if you don't love the material you'll be glad you took it.",
    "I would recommend this class to all students, regardless of their background in economics or any learning of economics in high school. Regardless of experience, this class focuses on teaching the method behind the madness of microeconomics, with emphasis on why things work rather than just stating how they work.",
    "Sure, it's good general knowledge to have",
    "Professor Berry is a superb lecturer! Even though there are several hundred students in lecture, he manages to keep everyone engaged through both his interesting lectures and his great sense of humor. Econ 115 is a really great introduction to microeconomics. The class covers a wide range of topics in microeconomics and discusses how they can be applied to real-world policy questions. I would definitely recommend it, not only to students who are interested in economics, but also those interested in government and politics.",
    "Econ 115 is a useful course for anyone to take. Not too mathy, but worthwhile. Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Solid intro to Economics- engaging and accessible, though repetitive at times.",
    "Good but somewhat dry introductory economics course. Good QR. Generous scale. Worth taking if you're interested in econ.",
    "wait until berry is teaching, then take it!",
    "Intro Micro should definitely be taken, and if at all possible, with Prof. Berry. At times he alone carried the course when the material got challenging after the second midterm. There is a lot to be learned in this class.",
    "ECON 115 is a great introductory course to microeconomics. It gives an effective overview of the important theories, models, and concepts that economists use and care about, and is a good foundation on which to start building the skills and knowledge we need to be informed about economics. It is a rewarding class that is challenging but never unreasonable.",
    "More math than I thought. Graphs and equations on the regular. If you are math minded, this is an easy class. If you're not, it's a bit weird. The class is annoying at first, but at the end, you realize that you've learned some useful topics. Be prepared to live in la-la land for the first 10 weeks. It is only until the last few that real economic models are used, and they are still super basic.",
    "A great introductory course for those hoping to learn some basic economics. Very interesting material, even if you aren't planning on being an econ major. I enjoyed it and I am not planning on doing anything in the math or economics field.",
    "ECON 115 was a challenging course. Often, problem sets would include problems that were not explained or illustrated in lectures, making course work extremely frustrating. In addition, students with higher-level economics experience from high school have an extreme advantage, making it difficult for students with no economics experience to place high on the distributional curve of grades.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this class because you HAVE to, and you're not really into Econ, don't take this class! It requires work, and if you hate it, it's pretty hard to make yourself study, and you probably won't. Other than that, it's a pretty standard Intro Micro class.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115. It's a large lecture (250 ppl?) and be prepared to sit next to lots of jocks. But the material is interesting, the workload is quite low (weekly p-sets, no textbook reading at all), and the lectures are pretty interesting -- mostly due to Berry's humor and great personality. You don't need to have taken econ in high school to do well in this class. I think 40% of students get a-range grades, next 50% get b range. It's not very hard. TAKE IT WITH BERRY. Berry is GREAT. Charismatic. A really wonderful explainer. Evident passion. Funny. Couldn't have asked for a better teacher of a large lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially with steven berry as the professor.",
    "I think everyone should take the class. It is so relevant to everyday life.",
    "ECON 115 is a great class. It took me a while to understand some of the concepts, and it goes by pretty quickly in the lectures, but the class is a great one to understand the foundations of microeconomics. Professor Berry is great and uploads all the slides (plus many resources to study for tests) online. Take this class!",
    "I feel as though you have to kind of suffer through the intro classes to get to the higher level, more interesting classes. It does give you a solid foundation of microeconomics, but most of what we learned was about \"perfect competition\" which doesn't actually exist, so the abstractness of it annoyed me.",
    "This is definitely a good intro course. Not too much work. Professor Berry is a super great lecturer so I definitely recommend taking it with him if you can.",
    "Yes! Important topic to know!",
    "Econ 115 is a typical intro econ course. My guess is that you're taking it as a pre-req. I would still recommend it. It's a good class and a good class to have in your repertoire.",
    "It's not something someone takes because they want to, but rather because they have to.",
    "Depends. I liked the material insofar as it allowed me to see the world in a new way, but I wasn't keen on the math (it is not hard at all, just poorly explained) and the large lecture format really didn't work for me.",
    "Take this class with Berry! He will make it an interesting class. And it's useful to expose yourself to economics if you haven't before.",
    "If you're into econ, then I guess that I would recommend this class. The problem is, anyone taking this class probably has never taken econ before and does not know whether or not they are \"econ people.\" After taking this class, I have realized that I am definitively NOT an econ person, and thus wish I had not wasted a credit taking it. Nothing against the professors or TAs, I just was not naturally attracted to or intrigued by the subject material. So overall, you might want to weigh the costs versus benefits of taking this class and then decide for yourself.",
    "I took it as a fifth class--great choice for someone who likes quantitative thinking and wants to learn something brand new without having to work too too hard.",
    "Big lecture class, good intro to econ....easy to miss out on things or zone out during lecture. Important to stay on top of your material--take this if you are responsible and want a very basic introduction to microeconomics.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes! I think it is a gray way to see if someone really like economics without overwhelming someone's course load. I also think the class was fun and would be enjoyable and useful for almost anyone.",
    "Very standard. Berry is in general a good teacher. I took it for the QR credit, and I would recommend it to any looking for a QR who has not studied economics before, because the subject has broad, sometimes interesting applications.",
    "I would recommend it! A good easy intro class and a good social science credit.",
    "Take it if you want. It's not that much work, and I definitely learned stuff. Lectures boring at times",
    "Take this course if Professor Berry is teaching it!",
    "A great overview of fundamental micro econ tools. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in or has never been exposed to the material because it is an interesting class. It is not too difficult, and the course load is relatively light.",
    "Only if you have to take it. I took it for a QR, which was a big mistake. There are easier classes out there for that. Predictably difficult but the curve helps a lot.",
    "Take it with Professor Berry in spring semester, it's easier, if that is what you want. Economic is indeed a way of thinking.",
    "I would recommend it as Professor Berry was a good lecturer but it definitely has its drawbacks. (math issue yet again)",
    "Even if you aren't planning on being an Econ major, still take this course- it offers an interesting perspective on how we make individual economic decisions, the pros and cons of the free market system, and practical financial systems (such as insurance, investments, redistribution)",
    "For many, intro micro provides interesting, but often overly simple concepts, with pesky math to convolute everything. For me, it was satisfying to finally be able to apply concepts I had learned in calc classes to something with actual significance (what you do in class never extends beyond algebra, but the underlying math for these simple formulas comes from calculus). There are certainly easier QRs if that's your game, but this is more about being able to apply simple math to graphs than it is about difficult problem solving, so it is a good fit for a QR.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in Economics. The math is basic- if you can do algebra then you are set. If you know basic calc, then you will have a little advantage on some problems. Problem sets are not too bad, and Berry is a great professor.",
    "An overview of basic concepts in micro economics, from supply and demand to the way firms decide how to produce. Very interesting and will come in handy in most thing one wants to do.",
    "great course. not much work. very interesting.",
    "Yes just to take it and know the material\/ relevant terms that appear in other courses. But don't expect it to be a blast.",
    "Yes take this class as an intro econ class, but if you're really not interested in econ, don't take it.",
    "A basic introduction to microeconomic theory.",
    "Surprisingly, a very good class. If you are decently good at math, this class will be really easy for you. Nonetheless, I still found Berry's lectures to be engaging and interesting.",
    "Do you really need more advice on whether or not to take ECON 115? If you're on this page, you're probably just trying to decide between this and the econ seminar. Or maybe you're curious about why everyone and their mother feels obligated to take this class. But it's the micro lecture. What else is there to say? Professor Berry is pretty good, as friendly and engaging as possible for this huge class; the material often puts me to sleep in lecture, but whenever I give myself a couple hours to read over it the math-meets-human-behavior concepts are strikingly interesting (if oversimplified); it would be easier with calculus. I took this because it was a QR, because it's a supposed keystone of the Yale education, and because it would look good applying for Global Affairs. I am now genuinely curious in taking other econ classes past macro, and I might, but it's not at all a priority. Anyway... I forgot to mention that I did pretty bad in this class. It's hard. The curve is nice though. But you're not reading anymore, you already knew you were going to take this class before you graduated.",
    "It's a very interesting course!",
    "Definitely recommend, but it's also a prerequisite for basically everything social science or economics or math related so you have to anyways. Take it with Berry because he is such a great lecturer and is so good at making the material interesting. I've heard Udry is great too but I'm pretty sure Berry is just better. Also make sure you get Erik as your TF. He rocks. Section is optimal but GO TO SECTION -- or GO TO ERIK'S SECTION even if he isn't your TF. It's actually really useful and really helpful, even if you have the smallest, stupidest questions. Seriously, do it. The midterms and final aren't bad if you study, so go to section and ask the questions you have and you will be fine. Great class, overall!",
    "Pretty basic micro Econ. Math can get hard. But a useful class.",
    "Yes! Even if you are not an econ major take this! It will come in handy and was very interesting, even for a Humanities major.",
    "Steven Barry is great take it with him if you can.",
    "Well I really did not like this class, but I knew that going in as I am not an econ or math person. I should not have taken this class for a QR, there was a lot of math. I also took it out of some vague sense of obligation to know things about econ which was probably a bad idea. I still learned some interesting theoretical stuff, but I will never remember the math or graphs. Exams were kind of a nightmare. That said, if you are an econ minded person you will probably enjoy it. Seems like a pretty standard intro class.",
    "This class is what it is--a large, introductory lecture class that works for some and not for others. Lectures can be bland (although Professor Berry makes them probably as interesting and informative as they can be), and section will repeat what you learned in lecture. Try to make the best of it if it's a prerequisite for something, but I wouldn't recommend that you take it for fun (unless supply and demand really tickle your fancy).",
    "Prof. Berry was enthusiastic throughout the course which made the material more interesting to learn. The TAs were also really helpful.",
    "The out-of-class lecture slides don't cover nearly as much as the oral lectures do, so go to class. Do the practice tests though, since the solutions are so comprehensive you could probably learn everything just from those.",
    "Yes, I would. I think it contains some vital information that all people should have a grounding in. It was well run, and Professor Berry certainly makes it as entertaining as it possibly could be.",
    "I would recommend it for a basic economics understanding",
    "I would reccomend to anyone who is interested in how the market works and what's to be informed about economics. Helps you become a more informed citizen and voter. Not a large work load. A straightforward class but work hard on the problem sets and study for the tests. You will get out of the class what you put into it. Not very dazzling, but it gets the job done. Take it with berry if you can.",
    "Its a very good introductory course and even those who don't want to study economics should at least consider it.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 for another student. I believe that having even a minimal amount of econ knowledge is important in today's globalized world, and this class is a great introduction.",
    "A solid introduction to find out if econ would be an interest for you.",
    "This course is a great introductory course to economics. It is not a \"gut\" class, but the material is engaging and the problem sets are very reasonable. I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a fundamental econ class that will get you thinking a bit more about the way microeconomics might really work.",
    "I would describe it as a good introductory overview of microeconomics. I definitely would recommend it to another student because it doesn't get too complicated, but gets in depth enough to understand certain processes of economics.",
    "I loved the course. I would definitely recommend it because it covered some very basic and practical yet interesting material. It was a straightforward lecture class with PSETs due every week, and I liked its simple structure. There are some larger concepts in this course that I learned and understood that I know will help me later on. It was a great course.",
    "A very standard economics course. People may say this class is hard, but that is probably only because they don\u2019t know how to do basic algebra. IF you know how to do basic algebra, this course will be the easiest SO or QR credit you can ever get. But just because this course is super easy doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not well-taught. The course notes are very thorough (meaning you don't always have to go to class), lectures are very good at reiterating content for those that just don\u2019t get the lesson the first time through, and the textbook was very relevant to the course. And if you have never taken econ before, you will still learn things! Take it with Prof. Berry!",
    "This is an average workload course that requires your attention. If you put the work in and are interested in economics this will be an enjoyable course. And just because you hated econ in high school does not mean you won't like this course!!",
    "Basic micro for those who have no formal econ background; apparently macro is much more enjoyable so you can look forward to that. Some interesting concepts but not enough depth to be super helpful.",
    "Take this is you are interesting in Econ, and take it Cr\/D if you are not an econ major. The lecture is huge, so it's easy to slack off. Unless you are super studious, don't over estimate your capabilities of skipping every lecture.",
    "It is essential to take micro, regardless of your major, just because it is an area of knowledge that will be used later. It is very practical and grounded in daily life. Professor Berry is a really nice guy. Lectures tend to be a little dull though. It is an average course, not too good, not too bad, but the things you learn are important.",
    "Erik was a great TF and really helped by answering the questions we had from lecture.",
    "If you have to take econ, take it. If you don't have to take econ, it is very boring.",
    "It is a good foundational course. I would recommend it.",
    "Definitely recommend if you're interested in econ\/marketing\/finance at all. Teaches you a lot about decision making in all types of companies, and the basics of the economy. Even though it was a large lecture, it moved at quick enough pace to be engaging. The problem sets are very fair, and don't take up a large amount of time. Great class!",
    "If you're into drawing a lot of graphs, economics, and the like, go for it. I think it does the basics fine enough, and I know most of us who want to pursue economics or the like have to take it anyway. It's not that painful, though I've heard from a number of other students that what we learn in intro micro and macro is not that useful. Just take it with Professor Berry and get it over with.",
    "take it if you want an intro to microecon. simple enough.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this class to another student because I felt like it gave me a great base for the rest of my economic endeavors",
    "I am definitely recommending that fellow students take ECON 115. The topics we cover in the class are applicable (indeed, critical) to other disciplines.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Professor Berry was engaging and clear.",
    "Econ 115 is very hard. Make sure you attend lecture and do all the problem sets.",
    "i would definitely recommend the course to my fellow student. It provide us the foundational tools to understand the market, and the ability to apply concepts by intuition. It's not all about maths but more about intuition. Once you are on the right track, you have a much clearer sense about how market and firms work, and how consumers make their choices based on their taste and market. The \"invisible hand\" manipulating the market is pretty cool. The difference between efficiency and equity is also astonishing. Generally it's funny to think about the cases as an economist.",
    "Yes, but it is difficult",
    "I think Econ 115 is a great class to take\u2014especially if, like me, you have no prior knowledge of economics and want to get a basic vocabulary and framework to work with. Professor Berry is an engaging and personable lecturer. Section depends on your TF, but it isn't required. The work load isn't bad\u2014 a weekly p-set\u2014 but it will pile up around the three tests if you aren't keeping up. My main frustration with the class was that we weren't allowed to use calculus. Three paragraphs of text in the book to skirt around the word derivative... I understand that this is done to make the class accessible to more people, and to make sure that students understand the concepts without using mathematical tricks they've learned in other classes, but if you've taken even the beginning of introductory calc, prepare to find this a little annoying.",
    "Econ 115 is a standard course for introducing a student to economics, a course whose strength is measured mostly by the strength of its instructor rather than on the basis of the course material. I personally feel students (particularly US citizens) have a civic obligation to take both introductory micro and macroeconomics in order to make informed political decisions (as the economy is the largest factor in electoral decisions). Thus, I would recommend it on that basis alone. However, were I to put my personal obligations aside, I'd likely advise my fellow students to take the course based on their preexisting interest in the course: if one has no inclinations towards economics, Econ 115 is not likely to change one's mind.",
    "Awesome! Take this section of you're looking for a good intro to ECON class.",
    "In ECON 115, you use fake math to solve the same problem over and over again. Given a constraint you have to maximize a quantity. They don't teach the course with calculus in a bid to make things easier, but of course without calculus the material makes zero sense. The class is boring and you'll feel hugely embarrassed when you screw up the exams because they're easy."
