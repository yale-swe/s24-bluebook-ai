    "LOVE Jan. LOVE german because of him. A lot of studying on your own but it's worth it!",
    "Definitely take the class! German culture and language is amazing,funny and interesting. You'll have an awesome time learning about a totally different culture. The workload is manageable and all you need is practice!Would definitely take L1 again if I could!",
    "Only take this class with Jan!",
    "Jan is a very enthusiastic teacher and very open to suggestion. The work is manageable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! It's a lot of fun.",
    "German 110 provides a great introductory exposure to the language, but it struggles to reinforce what it teaches. German's a fascinating language, and Elementary German I provides a pretty solid introduction to some basic vocabulary, grammar, and culture. But the course moves very, very quickly; German 110 meets every day, new material is introduced every day, and review of old material is minimal. It's kind of extraordinary, how much inforamtion we managed to cover as a class, but how little I really understand or feel comfortable using. An easy solution to this problem might be to make more worksheets with their answer keys available for practice outside of the classroom, or substitute the time-consuming and ineffective online exercises with written exercises in a workbook.",
    "I would definitely recommend this section to a beginning German student due to the holistic approach in terms of grammar and contemporary context.",
    "If you are interested in learning the basics of german take it."
