   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you want to major in mathematics, physics or computer science, or you want to train your logic skills.",
    "Math 225 provided a good introduction to linear algebra, as well as to the general technique of mathematical proofs. Professor Qi is a clear and engaging instructor with a love for his topic and a sense of humor. The workload is certainly manageable, and the exams fair. I certainly would recommend this class as it gives you a good grasp of the theory and workings of linear algebra rather than simply presenting formulas and focusing on computation.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Professor Qi is an amazing person, and the course covers a wide variety of materials and is extremely well taught.",
    "It is a good introduction to proof-based mathematics and linear algebra. I would definitely recommend this class for students to see if they like proof-based mathematics.",
    "Yes. It is not an easy math, so take it at your own risk if you are not very good at math. But it is not extremely challenging either.",
    "This is an excellent formal introduction to linear algebra and proof based math in general. The lecture at times can get confusing but the textbook is very well done, so if you follow along with the reading you'll be fine. This is a great way to get an intro to writing proofs while learning linear at the same time. From what I've heard, definitely go for this over 222.",
    "Weekly homeworks, one midterm 30% and a final. Homeworks are not worth much but it's where you need to do all your solidifying of material. also, reading through the book is necessary to follow the class. I would recommend attending office hours, and starting psets early. I had never taken lin alg, and I found this course quite challenging. It's proof-based nature is really cool if you are into that\/want to give it a try.",
    "I would recommend Math 225 for those that are interested in improving their familiarity with math as well as their math skills. That said, Math 225 is definitely not for those who will not treat it as a priority. Unless said person is a veritable genius, Math 225 will be a challenging course, both in terms of time consumption and material. The textbook is no longer a user-friendly, graphic-heavy textbook of math levels past, but a serious, probably-typed-up-in-LaTeX book, and it is not written to be friendly to the reader, but to make sure what is said is said in the most precise and correct manner. As a person who did treat Math 225 as a priority, it was a greatly rewarding and exhilarating experience.",
    "This course did a really nice job of establishing the fundamentals for other math courses. But only take MATH 225 if you are really interested in proofs and rather disinterested in applications.",
    "Yes, but only if it helps you for major requirements.",
    "Don't do it unless you really want to major in (pure) math... I took it as a prospective Applied Math major and it was overkill.",
    "This is a solid Linear Algebra course for people who are interested in proofs and understanding the logic. Be warned - the second half of the course goes by much more quickly than the first half. Professor Qi did a great job with providing clear and cohesive examples, and the problem sets are generally doable. I highly recommend finding a few other students to work together for review and homework checking as needed through the course; it will make it much more enjoyable. This course is very focused on understanding concepts and proofs, and not so much in the application of matrices (in my opinion). If you are looking for a course that would teach you the nitty gritty details of Gram Schmidt and SVD, with lots of practice, then perhaps consider another course (222?). However, if you want to engage with the core ideas of how Linear Algebra works and what is its relationship to linear maps, then this is a great course.",
    "As I said before, I would only recommend the class if you have an interest in higher mathematics. It was a hard and worthwhile experience though.",
    "I found the textbook much more helpful than lectures, but maybe that was because it was a nine o'clock, and I don't function that early in the morning. Be warned that you will need to attend lecture even if you don't find it helpful because of pop quizzes. Overall the class is of reasonable difficulty, and you get a lot of practice working with proofs. Professor Qi knows the material well and throws great jokes into lecture to keep things lively. He was really helpful when I went to see him during office hours even though I sometimes had a hard time following what he said during lecture. Overall it was a good class, and I'm glad I took it.",
    "I really wouldn't recommend this class unless it's required or you're already quite adept at theoretical proofs. I came in hoping to learn linear algebra on a more theoretical level and how to write proofs, but I felt like I was just thrown into it without much explanation or help. We were simply assigned problems for homework, we didn't have any kind of solution guide, and later, Professor Qi would just expect you to know how to prove any similar proof to the kinds you did on homework assignments. If you tried reaching out to either him for help, his explanations often were confusing \/ his tone would make it sound like this should have been obvious.",
    "If you have an interest in learning higher math (abstract concepts; proofs) definitely go for this class. It is very hard, and the concepts are not quite intuitive. However with a fair amount of work you can do well in this class (homework grading is very easy and exams are easier than lecture might make you believe). If you want to take linear to learn linear (or need it solely for a requirement), take 222. But if you want to do \"real\" math, do 225. As hard as this class was, I am very glad I took it and put in the work that I did (as well as waking up at 9am and groggily dragging myself down Hillhouse); it really opened my eyes to the world of mathematics beyond calc.",
    "I would recommend Math 225 to anyone who is interested in taking a linear algebra course that has more rigorous math. The time spent on the course per week may change depending on the problem set. It also should not require a strong background in making proofs. As the course material is cumulative, you can also gain a better sense of proofs as the course progresses.",
    "Math 225 is a challenging and time-intensive course. If you like math a lot, its definitely a great introduction to linear algebra; however, you must be willing to spend some time with the material. It is nice though to learn about why matrices and their properties are defined as they are. Furthermore, I have learned a lot about constructing mathematical proofs.",
    "Good intro to writing proofs and linear algebra, which I hadn't had experience with before.",
    "If you want to take linear algebra, it's not a terrible class just be prepared to do a lot of the work outside of class if you actually want to learn things well.",
    "Math 225 gives a more theoretical approach to linear algebra and will challenge you without breaking you."
