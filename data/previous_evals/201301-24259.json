   "comments": [
    "If you like programming, then may be you'll like this class. It would be nice if we did more of the application of the material in say medicine, etc. But a nice intro to the field overall.",
    "I really enjoyed this class because I do research in theoretical chemistry, and I felt that this class provided the basic information about theoretical chemistry that I had not picked up from just running calculations. It's not very much work (just 4 homework assignment) but each homework assignment takes a long time between troubleshooting the program (BOSS), navigating the output file, and finding references. Definitely find your reference first before running a calculation.The last time this class was offered before this semester was 3 years ago, and I don't know when Prof. Jorgensen plans to offer the class again. You might want to take that into consideration as you're choosing your chemistry electives.",
    "Good comprehensive course, but the professor covered a lot of material extremely quickly. I did not understand a lot of what he was lecturing about, but I came out with a basic knowledge of BOSS."
