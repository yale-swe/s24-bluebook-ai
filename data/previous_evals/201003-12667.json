    "If you are reading this evaluation, you probably are qualified to take Third-Year Russian. Take it. This is the first Russian language course I took in Yale and I must say that I absolutely loved it. Prof. Muravnik knows his stuff and can draw little maps of St Petersburg on the board while explaining how so-and-so were going to such-and-so place and happened to pass by this and that... also, he has lots of little comments on word usage and interesting observations on how Russian emigres use words differently, and so on, which helps you a lot stylistically. I expect that, besides the grammar and verbs (two textbooks), the course material will change, but we read Chekhov's \"Lady with a Little Dog\" and Karpovich's lecture on 19th-century Russian history. Prof. Muravnik used these not so much for the content as to expose us to a great deal of passive vocabulary and a core amount of really useful active vocabulary. I took an hour to read the first page of Karpovich, so bad were my reading skills then, but now I can actually use the phrases I learnt from it - this is the kind of course where you get as much out of it as you put in. While I felt really intimidated and out of my depth at the very beginning, especially verbally, I quickly grew into the class and improved more than I imagined I could.",
    "Of course that I would recommend the course to another student! I really like the language and enjoyed the course a lot. At the beginning we filled these little forms about our interests and Prof. Muravnik adjusted the readings according to our preferences. We began with Chekhov's 'The Lady With The Dog' and ended with Karpovich's survey of Russian history. The written and oral exams are not too stressful. Prof. Muravnik would give us review sheets and practice questions before each exam and we would go over them together.Also, Prof. Muravnik has a very useful method of teaching vocabulary. He always explains the ethymology of a given word so that we associate it with a familiar word of the same root and it doesn't sound so weird and unusual any more.",
    "Very much! It's a great class, you learn a lot, and it's never tremendously stressful. The trifecta.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "This is an advanced class for L5 Russian speakers. You build vocab and grammar from reading. I wold definitely recommend it to students who have completed L4. You definitely take from the class whatever you put into it."
