   "comments": [
    "FREN 140 is almost exactly the same as 130, only more fun. You still have the course packet work to do and usually some sort of supplementary reading or a film to watch. I think the teacher makes all the difference. I hated 130 with a passion and absolutely loved 140. Definitely take this class with Skorupa if you can. She is so sweet, so understanding and tries so hard to help her students. If you have a lot of other work due and French assignment due the same day, email her and she'll give you an extension with no penalty. She brought crepes and other great homemade foods to class about half a dozen times during the semester. She does a great job providing you with all of the materials you need to do well on the exams and will make extra worksheets or lists if you ask for them. Overall, best French teacher at Yale.",
    "French 140 is a continuation of French 130, just with more reading. I thought it was a standard French course, with daily assignments (worksheets and audio recordings), biweekly oral\/written tests, compositions for the end of each unit, and individual presentations at the end of the semester. I enjoyed the readings and the films that we watched; it was nice being able to read longer pieces of French literature.",
    "You either have to take this class for a requirement or are really into French. Either way, it's a lot of work, but pretty rewarding \u2013 my french is definitely a lot better than when I started. The books are also generally more enjoyable than in L3. There are plenty of good professors out there, but Mme. Skorupa is fantastic! She's super caring (I can't even count the number of times she baked for us...), and just a great explainer in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking French 140 with Mme Skorupa! I would tell a fellow student that it is a great course for becoming a confident speaker in French.",
    "This is a solid language course and Madame Skorupa is wonderful. She's very approachable and goes out of her way to help you with whatever you're struggling with (and brought our class delicious baked goods!)",
    "I enjoyed L4 French even though I took it as a requirement. My proficiency improved greatly and I love that you can only speak french in the classroom. It is a heavy workload and meets everyday but it allows you to get into L5 that only meets 3 times a week.",
    "Take this course! Continue french, it's a beautiful language.",
    "Definitely. You've come this far.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to fellow students. We got into literature and film, which kept the learning experience interesting."
