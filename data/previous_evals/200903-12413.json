    "This is the best seminar I've taken in my time at Yale. The readings are fantastic, Professor McCrea is insightful, approachable, and a skilled discussion leader, and the conversations were consistently engaging and eye-opening.",
    "This is not a class on social context or marxist literary criticism. It is a nuanced discussion of class and desire in a series of excellent novels (from 17th cent-20th), focusing primarily on the use of language in the novels.",
    "Excellent, excellent class. Professor McCrea is an amazing discussion leader and the syllabus rocked my socks off. You read about a novel a week, so be prepared to spend your Sundays curled up with a book--it's totally worth it.",
    "The reading list has a way of making the argument for the class. Professor McCrea chose the books well--all of them were interesting and we even had a thriller thrown in the mix. The discussions are well-led and Professor McCrea has great things to say. He also leaves most of the class time for student responses. Highly recommended professor.",
    "Great syllabus: The Brothers Grimm, Freud, Defoe, Beaumarchais, Austen, Balzac, Maupassant, Waugh, Highsmith, Bassani, Burgess, Ishiguro",
    "Definitely recommend. The broad theme is looking at middle-class characters who have some kind of interaction with the upper-class world - whether they are trying to move into it, marry into it, or commit crimes against it. Start in the 1700s with Defoe, jumping around between countries, and end up with the contemporary Iziguro. One book a week, only about 200 pages, and two papers - totally manageable workload. So it ended up being just really fun and interesting and not stressful - nice change of pace.",
    "If you can cope with meeting two hours at 9:20 on monday mornings, take it.",
    "Take any class with Barry McCrea, but only Cr\/D\/F. His class and his syllabus are both wonderful, but not his grading. Still, Class&Desire in the Novel was a great experience, with an enjoyable and provocative lineup of books that I actually want to reread after college.",
    "good readings. definitely a lit class, not an english class. less close reading and more broad content analysis. read a novel for each class - about 250 pages each class.",
    "Yes, definitely. Great reading list, great discussions.",
    "Good course. I don't know that I have strong enough feelings about it to recommend either way. I enjoyed taking a course with McCrea though, and I'd say that most of our class felt the same.",
    "This is a great class. Professor McCrea is extremely intelligent and engaging (although he might seem a bit formal at first) and really understands the material we read. The books are all great reads, and the understanding you leave the classroom with is incredibly valuable. I recommend this not only for those specifically studying literature, but also for students who are interested to see what power and insight books can hold in our culture."
