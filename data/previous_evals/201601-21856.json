   "comments": [
    "Took it for a Sc credit. Kavathas is nice, but not a particularly compelling lecturer. Material is fairly interesting, you just need to take the time to learn it. Most certainly not a gut, but also not too difficult.",
    "Discussion section complemented the lectures very nicely. However, we could have gone over the lecture material in a more systematic week-by-week way, instead of focusing on plot summaries of the cultural history longform articles\/books. More \"science-oriented\" sections (i.e. lecture reviews) would have been a more helpful approach for me, personally, and a more constructive\/useful way to spend time during section.",
    "YES TAKE THE CLASS",
    "This class is the PERFECT science distribution requirement. You will genuinely enjoy it and actually want to go to lecture. Don't let the science-y terms dissuade you from taking the course because you will seriously miss out.",
    "This class is great for a humanities\/non-science major who needs the science credit, but also doesn't want to take a gut. You learn a lot about immunology, but it's interesting and useful, especially if you like biology.",
    "Take this class! You'll be glad you did.",
    "The exams contained a lot of information, but the class itself was interesting.",
    "Great Science credit for a non science major. Not a gut, but Paula does a great job of explaining the sciency material. The books you read for section add a public health to the course that substantiates lecture material. It's also super cool to learn about the immune system, like the specifics of how HIV\/AIDS works. This course wasn't life changing, but I would recommend it as a low stress science credit.",
    "Awesome class! Must take!",
    "A scones credit for non science majors. You learn a lot without being overalls stressed. Highly recommend.",
    "An excellent course detailing the basics of immunity with an amazing professor (Paula is wonderful) and extremely competent and dedicated TAs! Best SC credit for a non-major at Yale -- highly recommended.",
    "This is a good science class for non-majors. Basically, it's a lot of memorization. The thing that makes it bearable is that Prof. Kavathas is really wonderful and clearly passionate about her subject, and that we go into the human aspect of disease as well.",
    "Great teacher!",
    "I absolutely LOVED this class!! It an amazing introduction to an important current topic of immunology! I would most definately recommend it because it is managable, well taught and interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It's extremely interesting for both science and non-science majors. I did not have an extensive background in biology, but Professor Kavathas, who is fabulous, provided us with all of the information we needed during the first half of the course. Take the class if you can!!",
    "MCDB 109 is a great course! The material is interesting, and it is definitely applicable and important in everyday life. While some topics can be difficult, I found it rewarding to learn them. Professor Kavathas is a major asset to the course; she is not only an interesting and engaging lecturer, but also a kind and caring person, and she really puts in a lot of effort to make the course great. I would recommend the course to another student, especially to someone who has a basic biology background but is interested in an in-depth introduction to the immune system and infectious disease.",
    "I would recommend for students with a strong interest in bio.",
    "I think it's a good science credit that isn't too strenuous. Professor Kavathos was great and very engaged with the students. Sometimes lectures were a little boring, but overall the material was accessible and she does a good job of making the topics and assignments varied.",
    "If you're interested in the relationship of medicine\/science to society, definitely look into it - especially the readings are interesting (and substantial).",
    "Solid as a rock.",
    "A look a the immune system and what can go wrong."
