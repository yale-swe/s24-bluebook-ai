    "Take this class if you want. You won't be surprised if you've taken Chinese at Yale.",
    "Yes, if we want to continue Chinese",
    "This is a really good, solid class. There is a considerable amount of work, but it is mostly reasonable. Shen laoshi is great. I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is a lot of work and is difficult, but if you are willing\/able to devote time to it, you will enjoy it. The class can be fun and is not too serious\/strict.",
    "Chinese 155 is pretty much the same course as Chinese 154. It's a good way to keep up your Chinese if you're returning from study in China. Of course, you can't really hope to learn at the pace you did when you were abroad, but that's more due to being in an English speaking country and relegating Chinese to a one-credit, meets-three-times-a-week course, than any weakness of the course itself. I did find that, even though I feel my speaking skills didn't improve much, I think my reading skills definitely did. You learn a bunch of vocabulary that you may not internalize well enough to use in speaking or your own writing, but will definitely recognize and understand when reading a newspaper or short story.",
    "This class is fine for maintaining your Chinese, and my reading and writing ability did improve. Coming from 150, though, I felt that there was a real drop in my speaking ability, because about 2\/3 of the classes consist of Shen Laoshi explaining grammar, with no speaking opportunities, and the tutorial didn't do much to help this problem. But the workload is very reasonable, and Shen Laoshi is understanding if you're having trouble with anything.",
    "Good class if you want to improve your chinese. Not very hard. You will learn vocab and grammar.",
    "Shen Laoshi is wonderful. She is very accommodating and genuinely cares about your progress. There is ample opportunity to talk in Chinese, which is good for keeping you practicing your spoken Chinese while in New Haven.",
    "An excellent fourth-year course. The pace is just right, and the teacher is wonderful. It teaches written Chinese very effectively, and develops students' abilities to read and understand newspaper and journal articles. There is less emphasis on speaking in class, although weeklyTA sessions help with this. The structure is usually reading one article or story per week, with daily quizzes on the basic content, a weekly vocab quiz and a weekly discussion\/debate.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone taking Chinese who is at the appropriate level. its a great course taught by a wonderful professor. what better reason?"
