    "Although it ended up being a much larger time commitment than I originally thought it would be, the work was interesting and it was an excellent learning experience. Professor Donohue and James Kwak are not only great project leaders, but also very enjoyable to work with. Highly recommended.",
    "This was really not so much a class as a mechanism to receive graded credit for assisting with Professor Donohue's expert report. If you approach it with that in mind, as I did, it's an enjoyable experience.",
    "This was not a typical YLS class in that there was no regular meeting time or common reading material. It was supporting John Donohue's work as an expert witness in a Connecticut death penalty challenge. Donohue is a warm and wonderful professor, and his student leader of the project was organized and was a great supervisor."
