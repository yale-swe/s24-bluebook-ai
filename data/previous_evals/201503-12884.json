   "comments": [
    "Good introduction to cognitive science. Dean Ruiz is a good teacher and I would recommend taking the class if she teaches it again (the previous teacher didn't get the best reviews). The exams tested some very specific things, but overall if you studied the slides you should do fine.",
    "CogSci is an interesting survey of current research in cognitive science which will pique your interest for further coursework in the field. Essentially all the information you need to know for the class is in the lecture notes with the readings adding a research context to the concepts discussed in class. The exams are straightforward and you will leave the class with an appreciation for the subtleties with which the human mind functions in everyday life.",
    "This is a great introductory class to cognitive science. A variety of topics are covered so there will definitely be something that interests you. I found every topic interesting.",
    "Very good introductory course to cognitive science. Covered a lot of interesting topics. I would recommend this class because its very interesting and a good starting point.",
    "Take it if you want a general overview of topics in cognitive science.",
    "This class is great; the information is interesting, the tests were straightforward, and altogether it was a nice experience. Worst part was that it was at 9am.",
    "I would recommend cognitive science if the student need a social science credit or possibly interested in majoring cognitive science, also if they would just like to learn more about cognitive science and what it is. It is a good introduction course and not too much of a time commitment.",
    "Yes, take it if you like psychology",
    "A really easy class. Great Credit\/D.",
    "This class is a good course for freshman. The information is exciting , but it requires a lot of reading. Take if you can!",
    "I wouldn't rate this course any higher than Intro Psych, and may rate it a little lower. If you want a general introduction to psychology and\/or cognitive science, I'd recommend you shop both courses (independent of which topic you think you're more drawn to; the content in both courses is very similar) and make your decision based on who is teaching. I definitely wouldn't recommend taking both Intro Psych and Intro Cog Sci. You'll just end up rather bored for 1\/2 to 3\/4 of the lectures in whichever class you take second.",
    "I would recommend CGSC 110 to another student if they have any interest whatsoever in cognitive science, psychology, or neuroscience.",
    "An overview of cognitive science topics. Lectures are interesting and taught with enthusiasm. Readings are not as interesting, but they have large overlap with lecture, so they can be skimmed with little consequence. Tests are unfortunately memorization focused. Other than that, a good experience.",
    "I would not really recommend this course to others. Only really first semester freshmen.",
    "Great and interesting class. Definitely recommend taking even just to get a sense of other fields that may interest a student.",
    "Intro to Cog Sci discusses many of the topics of intro to psych but it focuses more on the brain and thinking. Some topics include social cognition, language, memory, vision, morality, decision making and more. I would definitely recommend it to another student since the material is very interesting and Professor Ruiz keeps the class engaged. Also, relatively low course load is a plus.",
    "PSYC 130 01 is a good introductory class in the subject of cognitive science and opens up some interesting speculations for students interested in majoring in that field. It provides basic knowledge in the topics covered by cognitive science and offers some insight into research and studies done. I would recommend this class to another student as it is an interesting class to consider.",
    "To be totally honest, I didn't go to lecture for much of the semester because lecture was at 9am. Now, the ones I *did* go to were fun. I mean it's an intro course. The material stays shallow enough to be interesting while not too challenging. I studied for about 12 hours total for all three exams just reading lecture notes and skimming\/reading papers. I took it because I thought I would learn something new about cognitive science--while I did learn a lot that I didn't before, there were no mindshattering revelations--just a series of observations and experiments that amounted to an amalgamation of findings from psychology and neurobiology that happened to do with the mind. It's fun stuff, but it's probably not going to change your world. Take it if you need a course with a small workload--or if you are genuinely interested in the course. The grading seemed arbitrary sometimes on the exams--there were points taken off for not including small details that weren't actually asked for in the question--but it probably seemed that way to me because I didn't go to enough of the lectures or spend enough time studying. Also, learn your ta's name. It helps :).",
    "Intro to CogSci is such a fun course! There isn't much work beyond reading, so it's a great class to help balance out intense workloads in other courses. It's also really interesting, and hits subjects as diverse as sexual attraction and machine learning. Overall, it gives a great overview of cognitive science, whether or not you're interested in pursuing cognitive science as a major.",
    "I would summarize CGSC 110 as very interesting and engaging. I would recommend CGSC 110 to another student because it was an overall great course that taught me a lot. It was an enjoyable experience.",
    "A fantastic course. Really interesting, and a great way to fill an open spot on your schedule without committing to an extreme amount of work.",
    "Interdisciplinary and exciting. Good course for many different majors. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Good intro class, similar to a lot of other psych classes. Interesting if you're into psychology. 3 short midterms and 1 5-7 page paper. Reading is confusing and unnecessary. Not too much work at all especially if you go to lecture and take good notes. Good class overall.",
    "Very interesting and basic understanding of cognitive science. Would recommend.",
    "I'd recommend this to anyone who needs a science credit, or is interested in psych at all. It is a normal big intro course and exactly what you'd expect. I took it as a senior, and found it very manageable and interesting. My roommate took it as a freshman before she had adjusted to college style courses and found it much harder.",
    "A good summary course for anyone with no previous experience in cognitive science\/psychology.",
    "I would say CGSC is a standard survey lecture course that is great for an introduction to cognitive science. For people who are considering the CogSci major, I would recommend it. Overall, I found the material itself very interesting. However, I would recommend taking the course with a different professor, because it might be more engaging that way. For people not interested in specifically cognitive science, I might recommend taking intro to psych instead, because the material might be similar but the professors are more renowned and known to be fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who would possibly be considering Cognitive Science or Psychology as a field of study, as it covers a broad range of topics within these fields.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. The material and the readings are very interesting, and if you do the work you can do well in the class. There is a good amount of overlap with Psych 110, but this class is less conceptual. If you take them both at the same time, Psych 130 is a bit easier.",
    "I think this is a great course to take regardless of what you plan to major in. Everything taught is relevant in life everyday and could be cool to know.",
    "Engaging lectures!",
    "It's a good course for introducing cognitive science to a non-psychology major, and a nice review for a psychology major. Overall, I would recommend this class.",
    "This class is great- take it! The material is fascinating, the readings are very manageable, and Professor Ruiz is beyond wonderful!",
    "I would recommend Intro to Cognitive Science to other students. It is a great way to see if you are interested in cognitive science, and even if you aren't interested in pursuing the major, it is a useful course in which you will find many applications.",
    "Amazing introductory course. Overall the course succeeded in its purpose (brining out interests in the field for students)",
    "good intro course if you are going to major in cognitive science, interesting course to take even if you're not",
    "An overview of cognitive science, with a focus on its interdisciplinary nature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to my fellow students. While it was not the easiest class I took this semester, it was one of my favorites as the material was always interesting and related to a variety of topics.",
    "Its a class where you learnt volumes of information that can help you.",
    "This is truly a survey class with each lecture covering different topics, so it is often difficult to piece these topics together to determine a general path of the course. Instead of a textbook, there are a lot of article readings, some of which are incredibly long and obscure. These articles often play a small part in the midterms, and you end up only needing to write about some of the many that you read for each exam. The lecture is large and impersonal, but that's as expected for an intro course.",
    "This class is a good introduction to what cognitive science is and why it is important. Do not expect any sort of in-depth explanation of how things really work in the brain, but basic overviews of certain exciting topics that cognitive science covers. I would recommend this class to a student who has already studied psychology and wishes to understand the ways in which cognitive science plays a role in the interactions of humans in society.",
    "Even though this class was at 9am, and I had to force myself to go to get up and go, the class was still pretty interesting and once in lecture, it was easy to become engaged with the material. There was definitely overlap if you've taken psych courses before, but it was still a good class.",
    "Introduction to Cognitve Science is a well organized, heavy loaded classes that covers a variety of topics, some more In depth that others. I has a heavier work load that other courses but is definitely worth your time if you find cognitive science interesting and are looking to peruse it as a major.",
    "Good survey course of cog sci, although apparently with a lot of overlapping content in intro psych",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in cognitive science or psychology. I feel like I learned a lot about many different studies and different topics, and have a better understanding of how they brain works and how we function as individuals. Additionally, Professor Ruiz was a highly mediated professor who was very passionate about the subject matter and very motivated to help all her students. I would highly recommend this class!",
    "Alright class, but lack of section hurt me personally. If you're not a good learner in lectures, then don't take it.",
    "an excellent overview of the various trends in cognitive sciences. I took it simultaneously with PSYC 110 and while there is a fair degree of overlap, they come at the material from different enough perspectives that I feel like I have a really strong understanding of the information presented.",
    "A brief overview of a diverse range of topics in Cognitive Science. Not detail oriented, more just giving students an idea of what's going on in the field.",
    "Basic introductory lecture to Cognitive Science. The course covers a nice survey of topics to peak interest for later study. Manageable workload (the lightest of my semester) and fun content.",
    "It gives you a general overview of how cognitive science is a multidisciplinary field, and through discussion of specific fields of research, we were able to see how the different disciplines all work together to synthesize knowledge about the brain.",
    "Strengths: material was clearly presented, guest lecturers were sweet, help was easily accessible Weaknesses: exams were nitpicky, as the MCs were highly specific on information that may not have popped out as a main theme (aka study everything, esp brain parts). Unless you love most of the topics, not worth a 9 am class. Intro Psych was so much better for me. Cog Sci and Psyc are interelated and if you're trying to decide which one to major in, I would compare the syllabi of the intro classes and glance at the rest of the classes in the major and just with the one that you find more interesting. I wouldn't recommend, but if you're a Psyc Major, it's this or the notorious Human Brain. Thomas OConnell (TF) was super informative and responded quickly and specifically even through email as long as you had actual questions, other TFs helped me digest information in long papers you may not have the time to read in depth.",
    "Cognitive Science is a perfect way to understand more about yourself and the way in which you interact with your fellow humans. I would absolutely recommend this course."
