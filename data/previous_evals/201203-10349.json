   "comments": [
    "I would say it is a good course that will provide a decent background in post-colonial African history. I would not recommend it for someone hoping to learn from a professor whose expertise is in Africa, since the professor barely spoke. I would recommend it for someone who loves discussion with peers.",
    "This class will deepen your understanding of the post-colonial (or post-postcolonial) condition in Africa and probably elsewhere. The reading list features a lot of thought-provoking material (Fanon, Ferguson which unfortunately got cut because of the hurricane, Gleijeses, Piot). The time commitment is intense, though; with required responses each week, skipping readings is not really an option.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course for someone interested in Africa. However I would warn them that there are a lot theoretical concepts discussed.",
    "A challenging but varied run through major concepts in late and post colonial African thinking. Expect to read a lot, write a lot, and engage the concepts in discussion."

   "comments": [
    "This helped fulfill a requirement for my degree but also allowed me to learn about a period in African history in which I am interested. The best part about it for me was working on the paper. I wish I could say I had enjoyed class time a bit more!",
    "I wrestle with a lot of the topics we talked about in class on the regular, and now I feel like I have better tools to do so.",
    "Overall, the course acquainted me with some major concept in post-colonial thinking that should be broadly useful in doing development and public health work in Africa. There was also a handful of texts that were useful in helping me fill in my understanding of the post-colonial historical chronology."
