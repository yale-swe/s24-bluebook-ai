    "Currently, I imagine Dr. Auel's class is a well-kept secret. If you have a chance, take this class. He is an incredible professor. I have heard of people having bad experiences with linear algebra. I had a fantastic one all thanks to Dr. Auel.",
    "MATH 225 is the best linear algebra class at Yale. Dr. Asher Auel is simply the best - if you are hesitating between MATH 222 and MATH 225, take 225. It is rigorous and the workload is significant, but it will leave you with great understanding and knowledge!",
    "MATH 225 is a great way to explore more rigorous mathematics while learning a subject that is very interesting and applicable in many fields. I would definitely recommend taking the class if you are interested in pursuing further studies in mathematics. The p-sets are pretty long, but they are rewarding and you get more used to writing proofs as the class goes on. Do not let the early difficulty of writing proofs discourage you from staying in the class.",
    "Yes it's a great class. It was perfect as a first \"proof-based\" math class.",
    "Solid linear algebra course. Both midterm examinations focused on the mechanics of linear algebra, which made them quite easy, but kind of defeated the purpose of taking a proof-based course. Still, there were plenty of proofs presented in lecture and written in the homework. Would recommend for any science\/engineering types just because linear algebra is so useful.",
    "Highly theoretical not really practical. Yes if they are maths majors, if not no.",
    "Lots of proofs and new jargon. Definitely better than Math 222 for anyone planning on continuing in math.",
    "A great class, a thorough and rigorous introduction to Linear Algebra. All but two of the lectures were directly from the textbook; but the textbook is amazing, we used \"Linear Algebra\" by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence. A very theoretical course.",
    "Great course. If you like linear algebra and proof-based math you should take it.",
    "Definitely take this over 222, it's not much harder and you gain some appreciation for the fundamentals of mathematics (fields, sets, etc.)",
    "A good introduction to linear algebra that begins to use creative mathematical ways of thinking in some of the problem sets, but is ultimately still a little too focussed on computation.",
    "Yes--especially versus MATH 222. I think the proof aspect lends a theoretical rigor that would not be found there.",
    "MATH 225 01 is not necessarily harder than its applications based equivalent. More accurately, I think it requires a different mode of thinking, one that I found extremely rewarding. The course introduces you to proofs in a way that encourages rather than penalizes, as exams rarely involve generating proofs but assume that the student has gained an understanding of class material through the process of proving theorems, corollaries, etc. in the homework.",
    "If you're considering continuing with the math track, I would take this class over Math 222 to test the waters. If you survive this class, then you'll know that you can handle proof-based math. If you don't, you'll die by fire like me. That said, it was a necessary death by fire, and I'm glad that I've learned what my mathematical limitations are.",
    "I'd recommend this course. If you're willing to put in a lot of time on psets, you'll absolutely get an intuitive grasp of the material. Two midterms and a final, very fair grading.",
    "Do not take it if you are not a Math major",
    "I would not recommend this course. There is way too much work and the teaching is poor.",
    "This class is a much more difficult version of its counterpart, math 222. One of the most rigorous courses I have taken here, though the hours you spend on psets (3-10, depending on the assignment) do not correlate to test preparation, because even though the course's lectures and homework focus on proofs and theoretical concepts, in class evaluations focused largely on practical applications. Honestly, unless you are a prospective math major who plans to go into linear algebra theory, there is very little reason to take this course in comparison to 222. If you have any doubt about which to take, if you are just casually interested in linear algebra, or if you want to take linalg to use in some other application, take 222. The good news is Professor Auel is kind and approachable; if you do decide to take this course, I would recommend doing it with him.",
    "If you are interested in math, or thinking about a potential math major, I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Definitely recommended.",
    "Overall, this was a good course, and I would recommend it to anyone choosing between this and 222 unless you really want to avoid proofs. The more proof-based approach to class was interesting (it was the first time I had taken really proof based math) and conveyed a deeper, more interesting understanding than a purely computational approach would. Prof. Auel mixed in some interesting applications of linear algebra (google's page rank algorithm and some quantum mechanics) every now and then, which made the class more interesting. Psets are mostly proofs and some can take a while to complete, while tests are almost totally computational. The class spends much more time on the earlier topics than the later ones, so it did feel a little rushed at the end.",
    "If you are climbing up the mountain of math, take this instead of 222",
    "For most people, it seems that MATH 225 is not the most challenging course. I thought the subject was extremely difficult, but it was very interesting. I wanted to take the class so that I could learn how to write mathematical proofs--I did learn how to write proofs, which is good. However, I found that I was very bad at this, despite my best efforts. The psets contained a lot of proofs. The midterms were mostly computational (no proofs). It seems that most people finished the problem sets in under six hours, but they generally took me 9-12 hours a week. If you've never done proof based math and enjoy math at all, this is terrific class. However, be aware that many people in the class will already be familiar with linear algebra, which means that most people get A's on the midterms, which sucks if you haven't had the chance to learn linear algebra yet. If you can, take this class with Asher Auel. He's extremely helpful during office hours and very clear during class.",
    "I loved this course, but it is for a certain type of person. If you have done regular linear algebra before, or if you appreciate mathematics for the sake of mathematics, this is a wonderful course for you. You will study algebras in which 1+1=0. You get a deep and profound insight into linear algebra, as well as proof based i.e. \"professional\" math. You will struggle with content really hard, but then when you look back at it after two weeks it will all seems obvious. This sense of clear progression is the most rewarding part. The problem sets take about 12 hours, with a great selection of key problems. You will do proofs. The two midterms were ridiculously easy compared to the P-sets, and the final was reasonably difficult.",
    "A good introduction to linear algebra. Professor Auel is a very good lecturer, although I generally found that I could keep up without going to lecture since it was the same material as in the text book (and the class was at 9AM this year). The P-sets require a substantial time commitment and are very difficult, although they only count for 25% of the grade and you get one drop. The tests are miles easier. There is enough support if you find that you fall behind with office hours, section, email etc.",
    "If the student enjoys and has time to do proof-based homework, then they should take this class if they want a fuller linear algebra experience to what Math 222 offers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is interested in proof based math. I thought it was a good introduction to higher level math.",
    "Standard linear algebra introduction, but with an emphasis on understanding through proofs compared to 222. Proofs are in lectures and on homework, but the exams are straightforward computation. You will go more slowly at first than 222, but the conceptual groundwork is more in depth. Expect the pace to pick up after the midterm. Homework is long but clear and rarely tricky. Exams are fair. Prof Auel is a great guy--he appears to remember what it's like to be a student and structures the class with that in mind."
