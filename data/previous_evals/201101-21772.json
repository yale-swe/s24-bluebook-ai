   "comments": [
    "If you are shopping for a senior seminar, this is a great one to get. The work is manageable, class is interesting, and you get a lot of practical\/hands-on experience working with and interpreting datasets.",
    "If you are interested in development economics, you definitely don't want to miss this course. If you just feel like taking an econ course and learn more about economics research, this is a wonderful course to take as well. The classroom discussions are very intellectual stimulating; Professor Rosenzweig is very approachable and sometimes quite humorous.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was one of the best courses I ever took at Yale. I'm a senior and this is my last semester, so I can truly say that. Basically, every class period you learn about a few different studies\/models in development economics, for example, whether or not deworming actually increases school attendance or why girls in Indian are enrolling in English-language schools at a faster rate than boys. These studies often have very fascinating results. Over the course of the semester, you also develop a deeper understanding of the broader considerations that must be taken into account when promoting development, such as the opportunity cost of schooling. Professor Rosenzweig actually actively discourages you from reading the course materials before class, because you wants you to actually think about the questions posed in class rather than already knowing the answer because they were in the readings. (In fact, you really don't really have to read at all to get the full benefit of the course. Everything and more is in Rosenzweig's lectures.) The assignments also actually enhanced my understanding of the material and the topic.",
    "Indeed, great seminar for Econ majors!",
    "Recommend if you are interested in developmental economics. Not much otherwise.",
    "Good class but could be strengthened by more class participation. I found my attention wavering because there was no incentive to read or participate in the class.",
    "The course surveys recent (past 15 years) papers in development economics. The professor presents papers in the first half of the course, and student presentations comprise the remainder of the semester. Because of this structure, it is possible to learn the same content just by reading the papers independently of the class, but the seminar format worked well, and the professor is an excellent resource. This is definitely a decent seminar and workload is on the lighter end."
