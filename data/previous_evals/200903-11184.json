   "comments": [
    "As this is a required course recommendations are somewhat irrelevant. I would say this course does a good job of covering the material, but there are perhaps not enough examples assigned through homework problems.",
    "I would suggest to any student to pass out if they can and skip this requirement.",
    "Yes - this is a good course for incoming graduate students to take.",
    "While not so difficult a course, it is certainly useful. Interesting material will come in the following semester of the course.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it.",
    "If a student had a decently strong quantum background from college, i would not really recommend this course. Many of its aspects are in a way repetitive from undergrad although several approaches were new. if one is interested in how group theory plays into quantum mechanics, i would possibly recommend this course",
    "It covers the basics of quantum mechanics. You have to take it if you are a physics student",
    "It was an enjoyable course to take, my favorite of the term, and I would recommend any class taught by Professor Iachello to a fellow student.",
    "Yes, as it provides a pretty comprehensive refresher for quantum mechanics",
    "It was still a good class.",
    "yes absolutely necessary for physics--all the fundamentals are there.",
    "It's a good class. I'd recommend it to other students.",
    "Essential for any physicist.",
    "Introductory Quantum physics starting with solving schrodingers equation for one dimensional systems, followed by a survey of the formalism of quantum mechanics and some 3-dimensional systems including the hydrogen atom. Finally, angular momentum, many body poblems, and systems of identical particles are covered. Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Graduate level of Quantum Mechanics. Yes I would recommend this course since this course contains materials that engineers need to know.",
    "I don't feel like I really learned anything I didn't do in undergrad, so I might recommend a different course to a peer."

   "comments": [
    "This course did not deepen my understanding of quantum mechanics and it is really sad to say because quantum mechanics is such an important class for us.",
    "This course did not teach me much beyond what I'd already learned in Quantum mechanics, but such a refresher was likely necessary before I took more advanced courses.",
    "It has done very little to deepen my knowledge of my discipline.",
    "I think that this course was a good opportunity for me to review much of my undergraduate quantum mechanics material, though I wish I had more time to prepare for the final. I believe that final exams are meant to be motivators for students to solidify material from the semester, but one week for three different courses is not enough to do that.",
    "It was helpful.",
    "The course helped a little bit in understanding the subject on a deeper level. I saw more of the mathematics involved and how some branches of math (like group theory) are applied in the field of quantum mechanics",
    "I feel like I learned more about quantum mechanics in this course, which is obviously necessary physics to understand as a Ph.D student. He taught us group theory approaches, which I found interesting and worthwhile. Overall I felt this class was useful, and I look forward to Quantum II with Professor Iachello.",
    "The class provided a lot of insight into the formal structure of quantum mechanics and I enjoyed the perspective offered by the professor. However, I'd still prefer a little bit more detail in lectures and perhaps more relevant problem sets.",
    "Yes--the references to current experiments and historical context in lecture has been very helpful",
    "It provides a solid foundation of basic knowledge relevant to my discipline.",
    "This course was instrumental in laying the fundamentals for future work.",
    "Knowledge of Quantum Mechanics is essential for a physicist and will play a signficant role in my training for research.",
    "This class was rather cursory and did not deepen my knowledge of quantum mechanics (especially because I had a good quantum background from undergrad)."
