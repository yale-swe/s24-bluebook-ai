    "Summary: This class introduces the major thinkers and theories of religion and how to study it from the 20th century -- essential for anyone hoping to be able to teach on the subject some day.Recommendation: You need to know these thinkers, and this is the best way to do it.",
    "The course was essentially a guided reading group through some of the classic works and issues in the theory of religion. I would recommend it to all students of religion, since it helps frame many of the issues they will confront every day."

   "comments": [
    "Little to dissertation\/research, since \"religion\" doesn't relate heavily to it in a conceptually direct way; but absolutely necessary and helpful for being in the profession\/discipline.",
    "This course is one of thefew opportunities for students in the Department of Religious Studies to access the theory of religion. It provided essential tools to understand, evaluate and critique other works of scholarship in the students' respective fields, and also encouraged students to support their work with a theoretical framework."
