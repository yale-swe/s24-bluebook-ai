    "DEFINITELY. Such a great class if you have an interest in nature and love the environment.",
    "An interesting topic, but a bit of a disorganized class. Prof. Kellert has some brilliant ideas but does like to go off on tangents pretty frequently, and I felt that we didn't learn as much as we could have. Weekly interpretive papers felt only vaguely connected to the material, though we also had several readings that felt pretty similar over the course of the semester. Overall, would probably not recommend. Read Kellert's books on your own and talk to him about them.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in biophilia, environmental studies, or a related field. If you are I think you will really enjoy the readings and assignments and see them as eye-opening. If you are not already interested in these fields, though, I probably wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Good material, but not very well taught. Professor Kellert is extremely kind, but leads seminars like a lecture. You have to be very into the material to want to be in this class."
