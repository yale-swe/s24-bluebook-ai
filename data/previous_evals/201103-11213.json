   "comments": [
    "You learn the way to evaluate (financial) booms and busts and if they will happen again based on a set of 4-5 lenses that vikram designed and wrote about in his book. His book is great, probably the best and most useful part of the course other than the actual class discussion once a week during the seminar.",
    "Yes, highly recommended to all.",
    "take it",
    "This class should be a prerequisite for every single Yale student thinking about a career in the financial services industry. Invaluable.",
    "Interesting at times, very boring at others. Really depends on the quality of the people in your seminar. Two sections this year meant that it was a little more spread out, more hit-or-miss with discussions",
    "Awesome class, best ive taken at yale.take it if you have any interest in finance\/econ\/business. I got lucky, he added two sections this semester I dont know if it'll happen again.",
    "If you get in, take it.",
    "Evaluation of financial booms and busts through lenses that mansharamani developed himself",
    "A really interesting class, but maybe not as amazing as reviews from previous years would suggest. If you want to go into finance, take it. If you don't, it'll be good anyway. Definitely made me think about booms and busts in a new light.",
    "Yes, take it if you can get it. This class is awesome.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in finance at all--but don't feel that you have to be interesting in a career in finance to like it. There are a lot of different kinds of people who take the class and you don't talk about portfolios or investing all that much, you just learn about historical booms and busts.",
    "Yes, take the class if you want to get a good overview of financial history and markets. Don't take it if you want to take a finance related class that will land you a job on wall street -- you will not only be disappointed, but also likely to be turned to another path.This is a great seminar that will change the way you look at markets. The best part is that you will get a broad overview of different schools of thoughts, and you can use the frameworks you learn in this class to explore the areas that you are most interested in. The guest speakers this year are also fantastic and diverse, and students have good opportunities to interact with famous authors or experienced professionals and pick their brains.There were two sections for this semester. Though the topics, readings and instructor were the same, the dynamics of the two sections were completely different. Having been to both, I personally preferred the section with everyone contributing, regardless of experience in finance. After all, the purpose is to open up approaches to the same topic. Ironically, an extensive discussion focused on technical issues can be quite limiting. So if you can, sign up for the section that you enjoy, because your peers will impact what you get out of the course.The inevitable weakness with a seminar using the \"liberal art\" approach is ultimately its lack of depth. However, if you are interested in a particular topic discussed in the seminar, the professor is very generous with his time and can point you to the right direction for further exploration. As with most seminars, a lot of the learnings for this class also happens through the readings. Make that you have time to get through 200+ pages of reading if you intend to take this course , otherwise the discussion gets hard to follow and boring.",
    "Definitely take it whether or not you have financial knowledge beforehand.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in understanding how financial markets work and knowing more about financial crises since the Great Depression.",
    "I would summarize Financial Booms and Busts as a very interesting course that focuses on a topic that is currently very highly relevant. It's really enjoyable, particularly if you have a class that really involves itself in the discussions. The readings were relevant and interesting, and definitely a great supplement to the course. I would definitely recommend this course. It's unfortunate that it doesn't count as an Econ course (and it truly should, as it had a lot more Econ as some of the other classes in the department I've taken), but it is very interesting and useful knowledge to have. Take it!",
    "If you get in, def. take it. Vikram is an awesome prof.",
    "Yes, it\u0092s a great interdisciplinary course. An asset bubble is a really interesting phenomenon. There are a lot of readings but they are good and the guest speakers are worth it."
