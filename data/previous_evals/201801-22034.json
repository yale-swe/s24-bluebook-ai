   "comments": [
    "How cultures' performance art and their histories are incredibly linked, and how one influences the other and the extension of how that extends to change the everyday perception of the resident\/spectators of that culture.",
    "Basic knowledge of modern theater.",
    "I learned how to read different genres of theatre text with an analytical eye and gained insight into the history of theater from the 1700s to the 1990s.",
    "Good general overview of different theatrical trends\/history.",
    "This course manages to give you an in-depth survey of the entire evolution of theater from the lens of adaptation as historiography.",
    "I learned about many different theater styles if the 19th and 20th centuries.",
    "How to write a theater analysis\/critical paper (compare and contrast), evaluating adaptations, & learning about different theater movements.",
    "This course taught me to critically read and analyze plays. I learned about various theater movements and philosophies, and how to identify and critique a philosophy practiced through theater.",
    "I gained knowledge of many different performance styles and their origins. I also became more skilled in analyzing the cultural context in which performance forms and plays emerged.",
    "I was able to learn about several plays and a majority of the theatre movements following the 1700s. The material was taught in conjugtion to more recent adaptation, which allowed one to see the development and impacts of different theories and views of theatre. I gain knowledge of non western theatre as well.",
    "This was a very insightful survey of theater and theater history, from the 18th century to the present. This class pushes you to think critically about plays and performance forms, in both its discussion sections and in its creation of studio performances or scene studies. The course offers lots of knowledge about the major performance forms from across the globe and across the centuries, detailing how history (i.e. wars, politics, society) influenced theatrical art.",
    "I learned about modern theater, theory, and performances."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course could be strengthened by more varied Teaching Fellow Section Material, as I felt limited in my section on what I could talk about. This course is overwhelmingly strong, Dr. Elise Morrison works extremely well with the vast expanse of information to",
    "This course has a lot of interesting material but tries to cover far too much and in the process does not cover anything. There were also too many final assessments (a final paper, project, and final exam is really extensive), which did not allow me to commit as much time and energy to any of them as I would have wished.",
    "This course is made so that there is literally \"something for everyone.\" Even if you're not fond of the texts being studied in a particular week, the texts are so varied that the next week is bound to have something you're interested in. Professor Morrison also does a really good job of tying everything together, so it never feels like the texts or theater movements you're learning about exist in a vacuum. The one weakness was the way the workload was distributed. There is a 3-4 page midterm paper, and at the end there's a final studio performance for each section, a final 8-10 page paper, and a final exam. Most of the graded assignments occur at the very end of the semester, which can make it difficult to put quality effort into each assignment, especially when you're also trying to do final papers and study for exams for other classes. Maybe taking out one of the final assignments and substituting it for a short quiz or a few reflection assignments during the semester would even out the workload better.",
    "The only weakness of the course was the length of section time and the amount we were expected to get done in that period-- otherwise this course was as well-run as I could possibly imagine. It accomplishes an impossible task. Elise Morrison is an engaging lecturer and both she and Vaclav Pinos were extraordinarily supportive of students. One was left feeling that they wanted you to succeed sincerely, an unfortunately rare feeling in most courses, especially large survey ones.",
    "I think this class got a bit predictable and a bit boring. The plays we read were not very interesting until they got more modern. I think it could benefit from a different style other than lecture.",
    "Strengths: lots of periods\/materials\/important people covered. Weakness: lots of readings but enjoyable!",
    "Dr Morrison grounds her iteration of this course in adaptation and historiography, which help the historical writings to feel more contemporary and relevant to the students. We did a lot of readings dealing directly with social movements through time, which was a strength in terms of making the historical aspect of THST appealing to students. The course assignments were understandable and studio performances were useful to understand theory. One weakness of the course is that it was hard for Dr Morrison to fit everything she wanted to into lecture, and that there was little consequence to not doing the readings. It would have been more of a \"global\" survey of theater and drama had we covered theater movements from outside of Europe, the US, and Asia. We also studied no Native American art either semester.",
    "This course is very well structured and the content is varied enough that there is bound to be at least one topic that interests a person taking it. I cannot think of any improvements that could be made to the course.",
    "The biggest weakness of the course was that there was not always enough time to discuss the plays and the readings during the class itself. However, this was a product of the strength of the class which was that we discussed the historical and cultural context of the play.",
    "I really enjoyed working with my discussion section to devise and perform our scene study and studio performance. This is a great way of applying what we learn in the class and feel open to experimenting. The class feels always a little pressed for time; there's so much to be covered, and the material of the syllabus is well-chosen, but even still, it seems there is so much to say and just a smidge too little time.",
    "Strengths: good coverage of material, group projects function successfully weaknesses: lecturing often feels rushed, breadth over depth means I had a generally shallow understanding of the plays covered",
    "The strength of this course is its assignments, including the studio performance, scene studies, and final essays. They were structured in a way to really nicely complement the lectures from class. The structure of the course overall and its assignments was a bit formulaic, and by switching it up I think it could be made more engaging."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "YES! if you're interested in Theatre History, and are looking for a chance to study Art movements across the world, I HIGHLY recommend it",
    "Unless you are a theater studies major (in which case this course is required), I would not recommend this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Though it's mandatory for theater majors, I'm a psychology major and decided to take it. The class is structured in a way where you don't feel behind or not able to participate if you're not a major. I actually ended up learning a lot of general history, especially with regard to different arts movements, that I probably otherwise wouldn't have studied. It was also great to have the sections each focused on something different during the second half of the class for the studio performances; my section focused on existentialism, which is something that I never understood beforehand, so it was great to be able to delve into that as well. Take this course! It's worth it.",
    "Yes, for other THST majors.",
    "Take this course-- especially if you're NOT a Theater Studies major. If you do the work, you will learn more in a year than you could possibly imagine.",
    "Yeah, sure. It's not great but it's like any other intro class.",
    "Yes! While it doesn't provide the \"classics\" of theater history, it definitely involves periods\/pieces of more interest (niche). It is quite inspiring to be academically interested in a specific area.",
    "This course was particularly appealing to me (as a student who is not particularly enthusiastic about history) because of Dr Morrison's focus on adaptation and politics in theater. The course material was interesting and contextualized, and gave me an appreciation for theater philosophies students do not usually practice at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to people interested in theatre because it provides a firm foundation for play analysis.",
    "Well inthink its a great foudational class for theatre but I do not know if i think a non theatre person should take it.",
    "This class is a great way to get to know theater and its history and performance more! Even if you're not completely interested in Theater Studies, this is a fun way to dip your toes in and try a little bit of acting\/writing\/directing\/etc., while studying the art itself.",
    "yes, but only if the student was planning on majoring in theater studies or wanted to take a higher level course for which this class was a prerequisite",
    "Yes, if you enjoy theater or history. You learn a lot about the broad theatrical performance forms and theories as well as their historical contexts."
