    "Only if they have a very lit major disposition and are super nerdy about Russia or the American South.",
    "If you're interested in literary analysis, literary violence and bondage, comparative literature, Russia, or America, it's worth your time. Slightly scattered occasionally, but the material and the professor are both great and you can certainly create various coherent threads for yourself out of what's presented.",
    "Good class on a interesting subject. The graduate domination can get a little tough, but if you are interested in Serfdom or Slavery, I would take the class. MacKay is a gem.",
    "Yes, the reading is interesting and grants greater understanding of Russian and American cultures and the legacies of the similar institutions of slavery and serfdom."
