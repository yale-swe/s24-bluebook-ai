    "Reading great books. Not always fun but rewarding. You only get out what you put in.",
    "PAUL GRIMSTAD IS AMAZING",
    "I'm glad I did DS, but i think it's a bad program. It doesn't give you enough time to think seriously about anything.",
    "I would highly recommend DS Lit. The works you read are amazing, and Professor Grimstad is a very intelligent professor who always brings interesting ideas to section.",
    "Lots and lots of books. If you like books and literature and can stand a bit of pain, go for it. Professor Grimstad is a good choice - don't get intimidated, you'll adjust.",
    "Take it!",
    "Depends completely on your professor. The class is pedagogically absurd and the syllabus needs to be totally reworked, but with the right professor, it can be great!",
    "Prof. Grimstad is a very smart man but a very bad professor. He demonstrated a lack of respect in multiple ways: he showed up late to almost every class and kept us late almost every class; he lacked focus and consistently took the class on tangents, in some cases devoting the majority of the class to irrelevant subjects; and he gave scanty comments on the papers. Having completed all the reading and having spent considerable time writing the papers, I felt that Prof. Grimstad's behavior devalued the time and work that I had put in. He loved to hear himself talk and often brought up his books and his other classes (which were rarely relevant), and naturally he dominated the discussion during class. He was not very helpful in meetings about the papers. I wholeheartedly recommend DS Literature, but I cannot possibly recommend Prof. Grimstad. It's possible he would be better in a lecture class.",
    "Second semester lit has its ups and downs--everything on the syllabus is great, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less connected and sometimes less in depth than first semester can be. That said, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll read a lot of amazing literature, have great class discussions, and explore thought-provoking questions that go far beyond the fall. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go wrong with most of the lit professors, and Grimstad is wonderful--funny, brilliant, eloquent, scatter-brained, and infectiously enthusiastic. He seems to know something about everything, and class discussions always ended up going in unexpected directions.Going to every class was a joy.",
    "Take it. Directed Studies is a gem.",
    "I can't really summarize what ds is and what it meant to me. All I can say is take it!",
    "I would highly recommend it. In no other course will you get such a thorough survey of modern literature."
