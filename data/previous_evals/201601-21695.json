    "Good class generally. Prof Warner is very intelligent and fosters a pretty good discussion. Many people were tired or confused at 9 AM so discussions weren't as good as they could be. The selection of books is great, and the papers aren't too difficult, but not a lot of guidance is given for them.",
    "Yes, for the texts and for the teaching.",
    "This is a wonderful class. Prof. Warner is exceptional: he's been in the field a very long time, has an incredible repository of knowledge, and is kind and considerate - pretty much everything you'd want in a professor. He's very good at telling bullshit from actual analysis. He usually knows what he's looking for when he asks the class a question: he's always nice about it, but will gently keep prodding until we arrive at a coherent interpretation of the text. If you listen to him, you'll learn a lot about literary analysis. Also, he's very helpful with papers - he will gladly meet with you and give you feedback at any stage in the process. He is nice about extensions (if you ask in advance), but I would recommend submitting your papers on time if possible. Sticking to his schedule will keep you from falling behind. The selection of reading is also really good. This is not a survey course, and therefore doesn't cover all of the traditional bastions of American literature; Hawthorne, for example, is absent. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Hawthorne anyway. Instead, the professors have compiled a selection of readings, some of which remain constant (like Song of Myself and Moby-Dick) and some of which change every year. The reading selection is pretty diverse. A large percentage of the authors we studied were queer (or, if alive today, would have been considered so), like Whitman, Melville, possibly Dickinson, and James Baldwin. Prof. Warner has a strong background in queer theory, which he's very modest about - he coined the term \"heteronormativity\" and never told us! His background definitely helped us analyze some of their works. I enjoyed pretty much all of the readings (although I'm still not quite sure what to make of Gertrude Stein) If you're scared of Moby-Dick, you shouldn't be; it was actually my favorite work of the semester. He knows it cover to cover (he can pull tons of analytically relevant quotes from memory) and he takes his time with it. By the end of three weeks, we really understood it in depth. Overall, I'd strongly recommend that you take English 127, and that you take it with Prof. Warner - even if it's offered at 9AM Wednesday\/Friday like it was this semester. Prof. Warner is pretty relaxed, and has a very calming voice, so it's a great way to start off the day. Also, unlike some of the other English 127 professors, Prof. Warner gives 1-page weekly reading responses instead of exams. English exams sound awful, and the reading responses are great. They're not too much work, and you can turn your best ones into papers!",
    "A great class that provides an in-depth look into some of the finest American literature ever produced. Professor Warner is a wonderful teacher and warm presence in class, keeping discussion lively and interesting. The class gives you the chance to really sink your teeth into some great material, as the readings selected from the course are varied in tone, structure, meaning, etc, so you're bound to fall in love with at least some. These texts are analyzed and discussed at length during class, which really helps provide some penetrating insights into their meaning and purpose. Workload is reasonable (the amount of reading could be a little heavy from time to time), and the essays are fun to write. Professor Warner allows you to rewrite your first essay (based on his feedback and your own new ideas) before giving you a grade, which gives you the opportunity to see what works and what doesn't in your writing early on. So all in all a great class, and take it with Professor Warner if you can. If it's offered early in the morning again, though, be aware that it can be tough to drag yourself out of bed 9:00 AM to a 75 minute session of in-depth analysis. Probably not a good idea if you're not a morning person. Otherwise, would definitely recommend!",
    "I would summarize this course as a comprehensive introduction to range of American authors and styles. It does little to pick at the heart of what makes American literature American (and by little I mean nothing), but this serves the course incredibly well in that the course becomes a cohesive survey of American literature with more appreciation of the diversity and differences of the texts than similarities. I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that it is a course for people who love literature. With weekly reading responses, and essays that can prove incredibly challenging, it is not a course for someone who is not ready to put full effort into the study of American literature."
