   "comments": [
    "A class to learn about the different separations processes important to industrial and laboratory processes.",
    "LOL",
    "This course is not bad at all if you take it with Pfefferle. She's really nice and would actively try to find ways to connect the material to our specific career interests so we would always find it relevant. Plus she doesn't over-complicate any of the assignments and midterms, so you walk out of it feeling like you actually learned (and retained) information.",
    "If you are a chemical engineer, you will have to take this class. Otherwise, I would not recommend it. The majority of the material felt like review from other classes. Professor Pfefferle had limited background in the field and so most of the material was taught over Skype by a professor from UMBC which made it difficult to learn and fully engage with the class. The class was made more engaging by student presentations throughout the semester, but this took up a lot of class time. That said, the workload was pretty light relative to other chemical engineering classes and the tests were fair which was nice.",
    "Well, you have to take it. So take it. Just know this from this year. Only strengths is Lisa has some industry experience so can answer questions based off that, but she's been out of industry for so long that she is a bit out of date. She did not actually teach us for 90% of the class - instead we had a skype-lecturer (Doug Frey from UMBC) for about 50% of the lectures, and then student presentations for about 40%. Doug Frey, while he knew his stuff, was an annoyingly slow lecturer who would get off track, waste time with \"background\" and then never get to the actual point of the lecture. From the little lecture time we had with Lisa, she tends to do a few things: 1 - stand in front of the board, write something, then erase it; 2 - start a sentence, then stop half way through and start a new one; 3 - repeat the same few ideas over and over without going in depth. To improve it, get someone who actually know the material and wants to (and can) teach) it.",
    "The course covers interesting topics, though there is not much structure, resulting from Prof. Pfefferle being somewhat forced into the position of teaching the class without much background in the topic. This is mainly indicative of the lack of teaching faculty available for the ChemE department to draw from. Workload is moderate, and tests were very straightforward.",
    "I now know more about separation and purification processes than I did, but only barely. The structure of the class was bizarre - some student presentations, some lectures from Prof. Pfefferle, some Skype lectures from her colleague in Maryland, and the very occasional problem set. The trip to a distillery at the end of the semester was nice, but the actual classes left something to be desired.",
    "You are probably looking at this review because you must take this class (if you don't have to, don't). Do try your best to get the most out of the class as possible: Professor Pfefferle is actually very good at explaining things, you just sometimes have to ask the right questions or wade through some confusion.",
    "This course provides a straightforward introduction to many different separation processes, including distillation, absorption, stripping, and membrane filtration. The workload wasn't very heavy.",
    "The workload wasn't too bad and the tests were fine, but the class was fairly disorganized so it was pretty tricky to follow what was going on."
