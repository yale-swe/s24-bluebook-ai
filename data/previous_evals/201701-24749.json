    "I received a much stronger understanding of datacenter computing, networking technologies (switches, routers, protocols), and the discipline of computer networks in general. I received the insight that cloud computing is a powerful force that has only begun to change Internet computing, and its influence will accelerate as time goes on.",
    "In this class, you'll learn how datacenter networking is configured -- how the topologies are arranged, how the routing is setup, and how frameworks run on top of them. Specifically, the course was divided into three units: 1. Cloud topology and traffic: FatTree topologies 2. Cloud components: Xen (hypervisor), P4 (programmable switches), ... 3. Big data analytics: MapReduce, Spark, ..."

    "CPSC 425 was accompanied by great academic papers, which really revealed the subject. Minlan is a very sharp lecturer, and her slides were illustrative. The course definitely has room for improvement, though: The assignments varied HUGELY in their difficulty and time consumption. The first project was very small, the second was difficult but not ridiculously long, and the last assignment was much too long and tedious. (Not to mention that it was copied entirely and without reference from a course at Wisconsin-Madison!) For next year, I recommend two things: (1) issue problem sets that are due every 2 weeks, and are of a known scope, relevant to what was just covered in class and readings and (2) try very hard to make students read the papers. One thing that I've seen work (by Dan Abadi) is to randomly call on students in class, and give them points if they answer a question correctly about the paper.",
    "Overall the course was good. If you're looking for more engagement on the readings, consider requiring 1-2 paper reviews a week. This would significantly increase the amount of work required by the course, but I've seen this done in other courses and it definitely does get people to read (or at least skim) the papers before class, whereas I got the sense that only a couple people regularly read the papers here. Also, this is might be a little specific, but I've noticed a lot of Chinese grad students have valuable comments but never raise their hands, so consider cold-calling or forcing people to vote on the answer to a question if you're worried about them not participating (this also goes for any students reluctant to answer questions). Psets were ok, but it would be helpful if the setup code was provided somewhere outside the VM as well, just because 1-4 GB is a lot to download just to skim over a couple source files.",
    "Strengths: The subject material is fascinating -- datacenter networking is a complicated, challenging, and constantly evolving domain of study. You'll read papers from the past 10 years, giving you insight into the current state of affairs. Weaknesses: I have two principal suggestions: 1. Rather than repeating the content of the papers through a lecture, encourage more discussion. What are the strengths \/ weaknesses of the system presented? What can we take away from the paper? 2. The problem sets could use more thought. For example, the last one was rather tedious -- not sure how much I learned from messing around with Linux \/ AWS config settings. Worse, it was copied directly from an alternate online course, without reference or citation."

    "CPSC 425 followed the academic style of computer science courses. That is, we had lectures that reviewed the big ideas of academic papers, which were hand-picked from the literature for their influence on the field. Minlan is a very sharp lecturer, and her slides were illustrative. The course definitely has room for improvement, though: The assignments varied enormously in their difficulty and time consumption. We had three projects, labeled A, B, and C.Project A was very small, then Project B was difficult but not ridiculously long, and finally C was much too long and tedious, and involved spinning up HDFS\/Spark clusters on AWS or Google Cloud. If you've ever configured such a cluster, you know that it can waste hours of your time. Aside from these weaknesses, I have very high hopes for this course in future years. It is unfair to compare Minlan has great potential, and is already a polished lecturer. She is current in her field, has great personal skills, and will set you up with networks-related projects or jobs if you just ask. And I suspect she will take our feedback in stride and offer the best CS course in the department next year. Keep an eye on Minlan, and at least shop her course to see what I'm talking about.",
    "The material in Cloud Networks is both really cool and pretty practical. The workload was pretty light overall, although the three projects each took me 20+ hours, so definitely start early. Prof. Yu is very knowledgeable about this stuff, and you can learn a ton that you won't find in textbooks\/papers by asking her about industry practices or her opinions of future technologies, so I'd definitely recommend asking a bunch of questions (ideally do the readings first so they aren't stupid questions). Overall, if you're even a little interested in the material I'd recommend taking this course--just don't underestimate the amount of time it takes to get the projects up and running.",
    "The subject matter is fascinating. You'll read papers from the past 10 years, from companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. You'll debate systems in class and design your own such systems for homework. Therefore, I would indeed recommend the course to another student."
