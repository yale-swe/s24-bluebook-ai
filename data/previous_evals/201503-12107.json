    "If you want to learn the language you should take the class, otherwise it'll be a drag.",
    "I don't know how good this would be with another teacher, but I would recommend the course. My background before this was a semester of 120 taken a year ago (I hated the first 130 teacher I tried so quit that section). BUT. Florian Fuchs is the best!!! He is such an earnest and thoughtful teacher who really cares about all of his students. The class itself is a little oddly paced with too much focus on useless exercises that are either too easy or too hard. This is in part a fault of the textbook but also in part the fault of the German department who insist on following the exercises in the textbook. We did not spend enough time on drilling grammar with examples (grammar was usually, again like the textbook, presented with just a few examples all with similar structure\/one example per type of structure, not enough for the natural language-learning facility to kick in and infer the general grammatical rule). But overall I would recommend L3 German to the language enthusiast (which I am). In L3 we cover more obscure grammatical structures as well as some important ones (subjunctive mood, passive voice etc.) which together will get you to a great place for self-study. I'm undecided on whether or not I'm taking L4 or if I'll switch to the self-study track - but I don't think L3 is a level you should skip.",
    "The class was not too difficult; we learned a wide range of grammar but the vocabulary was somewhat limited especially since we focused only on certain areas of German culture which we are not likely to use in ordinary conversation."
