   "comments": [
    "Critical analysis of modern economic theory and news",
    "Great course that expanded my understanding of Macroeconomics a lot. Much more of a practical course than all other Econ courses in the department. Great and knowledgable teachers. Psets made me learn a lot although they were a bit tedious and long.",
    "The interactivity of this course really develops your analytical and critical thinking skills, being able to craft and present intelligent arguments for and against various conclusions. You learn about a broad range of macroeconomic topics, tailored to what's going on in the world today.",
    "Lots of cool macro stuff.",
    "A broad knowledge of macroeconomics and contemporary economic debates.",
    "I learned so much about macroeconomics that it is unreal. I can now converse intelligently about world affairs. It is an incredible course.",
    "Overview in terms of financial crisis and various aspects of macroeconomics and their relationships with the sociopolitical environment that we are in now.",
    "I've been exposed to a wide range of economic current events. I've better learned how to argue and view both sides. A great moment in class was around the time of the first presidential debate where we discussed both Trump's and Clinton's economic plans. And while I don't think anyone was swayed, it was interesting to rationally debate any positive effects of Trump's plan, not just simply dismissing it. This kind of attitude was present throughout the course.",
    "The course had us considering complex macroeconomic questions from multiple points of view - the 'debate' structure of the course was helpful in helping to develop a more critical approach to major questions.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of why we haven't recovered since the Great Recession, of what trends might look like for employment in the future, of the importance and difficulty of creating strong and resilient institutions, of how the aftermath of the Great Recession changed our understanding of macroeconomics, and much more. This class reinforces thinking critically about both sides of a question, something that other classes often just totally don't do. This class showed me how open many of the questions in macro are, and how important it is to have a coherent framework for attacking problems.",
    "I learnt a huge amount about macroeconomics that was directly relevant to the real world.",
    "Learning to evaluate macro issues from various points of view together with implications",
    "By taking this course, I developed the ability to think critically about both sides of current macroeconomic issues. I feel that I am now more knowledgable about the current macroeconomic climate, and more adept at reading and thinking about the macroeconomic news that I come across.",
    "Current affairs in macro How to look at macro problems in a critical view",
    "I feel like I learned things in Intro Macro and Intermediate Macro in a vacuum and quickly forgot them, but this class solidified that knowledge by putting it in context of actual world events. I would honestly say I've learned more in this class than in any other at Yale, and am now confident about my ability to discuss global macroeconomics at a high level.",
    "truly the most interesting and wide-ranging economics class I have taken in college Covered a broad range of material but was also structured and in-depth",
    "This course has taught me a lot about a very wide range of applied macroeconomics. It delivers many real world applications and makes you think about each macroeconomic argument from different perspectives. It makes you think about macroeconomic policies and theories in a critical way and focuses less on models. Further, the many papers you get exposed to show how exciting macroeconomics is and what cool questions economists are trying to solve.",
    "This course is awesome - I learned so much about current topics\/debates in macroeconomic policymaking. The structure of this course allows for students to see multiple sides on every issue discussed which is great."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Excellent course , no criticism",
    "Great debate and teachers and interesting topics. The powerpoints were quite bad though. I think this course should be a writing credit and adding another TA because the TA was overburdened.",
    "Debates in Macro is a terrific class - perhaps the best that I have taken so far. The material is rich and relevant. Roach and Aleh are devoted, accomplished, and approachable. They inspire a high level of engagement with the material, and their vast experience in economics shines through every class. The atmosphere of the class was ideal, as students were clearly intelligent but not trying to outdo each other. The main strengths of the class were the quality of material and instruction. The information could not have been more topical or covered more rigorously. For example, globalization was at the heart of the recent presidential campaign and in this class we were able to argue and analyze its merits and consequences. Only noticeable weakness was that the amount of material and reading could be overwhelming. Of course, you can easily get away with only doing a modicum of reading. However, I felt that so much material was covered and reading assigned that key insights could be lost or jumbled with less relevant points.",
    "Extremely engaging course - taught in a debate format, encourages participation at all times. The readings are fundamental.",
    "The course has an awesome discussion based format. The first 30-40 minutes is students and the professors discussing some current events topic related to macroeconomics. Then the professors lecture on the topic of the day. The course is awesome in this regard because we learn so much about so many different parts of macro. Weaknesses: There is way too much reading. It becomes very overwhelming and is difficult to keep up with.",
    "The readings and the topics are well-chosen and related to our future. Perhaps the instructors can further disagree with each other so that there will be more 'debates' in class.",
    "The format of the class (heavy student participation with the professors debating back) as well as the two professors themselves were the biggest strengths of the course. This course was the only one this term I didn't skip a single lecture. I genuinely loved coming to class. I can't think of any particular weakness; this class exceeded my expectations in every way.",
    "The material was very interesting, and presented by two very competent and interesting instructors. However, sometimes there was too much material in the lecture slides, and not enough time to go through everything.",
    "The primary weakness is that there isn't really a debate anymore. Aleh wants to bring back cold-calling next year (this was the only year it was absent) to stimulate the debate, but I don't think this is what students are looking for (or how to teach the most material most effectively). Students participated at the start of class even without cold-calling. What was really missing was a debate between Steve and Aleh, who now basically agree about most things, besides maybe Japan and China. The biggest debate, about whether insufficient demand could actually cause a recession and prevent a recovery, is basically over since Aleh saw Mian-Sufi. I think the class could actually do with less input from students\/less student debate, since Steve and Aleh know a ton more than all of us put together. Not saying there should be no student contribution, but I think more could be learned with less time spent on asking students what they thought (especially since they never finished all of their slides during class). Also, Steve talks like he's speaking to a boardroom, probably because that's what he did for his entire adult life. That's fine on Wall Street, but it doesn't work very well in a classroom. Other people I've spoken to were dissuaded from taking the class because of Steve's obfuscatory language, which takes relatively straightforward ideas and makes them really hard to understand. If he could communicate in a language undergraduates more easily understand, that would make the class a lot better. I loved all of Aleh's papers, though I think he hides some of their weaknesses sometimes. But he seems genuinely open-minded in a way that very very very few people actually are, and that alone (exposure to a professor who acknowledges uncertainty and is willing to change his mind) is a really valuable experience for a lot of the types of kids who take the class. One major weakness was that there was no feedback on homeworks. The comment on my first homework was \"I like your answer here in general,\" which is not conducive to improvement. Steve and Aleh should talk to the TF next year to make sure students get more feedback. Also the homeworks were graded so slowly that any feedback would be useless anyway.",
    "Course is fantastic because it focused clearly on tangible, important economic issues. Both professors were clearly engaged with the course and loved teaching it. The major weakness was that it took far too long for homework assignments and exams to come back. Yukun was clearly totally overwhelmed, and the course would have benefitted from two TAs.",
    "Strengths of this course included having two professors (not necessarily because their viewpoints were terribly different, but because they approach issues in different ways), and its emphasis on class participation.",
    "I think the course would be improved if there was better communication about which readings are actually important. I understand that it's good to expose students to a wide range of articles and papers, but we probably only needed to know things from about a third of the readings and it would have been very helpful for studying and class preparation to know which ones were important, given the high volume of assigned reading.",
    "Excellent discussions TA was very informative and helpful Professors extraordinarily experienced and willing to discuss all sides of any debate",
    "The breadth of the course is astounding and gives you a great overview of what the main points in macroeconomics are but at the same time it let's you not focus on many things in depth. The homework assignments were tough but ultimately the best way to learn exactly how to think about the key macroeconomic issues today.",
    "Strengths: Both professors are awesome, very knowledgable about the topics discussed and enthusiastic about teaching. The course material is well designed such that each week a different topic is discussed. Weaknesses: One aspect of the course I wasn't a fan of was the point system for tracking class participation. I felt it was hard to know how \"well\" you were doing, and how many times you were expected to speak in class."

   "comments": [
    "yes, class was quite useful for day to day interactions and understanding going ons in the world",
    "YES. This is a great course to develop a practical understanding of macroeconomics. The teachers are great and engaging, as is the debate in class. The psets are a bit long but you learn a lot form them. Overall, you LEARN so much.",
    "I would not only recommend this course but urge other students to take it. This course exposes students to key macroeconomic insights that elude many politicians and policymakers. It also encourages a high level of quantitative and logical thinking about important policy issues. The quality of peer contribution and instruction is unsurpassed.",
    "Yes, gives a good grounding in the political and economic debates surrounding contemporary economic issues.",
    "Absolutely yes, but with the caveat that there is much less of a debate than the title suggests. Aleh and Roach have, by their own admission, much more similar views than they did when they first started teaching this course. But it's still a fantastic overview of all major topics in macro, much more practical than intermediate macro (you look at absolutely no neoclassical theory in this class, focusing a lot on papers and classroom discussion). Highly recommended.",
    "Absolutely. Regardless if you are an economics major or not, this course is a MUST for anyone trying to understand what is happening with world's economy in such a complicated moment.",
    "This course is a must-take if offered again. It is the most valuable course I have taken in the econ department. Aleh and Roach are incredible professors whose dynamic is something to behold. The workload can be a little on the higher side since there is so much reading and the 5 psets (3 singles spaced pages of debate cases) require a fair amount of research and synthesis. Worth it though for the insights you get into the field.",
    "This course will help you not only to understand basic news and current economic issues, but also prepare you well for interviews if you are going into consulting\/finance.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. If you've taken economic theory classes and want to see it applied, or want to be able to have an educated opinion on basically all economic current events, take this class. It's fun, not wildly stressful (provided you don't try to do all the readings... that's simply not possible), and you'll learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend it, as it is unlike any other course I have had so far. There is much more critical thinking involved; regurgitation of the material is not what is expected.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in understanding big questions in macroeconomics. There is a ton of assigned reading, but Aleh said \"We designed this reading list so that no individual human could digest it all.\" The point isn't to read and understand everything, it's to sort out the important parts of an impossibly large amount of information. The class deals with a huge amount of material, so you learn A TON, and that alone is really valuable, but the real value is getting a perspective with which to analyze issues. You realize that there is almost no issue with only one side, which forces you to become less certain about your own positions. This class also directly challenges conventional and popular wisdom (\"Income growth does not cause democracy,\" \"Fiscal stimulus does not work, even on infrastructure\") or gives really interesting and non-obvious explanations for problems (\"Zombie consumers are killing the recovery,\" \"Jobs disappear during recessions and don't return\"). I still have no idea what grading is like because homeworks were graded so slowly, so it could be a good Credit\/D option, but make sure you take it seriously even if you do Credit\/D it, because you can learn such an enormous amount from this class. Highly recommend.",
    "100% take this course. I learnt so much and had a great time.",
    "This is the best, most relevant economics class I have taken at Yale. It is extremely light on quantitative reasoning and analysis (there's almost none), but it provides a great deal of insight into the most important macroeconomic issues of our day.",
    "Take this course! The professors are amazing, and they teach you how to gain an intelligent, critical perspective of Macroeconomics.",
    "Definitely. You learn a lot of things, but most importantly, you learn that there is not always 1 right answer.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely, this was an amazing class with amazing teachers.",
    "Yes, to all students wishing to make compelling arguments about economic policy",
    "Yes! This course is great. The topics it covers are timely and interesting, ranging from unemployment to monetary policy to economics in China & Japan. Both professors are very knowledgable, enthusiastic, and encouraging for students to participate in class. I learned a lot from this course. It was also great to read many economic papers in this course - something I feel Yale economics courses often don't do enough of."
