   "comments": [
    "A thorough and entrancing look at the development of art in Europe during the long 19th century, aka c. 1750-1910. Covers not only French art, but Spanish and Dutch as well. Brilliant lectures and a really enjoyable course overall. Take this class if you can.",
    "Great class with compelling material. Unfortunately it's delivered in an unexciting manner. Carol is an articulate, but not very engaging, lecturer. Section is pretty helpful, but would be better in the gallery instead of in a classroom.",
    "YES. If you have any interest in French culture or Art or the political changes that occurred during the 19th century, take this class. It's fascinating to see how these all tie together. Plus the TAs that Carol Armstrong picks are excellent- Section was actually fun!",
    "This class looked at art from the late 18th century through the 19th century.",
    "This is a great course. The readings are a little tough, but lectures are fantastic, the era is exciting, and the painters are legendary. Papers and tests are manageable and the whole thing is a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student because it was fun and allowed you to explore boundaries that you had before never crossed.",
    "YES! So excellent. The readings are hard, but so worth it and the class is structured very well.",
    "This is certainly a good course and it feels great to go through a museum afterward and know what you are seeing.",
    "The class is pretty much exactly what it seems like at the first lecture or two, so I highly recommend shopping it to see if it's your style. I ended the course feeling like I really learned some interesting things about great artists. It's not too hard (there's only two short, straightforward writing assignments alongwith the midterm and final), and doing the reading really helps you understand the material better but isn't essential. Really it's key just to go to lecture and you'll do fine in the class. If you find it really boring on the first day or two, however, know that lectures pretty much maintain the same style throughout the course, so don't expect any radical changes.",
    "This class is an interesting survey of all the French art that you are familiar with (David, Van Gogh, Manet). I took it credit\/D, which was a good choice (not a history of art major). The assignments are not difficult, but lecture can be really boring sometimes and other times really hard to follow.",
    "This class is absolutely amazing. There are two papers, a midterm, and a final, but you are given plenty of time to work on the papers. My TA was absolutely fantastic and Professor Armstrong's lectures were very interesting. If you cannot stand hearing professors say the word \"Um\", shop the class before you take it. There is also a good amount of reading, but the readings are usually interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, even if they aren't HSAR majors. I loved the focus on the 19th century time period, specifically to French art. The only thing I would warn a student about is the professor's tendency to say \"um\" a lot. Once you get past that (which you do after week 2 or 3), then the lessons become really interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if not to just look at and engage in the fantastic material. The art you look at is breath-taking and professor Armstrong's lectures will enhance your appreciation and understanding of the material. She is incredibly knowledgeable and infuses much history into her lectures, really giving you a sense of the context in which these great artists painted. There is a lot of reading, but it's interesting and if you have a tough week, you can get away without doing it. Believe methough you won't want to skip a lecture--they were always fantastic.",
    "Take it. It's a class an art history major should have.",
    "An overview of the fascinating 19th century in French art, well-led by Professor Armstrong. The readings assigned for this course are amazing and worth your time even if you feel like you are already familiar with the 19th century, particularly the ones from a feminist perspective.",
    "Definitely take this class if your interested in majoring in art history. This class delves into a period of art and history that is critical to understanding the shift between old narrative art and new modern purely aesthetic art. I would also recommend it to non art history majors."
