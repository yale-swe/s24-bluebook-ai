   "comments": [
    "The course as a whole is a diverse and varied study if nomadic culture that does a fantastic job covering major nomadic cultures, their developments, and their influences. It is a truly eye opening course that exposes students to something on the fringes if the art history and even socio-political world. I would recommend this class to other students f they are truly willing to think, engage, and try to gain something from the experience. This class is very specialized in the material and if you don't go with a strong desire to acquire knowledge you may not be satisfied.",
    "Good seminar for both undergraduate and graduate students. If you are interested in the arts of the foreign dynasties in China, this is the one to go for. You won't be disappointed.",
    "this is a very interesting and informative class, I would definitely recommend it to others."
