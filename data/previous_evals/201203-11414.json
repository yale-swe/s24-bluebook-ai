    "Given the problems of bias and identifiability, course evaluations seem deeply problematic.",

    "Absolutely yes. You have a great opportunity to think about what the role of sociological theory in your own study.",

   "comments": [
    "Given the problems of bias and identifiability, course evaluations seem deeply problematic.",
    "This course gave me a great foundation in sociological theory and a familiarity with some of the great texts in sociology, including Durkheim, Hegel, Marx, and Weber.",
    "The focus on formative works in the field was invaluable. In fact, I wish there were more courses like this, where a number of classic works are explored in depth. This sort of training seems critical for our future ability to teach a variety of sociology courses."
