    "Fun course. Memorized not just every single bone in the body but each part of every single bone and the soft tissue attachments. A very non-painful way to learn about the bones in the body.",
    "Self-management of time and focus! Also learning to connect concepts with each other.",
    "Sexing, aging, identifying bones of the human body.",
    "I feel really empowered by this class. I enjoyed being so responsible for my own learning - I was provided with what I needed to learn and the tools to do so, and was allowed to manage that by myself. Before I took this class I thought memorization was the bane of my existence, I'm much more of a hands-on, learn and apply the knowledge kind of kid, but this class gave me a lot of confidence, and combined my need for active kinetic learning with memorization and application of knowledge (@Sargis those isolated shafts tho). so thanks.",
    "Learning to identify bones and aging and sexing them.",
    "Super fun lab class where I learned every bone in the body plus all the holes and bumps and curves on every bone plus muscles that attach or nerves that run through the bones. Didn't think my brain could ever retain that much information. Loved the class",
    "I learned every bone in the human body! Hooray!!",
    "This class is wonderful! You will literally learn every single bone and the body as well as muscle insertions of the skeleton.",
    "- Identifying various bones and their features in the human body - Identifying gender\/age differences manifested in bones - Understanding how the greater musculoskeletal system operates",
    "I learned how to be perceptive and detail-oriented when examining intricate elements of human bony anatomy. However, I was also able to contextualize those details in the larger picture of how the human body works.",
    "I learned how to identify and side bones in the human body and their features. The purpose of this knowledge was aptly described when Dr. Sargis said an archaeologist can deduce that there are at least two skeletons at a site if they find two left ulnas. Personally, this knowledge will be useful in medical school.",
    "Learn every bone in the human body, including many muscle attachments.",
    "I learned all about the human skeleton! The course also really helped me build intuition about the overall function of the human body as a system. I loved how tactile it was in approach and the way that it facilitated group learning.",
    "This class gave a good scope of human bones and muscle attachments in a style that excellently facilitated learning and memorization."

   "comments": [
    "Class time was basically study time for the next exam. This made the classes actually engaging and fun and took away the stress of memorizing so many bones. You really got the time to understand the shape and functions of each bone.",
    "There is a lot of open-ended guidance. Meaning, it took a little bit of time for me to figure out how best to study (i.e. with disarticulated bones and how best to manage my time (which was reflected in my scores).",
    "This class is amazing. Hands on laboratory work every class made for easy memorization and identification of bones.",
    "I always felt before an exam that I hadn't had enough time, but in hindsight, I feel like I was generally prepared. It may be worthwhile to have pre-registration to avoid the loss of the first few classes, but I don't think it's crucial, and tbh that's the only thing I can imagine improving.",
    "Great class! I loved the format of having the lab in class which gives ample time to learn the bones. It's great how Rong had open hours before quizzes and exams.",
    "Strengths: everything. This was a bomb class Weakness: sometimes I wasn't 100% sure what things we had to memorize, know how to do, etc",
    "I absolutely loved this class. My only critique is that I think we could have spent a couple class days less on the skull unit as the next two quiz units felt a little rushed.",
    "I loved this course. It's mainly self taught which was extremely helpful.",
    "Strengths: - Resources of the class (ex. plastic skeleton) - Clear outline of what needs to be known for exam\/quiz - Extremely helpful professor & TA Weaknesses: - n\/a",
    "This course was amazing, by far the best course I have taken in nearly 18 years of schooling. The specimens from the Peabody were amazing, and Prof. Sargis and Rong brought energy, levity and a vast body of knowledge to their teaching.",
    "Strengths - The hands-off experiential learning was a fantastic and unique opportunity! - How can a bones class not be cool? Weaknesses - There could have been more guidance on how to approach the class at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Great course overall. Would be interesting to learn a bit more about the anatomical function of each bone, and not just memorize each of them.",
    "Truly, there are no weaknesses in this course. The pace was rapid but definitely manageable. The plastic skeleton was an extremely helpful supplement to in-class lab time.",
    "Awesome course, only thing I would say is one more day for the upper body and one less for the lower."

    "Absolutely take it. You won't get in unless you are a senior or an EBB major, but I'm so glad I took it. The professor is great, the TA, Rong, was great, and it's a really great introduction to osteology.",
    "absolutely, the single best class I've taken at Yale",
    "Yes! But be prepared to work.",
    "100% would recommend. TAKE IT IF YOU CAN GET IN.",
    "100% best class I've ever taken at yale.",
    "Take it! So fun and enjoyable. Time passes by quickly in the class, and Dr. Sargis is great.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're willing to put in tons of effort. It's not easy--my hobbies throughout high school\/college involved memorizing trees and rocks and fossils, but I still found osteology pretty challenging. Not only do you memorize all the bones, but also like several features on each bone (like what is this almost non-visible bump here called?) Overall, I really liked this class and both Professor Sargis and the TA, Rong, were super helpful. But it's not a gut at all. It's hard but you'll learn a ton.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! You learn every bone in the human body, and get to look at super cool specimens in class. Bones are so fascinating, and Sargis is an absolute expert, and very friendly and approachable - it was so great to ask him questions. The TA, Rong, was also wonderful. It is also just a really fun, low-stress class -- I looked forward to Osteology every week!",
    "Yes I would!",
    "Yes, for sure, take this class! Not only will you be able to identify all the bones of the human body by the end, you will have fun doing it. The professor and TA are both amazing and extremely helpful. Getting an A in this class is very doable.",
    "This was the best course I have ever taken.",
    "I would recommend this class to anthro\/arch studies majors as well as pre-med students! Note: You will not get into this class unless your are a senior or anthro\/arch studies major so probably don't even bother showing up! It's very hands-off learning so you essentially walk into the lab with bones laid out everywhere and a sheet of key terms that has the bones and features you need to memorize for the exam. You have to have a willingness to tackle self-initiated learning with little guidance up-front, although Dr. Sargis is a gem of a resource if you just ask him questions! Overall, class periods are chill but I really did have to spend about 6 hours the week of the exam memorizing.",
    "Absolutely. Four quizzes, all you have to do is study and you will do fine. Amazing opportunity to learn every bone in the human body using the Peabody's incredible human osteological collection. Could not recommend enough.",
    "Absolutely, I've spent all semester telling everyone I know to take this class.",
    "Yes absolutely 100%"
