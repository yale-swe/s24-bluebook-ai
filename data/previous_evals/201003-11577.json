    "This class would have been more helpful if the size of the class had been smaller. The first-year class of 2010 was a large one, and I feel that an additional section of the course would have been most beneficial. Discussions were slightly hampered by the large class size, as was review\/discussion of final proposals. Other than that, class was very helpful in terms of collecting ideas and initiating research project.",
    "questions 3 and 10: the assignments and theory behind the class were very useful. However, there was such a large number of students, and the disparities in experience levels were so large, that I didn't feel I personally grew as a researcher.",
    "Q1 Some of the earlier readings in the class were not well suited to our discussion. The readings were rather old.",
    "10. I began the course thinking that I could never write a research proposal. I ended it with a research proposal am proud of because the course was helpful in every single way to help me learn how to write a research proposal.So thank you Prof. Os Schmitz and Caterine.",
    "Most of the negativity of my comments stems from a misconception I had of the course. I had thought it was more oriented towards helping us individually develop our projects, rather than it being focused on theory of scientific research. The assignments and class discussions, I'd hoped, would be more geared towards that.",
    "For me, this course was an overview of the mandatory 1) ethics, 2) philosophy of science, and 3) grant proposal writing \/ scientific methods courses that were required of me during my undergraduate studies (biology major).Having written successful research grant proposals during and after college, I found the proposal writing section particularly frustrating since it was not particularly helpful for me at this time and the schedule did not mesh very well with the natural flow of my thesis development.It was clear that Prof. Schmitz spent considerable time planning his lectures, and his efforts to make the course participatory were appreciated, but three solid hours of discussions on the philosophy of science were often tedious.For me, the high points of the lectures were the few concrete examples of science being used in the policy making process. I wish there had been more examples along these lines. It might have been helpful to bring in some guest speakers who work at the interface of science and policy, who could have discussed some of the pitfalls that can await scientists who don't carefully consider the ramifications of \"advocacy.\"",
    "3. the assignments designed for the class are good. help to guide me through the research preparation process",
    "I'd like to comment on how helpful this course is, the instructor only gives us some generalities and vague terms without providing true valuable information in our proposal writing.",
    "Question 1: Gordon's \"Planning Research\" is an awful, boring, poorly written book. The other two books, and all the online reading, were excellent and insightful.",
    "Question 6. At the beginning was too slow at the end too fast.Question 1. Most of the readings were not interesting (useless), but the textbooks were good.",
    "If the purpose of this class is to make MESc students sit down and actually get cracking on their proposals, then it does its job. If it's really supposed to teach us much outside of that, it's hard to say what it is.",
    "The TA did a fine job in the class where she lectured, but she could use some work on her tone during certain moments. Both the prof and the TA\u00b4s frustrations with late work or failures to hand in work on time are very understandable, but the strength of her message is weakened by the somewhat scolding tone."

Also, the day that we spent discussing different roles for scientists and trying to come to consensus about how to respond to an environmental problem was very interesting and helped me to really see how other people would approach the same issue. Reference manager software reviews and the presentations by former masters students were helpful.",
    "The course did a great job of showing me how the grant process works in the scientific community. Professor Schmidt was very tough on us (a good thing) and very professional. He did a great job of explaining the harsh realities of the grant proposal process and did the best he could to show us how to cope with these realities.The 2nd half of the course was specifically very good, as we were required to submit portions of our proposal as the semester went on. (This was VERY helpful)",
    "Forced me to think about scientific ethics even though the professor obviously had very specific philosophies on this that are not necessarily agreed with.Liked the presentations that covered ways to find funding, and ways to find and read academic literature but these should have been earlier in the semester.Liked the real feel of the grant panel at the end but felt that we had too little guidance on what criteria we should be selecting for.",

   "comments": [
    "Size limitation of the class. It also may be very helpful for the class if, during the period of proposal review, the proposals were stratified based on the subject covered (such as in the NSF GRFP, where you submit to a relevant field, such as Life sciences, Physical Sciences, etc). In this fashion, comments can be more focused on improvement of methodology rather than saying \"I don't know what this was talking about, so I commented on grammatical structure instead\".",
    "The class size was too large. Due to the large class size, the few most opinionated students dominated the conversations. If the class size was smaller, others would have felt more comfortable sharing their ideas and thoughts.",
    "finding some way to divide the class up into those with previous experience and those without. I felt I would have benefitted from intense workshopping and discussion with my peers, more so than the format the class took due to its size and experience range.",
    "No time for discussion amongst students and student-to-teacher time to talk about research proposals!",
    "To provide the international student which is about one fifth of the whole class some useful information about funding application.",
    "Two sessions a week, rather than 1.Breaking people into different interest groups early in the semester to facilitate more interaction and peer-review.",
    "Discussions. While it was difficult to have discussions in such a large class (34) facilitation and preparation could have been better. Providing guiding questions or discussion topics the week before would have helped to focus students for readings and discussions.",
    "The discussions needed improvement. I thought that they were not terribly productive with so many students. The smaller breakout sessions were much more productive and helpful.",
    "It seemed that a lot of the material covered in the second half of the course we had already learned in the first half. Also, the discussion sessions were good but because we had so many papers assigned for each session we often didn't actually discuss the literature.",
    "I had thought this course would fill a particular gap for those research based degrees to get information about the research process as a Masters student at Yale and to give us exercises that would help us work towards that end. I thought that the theoretical parts and the pieces that taught us how to be scientific researchers were good but could have been condensed to the first two weeks, leaving the rest of the time to focus on developing our own projects in class time and through the assignments. I had hoped for in-class exercises, more out-of-class exercises to keep us on track, and perhaps for the readings to be self-selected. Ie - 'you must read ## articles by week 2 and ## by week 3,' supplemented perhaps by just a few readings on the theory of research.",
    "Discussions were stiff. Many of the topics were very interesting but were channeled in very specific ways.",
    "seems to me that the course is too ecology focused. I understand it is the specialty of the instructor and TA, but exploring other environmental topics could help engage the rest of the class more.the way to grade class participation needs to be improved, the TA used to make a note every time someone spoke in the class. Not the best way to get people start talking in class.",
    "The class would be stronger if it included more, structured peer-to-peer feedback. It would benefit from having students meet in small groups to discuss their research ideas or at least swapping write-ups that outline project ideas, questions, etc. Although during some classes we provided feedback in a large group (such as assessing the quality of titles), we really only gave each other feedback during the grant review panel (and this was somewhat indirect). Feedback and small group conversations early on would really help students determine their research ideas early on and help shape the progression.While I appreciate the pressure it put on us, the timeframe to determining research projects (from start of semester to annotated bibliography assignment) was unpleasantly short. At a certain point students in the class realized that they should just make up a project that they don't intend to conduct for the sake of the course assignments.The implication between this and the Social Sci Research Methods class is that this is supposed to be a quantitative class. However, the class material was not directly related to quantitative specific aspects of research. Given that this was the case, the expectation that students produce a quantitative rather than qualitative proposal (as expressed by the instructor) was inappropriate.Determination of whether a study is to be qualitative or quantitative depends first on determining what you intend to research. Since an objective of this class is to force you to determine what you will research, many students will not know iftheir research will be qualitative or quantitative until halfway through the semester.Finally composition of the grant proposal would be more valuable if we were expected to structure it in the format of a proposal that we could submit in its current form. This would be more valuable than using the structure required for faculty researchers.",
    "Some of the \"worldview\" and \"philosophy of science\" material in the beginning could have been condensed.",
    "There is an inherent timing conflict for most MESc students, as they are asked to complete work for this course that assumes a more finalized, detailed version of their research projects than are likely to be ready so early in the first semester. While to some degree this is helpful in pushing the process along, it can create issues for students who are newer to the material, have difficult advisor relationships, or who make changes over time. I don't know what the answer is, or if there's a better way, but this conflict was the source of a lot of stress for myself and some of my peers.",
    "It would have been nice if Bethany Zemba gave her information on scholarships a little earlier.",
    "Readings were helpful, but all of them were on ecology which distracted me while i was reading them.",
    "Better readings, more attention to the actual content, better tools to develop proposals, actually discuss topics in research methods, smaller class, more practice, less talk.",
    "There were days spent in theoretical discussion that didn't seem very helpful for me or my project.",
    "The TA and instructor were great in this course. My only complaint is with some of the early content of the course. I was hoping for a larger writing component early on, where the professor would focus more on the style of grant writing more than the philosophy of science. (Though the philosophical component was helpful as well)",
    "I feel that more of the course should have been spent on preparing us for the grant proposal process or aiding us in deciding on our research topic rather than waiting until what felt like the last quarter of the class to rush us unaided through the intense process of writing a proposal on our own.The size of the class really hindered the discussion and guidance process. I felt like I was always struggling to get my word in in such a large group and worry that that might have affected participation grades. Since we ended up breaking the class in half for most activities anyways, why not offer two different sessions next year to alleviate this issue.Overall I felt that feedback was highly negative throughout the class and lacking in general. Only 10 points were possible total for the final project proposal which was proportionately much more work than all the other 10 point projects. This was somewhat disgruntling.",
    "So much of the class is immediately relevant to those of us developing proposals, but in many cases, its rather farcical to attempt to develop a good proposal when students simply don't have a project developed to that degree. Even under the best case scenario, one semester is a very short length of time to develop one's project. Under the worst case scenario where the project's development is not progressing, the exigencies of the class require a proposal to be essentially made up - which is of limited value to the student, and I can imagine, of much less interest to the prof. and TA who have to grade and comment on it.I don't know what the solution is, to be honest, but developing an imaginary proposal is like running an imaginary experiment. I felt like I was working on it only for the purpose of fulfilling the class requirements, rather than learning the very useful skill of proposal development.Also, the class had almost nothing to do with research methods. Why is it called that?"
