   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it!",
    "Take it! The students in the class have quite varying levels of difficult--from \"omg that's korean?\" to \"get out of this class, you fob.\" That being said, Professor Lee is obviously amazing and does a pretty good job of bridging the gap. I would say that every student in the class, regardless of starting ability, improved quite a bit. My class also bonded a lot over the course of the year, and we had a great time. The class is as much work as you want it to be. Since Professor Lee is pretty lax you can get away with doing the bare minimum, but she's so cute you just want to make her proud and do extra.",
    "Yes. This class was a great way to meet new friends AND really improve my korean at the same time. I am so glad I took it.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Of course, Angela Lee-Smith is a great professor who runs a lively class. In the second semester of the heritage speakers course there was a much greater emphasis on improving vocabulary, reading real articles, and writing at greater length. You will improve with the amount of effort you put in to this class.",
    "Learn higher-level Korean vocabulary. It won't let you read articles about government policy or art, but you should be able to handle features and tabloid magazines afterward. A great seminar-like class where you come to form emotional connections that are both personally satisfying and useful outside of class, because you actually *want* to see them outside of class, and occasionally practice Korean together. I've definitely been inspired to take more Korean classes after my experience with Lee-Sunshengnim, which I think tells you how worthwhile this class is.",
    "Definitely recommended. If you take the first term L3 course, this is an obvious no-brainer. Angela Lee-Smith, as always, is an incredibly kind, talented, and helpful instructor, and L4 will develop your writing skills much more rapidly than in previous terms.",
    "Professor Lee is an absolute pleasure. She turns a regular language class into an intimate, effective, and entertaining family. I would not have taken this class if Professor Lee did not teach it. It has been an amazing semester."
