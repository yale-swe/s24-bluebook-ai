   "comments": [
    "Take it if you are into continental stuff or political philosophy. You will never regret it.",
    "This was definitely my favorite course of the semester and maybe even all of my Yale experience. It builds really well on the History\/Politics material of the Directed Studies, and as a past DSer I really appreciated some of the major themes of the course. I absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in modern political philosophy. And Benhabib is probably the best lecturer I've had so far.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was worth every class session and all the readings.",
    "It's not really worth it. A lot of reading, fairly difficult essays (though not un-doable) and you spend too little time with each writer to get much out that is meaningful. The writers are also terrible (except Weber, Arendt, and Professor Benhabib), but you can probably tell that from the syllabus.",
    "Take this course!",
    "I'd recommend it but be warned that many of the people in the class are philosophy\/humanities majors who, from the perspective of a political science major, really detract from the class experience. The papers are definitely tough but rewarding, and most of the readings are great.",
    "Definitely if you are interested in Continental Philosophy. It's one of the most rewarding and demanding classes I've taken at Yale on Continental Philosophy.",
    "Take it. PRofessor Benhabib is amazing and brilliant. The reading is out of this world good, and both TFs seem really good. It can be hard to keep up with the reading, but you should. it is awesome.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class.",
    "This class is phenomenal. It covers clear questions through different strands, culminating at the end with thinkers that question the premises of what we have been learning the whole time. It has strong, clear themes, and it is obvious how each thinker fits into them. Sometimes the themes seem suffocating, but the TAs do a good job of opening the texts up and drawing out the intricacies. Take advantage of being able to re-write the first essay, no matter how you do on it. It's a very good exercise. Take advantage of the awesome TAs. This course provides a great introduction (for some) and in-depth analysis of the material. There's a lot of it, but doing the reading is worth it.",
    "superb class for the political brain, particularly those interested in freedom",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to modern philosophy and a very good break from the authors that are repeated again and again at philosophy classes at Yale. It deals with complicated material, but at the same time it has very exciting reading and very awesome ideas!",
    "TAKE THE CLASS!!!",
    "Benhabib's lecture is a great course - if you're willing to put in the large amount of time necessary for the reading. If you can dedicate the time to reading everything (which, to be fair, isn't THAT much), you can get a TON out of the class. If not, I'd say don't bother, especially since the essays require a lot ofin-depth thought. But overall a fantastic course!",
    "Theory heavy class. The lectures are amazing but make sure you can type\/write quickly. THe TA's really know their stuff and will challenge you. Section is pretty engaging.",
    "This was a survey of several important 20th century political philosophers. It was my first such class, and I found it very challenging at first, but I definitely felt myself improve as the course went on. I would say take it if you're going to put in the substantial amount of work, but I wouldn't see the point if you're going to blow off the reading.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but it's also really fun. The reading is difficult but the workload is never onerous and it's almost always really interesting. Prof. Benhabib is one of the best in her field and a wonderful lecturer. Weber\/Habermas\/Foucault and others provide incredibly interesting insights into the world. I enthusiastically recommend this class.",
    "Take it if you have a solid basis in philosophy. This course weighs heavily on Frankfurt school and german traditions, not so much on Derrida and Foucault. Also, be prepared for the heavy reading! It's just hard to keep track.",
    "I don't think I would recommend it. Seyla is a brilliant lecturer and a brilliant person, but the subject matter gets too frustratingly repetitive and the class attracts the worst types of people. Section was awful because of the pretentious philosophy-buffs in it (who weren't actually intelligent).",
    "Definitely take this course! The pace and material is demanding, but the lectures were always fascinating and you will feel intellectually stretched the whole way through. The prerequisites are no joke: background in Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche are especially important.",
    "As a history major who did not take DS, I was in the minority in this courses. I lacked much of the background recommended for the course, and that definitely prevented some initial understanding. Because of this, I took the course Cr\/D, and I was glad that I did. The reading list is superb, yet difficult (particularly for me), and I thoroughly enjoyed both Professor Benhabib's lectures and the TA-led sections.",
    "great class, but expect to read a lot and work really hard. good for post DS students. I spent probably 70-80% of my workload for the semester on this class, but it was so worth it if youre interested in a good introduction to modern political philosophy. nietzsche and hegel would be a great background, and really all of DS...",
    "The course is a good survey of continental politcal philosophy. The readings are challenging and overwhelming in quantity. Luckily, it is easy to get away with skipping all of the secondary source material. Benhabib is good, but not always clear in her lecturing. And good luck if you want to get any time in office hours.... I enjoyed the course, however, and if political philosophy is of interest to you, I recommend it."
