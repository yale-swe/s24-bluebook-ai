    "I recommend it, but be prepared for the class to devolve into a giant circlejerk.",
    "English course that focuses on style and form of legal writing; I would recommend to anyone interested in a greater fluency in the law.",
    "Once in a while, you stumble on a class that you are always a little sad to go to every day because you know it means that you will have an hour and fifteen minutes less class time left in the semester after it ends. This was that class for me. I often found myself looking at my watch not because I was bored, but because I wanted to know how many minutes I had left to savor before I had to leave. Ehrgood is without a doubt the most engaging teacher at Yale, and his assignments, while at times long, are usually interesting and even fun. My writing improved dramatically because of this class, and I learned new ways to think about the law and about life. Take this class.",
    "take it if you want to improve your writing. there are lots of small assignments for this class, and though it may feel trivial to memorize rules for writing, you will feel your writing improve dramatically throughout the semester as a result of these \"trivial\" exercises. the professor is quite eccentric, but he's a genius at explaining how you can edit your essays. i'm certain this class has improved my ability to both write well and edit well. after all, writing is easy. the painful part is editing.",
    "The class is a lot of work each week, but it really helps you to think about how you argue a point in a completely new light.",
    "There's one possible misconception about the class that should be clarified: while it's called \"thinking and writing about the LAW,\" the class isn't actually about actual cases or laws. Rather, the class is focused on writing and reading analytically, with the greatest emphasis on learning to be a more concise, effective writer. Along the way, you'll do a lot of written exercises that may seem tedious at first, but are actually incredibly helpful--you'll never be able to forget the writing principles you learned, and you'll come to look at your own writing differently. You'll have to take 3 or 4 style tests on these writing principles, which you'll have to memorize and prepare for by editing and re-editing practice sentences.We also studied two hypothetical cases very closely (the Speluncean explorers, Rowe v. Pacific Quad) and had to write responses (of sorts) to them. This was probably the most exciting part of the course.Finally, Professor Ehrgood is more than reason enough to take this course. He truly cares about his students, and will painstakingly comment on every single sentence of your writing in hopes of helping you become a better writer. In class, there were times when he went off on tangents, but they were all a lot of fun to listen to. And I think I walked out of class having learned more than I thought I had learned.",
    "Definitely take this class for the following reasons:1) The professor. Professor Ehrgood is amazing, has a little cult following, and will teach you a lot. He's really funny and smart and cares a lot about his students. He'll schedule one-on-one meetings to discuss your work, is flexible about deadlines and realistic about expectations, and just generally \"gets it.\"2) Your writing will really improve. In English 120 you read lots of essays and the professors have you imitate their styles, saying stuff like \"Write like this\" or \"Make your sentences clearer, brighter, more active.\" And although that works, there's a limit to how much you're going to just feel your way through it. In English 121 you really get into the nitty gritty. It fills in the gaps where intuition isn't enough. You learn about \"nominalizations\" and \"making main actions verbs,\" which is slightly dry at times, but it's not like the last time you did grammar in high school or anything because everyone's smart so it goes really fast. The majority of the class is spent talking about mock judicial opinions or case briefs. Which brings to to reason three...3) YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW YOU WANT TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL TO TAKE THIS CLASS. It's genuinely interesting and fun to debate fake cases and will build your communication skills for whatever you end up using them for.Really, take this class if you can get in. I feel like all my poor writing habits just got straightened out and I have a much deeper appreciation for the law.",
    "Take it, whether you're thinking law school or not. At the very least, this class is for intellectuals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 very strong focus on being able to make coherent arguments, both written and verbal. You have sometimes-lengthy written assignments due before every class, but it could be worse. Take it for Ehrgood and for the great in-class conversations.",
    "One of the most universally useful classes I've taken at Yale! Take it! Effective and clear writing will be valued wherever you go. The interesting and incredibly dedicated Professor Ehrgood teaches how to form clear thoughts and write clear pieces. The class will improve your thinking, your arguments, and your writing. __________ PROFESSOR: Professor Ehrgood is a boss. He lives the class, and it's sometimes funny to see him editing his sentences as he speaks them in class. He loves clear writing for the sake of clear writing, and he was formerly a practising lawyer, so he knows that part of the class just as well. I was able to reach him incredibly easily, and he gives extremely effective and precise advice on writing in tutorials. __________ FORMAT: The class revolves around two themes: general writing style, and legal writing. There are readings on the two themes and exercises every class based on the readings. You are either required to reflect on the readings or apply the writing tips in the readings. In class,we discuss the readings or the exercises. The bulk of the work is before Thanksgiving break. The class kind of resembles a language class, except the language is English. __________ CONTENT: On the topic of general writing style, we focus on Garner's Legal Writing book which teaches us basic techniques for building strong sentences, paragraphs, and pieces and do the exercises. We also read about ambiguities in sentences and how to avoid them. On the topic of legal writing, we read the Speluncean Explorers, as well as the add-on cases: these are a set of basic cases that explore the bases of legal philosophy. We read a few other excerpts that explicitly outline the conflicting bases of legal reasoning: text, purpose, tradition, precedent, and policy. __________ WORK: There are assignments twice a week - it generally took me a decent amount of time, but in retrospect I definitely could've done all of them in 30-45 minutes if I'd focused. There's one midterm paper, one in-class presentation, and one final assignment (which includes a revision assignment based on the midterm paper). There are 2-3 style tests based on the readings in Garner. The grading is kind of nebulous, but I wouldn't worry too much about it because this work is incredibly useful and rewarding either way. __________ SUMMARY: A great must-take class with an incredibly interesting, knowledgeable, and involved professor. Legal Writing is probably the most objectively useful class I've taken in my 4 years at Yale and in the top-5 classes I've taken for sure.",
    "Yes. This class improved my writing more than any other class I have taken by far and Ehrgood is a fantastic and interesting professor.",
    "Definitely more focused on the writing aspect of law more than law itself. Still, Ehrgood's an amazing professor with great enthusiasm for teaching. He does get off track very easily and can be disorganized. Use shopping period wisely. Workload is pretty manageable.",
    "I learned to think better and write better. The daily assignments take time, but they increase blood flow to the brain. I felt myself thinking hard in this class all the time. Even in a good class I usually feel that way only a couple times per semester. I also learned a lot of really practical nuts-and-bolts things about sentence construction and structure. As a result, my writing has become clearer. I even find the process of writing easier (a relief I didn't think was possible), since I can better figure out how to say what I mean. Class meetings were fun too."
