    "Susan brought in several guest lecturers throughout the semester who were great. The field trip to the peabody collections was awesome too. I also enjoyed the assignments - particularly the review of a ESA recovery plan - and thought that all assignments were very aplicable to what were learning in class.",
    "The guest speakers who talked about their experience and the need for interdisciplinarity in their works.",
    "The guest speakers -- especially Rich Wallace and Dave Mattson -- were dynamic and engaging, and really helped make some of Susan's more abstract statements tangible and real. I also really enjoyed the recovery plan critique assignment, which allowed us to implement some of the mental frameworks that we developed in the class.",
    "* The talks given by guests and students were always very interesting and insightful.",
    "The material was taught through conceptual terms and also in case studies. Additionally students were allowed to apply the concepts to their own experiences in their lives or their research."

   "comments": [
    "In the beginning of the semester I would have appreciated a little bit more structure. I know Susan is not big on lecturing but maybe split up the class so its half lecture and then half discussion. Also, incorporating more case studies within the interdisciplinary framework might help facilitate discussion. It can be hard to have an engaging discussion for readings that were strictly on the policy sciences.",
    "It will be great if the professor can have students analyze more than one policy in the future.",
    "The class didn't really seem to follow any logical pattern. Class sessions often veered far off course, as the instructor sometimes engaged in stream-of-consciousness monologues about topics only tangentially related to the subject matter. I often left class sessions with no idea of what had just happened. All too often, the instructor would initiate a promising discussion thread; and then, instead of facilitating discussion, answer her own question or take the conversation in some unpredictable and hard-to-follow direction. This grew very frustrating.",
    "The class was poorly structured. Having readings and discussions during class was helpful, but not enforced. The final assignment was a good exercise, but was not rigorous enough to make us fully understand the basis of interdisciplinarity.I would suggest to keep the course as focused as to reading the case study book and discussing it in depth. The readings and other smaller side assignments were a bit distracting from the main goal of the class.",

    "I needed at least one social science course for my program and had heard from lots of students - current and past - to take one of Susan's courses. I also really didn't know anything about species conservation in the U.S. and being interested in land management I thought it was important that I knew something about it.",
    "This course is very valuable in the type of work I pursue in the future as I will be dealing with diverse groups of people.",

This is truly a professional class in that you learn this interdisciplinary framework and how to apply it to natural resource problems. I do wish we spent a little more time on the species and ecosystem conservation side of things since Susan has so much experience in that field but overall it was a great course and I got a lot out of it.",
    "Not really. Frankly, my understanding of what is meant by the term \"interdisciplinarity\" isn't much clearer than it was three months ago. I think a big part of the problem is that there have been very few cases of its successful use in species conservation. Nearly all the cases we studied were negative -- cases in which interdisciplinarity was not practiced, and species did not recover as a result. Seeing a positive case -- i.e., the successful application of an ID framework -- would have crystallized things for me, and, I think, for the rest of the class. Maybe it isn't the instructor's fault that there are few examples, but it was still frustrating.",

At the same time, I feel like there's a lot of knowledge out there that I could have acquired, but didn't. I thought that many of the readings and class sessions were redundant.",

    "If you're on the fence about taking the course, don't be intimidated by the first class - things will pick up. Go see Susan often - she's great to talk to. Start reviewing your recovery plan early in the semester. It will make your presentation that much better and you'll get more out of the experience if you do.",
    "The text book is very very useful.",
    "You have to work really hard to stay with Susan's train of thought. She's obviously incredibly intelligent and experienced; but her hyperactive mind and body of knowledge is exactly what make her tough to follow. If you just let her go on tangents,you'll lose the thread. You have to constantly ask questions, challenge her, make sure she's explaining things clearly... this is all much easier said than done, though.",
    "I would suggest students to take the Foundations class Susan offers during the Fall semester. This will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the topics of the class.",
