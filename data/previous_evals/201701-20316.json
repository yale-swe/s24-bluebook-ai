   "comments": [
    "I learned about civilizations in mesoamerica, their ethnohistory, and the methods we use to study their artifacts. We also spent alot of time talking about maize and its agricultural importance.",
    "I learned to view archeology and history with the eye of an anthropologist, to understand that our expectations are different from the past.",
    "I went into this course with only a high school-level exposure to the history of Mesoamerica, and with virtually no experience in archaeology (theoretical or practical). This class offered not only insight into a rich and compelling history and culture of a region that is often overlooked\/oversimplified in global history classes, but also an exciting crash course in archaeological understanding. I left the class able to discuss in detail the material cultures of the Olmec, Maya, and Aztec (among many others), but also to understand principles of archaeological and anthropological study.",
    "The class is a great basic overview of an intro to most major Mesoamerican civilizations. There's a good mix between overarching concepts and nitty-gritty detail, which makes the class interesting and three-dimensional."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The textbook we use is a strength. I feel like the Evans textbooks goes into just the right amount of depth for a student interested in the subject. We also covered many different sites, some of which were not too important, and I wish we had talked more about the big sites like Teotihuacan, Tula, and Tenochtitlan. We also spent alot of time looking at pottery. which can get repetitive after a while. I found that the sessions in which we had the opportunity to look at artifacts from the peabody was really useful, and made good use of yale resources available to us. The weekly quizzes encouraged us to read.",
    "The course material varied in how interesting it was for me. The textbook (Evans) was not good and impossible to get through. Lectures dragged on sometimes, but I really enjoyed when we took field trips. The trip to New York was really cool and I also liked going to the Beineke and Art Gallery. The class could be improved by choosing a different textbook, or only having students read relevant articles, which were mostly interesting. I also think that too much reading was assigned at once.",
    "The interaction levels of the course were very high, I got to learn from everyone of my peers and follow a discussion from my professor and teaching fellow. I would say more direction for the reading, maybe in the form of a study guide, woulf help the students out in the quizzes and reading. Sometimes it was hard to decipher what we needed to know",
    "The strengths of this course are in its subject material and curriculum, in Professor Chinchilla's lectures, and in the variety of opportunities offered by the class. The opportunity to study, in remarkable depth, breadth, and detail, the cultures of Mesoamerica with exposure to exciting primary sources and accessible contemporary scholarly texts is a major point in its favor. Additionally, Professor Chinchilla offers in his class meetings a healthy variety among slideshows, video presentations, discussions, seminars, and lectures. The most unique strength of this class was the variety of opportunities. We were able to go to the Y.U.A.G, the Peabody, and the Beinecke on multiple occasions to examine primary documents and artifacts, and discuss their importance in exceptional detail and depth. The course's main weakness is a disjointedness between the readings and the lectures. While both are compelling, there is often little overlap between a particular week's assigned readings and Professor Chinchilla's slideshow, leaving the students to fill in the gaps.",
    "The class has very interesting material, and the extra readings are a strong supplement. I might move away from having student-guided classes, as I didn't feel like those often went as well as one hoped."

   "comments": [
    "I found definitely recommend if the student has interest in ancient mesoamerica. If not, then dont bother taking it because you might get bored, and lack of participation will damage the class environment since it is a small class. Expect to participate alot, or make a fool out of yourself.",
    "I would recommend taking this class credit d fail. It's just not worth it to do all the readings and requires a lot of time and effort to do well. The field trips were really cool though.",
    "This class is an amazing opportunity, and I highly recommend it. Professor Chinchilla is clearly an expert in this field, and his classes are fun and varied. The subject material is stuff that you always wished you could learn more about, covered in really extensive depth and detail. The best part, though: the class occasionally meets in the Beinecke, YUAG, or Peabody to examine artifacts and documents firsthand. It's one of those amazing opportunities that makes Yale special, so don't miss out!",
    "I would recommend the class if the topic is something you're interested. Your engagement with the material will determine how much you enjoy the class."
