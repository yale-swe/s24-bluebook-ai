    "It's a decent lab course if you need it for your major or for med school. Covers basic aspects of evolutionary biology but isn't really that correlated to 225. That being said, a lot of the experiments and computer simulations are repetitive in their main concepts. So, many times, you do a lot of tedious work for little reward. Other points: not many guidelines are given for the end-of-term presentation. Readings for each week are often poorly defined. Some experiments take way longer than they should. BUT you do get out early almost every day, and you get to know Prof. Caccone, Katy (TA), and your classmates because it's a small, chill lab course. I'd recommend it as long as you keep in mind that it's much more work than the 0.5 credit insinuates.",
    "E&EB 226 is a great lab course. It\u2019s best to take it if you have already acquired a heavy science background. Many topics covered ranged from intermediate to advanced science. Taking it with E&EB 226 at the same time was great because it helped reinforce some concepts covered in that class. All the labs are really fun to do, but the reports after the labs will take a lot of time to write.",
    "A pretty good course that surveys a number of the common techniques a lab biologist would need. The computer labs are fairly useless, but you'll learn a fair amount from the course."
