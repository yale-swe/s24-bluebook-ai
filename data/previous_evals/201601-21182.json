   "comments": [
    "if you gotta take it, you gotta take it am i right? you're probably premed so yeah you do complete the psets in section and study hall, study the lecture slides and don't worry too much about the actual modules. the class covered a lot of ground and grade-wise expectations are clear. the expectations for exams? not so clear. you can get an A if you just do the right things and go to lecture. however, you are by no means prepared for the MCAT",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this class unless you have to take it because the material often seems out of the scope of an introductory physics class. The work is hard and it takes a lot of time.",
    "If you're a premed, take this class. You learn physics in the standard way (it's not a different syllabus\/biological apps in the way that Phys 170 is) and it's very manageable.",
    "No. Please only take it if you have to.",
    "Not a bad class, better than 170",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "Honestly, as much as I love the idea of Physics 171 providing a more practical approach to physics as a biology or pre-med student, I mourn the fact that learning those applications assumes that bio\/pre-med students don't know or need to know math. Seriously, you get so little out of this class that actually could be really interesting.",
    "171 is generally easier than 170 even though the material is conceptually more difficult. The instructors did a pretty good job of making sure the material \"stuck.\" through the very transparent nature of the course: lots of resources, through sections, study halls, and peer tutors. Exams were fair (if you take the time to do the problem sets and really study, they were very straightforward and easy, unlike exams from 170). The grading for 171 (like 170) was also very nice; you only have to achieve a certain percentage score to get a certain grade, which is awesome especially because the class is littered with premeds. I would recommend this class to another student just because of how easy it is to really do well if you put in the time and make use of resources. The instructors generally were good. I liked Claudia more than Rona and I think most people would agree. To be fair, this year Claudia taught 170 with the man himself, Mochrie, so she's probably more used to what kids expect from the course. Overall, take the class if you can put in the time and effort to go to class (which you have to, clicker participation is part of your grade), go to section, and do challenging but not overbearing problem sets.",
    "If physics is not your strong suit, PHYS 171 is a slower paced and simpler version of E&M and PHYS 181. However, much of your understanding will need to be self motivated. Look online for resources rather the the modules. Study halls are also helpful.",
    "In no universe would I recommend that another student take this class. But, just like everyone else in this class, I'm pretty sure everyone takes it because they have no choice. I can't speak to the quality of 180\/181, but at the very least this class is very accommodating and provides you with a lot of avenues to get help and support if you are willing to take them, however the class already takes up enough time and I don't always want to put more time in even if I should get the help.",
    "Hard",
    "The teachers don't explain concepts well. Expect to spend lots of time teaching yourself the concepts for the psets.",
    "If you arent pre-med, avoid this class at all costs. Take 180 or 200. You will most likely want to learn applications of physics and 171 is not the place to do that. If you are pre-med shop it, but still take 180 or 200. THe class is structured in a manner that is favorable to pre-meds so maybe it aligns more with what a typical pre-med is trying to get out of the course. If physics 171 were an NBA team they would be the Sacramento Kings. Not terrible, but a far cry from your best option. However, I am not pre-med, so maybe my perspective would be changed if I were.",
    "PHYS 171 is a physics course with biological applications. I would recommend the course to students who are interested in learning physics and are interested in biology and life science. The course shows relevant application. The best part of the course is its organization. It's extremely well organized and definitely gives students the resources they need to improve or learn.",
    "If you can take something else I would recommend that. For most possible, this is not an option. Good luck!",
    "PHYS 171 is essentially a direct continuation of PHYS 170 as far as teaching style and how the course is operated. The material is different, and sometimes it can be more quantitative and analytical and other times more conceptual especially towards the end of the semester. The problem sets and exams were reasonable in this class.",
    "Tough and haphazard.",
    "I spent more time on this class, by being in class, doing psets, going to study halls, and studying for weekly quizzes and exams. And despite all that time, I feel like I retained minimal knowledge. And obscure knowledge at that. Not normal physics concepts. So just be prepared for that, grit your teeth, and fight through it.",
    "I would not take this course unless you have to. If you do need to take a year of physics for a pre-professional program, I would take the entire PHYS 170-171 sequence.",
    "Most people who take this class are required to do so, and given the amount of work involved, I would hesitate to recommend it to someone that doesn't need to. However, if you are required to take this class, I think that Professor Ramos and Professor De Grandi are good instructors to have -- they are clear and fair. They also allowed us to do test corrections to earn back a third of the points we lost on the exam. Be warned that the workload is very heavy -- weekly quizzes and problem sets on top of midterms made this class a huge time suck. For the most part, the difficulty level of the assessments was reasonable.",
    "Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to.",
    "A necessary evil, better than I expected",
    "So much better than 170. The best thing about this class is the supportive environment because you're not graded in comparison to everyone else, and they encourage collaboration. More premed classes need to be like this.",
    "It's a class that will touch on some really, really interesting physics phenomena that will help you understand biology better. But it is a hard class, and will require a lot of outside studying time to make the concepts accessible (at least to non-math\/physics minded people like myself).",
    "I would not recommend Physics 171 to another student unless it is absolutely necessary to take. I did not feel like I learned as much as I should have. I recommend taking Physics 181 instead.",
    "I liked this better than 180, definitely consider it, it's not hard to switch from 180.",
    "If you need physics for pre-med\/MCDB stuff then yeah take this class.",
    "A \"physics for premed\" course that feels even less relevant than the 180\/181 track. The professors, Claudia and Rona, are very sweet and open, but the Modules that they have to work with are awful. It focuses on deriving equations and relatively obscure mathematical tricks. Stick with 180\/181, you won't regret it.",
    "Take the TEAL classroom. Work on psets with friends. I actually liked Phys 170 and 171 not too bad if you took AP physics in high school. You can have fun if you put the work in and i think it is applicable to bio people and premed people there will be times when you are like \"this doesn't relate to physics at all\" and you just have to deal with it LOL",
    "Yes.",
    "Well, I'm just glad its over. Don't take this class for fun. I seriously have no idea why someone would take this class for fun. This was probably one of the most time consuming classes I have taken, but the professors and TAs do offer a lot of support in helping students do better. We also got opportunities to redeem ourselves and learn from our mistakes. And as an MCDB major, I do have to say that there were a few things I learned about in this class that I also learned about in my biology classes, but I didn't really understand those things any better. It was a lot of little things in a small amount of time.",
    "AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL I don't recommend but I know many of us will have to take it anyway. It's not an inclusive environment, especially for 1st generation premed students who have never taken physics before.",
    "Odds are you're taking this class because you're premed - it is better than 170, but still not great. Come prepared to put in a similar work effort as was required for 170.",
    "Take 181 if you actually want to understand physics. This class was one of the worst I've taken at Yale. Although the concepts covered were not extraordinarily difficult, the explanations of those concepts both in lecture and in the modules were awful. The class was frustratingly unclear and the information was laid out in the most convoluted way possible.",
    "It is generally an interesting class, but is difficult. Be prepared to get a lot of help outside class, because I often did not understand what was happening during class.",
    "People don't usually take PHYS 171 unless it is required for their major or pre-professional track. That being said the course isn't bad! It requires a lot of work outside of class but as long as you work with peers, the material is accessible and engaging.",
    "Easier than 180 if that's where you're coming from, and far less stressful. The weekly quizzes keep you on top of things and the psets are hard, but better if you go to the weekly study halls and work with other students\/TFs. You're probably premed, so just get through the requirement. Claudia and Rona are really nice.",
    "Don't take this physics unless you have to; it's a hard class with math that is above the level they say is going to be in it and it's not enjoyable.",
    "Horrible class. I repeat horrible class. Utterly pointless, horribly taught, not structured properly, honestly an embarrassment to Yale. My high school physics teacher put the professors of this class to shame. Everyone knew it was a joke and the professors lost control of the class on a daly basis. Lectures were literally stalled because rona and claudia were stuck pointlessly deriving equations that they got confused over. The lecture slides had nothing to do with the homework, nothing to do with the exams, and nothing to do with real physics. honestly a shame Yale puts up with this lackluster disorganized crap. terrible structure. Its best to hire real engaging professors and teach kids classical physics. doing a hodgepodge of bs really is not the answer. The only silver lining were absolutely great td's. I learned everything from the 1 week review sessions that that the ta's taught. They clearly put everything into scope and used an old fashioned chalkboard to teach physics..something rona and claudia obviously couldn't do. please cancel this embarrassment of a class.",
    "Honestly, if you're taking this, it's probably as a pre-requisite so you don't have much choice. It's not *terrible* but it's not great. The way to go is to take Phys 180 (with Nikhil Padmanabahn), and then take 171. That's what I did, and it worked out fine. They made it a lot harder this year, apparently, and I also felt like there was virtually no discussion of bio in 171, save a few exceptions. Not good or bad, just not as it was advertised."
