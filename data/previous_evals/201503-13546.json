    "About the course was very helpful, and I learned a lot from all different techniques that we explored. At times I had a really hard time with the mathematical components of the class I don't know whether that time could have been spent doing something more related to practical uses of the models or making our understanding of their inner workings a little bit easier. I liked it in class we went through examples and actually saw how the models were working those are my favorite discussions. I think would've been nice to have had a question-and-answer session briefly following each homework being turned in, because that's when the materials fresh in our minds we can ask relevant questions.",

    "Assignments and projects were always well-applied, with a clear reason for doing the assignment. It was easy to frame my thoughts on each assignment in a way that made sense to me and my research. The course was also very well organized with a sensible progression in topics.",
    "The best aspects of this course were deftly the homework assignments and having the opportunity to practice modeling on a regular basis. I enjoyed working with the data sets and practicing the skills, though at times it did require going to see Henry to make things work properly.",
    "Regression is an important topic to scientific consideration of the environment. One is hard-pressed to think about working with environment without comprehension of this material.",
    "The best aspect of this course was hands-on experience in practicing the different regression models and how to use it in R software. Tim really wants to make sure you understand it and cares about his students.",

    "Nothing",
    "Lecture's were very theory-heavy. Theory by itself is not bad, but too much of it made the lectures dull and, at times, very difficult to understand. A good understanding of matrix algebra is essential to understanding the lectures, but too little time is spent on actually developing the skills necessary to understand the notation and associated theory.",
    "I think perhaps working to make the in class portion a bit more engaging would be really helpful. The notes are extremely well-written and helpful, and I constantly return to them, but at times I feel like I get more out of reading the notes on my own then by sitting in class hearing them. So perhaps there's some way to apply the notes to the class lecture? Not sure what the best way to go about this is.",

Even though it's only one branch of modeling it opens windows to new techniques and thoughts. I thought this course provided a really good framework for understanding other models too.",
    "Good fit. Statistical consideration of environmental data is essential to work in the environment.",
    "This course is perfect for those people looking for a way to study regression statistics within the forestry school at a lightly advanced level than those offered by the basic courses. It is very heavily reliant on examples from forestry but the practical applications of the skills learned here extend far beyond it. Perhaps more examples from other disciplines would be useful in providing context for students.",

But you have to be able to plan ahead and be comfortable being frustrated sometimes. Using the teaching fellow is particularly helpful, but you need to schedule yourself so that you can do that accordingly.",
    "Have some background in statistics. Be prepared to learn the R statistics programming language while learning regression -- this can be a challenge. If you already know R, by all means, jump in! Prof. G. is fantastic!",
