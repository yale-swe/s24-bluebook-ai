    "Drs Peduzzi and Ciarleglio are outstanding biostatisticans and teachers.They are very generous in sharing their vast experience in designing, executing, and analyzing multi-center clinical trials.Dr Peduzzi's deep analytical prowess is matched only by his sincerity and dedication to ethics in investigational science. It was really a pleasure to have the company of such a moral force in class each week.",
    "The course would be greatly improved if the last several lectures (sample size, data analysis, etc.) were moved up to the beginning and middle of the course. Much of the content early on had already been covered in BIS540, which many students had already taken.",
    "Great class, especially the class project. However, the material presented was very redundant from Dr. Makuch's fundamentals of clinical trials class. It would be nice if the class was more math heavy, rather than just conceptual. However, the project was what made the class so interesting. It's very practical and it was a great experience going through the thought process of designing a clinical trial. It would be great if this class would pick up from fundamentals in more detail though.",
