    "Yes I would recommend this class. I'm not even a Global Health Fellow but I found this to be an informative class. It makes you really think through the process of designing your own research which is a great exercise in it self. If you're interested in actually carrying out your own research, you have an added bonus of leaving the class with a polished proposal.",
    "Yes, it was super useful",
    "Leslie Curry is a great professor!! Everyone loves her. The material is highly relevant and if you haven't studied this content before this is rich, helpful material. If you have studied research methods or have high familiarity, then talk with the professor ahead of time to make sure this is not going to be too basic. This is a required course for the Global Health Fellows program, so you may need to take this course, in which case go for it! It really helps to prepare for any type of research project you want to do - whether it's summer or not, as I did a full year project for after graduation.",
    "A lot of students will have to take this as a global health fellows requirement. I would recommend this course insofar as it teaches important skills and concepts needed in the field of research. It was not my favorite class, but it was definitely the most important.",
    "This was a great introduction to research methods where you basically spend the whole semester developing a global health research proposal. If you are hoping to do independent research in the summer (or post-grad, or sometime in the future), you should absolutely take this course. As a global health fellow, this class is essential, but it is open to non-GH fellows as well, and it is not awkward at all to be in the class if you're not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is the most practical course I've taken thus far at Yale. While the material is not extremely engaging, it is SO useful and applicable to all aspects for the rest of my academic career. Also Professor Curry was wonderful and one of the best professors I've had. The fact that there are two TAs in the class was also great because I felt like I got a lot of hands-on help.",
    "Great course for learning the fundamentals of research in global health. Even if you don't have a specific proposal in mind, I think this course sets a good foundation and provides you with the resources you need to learn about any type of research you might pursue in the future.",
    "A wonderful class that I would absolutely recommend to anyone studying global health. You will learn a lot about research methods through writing a research proposal that you can potentially carry out in the upcoming summer. Professor Curry is absolutely incredible -- very knowledgeable, helpful, and kind. Grading is on the hard side, but don't let that scare you away from a really excellent course."
