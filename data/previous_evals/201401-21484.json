    "Yes!! You will never leave this class feeling like you haven't learned anything, I promise.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is looking to take an English class that moves beyond literature written in the US and Britain. It will help you think about literature, post-colonial issues, and the creation of knowledge in ways you may not have ever be challenged to do so before. With a reading list this great, the discussion will never lag.",
    "DO IT. well-designed and really fun.",
    "Take it! Professor Pravinchandra is an amazing professor, and it's fantastic to be exposed to an area of literature most of us haven't read much of.",
    "Yes! Really interesting material you might not be exposed to otherwise at Yale."
