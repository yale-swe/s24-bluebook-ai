    "I was very invested in this course, despite not having a musical background myself. I have grown to appreciate the level of artistry, hard work and intellect required to write good lyrics. Michael is very brilliant and dedicated. I appreciate his tell-it-like-it-is style of teaching. He cares very much about his students and puts a lot of time\/effort into his feedback. He did a great job of bringing in guest artists who provided us further context for this particular art form and the industry as a whole."

    "For my final song I decided to adapt a lyric from a (non-musical) play I'd already written. This was difficult but I learned a lot not only about songwriting but about the characters in the preexisting play. I might apply some of what I learned in that final assignment to restructuring the dramatic action in the original scene\/text. I also would strongly consider lyric writing in the future on other projects. I really enjoyed collaborating with a composer. A true highlight of the entire semester!"

    "One caveat: for those who cannot read music, there may be some initial difficulty with writing assignments (mainly when writing lyrics to music without the benefit of dummy lyrics to help with scan and meter). It is a sharp learning curve. However, I found things got easier when we started writing our own lyrics."
