    "Let me give you a little background on myself: I came into this course as a freshmen, having taken AP Calc soph yr, AP Stats junior yr, and no math except AP Physics B my senior yr. If you are one of those people that has forgotten how to integrate, don't worry. All hope is not lost. You can either spend a little bit of each day in the summer reviewing calc, or do what I did; spend the entire Labor Day weekend relearning a year's worth of Calc. The math department does have calc tutorials, so go through them. But you MUST refresh your memory, or you'll be screwed. Also, pick a good professor. This is SOOOO important because if you get stuck with a shitty teacher, you're doomed. Go to office hours. Take time to visit math tutors and find one that you really click with. CHECK EVERY PSET.",
    "Good if you want a good understanding of multivar. VERY HARSH CURVE. The mode score on a midterm was 150\/150. If you didn't get a perfect score, your A is basically gone.",
    "Math 120 is a great course with Miki. If you like learning at a fast pace and always being on your toes, this class is perfect. Sometimes I found that if I got distracted for five minutes, I had no idea what was going on in the lecture so make sure that you really like math enough to sit through it for an hour and fifteen minutes.",
    "Do take it, but only if you want to be a Math major.",
    "the class moves very fast, but if you stay on top of your work\/psets every week you should be fine. they're pretty nice with the curve. take it if you need to.",
    "It's a class that requires a good amount of studying if you are striving for a really good grade. the curves are nice though.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is well taught and the progression of concepts helps understanding of past lessons, so take it!",
    "It's a good course if you're very good at Math, but if you're not 100% certain definitely take Math 115.",
    "take it if you want to learn multivariable calc, but the curve is a bit challenging",
    "Math 120 is a great course for any student who was good at\/enjoyed math in high school. My main words of warning are not to take this course lightly just because you were good at math in high school. If you've never taken multivariable calculus before, THIS COURSE WILL BE HARD! With single-variable calculus, everything is easy to visualize. You can draw any graph by hand, and taking an integral is straightforward. In Math 120, this is not the case at all. At any point on a graph, there could be lines going in all different directions, and surfaces are very hard to picture in your head (and on paper). None of the actual math is much more complex, but the visualization and setups of the integrals are what make the class challenging. However, with practice, setups become much more straightforward, and you begin to realize just how cool 3D graphs are, despite their apparent complexity.",
    "What is there to say? It's a typical intro math class that most people are taking to fulfill a requirement. The material isn't terribly difficult, but be prepared to spend a few hours a week working through appalling algebra on the problem sets. Also, be prepared to shop professors looking for one that speaks English and has teaching experience. Miki Havlickova and Yu Wen Hsu are both good to have.",
    "The majority of the course is not challenging. Keep up with the psets since the midterms are of equal difficulty. Once you get to Greens, Stokes, and Divergence Theorem, actually spend time understanding them. These theorems combined killed me on the final. DEFINITELY TAKE THE COURSE WITH MIKI. She is the most intelligent and articulate professor I've had at Yale. Each class of hers is extremely well-organized, and she provides multiple examples to substantiate a concept. She genuinely cares about her students, and her concealed humor makes her all the more enjoyable to be around. Honestly, I can't stress how awesome Miki is.",
    "I would not recommend the class to people who don't need to take it. It is an intense class if you are not a strong math student.",
    "As long as you're okay with math, this is nothing new - simply the next step in calculus. Focus more on getting in a get section. Havlickova is excellent, although I have heard various horror stories about other sections.",
    "This class basically is a harder version of single-variable calculus - now you have more dimensions and you have to learn about vector fields and new equations. Math 120 shouldn't be too hard if you have a solid foundation of BC calc.",
    "Math120, while the course is more difficult in grades than Enas151, is good if you need to take multivar as a prereq for a science\/econ class or if you just like math.",
    "Definitely recommend- good class",
    "A difficult but fair class. Professor Havlickova is quirky and amusing, and does a good job of explaining a really hard topic. Problem sets take quite a while but really help you get a better grasp of the topic. The exams were reasonable and offered more time than you'll need. Don't make my mistakes; if you want a good grade then take advantage of office hours, peer tutoring, study groups, Khan academy videos, etc.",
    "It depends- I would recommend Math 120 to another student if they like mathematics. For a history major with no interest in quantitative study, for interest, I would not recommend the class, as it seems to weed out many of the weaker or less math-inclined students who venture to enroll in the class, even though it is a major gateway into the rest of the courses in the math department.",
    "I would recommend taking this course, but your experience could vary greatly from mine depending on the teacher."
