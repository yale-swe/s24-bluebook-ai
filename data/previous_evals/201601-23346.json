Also, too many topics were covered each day in the discussion sections -- we would just be getting to an interesting conversation, and have to switch topics. We never had enough time to cover all 3 topics scheduled for each session. It might be useful to organize reading groups that meet once a week outside of class (in addition to a broader discussion section).",
