   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course!!! First of, the material is super interesting. Second of, the 3 exams are open note which is so refreshing. You're really able to focus on the material and learn, rather than stress about memorizing everything. Class is so interesting, and despite my being a night owl, I made it to every single 9am. Professor Kyriakides rocks !",
    "Great BME elective. Pretty chill class--all you need to do is go to lecture and take VERy good notes. Open book exam makes this class a lot less stressful. No work outside of class.",
    "This is a fantastic course! The material is very interesting and applicable to research. The workload is extremely low (three non-cumulative open note exams, no psets), but you still feel accomplished studying because the material is so interesting. Highly recommend!",
    "Definitely recommend!! Take it if you're mechE and interested at all in BME!",
    "Fascinating course, would definitely recommend",
    "This is a super fun class because Professor Kyriakides is full of great anecdotes and insight into medical device design. You'll also learn a lot about how the human body will destroy your chances at becoming rich through glucose sensor designs.",
    "I absolutely loved this course and think more science courses at Yale should be taught in this manor. The class focuses on topics in biomedical engineering, from the perspective of an immunologist. As a pre-medical student this course introduced me to a side of medicine and an understanding of the body I had never considered. Professor Kyriakides analyzes scientific papers as a means of teaching the advances in each type of technology. His approach will be extremely helpful for anyone planning to complete independent research. You'll not only learn about what happens when foreign materials are implanted in the body but, how to extract the vital information from a scientific paper while considering its strengths and weaknesses.",
    "a fascinating class that i highly recommend for any bio-oriented individuals",
    "An awesome class with great content and entertaining lectures. Only two midterms that are open notes and a final that only covers the last part of the material and is also open notes. Highly recommended!",
    "Doable as a non-BME engineer, but the class has a very strong biology focus. Biggest thing I'll get out of it will be the response of the body to foreign objects and wounds.",
    "This class is one of the few lecture classes that is not boring to sit in. The material is all stuff that is really interesting and new- many of the papers you read were published within the last 10 years and it's so worth it.",
    "Very interesting and definitely taught at a level that reaches a wide audience. Def go to lecture though!",
    "Good elective for BME majors.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student who is interested in medicine. The course is a low-key introduction to inflammation pathways, an understanding of which will prove invaluable in future courses or programs. That may sound dry, but Kyriakides breathes life into the semester with engaging anecdotes and criticisms of modern literature (which makes the material all the more easy to remember!). The exam structure (two midterms and a final) and course material is easy to keep up with, and becomes intrinsically motivating as you move through the class. I recommend having a basic understanding of biology prior to taking this course. Experience with reading primary literature is also recommended, although the pertinent information in each study is outlined in the lectures. Remember Kyriakides' criticisms of primary literature and you'll be fine."
