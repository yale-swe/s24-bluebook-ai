   "comments": [
    "Fabulous way to analyze 20th century America in a stimulatingly interesting and novel way.",
    "Definitely want to keep in mind from a pretty early stage the fact the paper comes at the end and benefits from a lot of separate research. We got to watch some fillms I really enjoyed (West Side Story among them) and the reading is generally informative about NY.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone really interested in cultural history. It's a great opportunity to explore the cultural history of a specific and concrete space and time.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Yes.",
    "It's a great course. If you already love New York City or want to learn more about it, I would highly recommend it.",
    "Honestly, this course sounds more interesting than it is. Each week sounds really exciting, but can be bogged down by super academic, heady, and somewhat incomprehensible readings. I would have loved more primary sources. That said, the class can be really interesting, and the final 20 page paper may seem daunting but feels like a great accomplishment once it's completed.",
    "This is a great course with a lot of reading that is certainly not all necessary to do in full. The information is really interesting and the ideas of the course, though specific to NYC, can certainly be extended to a great number of fields including the arts, art history, sociology, urban studies, etc."
