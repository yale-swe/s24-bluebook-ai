    "While labs have a reputation for being challenging and lots of work, they can be fun, provided time is put in to preparing before class. I would definitely recommend CHEM 136L to another student. It is informative, fun, and the expectations are clear and easy to meet. It may be more hours than other classes, but the work is not difficult.",
    "only take it if you need it",
    "Your mom always told you to start your work early and do it bit by bit so you didn't have to do it all the last night. She was never more right than with Gen Chem II Lab. If you start your lab early, it's doable. Otherwise, it's a nightmare. Study the prelab quiz sample questions - they will really help. You might get destroyed on some prelab quizzes, but generally grading on labs is very generous. I'm told \"it gets better\" after Gen Chem lab - I sure hope so.",
    "CHEM 136L is a lot of work, but it's worth taking if you have to.",
    "Painful",
    "Start the lab reports early, and don't hesitate to ask for help from the instructor and\/or TA. Would recommend if you enjoy classic chemistry lab.",
    "It's inherently a boring course in my opinion, but it was made as straightforward and painless as possible so well done in that respect. Dr. Parr is the man.",
    "It is a fine lab, and you must take it. Professor Parr is a fun, straightforward Professor to take it with so I would recommend taking it with him.",
    "Chem 136L is a good general chemistry lab course. The course really allowed students to hone their lab skills. Although the lab does not always line up with lecture material, lab was very helpful to understanding course material better. Students should definitely take lab at the same time as the lecture. Although many say lab is more work than the credit given to it, lab is definitely beneficial and one can do well if they are willing to put the work in.",
    "CHEM 136L is the lab that students typically take with CHEM 167, since both courses cover largely the same topics. Four straight hours of lab are not nearly as tedious as they may sound, and lab reports are only unpleasant if they are procrastinated. Overall, go into lab with an optimistic attitude, especially since this course can be enjoyable with a positive outlook.",
    "It is a helpful class.",
    "CHEM 136L was a great way to become familiar with lab rules and techniques.",
    "The experiments are enjoyable if you like hands-on learning although they can take some time. Sometimes the work can seem like a lot, so good time management is definitely needed.",
    "A solid foundational class, a great accompaniment to chem, the best part of this class is the professors.",
    "The labs are definitely tedious but do-able. If you just read the lab background info\/procedure beforehand and pay attention to the pre-lab lecture, you'll do fine on the quiz and the lab. It does take some time to prepare and complete the lab reports, but you'll do well if you put in the time.",
    "This chem lab is a great overview to begin chemistry at Yale with. I would recommend it to someone with a background in chemistry, but may suggest that it may be more difficult for someone who hasn't because the lab activities may be on a topic that hasn't even been broached in lecture.",
    "Chem 136L is a really fun class to take. The experiments done are very interesting and really helped me to supplement the material that I was taking in my Chem class at the time (Chem 167). Although the lab reports do take a lot of time to finish, doing the calculations and answering the questions further helps supplement the materials. I would definitely recommend this course for someone who is taking chem 167 because it greatly helps with both classes.",
    "I would recommend it to another student because it was an enjoyable lab to apply what is learned within general chemistry."
