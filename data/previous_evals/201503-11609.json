   "comments": [
    "This is a good introductory course to astronomy. As a non-STEM major, I found the class approachable, interesting, and doable. I would not classify it as a gut, but the material made it easy to do the work and interesting for each of the lab reports. The work load is relatively low, which seemed fitting for a half credit class. I can't compare it to other labs, but I really enjoyed it. It's also a great opportunity to use the observatory, which few students take advantage of while at Yale.",
    "Fun, but far more work than it's worth. Would not recommend.",
    "You don't have to be a stem person to get a lot out of this course but if you are a stem person there is enough to keep you challenged. It is true that for part of this course you basically just get to use a professional telescope to take cool pictures of galaxies but there are also more academic parts. This class is great but I would highly recommend taking it with friends.",
    "It is a generally boring and tedious class. It is mostly pressing hitting and mindless data manipulation.",
    "ASTRO observing is a tough course. The workload is six labs but some of them are very tricky and time intensive. People expecting a nice half credit because of an awkward credit total (usually due to starting language at L2 or L4) will be disappointed. You must know your stuff, and it is geared towards STEM people. Also, there is not much talk about the planets and very little observing is looking through a telescope, mostly you just look at a computer monitor. I would not recommend taking it Cr\/D, take a different class Cr\/D instead",
    "Fun and engaging class, but might be more work than you expect. Definitely take it though if you want a chance to use the observatory's amazing telescopes.",
    "I would not recommend ASTR 155 to another student unless I knew that they changed the format of the class to make it more interactive and enable actual learning.",
    "The course accomplishes its goal of being a great introduction to the techniques of observational astronomy. You get plenty of hands on experience with the equipment in the observatory and plenty of instruction from the teacher and the TAs. Great course, but as with most lab courses be prepared to put in several hours for each report. The practical aspect of the course, while being its biggest strength can sometimes be a weakness, as unexpected problems can interfere with making observations (weather, equipment malfunction, etc..). If you are into astronomy this is a must take, if not then you will likely be into it by the end of the course.",
    "It is a very interesting course! Take it!",
    "Lab writeups were tedious and uninteresting but the observations were really cool. Organization of the course was ok; sometimes felt like it could be better.",
    "111 THIS IS A SUMMARY. READ IT! ASSIGNMENTS 5 lab reports worth 20 points each plus a 6th \"final project\" worth 40 points - the latter is nothing more than a regular lab report, but you get to choose the experiment. They were due roughly every other week, and this is very manageable even if you start just one night before the deadline. PROFESSOR Faison is wonderful. Lectures happened every Tuesday for 1h15m and he would excite the students every single time. Lecture time was spent on both conceptual content and lab-related work, i.e. data analysis. TIPS -Find a friend to take it with. It makes your life easier when choosing lab partners. -Do not start lab reports in the night they are due. I did it with every single lab and it worked, but it was unnecessary stress for such an easy class. -Do not forget to sign up for observing time!",
    "This is a fun and interesting class! As a non-astro major I really enjoyed the data processing, and having images to show my friends and family - I think it's a great outreach class that still accomplishes real tasks. It is a little more work than most half-credit classes and requires a bit of flexibility for nighttime observing, depending on the weather - perfect if, like me, you don't have many scheduled nighttime obligations, but it might not be a good fit if the idea of being on-call to drag yourself up Science Hill does not sound like an option.",
    "If you have a free class, and are willing to deal with the fluid schedule of this class, than take it. It is a very cool and satisfying experience to use the observatory, and the class is not too difficult to prohibit it from being a blast.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. I would recommend it to fellow astro majors because it is more helpful and interesting than the other option of a physics lab. I would recommend this to a non-astro major that is interested in astronomy and would like to actually take hands on data. This would be an awesome opportunity to do so."
