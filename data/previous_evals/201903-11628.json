   "comments": [
    "I developed a broad familiarity with the immigration literature and the key debates among scholars.",
    "Understanding of the dialogues in migration literature! I have many lingering unanswered questions which I am excited to continue exploring in future study.",
    "More than anything, I gained a significantly more nuanced perspective on the opportunities and challenges in migration studies and practice. It's difficult to think of any concrete takeaways I have from the course. I think this a good thing - the course instead exposed us to a great variety of perspectives of migration. There were of course smaller lessons contained within each of those perspectives, but the big picture was that migration is a field of awesome complexity.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of migration theories and the current debates in the field. I walked away with a much more nuanced perspective on migration policy and socioeconomic impact and a better idea of where research is still lacking on the topic.",
    "A brilliant and thorough overview of all things migration - immigration, emigration, displacement, economic migration, refugees.. A fascinating course!",
    "Various theories and scholarship on international\/transnational migration, managing a demanding reading load, writing research proposals."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Having students lead the discussion and conduct regional presentations was a strength in that it required students to master the material. But I would have enjoyed a little more lecturing directly from the professor.",
    "Emily is really knowledgeable and kind, which I think shaped the overall tenor of the class. I thought it was amazing that we were able to read a solid syllabus and focus on discussing the readings each week. I personally really enjoyed the regional presentations as well. For the weaknesses, I think it would be awesome if Emily could spend maybe 10-15 minutes at the beginning of class and run through methodologies used in the week's reading that people found confusing.",
    "I think the readings for the course were very strong. However, I am not sure how feasible it is to discuss 5-6 papers in one seminar that sometimes also includes a presentation. The pressure to get through all the readings contributed to making our class discussion somewhat fractured.",
    "This course is very flexible and it is really up to the student to determine what they take away. That being said, Professor Sellars is very approachable and the materials she provides are thought-provoking and well-structured to facilitate ongoing debate on the topic throughout the semester. It never felt like we were simply circling around the same ideas again and again. Instead, every week brought new perspectives and new questions to the table. If you remain engaged, there is a lot to take out of this course.",
    "The strengths of the course are that although this is a rather specialized and niche course, the readings were never in the least repetitive. I would have loved to read a little more about emigration and receive some grades throughout the semester to have an indication of performance. The regional presentations were excellent. The weekly reading responses were much-needed incentives to do the readings.",
    "I felt that this class was very well-designed for student learning. There was a great balance between student-led discussion, as would be expected from a graduate-level course, and guidance from Emily."

    "Absolutely take this course if you are interested in migration. Emily is a brilliant professor who can deftly navigate tough conversations, and we dedicate the class time to discussing the readings and themes of the week. I definitely would not have been able to walk away with the same knowledge had I just done the readings on my own time!",
    "50\/50. I don't think I would say a student is missing out, but if the student is interested in the topic they will likely have a good time.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in this subject, take this course. It is a great introduction to the political and economic landscape of migration and very applicable to future studies and work in the field. The content is also very interesting and Professor Sellars is a great facilitator of class discussion.",
    "Absolutely!! If you are interested in migration, take this course, even if you are an undergrad!!!",
    "Yes! This class was absolutely phenomenal and one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale."
