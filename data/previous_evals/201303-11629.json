   "comments": [
    "Each week, the class is assigned an entire book focused on either one river or one aspect of riverine ecology (ie the Rhine, eels, dams,etc). At the beginning of class, Professor Scott offers some opening thoughts on the readings or about another topic focused on rivers and the class is opened to discussions from there. Sometimes, Professor Scott will call on a student to give an informal analysis of the reading and offer some direction\/questions for discussion, but other times class participation flowed more freely. The only work that students are asked to hand in is the final term paper - otherwise, the class solely consists of participation in discussion. Professor Scott is extremely open in both class and choosing a term paper to allow students to explore whatever aspect or perspective most interests them.",
    "Think hard before taking this course. It's a very interested reading list but also pretty limited - heavily focused on the negative effects of dams (we never read any counterpoints), and were mostly talking about just a few rivers. Discussions were a mixed bunch. Sometimes they were great, other times they were really directionless or rambling and a bit frustrating. It actually didn't end up being too much work - after the first few weeks, you realize that he doesn't actually randomly call on people so mostly people just read a chapter or two a week. The final paper is pretty much all you need to do for the course. (Of course, there is zero guidance on the paper so I have no idea whether my effort was worth anything\/what sort of grade to expect.)",
    "Potentially. It's incredibly unstructured but the concepts are interesting if you've never thought about them before.",
    "Professor Scott is a wonderful professor. He assigned interesting readings, inspired thoughtful discussions, and shared nuggets of wisdom. This class was a very worthwhile class to take.",
    "Years from now I will point to this course as the one that began to change my approach to land use and \"resource\" management issues. Professor Scott is brilliant, the course material very engaging and the subject matter fascinating. If it interests you, you should jump at the chance to take this course, which allows for a great deal of self direction in a positive way.",
    "The class is intense - you read two books a week and meet for two hours two discuss them, but either than that there is only one paper, and you're given an incredible amount of freedom to write about whichever river you want.",
    "Absolutely take this course! It's a good amount of work. The books are wonderful. I learned a whole lot and really enjoyed my final project. Choose to research what you're interested in, Professor Scott gives you flexibility, and it will be worthwhile. After this course you will think about rivers, government, agriculture, society, nature, and economics in a new way.",
    "The class challenges the student to consider all narratives within rivers and requires that readers think not only from a human perspective.",
    "An excellent course. You read a book (or two) a week, with great discussion and a lot of room to craft the final paper at your leisure. James Scott is an interesting professor to spend time with; take advantage of the opportunity.",
    "I would recommend this class. You learn a lot about something critical to the existence of all civilizations. It also challenges you to think about the rights of non-human actors and ecosystems--should their rights be considered by dam proposals? After taking numerous econ classes, Professor Scott's distrust of CBA was refreshing.",
    "Comprehensive and much recommended.",
    "My largest take-away point from this class is a deep distrust of nation states. James Scott talks a lot (open questions, anecdotes about his field work in Burma and other things, unashamedly radical quotes that I scrawled into the margins of my notebook) and contextualizes topics through the theories he's written and researched. Because I find his theories brilliant and agree with his politics, I loved it. The class is also a great opportunity to read environmental histories and work through huge environmental and political concepts (\"Confucian\" v. \"Taoist\" water management; the rights of nonhuman beings). Because students are in all different departments, many do not have common ground, and others look only at Prof. Scott, seeking his approval at each comment. This is tiresome, but by the end the group finds a lot to share with each other.",
    "Great course. It meets once a week, but make sure you're prepared, because Professor Scott will randomly call on people to summarize the week's reading for the class. The only grade is the final paper, but if you prepare well in advance you should be ok.",
    "A good subject-specific class. Worth taking even if you don't have an interest in rivers, as the themes and discussions would be relevant to a range of disciplines. Particularly poignant though if you are interested in perceptions of nature, human-nature relationships, or rivers."
