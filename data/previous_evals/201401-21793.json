    "They call it \"process design\" but you don't get the design project until after spring break so you have no time to design anything interesting. You spend the first half doing annoying econ calculations and some random ChemE you already learned in various other ChemE courses that you could learn or review easily on your own from a book at this point considering you've gotten through the rest of the ChemE curriculum. An ultimately disappointing course to end a disappointing ChemE curriculum.",
    "It's a requirement, so... yeah. Have fun.",
    "Chem E Senior Design, wish it was longer and more involved, but it is heavily focused towards the last few weeks of class.",
    "The material in the first half of the course is actually fairly interesting for a change, especially if you enjoy economics. The project was very rushed but was an interesting experience.",
    "I learned no useful information in this class. The only practical thing we learned was Aspen, and used it for a week and never touched the program again afterward. I thought that this was a project based class, but the project was more of a lit review than anything else. The project required no engineering skills, rather it was an exercise in bullshitting. But Yale engineering has taught us to bullshit well, so that's what we did.",
    "Half economics lecture, half senior project. Compared to Altman's process control final project, this project is a breeze."
