    "Take anything that Eitan Hersh teaches!",
    "If you get into the class, definitely take it. The subject matter is super interesting and Professor Hersh leads great discussions. You don't really realize how much stuff in your life is related to info, tech, and political power until you take the class. There are 3 papers each worth 20%, a 10-minute in-class presentation worth 20%, and participation (including weekly forum posts) is the last 20% of your grade. I found the other students in the class to be one of the best parts, because they were incredibly smart and offered interesting comments -- I don't know if that we just got lucky this year, or if Professor Hersh does an amazing job of picking students based on the paragraph you write during shopping week. For the 3 papers, definitely go to office hours to talk about your topic beforehand. He's a somewhat harsh, but fair grader. If you really listen closely when he talks you through the paper prompt and go to office hours, that should help. There are a few weeks with guest speakers, including one about Uber (if he decides to keep that week) which was really cool. Most of the readings are fairly interesting, although there are a few super long or technical ones that are a pain to get through. Overall, it was a fantastic experience with a good distribution of assignments.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the class. He's a tough grader, but you'll learn a lot about how to incorporate technology into governance and also how to read political science papers. Grades consist of three 5-page papers, an oral presentation, and participation. I think Hersh is one of Poli Sci's must-take professors.",
    "A look at modern applications of political science and how they interact with changing aspects of society. Would definitely recommend, regardless of background. Great class",
    "Quite interesting topics raised about new technology that challenges current policy and law. 3 short papers, professor is good at facilitating discussions, definitely a manageable class.",
    "Yes, especially for students interested in the technological aspects of politics.",
    "Yes for sure! It is more work than it seems. There are three 5 page papers (which is definitely harder than one 15 page paper), an oral presentation, and a decent amount of reading. This isn't to say there is an absurd workload, but it's harder than it seems from the get go. Otherwise, great professor, great discussions. Always bring your A game. Also there's a no technology policy, just a heads up.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is an interesting class and is not too time consuming other than around the time that papers are due."
