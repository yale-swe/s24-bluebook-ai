    "In German 110, you learn the basics of the structure of the German language and you learn how to hold a basic German conversation. You learn how to pronounce and speak basic German and how to understand German through listening and reading. I would definitely recommend this course because it is so much fun and extremely informative. It doesn't feel like work because the material is presented so well that it feels fun.",
    "I think this class was probably the standard intro to German. Tests and homework make up a big part of the grade -- as long as you keep up with the homework, it should be doable. There's a final video project instead of a final exam, and it can be a nightmare if your group procrastinates on it. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot and would recommend German at Yale, especially with Nadja -- she's so nice, understanding, patient, and good at explaining difficult aspects of the language.",
    "The introductory German course department provides a great start to the German language. If you are looking to start a new language, then this is it. All aspects are focused on. By the end of his course you will be able to speak, read, and write basic sentences."
