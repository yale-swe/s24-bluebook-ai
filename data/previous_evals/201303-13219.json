   "comments": [
    "Excellent course, would highly recommend taking it (as opposed to trying to pass-out of it).Obviously, this course wouldn't make too much sense for anyone but a physics graduate student to take.",
    "A very solid treatment of quantum mechanics. It's a very tough class and the exams will probably be among the hardest exams you will ever take.",
    "Slightly redundant in material from undergraduate, but some new and interesting ideas interspersed throughout.",
    "I recommend it to you if you are a students major in physics, applied physics or EE.",
    "You won't see a lot of new stuff if you've already taken Phys 440 and 441 but you'll learn it in a more complete fashion.",
    "Great, A+",
    "I think the material is very important--so yes. A bit strange that we didn't do any perturbation theory yet, nor many other important topics in QM, but I guess that's for next semester.",
    "This is one of the most important core courses and unless you have already taken it at a grad level, you probably should not try to pass out of it. The course covers the foundations of quantum mechanics and applications of it. It gives a group theoretic motivation of the equations which is nice and usually different from undergrad. I would recommend this course because it is one of those topics that every physicist must have mastery over (I'm not there yet).",
    "First 3 chapters of Sakurai done really thoroughly. Not an introductory Quantum Course. And should be taken after you have some experience with QM.",
    "It's an essential course I would recommend it.",
    "It's a great course to take. I would recommend it because of the quality of the lecturer.",
    "The first three chapters of S&N contain a variety of topics,while I think what the professor chose were appropriate. I would recommend this course to every student who's interested in know more about QM.",
    "Advanced QM, a required course, but quite interesting",
    "It is a well-taught well designed course that will prepare one for further coursework. I would recommend it for these reasons.",
    "The course is designed for 1st year PhD students in physics\/applied physics. It helps one remember the basic formulas in quantum mechanics, which is extremely important for everyone in physical science.I recommend this course since it is elementary, which builds a foundation of understanding the quantum world.",
    "This course focus on some of the fundamental concepts of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, using a modern and advanced approach. I would definitely recommend the course because it teaches you or make you rethink about some fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics.",
    "Recommend them to take it.",
    "Yes, because it gives you a very comprehensive introduction to quantum mechanics."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It absolutely provided foundational techniques that are needed in my future work and likely my research",
    "It definitely added to my knowledge of physics and introduced me to some new concepts that I will likely see in later courses. I doubt that this course will contribute to my dissertation\/research though.",
    "Quantum Mechanics is the foundation of most of the courses in physics and applied physics. It helped me a lot.",
    "QM is one of the more important topics to modern physics research, so it's definitely helpful. Spending half a semester on angular momentum probably won't be very useful for me in particular, but for students in HEP it's probably the most important quarter of their graduate classes.",
    "It brushed up the things i knew which is in a way helpful.",
    "Not doing research yet but it should help.",
    "I learned a great deal this semester. Since that is my goal, I'm happy. I need quantum mechanics for research so thus course has been helpful.",
    "The whole QM world is developed in a more systematic way in the course, which is quite different than what I learned in college QM. As a PHD student in Applied Physics, the contents, I believe, will turn out to be really helpful.",
    "Not much.",
    "I learned:1) the connection between classical and quantum mechanics;2) the WKB semi-classical approximation;3) addition of angular momentum;4) meaning of the degeneracy in the Coulomb and 3D harmonic oscillatorIt is a general physics course, so it is hard to say how it contributed to my research, but it certainly has deepen the knowledge of my discipline."
