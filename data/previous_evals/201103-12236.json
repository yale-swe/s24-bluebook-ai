   "comments": [
    "Amazing material, great professor, not too much work, not too much participation. Great for independent workers or any interested in Borges.",
    "Yes!! Take it. Take any of Professor Anibal's classes if you are interested in Latin America and have a good command of the Spanish language. He is wonderful and the material is always interesting. He is incredibly approachable and is very nice to his students when grading.",
    "Great class. Not really for improving speaking skills but rather reading. Mostly lectures by Anibal, but he's really smart. Borges is awesome too, especially for anyone who's studied philosophy...Workload is pretty light too. Only bad thing is 9:00 AM.",
    "Straightforward, you get a great exposure to and understanding of Borges. Definitely recommend it.",
    "This is an awesome class. Borges is a fantastic author; it's a blast reading his work for an entire semester.",
    "Definitely recommend to people taking Spanish as a foreign language and for those who have read stories by Borges previously. Although you don't get to work on your speaking skills as much, you get to read great literature in Spanish, helping your reading skills.",
    "An excellent class. There's no better reading than Borges, and An\u00edbal is a great professor. The workload is lighter than most classes. This is the class that got me up early in the morning without regret. One of my favorites from last semester.",
    "This class gives you a deep understanding of Borges as a writer and the ideas that he liked to explore in his fiction. I would definitely recommend this class!! Take it!! You will come away with a new appreciation for Latin American literature and Borges!",
    "Take this class to get a great introduction to the works of Jorge Luis Borges. Workload is extremely manageable. This is seminar-sized but feels more like a lecture, so if you don't really want to talk you don't have to.",
    "If you like Borges then take it."
