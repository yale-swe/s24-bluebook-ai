    "TAKE THIS CLASS! professor aronson is wonderful and knows all there is to know about historic painting techniques. He has such a great love of the material that he makes every detail fascinating. You will get to paint in oils on a variety of supports (copper, slate, gesso panel, canvas), learn about different painting techniques from the old masters to the modernists and tour through YUAG and BAC learning about how the artists achieved their effects and how the paintings have changed over time through aging and cleaning. If you enjoy art this is a great opportunity to think about painting from a different perspective, focusing on materials and application of materials rather than composition. work load is very reasonable and fun.",
    "Take this class if you want to paint and want to learn about how paintings are made. For art history or studio art majors, this class is extremely beneficial in terms of gaining an understanding of materials (what they are and how they work).",
    "This class is what it says on the tin: a lot of information about painting technique, almost all oil (and some earlier). It's basically what you put into it -- if you're an artist, it can be a very valuable way to reexamine your techniques. But even if you approach it more casually, you learn a lot, and it's just fun to experiment with all the materials.",
    "Take this class! If you are at all interested in how paintings have been made in the past and in exploring the yuag and ycba, you'll really enjoy it.",
    "This was an incredible class which has entirely changed my approach to oil painting, not to mention how I approach choosing and preparing surfaces. It's more laid back than some other classes in the department, but it gives you a much more thorough technical background in painting than anything else. Though the class is long (four hours on Fridays), it always flew by. The class was the highlight of my week, and the timing ended up being ideal rather than inconvenient. Mark is the brilliant and talented Head Conservator at the YCBA, and working with him was stimulating and incredible. (He's also very nice.) I learned so much, and I hope to apply it to my painting practice in future.",
    "Painting Materials and Methods was a great class. It was different from other art classes I've taken at Yale, since it concentrated more on materials that, say, critiquing your artistic vision. The class will introduce you to the complicated world of oil painting. I enjoyed that we split our time between the studio and the art museums on campus. This way, you learn both by doing and by observing. You will look at paintings in museums in a new way. You do not need to be a particularly skillful or experienced painter to enjoy or learn from this class\u00e2\u0080\u0094just enthusiastic. Take it!",
    "Yes, definitely. Like I said, I think this is unlike any course offered at Yale and offers real hands on experience with materials."
