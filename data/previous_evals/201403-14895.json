    "Taking a directed reading course on Jurgen Moltmanns theology, work that is exemplary in contemporary systematic theologians its attentiveness to social and political concerns alongside doctrinal commitments, with Professor Volf whose intellectual and personal familiarity with Jurgen Moltmann makes this a unique opportunity. I would recommend the class to any student of theology.",

    "Having the opportunity to discuss the historical situation within which Moltmann wrote as well as the continuing debate concerning Moltmann's legacy as a theologian definitely incised my knowledge of the field of theology, and I certainly think that my dissertation research and topic will be informed by the conversations we had during our meetings, as well as by the final paper and Prof. Volf's feedback on it."
