   "comments": [
    "YES take it if you have an interest in India and\/or social movements. The diverse readings cover many different political issues (feminism, agrarian rights, and so forth). Prof. Thachil is challenging but very kind, and discussions were extremely interesting. Also, the level of analysis and close reading goes beyond much of what I have done in poli sci classes.",
    "I definitely would recommend it if you're interested in India and want to understand the complexity and diversity of issues facing the country today. I probably wouldn't take it if you know a ton about Indian history already, although you should try to find something else offered by Professor Thachil.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, whether or not you're interested in South Asian studies or not. Social movements in India will allow you to form your own definition of a social movement and study about ten movements in India. From the Naxialite movement, to the women's movement, to the middle class movement, you will certainly find a few topics that interest you. The discussions will be interesting and the Professor is great. The workload isn't tough. You will have two five paged response papers, a final fifteen page paper, and weekly readings, which can be fairly long. If your not sure about the class, at least shop it.",
    "SAST 241 was a pretty demanding seminar as someone who had never taken a PLSC or SAST class. Although there was a lot of background reading assigned that was specific to the course material, I felt like I never had a grasp on the basic poli sci methods of analysis that would have allowed me to write A-level reading responses. The grading was pretty tough, and based on the comments I got back the prof was clearly looking for a level of sophistication in my writing that requires a lot more experience in his field.You definitely cannot get away without doing at least 50% of the reading, either (and there is alot). As is to be expected in a small seminar, the prof was always extremely well-prepared, and there was NO BS-ing answers in class here. I would only take it if you plan to do all the reading, stay engaged in class, and have taken at least one or two PLSC or SAST classes in the past.",
    "Moderate workload, interesting material.",
    "read 3 long scholarly articles at home, go to class and analyze a movement by using 'social movement' lenses (most of the information you have to make the analyses comes form the articles). meet twice a week for and hour 15 minutes each, and spend those two classes on one movement.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn about India this is a great intro class to take.",
    "I would recommend the course highly. The professor is great and it covers a wide range of movements in India without going too far in depth.",
    "yes, yes, yes. take it. great class, learned a lot, interesting, good readings."
