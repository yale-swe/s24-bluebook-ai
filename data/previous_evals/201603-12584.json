    "This course was my introduction to media and opera studies. I learned so much. I also learned how to express myself more succinctly, and how to stay on topic--or at least I tried. Professor Kreuzer made me want to be a better student and a better scholar, and I still feel like I fall far too short.",
    "The class introduced a wide range of media-studies scholarship and its relationship to opera and theatre performance.",
    "I learned new literature on media and opera. Also, I learned to raise questions to challenge my own views on the role of digital media."

   "comments": [
    "The discussion format worked well. The materials were interesting.",
    "Strengths: The format was excellent. Reasonable amount of readings, all of which are discussed in class. Students gave brief presentations instead of leading class discussion (a pet peeve of mine). Professor Kreuzer was open to ideas, but worked to maintain common threads throughout our discussions. Weaknesses: Some of the readings were incomprehensible. Even though the amount of reading was reasonable, they were so densely theoretical that they ended up introducing way more ideas then we could accommodate in our class discussions.",
    "I liked the structure of the syllabus. For each week, there were too many readings to reasonably cover in class, so we would discuss at the end of each session the readings we were most interested in for the following week. This gave the class a certain kind of flexibility to student interest (which was useful in a musicology class with so many non-musicologists), as well as a handy resource for following up on personal interests afterwards, or for the final project. I also appreciated the effort to simulate a professional conference environment, through the submission of abstracts and the reading of papers. We don't do enough of that in our classes. I wish there had been some intermediate writing assignment, or some other way we could have received feedback on our work prior to beginning our final projects.",
    "This course was efficient, intellectually stimulating, and fun."

    "Yes. Especially for students in film\/media studies or theatre studies or art history.",
    "Certainly yes."
