    "A lot of work, but you learn a lot. Definite upgrade from L2",
    "I would suggest you take it if you want to improve your french. Plichart is decent--she tries really hard. However, if you really want to work on your french, I would suggest taking it from someone else--but Plichart is good if you are more casual about your french language experience.",
    "It was a good course and is definitely something you can see immediate improvement from. I would recommend it to another student because it's definitely worth it, but it's a lot of daily work. There aren't too many large projects, which is nice, but I would definitely make sure he or she knows that there is constantly something to be done for this class.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who wanted to learn French.",
    "French 130 04 was a great class. I love French, so I enjoyed all of the readings and films we watched, and Mme Plichart was very kind and helpful. I was never afraid to speak up in class. There is a fair amount of nightly work, and it should all be done before the tests, though sometimes you can put off some of the exercises that are due the next day. The class is a breeze if you took French in high school like me, though you definitely have to do the work, and it would still be totally doable if you started French at Yale.I would absolutely recommend French 130. If you're trying to get through their language requirement (I think it's the most fun way you can do it!), or if you just love French, take this class!!",
    "This course is very helpful and will allow you to improve your speaking and writing skills. If your goal is to master the language then this is definitely a necessary course to take.",
    "Good class. Take it."
