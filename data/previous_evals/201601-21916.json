    "What an awesome class! The reading list was great - it included an range of authors and topics from Sayed Kashua, an Arab Israeli author who writes about the complexity of Arab identity in Israel, to a really nonconventional example of Israeli holocaust literature, and lots of other subject areas in between. Class discussions were engaging, and we had students with very different backgrounds in terms of prior knowledge about Israeli culture and literature, as well as different viewpoints and backgrounds to bring to discussions about sensitive topics related to what we were reading \/ watching. Also - Shiri is an amazing professor! So knowledgeable, so invested in students' learning and engagement, she'll point you in the direction of good resources and authors for your research for papers, and she often allows students to submit drafts for feedback if you want before a paper deadline-- something which very few professors do. She really wants to make sure we are doing our very best work and getting a lot out of the class. Three cheers for Shiri!",
    "Take this course - it is one of my favorites at Yale. The reading\/watching list is so fun, and you get to see many different aspects of Israeli culture. I now want to read more by all the authors we read. Shiri is amazing - great at leading class discussion, and super accessible. She gives in-depth comments on your work. Just a generally wonderful class.",
    "A really fantastic course that I would recommend to anyone who loves reading fun literature! The readings were a pleasure to read and the movies were always fascinating. I learned a bunch and this was one of my favorite Yale seminars that I have taken so far!",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The course is a great way to gain an understanding of Israeli history and culture. Pretty much all of the readings are enjoyable and the discussions are also engaging. Their is not a whole lot of work (1 short paper and 2 longer papers) and Shiri is very helpful in guiding students through the process of writing the papers."
