    "Honestly, Jorgensen is super nice, but he needs to speak louder, please. I didn't learn a ton in this class, and it was probably because we were only assigned 3 problem sets (and a fourth one that was ungraded). If you want a laid back class that will help you cement your understanding of organic molecules, with some pharma applications, take this! We don't really focus on syntheses. Also, hopefully you can get Yue for a TA. She is the best and is super dedicated. Always willing to go above and beyond to help!",
    "I learned a lot about historical and modern organic and physical organic practices. There was also a lot of insight from Professor Jorgensen about special topics that he enjoyed that were also very interesting.",
    "I now know about some cool chemistry experiments and how much of a boss Jorgensen is. Also learned some basic principles too."

   "comments": [
    "Please assign more problem sets. Problems are the only way to actually learn the material! Also, we were given very little information about the exams, which caused some stress.",
    "The course was very well taught, and the material was presented in a way that was understandable. However, I would have liked more problem sets to reinforce the concepts taught in class. It would also have been nice to have a more detailed syllabus.",
    "Not too hard to follow along but many concepts are rushed and not explained in detail."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to become more comfortable with material you have already learned, and just go deeper, this is a good class. Jorgensen is super kind, and generous. Although there isn't much work or assigned problems, which can cause stress when the exams are all about solving problems....",
    "Chem 418 is a good introduction to historical and modern practices in organic and physical organic chemistry. There is great emphasis on molecular orbital theory and not so much on arrow-pushing as there was in introductory organic chemistry. It is an interesting class if you want to see Professor Jorgensen's view on chemistry and life.",
    "yes, satisfying to tell the kids complaining about regular orgo that you are taking advanced orgo. Also, for goodness' sake, sit in the right half of the classroom if you do take it (you'll see why)",
    "There is a lot of self studying involved. I would highly recommend reading the book to understand major concepts. Taking notes in class helped me a lot because the exams were heavily based on the examples we covered in class. Overall, pretty doable advanced course.",
    "As far as chemistry electives go this one is pretty good. The workload is doable and the textbook was the best I've ever had for a class and really helpful for understanding the material. Professor Jorgensen is a pretty quiet lecturer though so he can be hard to hear at times."
