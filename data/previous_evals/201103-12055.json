   "comments": [
    "Absolutely lovely. A really enjoyable experience. I didn't even know I was interested in 17th century literature and ended up loving (most) of it. Covers a wide range of genres starting with plays and ending with Bossuet's sermons. Professor Semk is so lovely and such a good professor that I'm sure any class with him just great. I definitely felt like I got a lot of this class, more so than if I had just read the books on my own.",
    "Absolutely! I'm a french major and this was an easy, fun, but useful course to take. It also really improved my speaking skills.",
    "French 219 is a taste of the French literary legends. I would most definitely recommend it to a lover of words, (French words that is) as a solid foundation for continued study of French literature. I won't forget lessons from the Princesse de Cleves, Clelie, and the Moliere plays we read. These are universal lessons to learn, and it was a pleasure to have Professor Semk guide us through them.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 219 to anyone who wants to learn about a very weird period of French literature. The plays and stories that you read cover everything from Moliere's farces to Racine's tragedies to La Fontaine's fables. The readings are well chosen, although sometimes challenging but fun nonetheless. Semk is one of the best professor's I've had so far and he really cares about what students have to say. He is good at leading discussion to a productive end. The work load isn't too bad, but some of the readings may take a bit of time. Be prepared to say intelligent things in class - everyone speaks, so you can't hide. This class is great for those who want to read something different (but still super interesting) and improve their French.",
    "I would definitely recommend FREN219. The class has an interesting syllabus (mostly plays) full of material not covered elsewhere, and Professor Semk succeeds in making class both fun and informative. The workload is very reasonable, and well distributed throughout the semester.",
    "I would definitely take it! 17th century French literature will surprise you in a way you never expected. Wonderful readings and wonderful professor. There is a fair amount of reading, and much of it is a bit difficult, so be prepared.",
    "If the subject matter interests you, go for it. This seminar provides a solid, straightforward survey of French literary culture in the 1600s -- Moliere, Corneille, Racine, Scudery (La Princesse de Cleves), La Fontaine, and a few others. Prof. Semk is really nice and knowledgeable, and the workload is entirely manageable. Class discussions dragged a bit at times -- though this might not be the case with a different group of students -- and as someone who is not inherently drawn to the material (I'm a bigger fan of 19th c. stuff), I didn't find that this seminar instilled any great passion for these authors or works. But as I said -- if you're intrigued by the titles on the syllabus, or 17th c. culture, then you'll probably have a great time."
