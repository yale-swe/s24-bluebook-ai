   "comments": [
    "Great class. The class is not difficult, but make sure to attend every lecture. Anything Professor Henrich puts on the board (especially math-related equations and examples) will be on the exams, so if you miss those, you're in for a rough time. Expect to do a fair amount of studying for midterms, but as long as you take the class somewhat seriously, attend lecture and study, it's very manageable.",
    "A great SC\/QR for non-math\/science kids. It's probably best to have some basic algebra and a little bit of physics, but the p-sets are short and easy and the lectures are fun. If you like technology, but don't want to get too nitty-gritty, you'll love this class.",
    "This is a class that teaches you how the basic technologies you use on a daily basis work. However, if you are not prepared to go to every lecture and pay attention do not take this class because it is NOT A GUT.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to get a SC credit.",
    "Take this class! You will do well if you attend lectures and study.",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this course. It was great learning about things that actually apply to your life, as opposed to astronomy for example. Some topics were more boring than others (the last unit on X-Rays was pretty dull), but I learned a lot and generally enjoyed it. The problem sets were not too hard and the workload was really light. There's no textbook and only a problem set each week to do, which is usually pretty simple.Professor Henrich was great. You know he is really into what he is teaching and does his best to make the class interesting, using demonstrations and videos almost every class.I'd definitely recommend this class to those looking for a science or QR credit.",
    "Great class! Interesting and useful material. Lectures were generally entertaining, especially when the Professor brought in demonstrations.P-Sets were pretty easy and short. They were graded very generously.Attending lectures is very important for there is no textbook.",
    "Take it for the SC\/QR but only if you're genuinely interested.",
    "If you're interested in how things work and can motivate yourself to do the coursework (and actually do it - the exams are pretty hard), take it. If you're looking for a gut, don't.",
    "Definitely a good class if you need a science credit and want to actually learn quite a bit of cool stuff, but don't want to be spending hours on the class.You MUST show up to class though (or have a really helpful friend who does...) - the professor doesn't post lecture notes online, nor is there a textbook.",
    "You have to go to class and pay attention. It is interesting material and if you put the work in you will do well, otherwise it can be a nightmare.",
    "Yes absolutely. Take it if you need a QR\/SC. It really is a great class and you learn so much cool stuff. Definitely helps to have a high school physics background but not necessary. Expect to work a bit but its worth it for the cool stuff you learn",
    "This is not really a traditional science course. You'll be expected to memorize how things work. There aren't that many actual calculations or formulas on the test. It almost feels like a humanities class. Take it if you're interested in getting an idea of how things work, but not actually calculating the precise numbers and formulas.",
    "It is not a gut class for non-science majors. But there are a lot of interesting stuff that are covered. You just need to be ready to learn and work like any other class.",
    "It is not an easy science credit if you have not taken physics before.",
    "In Applied Physics 110 you learn how a wide variety of technology works. You begin by learning the physics behind each device. There are weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final exam. I would definitely recommend this class. The material is interesting and engaging. It is very important that you attend lectures as there is no textbook. It might also be helpful if you have a basic background in electricity and magnetism.",
    "I would if you are prepared to study hard and actually make an effort in the class. not excessively easy, but very interesting",
    "If you took HS physics, take it.if you have a friend in the class who took physics and is willing to help you, take it....doing it alone if you're not good at science would be very hard.",
    "Yes. You will learn a lot.",
    "Good science credit. Not too much work. Professor presents the subject clearly and engagingly. Do go to the lectures, you'll have an easier time in exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend the Technological World to anyone who is not a science major but is still interested in knowing how things work. It absolutely gave me a more thorough understanding of everyday technologies. Be careful if you have not taken physics at any point though; the class is certainly not a gut, especially if you lack basic physics. It's also a class that it much more enjoyable to put in a little more work and understand technologies more thoroughly than to just put in the bare minimum (a problem I struggled with myself from time to time.) If you put in some time, it's an excellent class.",
    "There is a lot of math involved, so I would think about taking this class if you really need a Sc. It's a manageable QR, but I would not take this class again if I knnew what I know now. I've heard from APHY majors that Henrich is a great prof, I think he has trouble presenting and teaching concepts to nonmajors.",
    "If you are interested in how technology works or just want to strengthen your physics background a little, this is a good course.",
    "If you want to know how modern gadgets work, take it. If you want to know how to troubleshoot stuff (which was kind of what I wanted), this may not be what you look for. It's a good class. A little hard for a introductory science class.",
    "Interesting materials with very reasonable workload. The professor is very funny and he gives a thorough explanation for things we need to know. Recommended for science credit, though it may not be your gut science.",
    "Yes. Wonderful and easy science credit, as long as you attend lectures. Forming a study group with your friends is also very helpful. Take if you are mildly interested in knowing how technology work around you in daily lives which I am sure a lot of you are.",
    "A lot of material and some quantitative stuff so maybe not quite the gut you're looking for. really cool class and very rewarding as you understand some of the contemporary technologies that pervade our lives.",
    "If you need a science credit, this is a good course to take. This is not a gut class. You have to work hard to get good grades.",
    "Tech World is a solid class. You learn how a lot of modern technologies work without being overwhelmed by the underlying science. It's pretty cool to realize the number of applications that can be derived from a limited set of simple physical principles.",
    "This is a great course. I'd recommend it. I took it because I needed a science credit, but I still enjoyed it a lot. Unlike most other science courses, you really get to learn how the devices and technology you use everyday work. Don't be fooled by the name of the course, though - you do learn real stuff and you will be challenged.",
    "Oh yeah, I can dig it. Learning how stuff works is totally sweet, and the physics are simple enough with a little study.Expectations were very clear, and the course was very well designed. Go to lectures, find a study group, and if you're looking for a quick Sc you'll be set. Or, if you want to really dig into the material, the course allows for that too. You get out what you put in, here."
