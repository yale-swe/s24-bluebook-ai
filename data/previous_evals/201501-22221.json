    "Great class. Not tremendously hard, especially if you come in with some familiarity with Russian and American interests. Even if you don't, you'll learn a lot from the highly accessible readings and the great class discussion, although that obviously depends on who else is in the class. Tom Graham is a legend.",
    "This class isn't so much about the immediate US-Russia dynamic as about the ways in which broader geopolitics inform the US-Russia relationship, and vice versa. You look at US-Russia relations through the prism of issues such as rising China, ridiculous North Korea, rah-rah-rogue Iran. If you do the reading, you'll learn a lot, but otherwise the class isn't so much an informational deep-dive as a thought-training exercise, teaching you to think strategically and holistically about national interests. Sometimes your brain will hurt from thinking so much; at other times, your brain will hurt from your own bullshit. Thomas Graham is knowledgeable, accessible and a whole lot of fun. Take, and take advantage!",
    "Take it take it take it. You'll learn a lot, even if you're already interested in the region. Plus Prof Graham is awesome. I loved Prof. Graham! He is an excellent discussion leader, and his practical experience allows him a perspective that is unique at Yale. One of the best global courses I've taken.",
    "Be prepared to do the reading, and you'll get the absolute most out of this class. Professor Graham is amazing and manages to keep a nearly two-hour class on global security lively and engaging the whole time.",
    "If you are interested in contemporary global affairs at all, you should definitely take this class, as you will learn much more from courses like this than from stupid IR theory courses that do not really teach anything tangible. Professor Graham is amazing as well!",
    "Take this course if you want a more expansive view on Russian relations, especially if your background is primarily focused Russia's political relationship to Europe. A different region is covered each week, which gives you more background on a host of global issues from an atypical vantage point.",
    "A fantastic class that gives you a lot of information on American-Russian relations, as well as on their interactions in many parts of the world. In some ways, this is a class about the direction of future foreign policy, and the big powers that may shape the world in the years to come. I highly recommend - every class is a different region, so you will learn a lot. The only thing that was intimidating was how much all my fellow classmates knew. Most of them had a lot of experience with Russia, and\/or spoke Russian, so this was quite a shock for me. Nonetheless, highly recommend!",
    "Absolutely! Take this class even if you are not interested in Global Affairs. After taking class, you will seriously consider changing your major to Global Affairs.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course if you want to think about the future of political relations between Russia and the rest of the world: What are the main interest at stakes, how do they relate to each other, what are rational choices for Washington, Moscow, and others?",
    "For students interested in debating foreign policy and examining U.S. and Russian strategies in the 21st century, this is a great class to take. Professor Graham is an awesome person to work with, and he makes himself very accessible to students outside of the classroom. The class features a good amount of reading, but you'll leave with a great foundation in a number of crucial topics ranging from the Arctic region to Central Asia's pipelines to North Korea's nuclear programs and change the way you assess key issues using multiple countries' perspectives. Professor Graham forces you to think about the U.S. and Russian side on every issue. It was one of the best policy classes I have taken at Yale."
