    "Take the senior essay. Definitely if you want to do graduate school, but even otherwise I think the senior essay really pulls together everything you have learned over four years.",
    "In the words of a great man, \"A lot of you may be wondering 'why should I write an essay'. But let me ask you: how DARE you even consider not taking advantage of the privilege of working with a professor in this economics department.\"",
    "The Senior essay is really what you make of it. If you don't need it for a future research degree and are burdened during your senior year, I wouldn't necessarily suggest doing one.",
    "NO! I received no support from my adviser, and when I sought help the University would not provide a tutor. The department provided no support and I believe that this is a serious problem which needs to be addressed.",
    "Yes",
    "Do it.",
    "Yes! The senior essay is a chance to use all of the tools, theories, and information that you have accumulated over the past 3 years and to work with a member of the faculty. I found the essay to be the most rewarding experience at Yale so far and hope that everyone finds it to be a similarly enjoyable experience. As long as you pick a helpful adviser, the essay will turn out well!",
    "Do it, and do it all year. I was not an all-star econ major, but I really loved working with my advisor. Try to see them all semester. I only saw mine frequently toward the end, and I regret not doing it earlier. The end of the paper gets a bet stressful but it's definitely worth it, and the whole experience is pretty chill until then.",
    "I would recommend that every econ student do a Senior Essay. It's required for almost every other major so I honestly don't know why Econ students get away with not having to do one. I personally feel that before one can truly call him\/herself an econ major, he or she should have done some sort of meaningful econ research and the Senior Essay is the best way to do that."
