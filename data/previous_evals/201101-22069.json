   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you are a CS or EE major you should definitely take this class. It is a manageable workload where you learn really applicable, new, interesting topics.",
    "Starting with the physical layer (frequency spectra, physical considerations for wireless communication, signal attenuation \/ fading) and moving to the link layer and then to the application layer.You get to do Android development, which is awesome.Later lectures are more advanced topics (and slightly less organized) but still very interesting. There's a good mix of engineering \/ practical design, but also sometimes you'll dive deep into an algorithm after modelling a realistic problem and reducing it to a simpler one that can be solved by theory.",
    "This is an interesting course. Even though one semester is not enough time for this much material, what we did learn was useful. The professor told us repeatedly that some of what we were covering was not yet fully worked out, and it was exciting to see a field where so much research work still has to be done."
