    "how to read a scientific paper",
    "I learnt about the pressing conservation concerns and how management plans are evaluated and carried out.",
    "I guess I learned about conservation biology but honestly, a lot of the stuff we learned about seemed a bit pro-eugenics. For example, we learned that human population was the biggest threat to the planet rather than the insane wealth hoarding that happens under capitalism. Also a lot of the social issues relating to conservation biology were glossed over, i.e. the potato blight was blamed on lack of biodiversity rather than Britain's imperialism, the bison going nearly extinct was blamed on over hunting, rather than discussing how eradicating the bison was linked to the genocide of Native Americans. I realize that this is a sc credit and not a so\/hu credit, but this class stresses connections of this earth and you can't have that without linking environmental issues to issues concerning the humanities\/social sciences.",
    "I learned how to read scientific papers analytically. I learned general the importance of biodiversity, conservation management, patterns of threats to habitat and endagered speceis and genetic variation.",
    "In this class I learned about conservation biology and the need to protect endangered species, our planet, and the key resources that allow ecosystem processes to take place.

    "Knowledge about the different aspects of conservation biology: species, biodiversity, habitat loss\/fragmentation, climate change, overexploitation, invasive species, extinction, different approaches to conservation. I didn't have a lot of background in biology and learned so much. Assignments included exams, papers, debates, section participation.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very interesting, lots of interconnected topics",
    "The questions on the exam aren't good applications of the content as it's discussed in lecture. Class talks a lot about principles, theory of conservation, and some case studies. The exams are VERY VERY policy focused which I did not feel adequately prepared to be assessed on. Professor clearly cares about students learning.",
    "Strengths: this is the best science credit ever. Class was not hard, I learned a lot and the work load was really reasonable.",
    "Tests were worded very poorly, often TAs had no idea how to help us during the exams. Sections were too try-hard. I heard stories of other TAs literally giving out student points for talking during class. Luckily my section was chill and I learned a lot. Overall the class was super interesting, not too much work, and definitely has real world applications.",
    "This class is a good intro science course. It is easy to follow along with, however the tests were a bit difficult. Sometimes the tests were very vague and it was hard to determine what the staff was looking for.",
    "This course was well organized and applicable to real-world situations.",
    "Strengths: compelling speaker; interesting topic; well-organized; not overly difficult for non-science majors Weaknesses: too many assignments",
    "The tests were difficult and in my opinion, not always fair. The questions often differed from concepts highlighted in lecture because they were very specific and detail-oriented.",
    "pretty easy. Professor Puth went through the lecture slides quickly and there were a lot of them, so paying attention and taking good notes during lectures can be difficult at times.",
    "Strength: it was good to learn the environment is F'ed and have the evidence to use to back myself up in internet arguments weakness: it got .. repetitive",
    "The exams were too long for the allotted time, but the papers were interesting and guidance was clear.",
    "strengths: clear lectures, setup is very organized, expectations are clear, as long as you go to class and do the readings you will do well. slides are clear. weaknesses: guest lectures were not nearly as clear or good at facilitating learning as regular lectures and could have been better taught.",
    "Too many small assignments so it took up a lot of time. 3 exams, 2 papers, and 1 debate made a non-major class take up significantly more time than other classes",
    "Slides are really unclear and it's hard to go back and look at the slides to fill in your notes if you missed something.",
    "The course was interesting, however I had a hard time focusing in lecture and the tests tended to be too long",
    "I thought the class had really interesting topics but I feel as though the grading of assignments was not up to par and for the number of people enrolled in the course, the instructor was not sufficiently prepared. I think the grading should be improved to be fair to all students making the guidelines as clear as possible and giving more examples of what kind of paper, assignment, or test they will be looking for.",
    "It has a great amount of information, interesting things to learn. Weaknesses, the tests are too long for 50 minutes. Even if you know things, you really don't even have time to think through what you're trying to say because she makes tests 10 pages. The section should not be mandatory. At all. It should be available for accessible review and assistance throughout the semester but if you go to class there's nothing this section will really do for you.",
    "Strengths: Professor, syllabus, subject material, TFs Weaknesses: Workload was unnecessarily high, some lectures packed too much information and forced Professor Puth to rush",
    "The class was interesting and there was not too much work but the lectures went very quick.",
    "strengths: interesting subject, lots of opportunities to improve your grade weaknesses: dull lectures, confusing exams, a lot of assignments",
    "Strengths: the material was accessible and current. Weaknesses: the lectures were sometimes slow and disorganized. The exams could have been much improved: the questions were often wordy or unclear and did not really test concepts in a systematic fashion. Including fewer topics and going more in depth into the biology and science of these topics would have been more interesting and academically rewarding. There were too many small assignments: I would recommend getting rid of the outside lecture piece and just having two exams, the position piece and the debate.",
    "Strengths: the debate was really fun and I actually feel like I learned something Weaknesses: the pro-eugenics thing, assignment due dates were strangely spaced out (for example we had months to finish one smaller assignment but then other bigger assignments were due in almost immediate succession), your grade basically depends on how nice your TA is feeling that day",
    "weakness: constant busy work, it's easy to do the night before but it's constantly work and assignments for this class",
    "Strengths: - Lecturer speaks comprehensively and is engaging - the material of the course is so important for our world and planet. - it is a relatively easy science credit that is actually useful and important Weaknesses: - sometimes the lecturer covers much more than what is useful and what we need to know, so it is hard to know what to focus on until we see the concept list on exams. - There are too many assignment in the course. I liked most of them, but I think it could make it a lot easier to have fewer assignment that are worth more and that test the same areas of knowledge",
    "The strength of the course was that it allowed for a large range of topics being discussed that are related to human intervention in someway or another. Additionally the strength of the course was that each topic discussed had very real world implications and could be placed into its proper context very easily. A weakness of the course was that it often felt as though some of the information being taught was not particularly helpful or necessary information to gain a broader understanding, draw meaningful connections, or make conclusions on how to help a particular situation regarding conservation biology.",
    "If you work hard you will learn a lot",
    "Very interesting course if you like sustainability and conservation topics. Course is well-organized and easy to follow",
    "Very strong course with great content! I really enjoyed the professor and the TAs, and had a great time learning about a topic I am passionate about.",
    "It was not conducive to different learning types, and the lectures were often boring and not engaging in any way.",
    "Good class and good structure, but as an EVST major, I felt like I already knew most of the material we went over.",
    "This course, thankfully, was straightforward, simple, and to-the-point. Review for exams really drove home that social science\/humanities professors are looking out for their students in ways STEM kids can't imagine, and by that I mean review could have been more precise in regards to what it was we were meant to be reviewing, and more extensive in regards to the practice problems we were given. The humanities kids in this class really felt left in the lurch.",
    "For the most part, the content in this class was pretty easy to grasp. Most lectures were pretty interesting although there were some that seemed to drag on a bit long. I also feel like time in discussion section was sometimes not used to the fullest potential, but overall section was enjoyable and I had a great TF!",
    "Easy science, hard tests though.",
    "I loved the organization of the course -- it was meant to create an environment to genuinely learn, without the constant and unnecessary pressure of assessment that some courses add to students. The course was very engaging throughout.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics, fair exams. Weaknesses: a lot of extra, somewhat unnecessary assignments.",
    "Its very interesting, nothing to change",
    "Fun and engaging section, good lectures but often rushed. The tests are difficult relative to the homework, but not unfair. Great class",
    "A lot of content and not a lot of time to ingest it. Might get better understand if content was streamlined",
    "I think it was well structured to make students engaged, but sometimes there were too many small assignments and it got to feel like busy work.",
    "Strengths: interesting course material Weakness: A lot of time consuming assignments",
    "Lectures are a bit all over the place, and section readings dont seem particularly useful but youre tested on them. Tests are very straightforward and studying for them is doable",
    "The discussion sections were very engaging.",
    "Strengths: interactive, Professor Puth organized it well, I enjoyed the guest lecturers. Weaknesses: the unprecedentedly large class size made it a bit harder to reach out to the professor",
    "Strengths: interesting materials, clear lectures, Weaknesses: sections and section activities sometimes seemed unnecessary",
    "Very interesting and relevant information, conservation is obviously very important today",
    "The class is interesting and is a great science credit if you are in need of one.",
    "more engaging lecture, not just reading off slides",
    "The course material was interesting and I was able to learn a lot, but the tests were difficult in that even though I understood things conceptually, memorizing details of readings and specific terminology was difficult.",
    "Strengths: my TA was great, and the material was really interesting. Weaknesses: the exams were the most poorly written and unfairly graded tests I've ever taken.",
    "Strengths: I personally liked having three non-cumulative exams Weaknesses: the professor was super unforgiving with grading, and there were TONS of assignments, some written, some oral, and then the exams",
    "The course had strong test preparation tools with clear lecture slides to help in review and review sessions and study guides to further assist in preparation. I did find the difficulty of the tests to vary significantly, which made preparing for them more difficult as certain tests focused on broad topics while others required more specific case study knowledge to do well. Having some guidance on that beforehand or making the tests more uniform would be helpful.",
    "Strengths were Linda Puth she was a cool teacher. Weakness was the specificity of the tests.",
    "This course did a good job of keeping the information engaging but could have created more student involvement.",
    "The tests were difficult and had a confusing format.",
    "Weaknesses: there's not a lot of clarity in grading",
    "Improvements: The concept lists for studying for the exams did not help with the actual exam questions. Often, the exam questions were unclear and could have been answered many different ways, but the graders were only looking for one type of answer. In the future, I would encourage the professor to make the exam questions more straightforward, especially about the type of answer they were looking for. The grading was also pretty harsh on the exams and it seemed like I would lose points for the most random things. Also, I never used the textbook but spent too much money on it. Next time I would encourage the professor to ditch the textbook so people don't have to waste money on it.",
    "The course was successful in providing me a wide range of base knowledge around conservation biology. I also learnt methods of how to read scientific papers and what to look for.",
    "The classs topic is interesting and important. The material is presented so poorly it is possibly the most boring class offered at yale. Also, the exams are ridiculously hard even though the material could be grasped by a middle school student.",
    "Good lectures and section, would advise professor to make exams a little ahead of time so TAs are able to better plan for review sections but other than that, good class",
    "There are too many assignments and expectations of the course given that its mainly a science credit for non majors. Mandatory sections, 2 papers, a debate etc. plus 3 exams is asking a lot.",
    "strengths: get a lot of info on the subject, TAs are nice, great course to get knowledge on a subject that's so pressing while being comprehensible for non-science majors, review session for second exam was great weaknesses: trying to do too much with all the assignments and the amount of material trying to be fit into each lecture, (almost each lecture started with materials supposed to be covered in the last one),",
    "This course was very informative and I found the lecturing style to be quite effective. That being said, I did not feel that the discussion section was particularly useful (but that is simply personal preference).",
    "Material felt dry -- like it hadn't been updated in awhile. Sections were a good place to learn and explore concepts more fully.",
    "Enthusiastic professor, interesting and relevant material. Cool assignments like the Pebble Mine debate which was a refreshingly new thing to do in section. The tests were pretty long for a 50 minute class, so it was hard to finish them in time.",
    "The lectures are not particularly engaging, but the overall topic is interesting. It is a gut, and easy to do well because there are many assignments that add up to the final grade. The weekly readings are brief (usually 2 or 3 3-page research papers, and you don't need to read the textbook), section is straightforward and if you study well for the exams, they are honestly not too difficult to do well in. I also really appreciate how Professor Puth takes the feedback of students to heart - for example, the 3 exams were originally 10% each, but she changed the weightage such that the exam with our highest score would get the highest weighting etc.",
    "Way too much information but great professor and good assignments",
    "It 's really nice that for most non-exam assignments students get to pic their topics. However, I did not like the debate assignment where students had to do a lot of prep only to be assessed on 1-2 minutes of talking, which reflected more of a student's public speaking skills and not how much they learned.",
    "Lectures were organized but could have been more engaging. It also would have been helpful if there were more notes on the slides or if the lectures were filmed and posted.",
    "I thought the section leaders could have been more helpful in giving advice and guidance on the homework assignments.",
    "Weakness: felt very disorganized, work was all backloaded, more work than a normal gut strengths: good SCIENCE gut, good basic understanding\/general understanding of environmental studies"

    "Yes!",
    "YES!! Super interesting, neat assignments that arent too much work... great way to get a science credit.",
    "Yes, this class is a good course especially if you are looking to take an intro science course. It has a good mix of science and even some economic principles. Very important information to learn about and is a fun topic to study.",
    "I would recommend this to a student looking for a science credit or someone who is interested in the environment and how we interact with it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great science credit. It very clearly ties into one of the biggest issues facing our world today: climate change and preserving the environment. Beyond explaining the threats facing nature, the course explores the solutions that scientists and activists are implementing today and that we need to expand upon.",
    "No. This is not a gut! I spent a lot of time studying for the tests and it didn't always pay off. While I thought the debate was fun and the papers were better than others I've done at Yale, the class itself could have been more enriching.",
    "yes if you're looking for a decent science gut as a non-stem major",
    "Yes, it is a highly relevant and important topic which I think everyone should learn about.",
    "yes indeed",
    "Yes - a good way to learn about an important topic.",
    "yes, would recommend if you need a science credit and are a non-science person. it was interesting for someone in the humanities\/social sciences because you definitely learn science and can see how it is relevant in our lives and future.",
    "A good science credit for people who are not a science major.",
    "Not unless you are really interested in conservation biology. I took it as a non science major who needed a science credit, and I really wish I had taken any other class. I did not love the lectures, and there were a lot of random assignments that were not included in the original syllabus, so it was more work than expected, and the exams were always fairly difficult because of the amount of information presented and no clear range on what would be asked",
    "Yes, it's a great science course for nonscience majors and the topics are very important, especially in our day and age.",
    "Yes, it's a worthy science credit, especially for non-stem kids. It's fulfilling as well as accessible.",
    "Yes! The workload is high but the material is clear and interesting",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone looking to learn about our environment who may not have a science background.",
    "Absolutely not. I only took the class because the workload was low. The class was actually very very boring, and everything about the class sucked. Also, the workload was not as low as I though. In addition, Linda is a terrible professor, so lazy and disorganized. I'm on financial aid but if I had paid for this semester, I would have been really disappointed that my money pays her salary.",
    "no, this is much harder than a gut science should be",
    "It is a decent science credit, but do not expect to learn much other than a general appreciation for the urgency with which we need to confront climate change.",
    "If you are looking for a gut, this isn't it fam.",
    "only as an easy science credit but NOT a gut, there is a lot of work",
    "Yes! Definitely, especially if you need an engaging and useful science credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants an introduction to conservation in the real world context. Conservation and conservation biology are both growing fields especially as we humans increase our population and enter into an age in which we cannot seem to limit or slow down our consumption of resources. This class allows for the understanding of the adverse affects of the human population resource use and how to limit these implications in the real world.",
    "If you work hard you will learn a lot",
    "Yes--good course overall. Science \"gut\" but the workload was surprisingly high. All the professors and TAs are very nice and helpful",
    "I would! It's a great science class that teaches you information that you can use in everyday life as you persue other topics.",
    "No I would not. The lectures were poorly taught, and the content was not incredibly informative or interesting. The exams were overly challenging for no real reason seemingly other than to give students bad grades. Overall, especially if you're not a science person, this is not a great class for anyone looking for an interesting science credit.",
    "Yes, everyone should have to take this course. Our environment is the basis of human life.",
    "Yes, it's simple enough to understand and good for non-STEM kids. That said, when the material approached social science (policies, the position paper assignment, one guest lecture included well-wishes for Bolivia's right-wing takeover), I understood why I don't take more science classes. Directions can be vague, where they might've appeared more straightforward to students more familiar with the material.",
    "If you're looking for an easy science class, I think this is a good one to take and presents interesting and relevant information. If you are looking for a more in depth class in EEB or EVST this might not be the best class to take",
    "If they need a science credit.",
    "If you are interested in a science credit and also interested in sustainability and how we can further protect our landscape, then this course is for you.",
    "Yes! It is a great science credit for nonscience majors.",
    "Yes it was good and everyone should know it",
    "Yes, great course if one needs a science credit. Definitelu an important class for all students, especially the ones who love polluting",
    "Yes. Relatively simple content but often a lot of work. Good science credit for someone with other large time commitments but not a total gut.",
    "If you need a science credit and are somewhat interested then yes. Otherwise steer clear.",
    "Yes: good science credit that is useful in the grand scheme of things",
    "Yeah, for a Social Science person looking for a SC credit it was as least bad as they can be",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to learn about conservation biology but someone who isnt a science major",
    "I would, because climate change is often only thought of through the lens of human necessity and the biodiversity and the preservation of the earth, not just the arrest of a warming planet, is crucial to our planet.",
    "Yes if they realize that even without Psets theres a lot of weekly work. Good for non-science majors for sure; you learn a lot about the intersection of environmental science and policy",
    "Yes, good course with relevant information",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a great science credit that isn't too insanely difficult but also isn't a gut.",
    "yes i would id say its fairly easy to do well if you put in the work (which is minimal) and go to lecture. overall learned a good amount and enjoyed it",
    "Yes. Take this class. But do not expect an easy A without putting the enough effort especially in participation.",
    "Yes, if you have an interest in conservation. It was quite a difficult course, however. Definitely not a gut.",
    "I will say that the material you learn in this class is both really interesting and really important to know. However, the way the class is structured is INCREDIBLY frustrating at times. The exams are the most poorly written tests I've ever taken in my entire life. To study for them, you need to memorize the material, but then when you get to the test the questions are so vaguely worded that it's almost impossible to know what material they want you to write down. The exams tested your ability to randomly guess what the graders were looking for, instead of testing the material you learned while studying. The grading is ridiculous as well, with TAs taking off points willy nilly for correct answers that they somehow find a problem with (this happened to me and several other students).",
    "Yes for a SC credit. the information is really cool and pertinent to our global climate right now.",
    "I would if this student is looking for a manageable science credit or is interested in conservation. We went through a lot of material in the course, but Professor Puth did a good job of laying it out clearly and making the material easy to follow.",
    "Yes I would because its an interesting perspective especially for a non science student.",
    "Yes it was a good introduction to biology.",
    "would not recommend",
    "The material was pretty easy--it's a good science class for people who need to fulfill the distributional requirement. That being said, it felt like the exams were purposefully difficult to avoid a situation in which everyone got a high grade. In general, I would recommend, but it was a lot more work than I initially believed it would be.",
    "If you need a science credit but still want to learn some pretty useful and interesting stuff I really recommend this class.",
    "Yes! It's a perfect science credit for non-science majors. I found it interesting and engaging despite little previous biology knowledge. There are 3 exams (sometimes they were a little tricky because the professor didn't always specify the kind of answers they wanted), some papers, a debate in section, and regular section attendance. You have to read some scientific papers before every section, which were pretty dry but still understandable.",
    "Yes - it teaches invaluable lessons about the environment and how we must treat it if future generations are to survive.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this to other students who are interested in taking a less challenging science class but still want to be challenged intellectually about different methods of conservation around the world.",
    "I would not. It is very boring.",
    "Yes, this is a great intro course. Would highly recommend EVST\/E&EB majors take this course before General Ecology to be exposed to the concepts before you learn the math.",
    "As a survey course on conservation biology and ecology, go for it!",
    "If you really need a science credit its not the worst class but there are better out there.",
    "yes if it's a non-science major student trying to get a science credit. overall, i think you'd end up with a solid grade and some interesting new info if you tried. but, it is a lot of work, last minute assignments, and material for just one course.",
    "I would, if they were generally interested in the material. The topics covered were not only interesting, but also relevant to current issues. The material is rather niche (when it comes to Science at Yale), so my recommendation would be person-dependent.",
    "Maybe!",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, definitely a good science credit, even if you don't need the SC requirement. Very relevant topic, professor is super engaging. Sneakily a decent amount of work though.",
    "Yes, it is a good science gut! The overall topic is interesting, although the lectures are not particularly engaging,. It is easy to do well because there are many assignments that add up to the final grade. At the same time, you're learning about important issues that are good to know, even just for general knowledge. The weekly readings are brief (usually 2 or 3 3-page research papers, and you don't need to read the textbook), section is straightforward and if you study well for the exams, they are honestly not too difficult to do well in. I also really appreciate how Professor Puth takes the feedback of students to heart - for example, the 3 exams were originally 10% each, but she changed the weightage such that the exam with our highest score would get the highest weighting etc.",
    "Yes, good science for non stem majors",
    "I would recommend this class to a student if they made sure early on in the semester that they're keeping up with all testable material. Most of it is from the readings discussed in section, so students should be prepared to complete what is expected of them.",
    "Yes if they need a Science credit that is easier than most, but I still found it overall not very interesting unless if you're very passionate about conservation biology specifically.",
    "yes if need science gut or want a rudimentary understanding in environmental studies\/conservation. no if you've taken a lot of EVST courses previously - a lot of repetitive stuff. conservation decision making was interesting, tho, and not something i'd learned about in prior classes."
