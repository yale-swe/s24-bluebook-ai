   "comments": [
    "I am not a history major, and I find this course manageable. The amount of reading is fair and not too hard to chew.",
    "History of Food is a super interesting survey course of the culture of food throughout time and place. The course material is broad - you move from China, to India to Medieval Europe in just one lecture - but you will come away with a new understanding of the role of food in history, and you'll definitely learn a ton. Professor Freedman is great and super flexible, meaning that you can write your papers on essentially any topic that interests you. I would highly recommend this course to all Yalies, regardless of major. It'll be one of the most fun classes at Yale, guaranteed!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for another student, even if it is not taken towards one's major. It is a great class for learning about international interactions through the culinary lens, helping one understand culture as well.",
    "Class with very manageable workload and fun topic.",
    "The class is just okay. Lectures are fairly boring and the class only gives you a cursory introduction to wide array of topics. The best part are the essays that are interesting and fun to write. If you are looking for a good credit\/d class, this is if, but there are definitely more interesting history classes out there.",
    "Interesting and fun class with a very manageable workload. I would recommend.",
    "Take the class if you've ever been curious about how our world's many different foods and cuisines have become what they are today. Professor Freedman is a wonderful lecturer, very nice, and obviously fascinated with the topic; his passion made every lecture an engaging and fun experience. The workload is a bit more than the average history lecture: two 8-10 pg papers, a midterm, and a final. However, I found the work worth it, especially since we could write about basically anything we were interested in for both of the papers.",
    "Take this class! Bring food if you don't want to get hungry during lecture.",
    "I think HUMS 164 is a great history class even for non-history-oriented people. I would recommend it as long as you have a strong interest in food.",
    "Interesting course with a light work load. There is reading and can be boring sometimes",
    "This class was a ton of fun! I totally recommend it! It's a very manageable workload. Two papers, a midterm, and a final. Readings aren't necessary if you go to lecture. The papers were pretty easy and straightforward, and there were a ton of options to choose from. Both the midterm and final were essay questions, also with choice.",
    "Definitely take this course - but be aware that it is not a gut.",
    "This class was wonderful for anyone who is interested in food, or how food has shaped history-- a wonderful survey course.",
    "Starts off as a region by region overview of food and customs. Then becomes more interesting when it talks about modern food and restaurants",
    "No. The class wasn't as enjoyable as I thought it was going to be.",
    "I loved this class -- it's a great overview of the history of food. There is generally an emphasis on themes around food preference rather than the environmental history of food. And there's a focus on how food drove major historical events.",
    "I would summarize this course as a great way to learn about cultural development and interaction through a different medium",
    "This course is great! Definitely take it before you graduate. You learn to really appreciate food, which is sort of mundane and ubiquitous on a superficial level. However, you really dive into the meaning behind food (cultural, artisanal, authenticity, etc) and Freedman is a great lecturer!",
    "The History of Food is an informative, fun class whose lessons will remain relevant for the rest of your life. Food never goes away, after all! I would highly recommend this class if it is offered again.",
    "Yes. Great history class for non-history people. Very relavent and lots of good interesting perspectives from people in the section. I learned a lot and the lectures were great. THe reading assignments were all interesting and not bad to read. I usually dont do the readings for classes and I did these.",
    "History of food, where food comes form, food culture, and current issues relating to food. Mostly focused on food in America, but there is some discussion of food in other parts of the world. TAKE THIS COURSE. PLEASE. YOU WILL ENJOY IT!",
    "Take it for a low key lecture!",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course! The topic may seem indicative of a gut course, but it really isn't. There are 2 papers, a midterm, and a final, so while it's not a gut course it's definitely very doable and a really fun 5th class to add. The readings are very helpful, since Professor Freedman sometimes won't be able to cover everything about, say, Indian food, in a 50 minute lecture, so you should absolutely do the readings (but sometimes lectures do seem like recapitulations of the readings). If you want to do well, though, I would highly recommend doing the readings and going to class, since with so much material, it takes a little time for everything to sink in. Professor Freedman is a great lecturer, and the papers were actually fun to write.",
    "HIST 246 01 is a course that provides an overview of the history of food from prehistory to the present day. It looks at cuisines from different periods and around the world, as well as the social and political factors that affected what people have eaten in different parts of history and the world. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in history or food in general, or simply anyone who wants to learn more about a topic that not many people have a deep understanding of.",
    "Recommend it. Interesting and not very hard.",
    "I would say that HIST 246 is a class on the history of food and more importantly of food culture. You will traverse a long timeline that describes the force of globalization, immigration, and taste on culture of cuisines and food environment. I would recommend it to another student who is interested in history and food. The topics get repetitive, but if you like Professor Freedman's lecturing style and the subject matter you will like the class.",
    "If you've ever wanted to get a wider perspective on the most central element there is to human society (food), now's your chance! This class is accessible, the workload is totally manageable, the material is interesting, and you will not regret learning this stuff. This information is even more crucial as current food systems accelerate climate change and societal destabilization. Papers have wide leeway for personal choice and the exams are straightforward if you've been engaged in the course. Take it!",
    "This was a great 5th class. It was really interesting to learn about the history of food in different cultures.",
    "Great class -- very interesting and you'll learn a lot. Professor Freedman is extremely knowledgeable and a great lecturer. Material is not particularly difficult and workload is fair (midterm, final and two papers). I enjoyed this course a lot."
