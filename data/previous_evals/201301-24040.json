    "Very interesting, yet challenging subject matter. The topic is relevant and unique to anything else offered at YSPH.Strengths:-Interesting topics-Broad range of religious\/spiritual factors considered-Very clear\/logical presentation of contentWeaknesses:-There could have been more assignments that encourage interaction among the students.-There could have been some resource to overview basic tenets of religions explored.",
    "This was a really interesting, low-pressure course. It is an important class to be offered at YSPH and I'm really glad we have it. However, I think it has the potential to be even more interesting. The class was very methods and research-focused, and there was a lot of emphasis on reading and discussing academic articles. I would have liked to see more case studies, and perhaps discussions that were not so research focused, but instead more application and practice focused. Some of the methods lessons were helpful for reinforcing what we've learned in biostats and epi. A lot of the topics were really fascinating. The final paper assignment was great. It was nice to have a take-home open-note open-communication midterm. It would have been nice not to have to do it during spring break, but given everything else we had going on, this was the most feasible option and it wasn't too bad.",
    "This was not a discussion course. ~70% of the 2 hours were spent listening to the professor. He did not seem to want us to discuss the material, so students quickly became disengaged.",
    "Religion and health outcomes is a very controversial issue. I'm glad that this class exists so that we can discuss these issues and learn from it.",
    "Very boring course- this is a seminar course and there was supposed to be interactive learning. That did not happy...at all.",
    "This was a good course, the title explains it all.",
    "Interesting topic",
    "This course was very useful to me."

    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Strengths:-Nice guy-Knowledgeable-Provides good feedbackWeaknesses:-He didn't seem to expect much from us as Master's students (i.e. level of understanding seemed to be on par with what you would expect from undergrad students)-Doesn't push to facilitate conversations as much (he just lectures whenever people hesitate to respond)-Seemed to favor some aspects of spirituality than others (e.g. gave an extensive presentation about the history of yoga, the teachings of various yogis, brought books about yoga, and went through some yoga moves for the 'meditation' class all before discussing the readings. But didn't do similarly when talking about other topics like Christian prayer or Orthodox Jewish culture. He clearly is a yoga enthusiast, but unfortunately, the level of background provided to use was not as extensive for any other religion\/spiritual concept)",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Prof Van Ness is really nice! He is really approachable and really cares about helping his students. He was especially helpful withour final papers. I really appreciated that he allowed us to send him drafts and that he gave us resources. He encouraged participation and valued what each of us had to say. He brings a very interesting and important perspective to YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Dr. Van Ness did not expect much from us, which was discouraging and somewhat insulting.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Dr. Van Ness is a wonderful professor. He always loved student input and would always invite commentary. He was always available when a student needed help with course work.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Very, very boring and dry. Lectured to us like out of a Charlie Brown movie.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0He really cares about what he does.",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Helpful",
    "Instructor: Peter H Van Ness \u00a0Professor Vanness was a great instructor. He has lots of background knowledge on the subject.I enjoyed his teachings."

    "Interesting foray into the intersection of religion\/spirituality and health. Fair work load and interesting readings. I'd recommend to a second year as you benefit from the statistical and methodological background.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a low pressure, chill course, and a lot of the topics are interesting. I would like to see more discussion that is not so research-focused, but overall this was a good course. I looked forward to going to class each week.",

    "This course is very important and useful for Public health students. I would definitely recommend it for other students as this course will help them to understand the relation between religion and health better."
