   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in game theory, or anyone who is looking for a relatively easy QR.",
    "GREAT COURSE!",
    "Game Theory may seem intimidating, but this is a great way to get a QR and get some background in an important topic in economics and political science. You'll also probably never have the opportunity to have it taught in such a precise, clear way as you will in this class. Exams are fair, but problem sets can be tough, especially if you aren't in a study group. Office hours will help you though.",
    "Take this course if you want easy math and if you're interested in seeing how politics work in a more mathematical way. However, don't expect to learn much about politics as a subject.",
    "Take it if you've never taken game theory before and want an easy introduction to a few concepts. Don't expect much emphasis on policsci.",
    "This class definitely sparked an interest for game theory, as the games are very relevant to everyday life. However it can get a bit tricky as there are often no concrete answers to games.",
    "It is an excellent introduction to game theory. Very well taught, and very interesting material. I would highly recomend taking it. The only thing to be wary of is that while the examples are often in polisci, beyond that there is little direct connection to polisci. Instead, it is mostly a generic intro to game theory.",
    "Yes. It is an interesting introductory course to game theory.",
    "This was a fun course that introduces all the basic topics of Game Theory without getting too technical.",
    "A good introductory game theory class. However, it's less poli sci oriented or applied game theory than I expected. If you've taken another intro game theory class, you won't gain too much from this class.",
    "The class is a good QR if you're looking to fulfill distributional requirements and want something that's both manageable and interesting. You definitely need to put in the work for psets, but the exams are relatively straightforward. Professor Beim makes game theory accessible to those who haven't taken econ or math here, although an interest\/knowledge of political science would certainly help.",
    "Not a bad QR credit, but watch out for the time slot. This is a hard class to take in the late afternoon.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who would like to study game theory in a small classroom setting.",
    "Interesting class, good QR if QR isn't really your thing. Almost definitely easier than the game theory offered by the Econ department. Don't overestimate the amount that political examples will come up, though--it was usually simple stuff if anything politically relevant at all."
