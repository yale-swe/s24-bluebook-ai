    "Knowledge about the relationships about the developments of anthropological theories and colonial affairs. Knowledge about various anthropologists and their theories.",
    "This course besides exposing me to anthropological theory taught me to question myself and how understanding ones positionality is necessary to account for one's innate biases. This is something I otherwise was not forced to confront in any of my other classes.",

   "comments": [
    "Many weeks the readings didn't seem to have much relevance to (post)colonial studies, or even Anthropology largely. Providing more of a structure\/explanation would make the purpose of some weeks clearer.",
    "Well taught course. No complaints about the course. Readings are insightful and the seminar meetings are productive.",
    "reading load is too large i think, but good mix of readings",
    "This course like other seminars is built on the discussions of the class which means if people do not engage then it does not work. This course's structure with the presentations and the respondent support this discussion and can help kick it off. However, there has to be a better way to frame the class such that people can engage with it and keep discussion going... Once discussion kicked off however this was a really valuable class as people could posit whatever they wanted for the class to discuss over. We may have strayed from the readings but talked about some important stuff.",
    "great small seminar, weak in that it's only engaging if the class itself does the readings and is engaged because there are so few people"

    "Well-taught course. Lots of reading. Fewer writing assignments. Important for any kind of social science work.",
    "yes. You'll learn plenty.",
    "Yes. It is helpful for my understanding on the subject.",
    "Like any seminar and theory course you must look over the syllabus for the readings and the day to day topics. This course delves into post colonialism and especially focuses on the middle east and black America. This part of the class is especially cool especially if you have little previous experience. I would definitely recommend this class and make sure to ask silly\/random questions and drive the discussion yourself if no one else will!",
