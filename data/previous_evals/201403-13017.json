    "Good Hum credit",
    "Take it! It's not so hard and yet it is very interesting",
    "This class is a fairly chill lecture describing the history of medicine in America for the last century. It's quite interesting and the lecturers lecture well and give interesting information. The course is isn't bad in terms of work and the exams are fair and test overall concept knowledge. There is one final paper towards the end of the semester that isn't bad provided you don't wait until 3 days before it's due to start thinking about it. Overall, satisfied with the course, and I'm not a humanities major.",
    "The subject was incredibly interesting. However, I feel that I would have benefited more had there been more than one paper and a lighter weighted final.",
    "Take this class. It is fun and interesting and extremely relevant. You won't regret it.",
    "I really liked this course! I thought it was a very interesting topic and that the professors were very skilled lecturers. I enjoyed coming to class because I knew the lecture would be interesting. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Interesting, relevant, and not too difficult.",
    "You should absolutely take this class! It is really interesting and even eye-opening! The themes are both historical and relevant for us. Overall a fun course!",
    "The class could be really interesting--there are a ton of cool topics and readings and lectures, but it is really disorganized and it is hard to follow a chronology, so it's hard to really internalize the significance of the information. Its not that hard, and lots of people treat it like a gut, but the TAs grade pretty harshly, so I wouldn't consider it a gut at all.",
    "Great class. I would recommend this class to another student. It was very interesting and I enjoyed learning the course material.",
    "It is a fascinating course that mixes in in both present and past movements and themes. It changes the way you view advertising and the public's perception of health. I definitely recommend it.",
    "It is a general overview of the historical developments of media and medicine, and how those developments are connected. Very informative overview on pertinent historical events (like Tuskeegee, nationalized healthcare, medical dramas on television). It was exciting to trace the changes in media's portrayal of the medical world between the 1880s and present day.",
    "Interesting class with interesting material - not very much work but the exams are a lot of writing",
    "Decent course, lots of work. Exams are heavy on the readings and lectures (you have to cite readings, lecture, and section for exams), and section is required.",
    "A class where you walk away having kearned a lot about interdisciplinary aspects of health in America. Anyone can learn something from this class and enjoy it too.",
    "Yes. Not much work, but really interesting stuff, and fun to talk about in section.",
    "a lot of reading but definitely take it! interesting for history lovers",
    "Definitely a class worth taking! Very interesting, broad and engaging!",
    "Great course about media from a medical perspective. Everybody sees drug ads and should have an interest in health for their own sake, so it is very applicable.",
    "Not a gut",
    "This is a course that discusses how media has been used to bring awareness about diseases throughout history. The material is interesting, but the lectures can at times be a bit dry. The grading is a bit harsh for the difficulty of the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. I initially didn't think I would be too interested in the material but actually enjoyed doing the readings (which never happens). Gives you a great sense of the current state of the medical profession and how its developed and interacted with the public in the past century.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is definitely an interesting class I'm glad I had the privilege to take.",
    "I took this class to get a humanities credit. There is very little work for the class (midterm, paper, final) because the readings are not necessary to do thoroughly. The class is interesting most of the time, but I wish I had taken something more meaningful to me. Also, just because it is not much work does not mean it is an easy A.",
    "Great HU credit. Workload is not bad at all. The tests are somewhat strange when you first take the midterm, but by the time the final rolls around you have a better sense of what they want. It's important to understand themes in the course rather than specific detail. Readings are important as well.",
    "Good! Not a lot of work but good to know. Only one essay, one midterm, and the final. Section participation is also big.",
    "This is a very interesting course! A lot of the people in it are premed but even as a non-premed I found it very interesting and a really nice hum class. The lectures are really interesting and full of videos and historical sources.",
    "Definitely take it. Not a hard work load, easy material to comprehend, and lectures are pretty interesting.",
    "Media and Medicine is a really fun class. It's not super demanding, but you need to do at least some of the readings to get by. It's a big lecture class but the lectures are really interesting and definitely worth going to.",
    "It is an interesting combination of media and medicine. Take it. I liked it because it was medicine (which I am interested in) but not sciency. The lectures are interesting - a really nice course to have in the midst of all the pre-med requirements.",
    "TAKE IT. its a course that lead you to look at things differently",
    "A GREAT class! You will learn a ton about how media and medicine interact, especially in terms of the ethical questions that come into play. I realized that I really didnt know as much about the topic as I thought. The tests are graded a bit harshly, but theyre not horrible. You dont really have to do the readings, BUT NOTE: the readings are the BEST PART of the class! They are actually incredibly interesting and informative. If youre going to take it, it is a waste if you dont do the readings.",
    "This is a great class! It isn't too difficult, but you learn A LOT of things throughout the semester that can really change your perspective on the relationship between medicine and media--a relationship that we encounter pretty frequently. I would highly recommend this!",
    "I loved this class! Very low stress and very interesting content. The reading load is very heavy, however depending on what section your in it is often not necessarily to read every single one. I admit I read them all and they were extremely interesting but sometimes unnecessarily time consuming. I highly recommend it if you want a good class. The grading is also very fair if you put significant effort.",
    "Would absolutely recommend, just don't expect it to be the easy A that it used to be",
    "Although the workload is light and the material is interesting, I did not like this class as much as I thought I would. It is poorly organized and team taught, which means that you jump back and forth from one decade to another. There are times when it's unclear what certain lectures (particularly the guest lectures) have to do with the intersection of media and medicine. If you are thinking of taking this class because you are genuinely interested in the subject matter, beware that this class, because of its reputation for being a gut, attracts a huge number of people who aren't really taking it seriously, and you might be better off taking a HSHM seminar instead. The material is largely intuitive, so you won't necessarily be learning very much, so if that would bother you, find something else to take.",
    "Cool enough class, take if you need the humanities credit",
    "A really interesting class with a lot of great material that you might not have known about before. And this class is definitely not just for pre-med students, which it can seem like initially. If you're interested in medicine's effects on society and society's effects on the medical establishment within the lens of media\/film\/ads\/cartoons, then this is the class for you (it covers a lot of topics that are important even today - and all of us are patients at some point, so in general, this course should be important for everyone). Berland and Warner are pretty good lecturers and I was almost never bored during their lectures: they relied on a lot of different forms of media which kept the topics interesting. There is a lot of reading but you can get away with not doing some of them. If you can get into Sigma Colon's section, do it. She's the head TA for the class and her section was probably the best section I've ever had at Yale (and I'm a senior). She lets everyone participate pretty equally so there never were any section assholes. Also, she was very clear about what she was expecting for our paper, midterm, and final so the course became a lot more manageable and enjoyable. One of those rare gems where you actually enjoy learning the material itself. Definitely take it!",
    "This class was a very interesting and fun class. I always looked forward to going to class, and I feel like it's one of the best classes Yale has to offer. However, as a warning, this is not an easy A class - it is, however, not hard to get a B+ or A- without doing much work. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend it to any and every Yale student.",
    "Take it! The class is extremely easy. The lectures and readings are actually interesting because they're relevant to today's generation.",
    "Recommend. Good class, not a ton of work. Easy to get a B+ but difficult to get an A.",
    "I would recommend this course because content itself is interesting.",
    "I'd recommend it if you need it for distribution and want something pretty painless. Personally, I didn't find it that interesting but a lot of my friends really liked it.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is interesting and informative. The workload is not too bad and the professors are interesting.",
    "Pretty easy--take it.",
    "A great class that teaches you lots of interesting information, and with minimal workload. Take it!",
    "A class I took mainly because I heard it was easy. I went to class 4 times. 2 of those times were for guest lectures - I'm pretty sure I never heard Professor Berland teach a class. The grading is based 20% section, 20% midterm, 35% final, 25% paper. You don't need to go to class to do reasonably well on any of these things if you do the readings instead. There are a LOT of readings though if you choose this route. This is the kind of class you take with a friend and you switch off who goes to lecture each week. I would recommend doing that.",
    "Take it!! The material is good to know in general, and a lot of the themes and concepts are applicable in other classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. It was interesting. Not easy, but not hard. You learn so much American history and it gives you a new perspective on looking at advertising especially with regards to health and to foodstuffs. And you learn about a lot of things pertaining to ethics in the medical field. very interesting stuff",
    "A relatively interesting class. Would recommend as an easy humanities credit, although grading has been getting harder recently. Doing the readings does't add too much value, but attending the lectures and sections do.",
    "Take it! I learned a lot, had fun writing the research paper (which is really short) and did well in the class without a lot of work put in.",
    "yes, very interesting course regarding the intersection of media and medicine. speakers could be a little more engaging, but the material presented was very fascinating. very applicable and pertinent to current day themes.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student. I learned so much from this course and enjoyed the lecture.",
    "A really cool that combines a lot of interesting topics. Some lectures were better than others, but the class made sense and was very interesting.",
    "Highly recommend this class. The material is super interesting - ties historical material to things going on in our lives like the Affordable Care Act, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, TV shows like Grey's Anatomy and House, etc. and provides a really interesting perspective on all of this.",
    "If you are looking for a good intro to understanding media, this is an OK course. It's hard to review a lot of the lectures because you don't have access to the slides and media pieces the lectures discuss. John Warner really drags down his half of the course, but I enjoyed Gretchen Berland's lectures.",
    "Super good for HSHM majors! Nice overview of everything, and great to see different public health campaigns, etc. over the years.",
    "YES. Take this class! It's very low-key in terms of workload but also incredibly interesting. Even if you're not interested in medicine, this is definitely a fascinating class and going to lecture actually is fun.",
    "really enjoyable course and highly recommend taking it as a 5th class",
    "This class has some interesting topics but at times seems repetitive. I do also think that the instructors of this class are a bit unrealistic with the amount of readings that they assign.",
    "The class is very interesting!",
    "I thought it was a very dull class, full of repetitive information and well-known facts about the media. It's good for pre-med students who may not have ever been introduced to this sort of subject but as a humanities major, I felt like I didn't get any useful knowledge out of the class.",
    "I recommend the course and thought very helpful in many ways. It helped show the influence of media and understanding stigma within society.",
    "A lot of HSHM classes have a lot of overlap, and this class is no exception. There are probably other, more compelling classes in the major out there, but this was enjoyable.",
    "Media and Medicine is a really interesting course. I took it to get a Humanities credit, but I think it is a class that anyone would enjoy because it is so relevant to our lives. It was really interesting to look at the shifts in the portrayal of medicine in America's history. The articles we read and film clips we watched in lecture made the class very enjoyable.",
    "I would highly recommend this course",
    "Would recommend if you need a Hu credit.",
    "YES. Take it. It's a really interesting and relevant course that will enrich your world and make you more educated and aware of the medical profession. It won't change your life, but it'll be really interesting and informative.",
    "Absolutely. It's a great AMST course if that's your major, and it's a great humanities course if it's not. It's just entertaining. I especially recommend it if you're just tired of knocking out requirements for your major and want something random to spice up your schedule.",
    "Look at how media and medicine interplay in 20th and 21st century. Take the class!",
    "would definitely recommend--especially for a humanities class if you're struggling to find one",
    "Overall the course is interesting, the exams seemed to be graded rather arbitrarily. The grading on the paper would depend on your TA, and how much you spoke with him\/her about your paper idea.",
    "Absolutely take this class of you're interested in film, television, journalism, and the way that these entities have dealt with medicine over time. This was a very interesting class with a completely manageable amount of reading and a low workload, but the professors were also interesting and accomplished. Take it!",
    "Media and Medicine was a great survey course in the history of how medicine is conducted in this country, which highlighted everything from film to twitter as examples. Both professors gave excellent talks on the course material - one from a more medical background and the other from a more historical background - to leave students with a feel for the changing relationship that the medical establishment has held in the US. I recommend this class to anyone of any major and think that it's an important aspect of American history that students should know about.",
    "Solid class overall. It explores the intersection between media and public health\/ medicine in American history up to the present, which is really interesting to study. That said, some lectures were a little dry. Section was helpful, and the exams were relatively easy and straightforward. So was the paper. I would recommend this class, but know that the material does get a little repetitive by the end of the semester.",
    "Pretty interesting class, but not organized enough in my opinion. Sometimes it feels like you're learning the same themes over and over again. There is one midterm, a 7 page paper, and a final. The midterm and final are essay writings. So basically, during the course they throw a bunch of topics at you and your job is to put them all in chronological order, figure out different ways they relate to each other, and then make some type of argument about them. I probably wouldn't take it again if I could do it all over",
    "yes if you have any interest in medicine; it's actually very interesting to see how the status of medicine has changed in the 1880s",
    "It's a good overview of the history of media and medicine. It's not much work - you can just skim the readings and get a good grade. That said, if you put in more work, the material actually tends to be decently interesting and rewarding. Medicine has an important place in American culture and society, and it's interesting to look at the history of the medical industry in the context of its relations to the media.",
    "Media and Medicine is an interesting class, and overall, I would recommend taking it. If you're looking for a gut, it might not be the right class for you, because the TFs will be harsh graders. You really do have to do the readings to do well.",
    "This is a very solid option for a humanities credit for students interested in STEM. The class is not too difficult and does not require much work, and the material is pretty interesting.",
    "Really interesting material. Lectures didn't feel like a class, since they were loaded with clips and interesting narratives. I would say it is a little light on information, so if you're looking to have life-changing epiphanies, this probably isn't the class for you.",
    "Great class and very interesting material - you will learn a lot about a very relevant topic. Going to class was always a pleasure.",
    "This is a really great class where you learn about media and its relationship to medicine. You get to watch a lot of clips in class and you learn about things you would otherwise watch on youtube anyways! Really insightful and teaches you to appreciate the importance of media in the medical field. Make sure to discuss your final paper with your TA!",
    "I think that the course's reputation as a 'gut' class should not be taken too seriously because there is a lot of reading that will eventually be necessary in order to get a good grade, and because you have to learn a lot of the material on your own.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Definitely one of my favorite courses at Yale and it's so easy because the material is too engaging and interesting to not fully delve yourself into. Regardless of your major, this class will relate to everyone, and you leave with a new take on everyday life around you - noticing several health- and medical-related media around you that normally you would have written off as normal or even ignored. I loved going to this class every week. Also, there are only weekly sections, 2 exams with essays, and a final paper - totally manageable. You'll thank yourself for taking it.",
    "A dull class with below average workload. Course material is pretty interesting, but lecture is tough. Overall a solid class.",
    "Awesome class! Not too much work and exposes you to more than just the science behind medicine. Interesting humanities credit for those majoring in science or pre-meds.",
    "Yes, definitely take it especially if you're interested in how American health care stakeholders have used the media to define the discourse of medicine.",
    "No. This class is fine--the material, lectures, readings, etc. are interesting--but it's not particularly engaging and it doesn't seem worthwhile.",
    "Relatively interesting lecture on how medicine is portrayed through media, very heavily based on section participation. Minimal written work throughout the year, but a LOT of reading if you actually keep up with it. Paper was a weird assignment that was tough to understand with no formal assignment or standardization of grading etc.",
    "yes yes, take it!",
    "Film 244 is not a \"gut\". The workload is below that of other Yale classes (and the subject is VERY interesting!) but it is not a class where everyone gets a good grade without doing a bit of work.",
    "Good class, very interesting subject matter",
    "I would definitely recommend the class because it changes the way you look at medicine in the world. It is a very interesting course.",
    "Quite a lot of material, but interesting class that is worth taking",
    "This class was very interesting, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. It is about medicine and media dating from the 1880s until present time. The readings are usually very interesting but can be very long, sometimes over 100 pages a night. They show interesting clips and images that relate to daily life, and the classes go by very quickly",
    "Great course to take. Course work is not terrible and the readings grab your interest.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would advise this class to another student. The readings were not overwhelming, and I found them useful for exams and lectures. The class did a really great job showing the change in the relationship between the medical profession and the general population.",
    "Easy HU credit, and you learn something new about medicine. Great for any background-- you definitely don't need to be a history or HSHM major.",
    "Take this class if you can use it for your major or need an easy Hu credit. Super interesting! Attendance to lecture is ~optional",
    "really recommend this course even if you aren't doing anything related to pre med. Interesting material with moderate load. You have to do the reading even though they are very reflexive of the lectures because you will be marked down on the final if you cannot site specific articles and quotes.",
    "Overall, though I would not recommend this class highly to another student, I would also not recommend against it. I left the class feeling pretty neutral about it. It will enlighten you about a few topics you didn't know about before, but at least for me it felt like it just re-iterated a lot of knowledge I already had.",
    "This was a very interesting course and had a manageable amount of work. A strength of this course is that the readings match up very well with each lecture.",
    "Solid overall class that is definitely recommended.",
    "Take it! It's one of the most engaging large lecture courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take it if you want to improve your writing and historical analysis skills. It's not too intense for non-history types but was a great way to learn about media\/medicine and even converted a few people to HSHM along the way.",
    "Take this class credit d if you need a 5th class. It's not worth it for anything more than that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it's very applicable and interesting especially with our society's love for media",
    "I would highly recommend this is you need a social science credit or if you're just interested in the topic. One of the few classes where the material is interesting, accessible, and you can actively engage with it. Do it!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend HIst 147 for another student. It was a great course that was taught in an engaging manner. Additionally, there isn't much work given that the reading wasn't completely necessary.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is very interesting, and taught very well!",
    "Section, midterm, final, and final paper, so not too much work. Make sure to attend lecture, as the slides are not posted.",
    "Great class! Take it!",
    "Pretty interesting class. If you're looking for an interesting fifth class, take this one!",
    "Really great 5th class. Not too challenging but always interesting and relevant. People of any major would really enjoy this class!",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course material presented in Media and Medicine in Modern America, and was not at all overwhelmed by the workload. I would recommend the course to any student interested in the field of medicine as seen through the analyzation of media campaigns past and present.",
    "I thought this class would be more interesting than it was. Lectures became boring and readings don't add much to the lecture. Not a ton of work though.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "I would recommend this overall if you are somewhat interested in material and looking for a class to fill out your schedule that wont be overly demanding. The workload is pretty light (7 page paper, midterm, final), but if you are not interested then you will likely not be going to lecture or doing the reading, so it would be easy to be unprepared for tests.",
    "Beware that this course is definitely a history\/english course. I found this to be a bit difficult at times being that I am a more science-inclined student. That being said, the lectures were very interesting and informative! You definitely come away with knowledge that is directly applicable to real life.",
    "Gives a great historical review of the relationship I media and medicine in contemporary times. Very replace by unimaginable and allows you to see the intersection and influence of these two branches. Would recommend for anyone! Great class not too hard and super interesting!",
    "I took this Cr\/D as a fifth course but even if you take it for a grade, it shouldn't be too stressful to do well. I loved reading about the topics that this class revolves around - I only wish that discussions had gone more into depth about them.",
    "It is an okay class that doesn't require a lot of work, but the grading is not easy. The material is interesting, but not taught very well.",
    "I would recommend the course because it is not too difficult and the material is enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - the class is basically teaching you common knowledge.",
    "Media and Medicine is a phenomenal course, especially if you're pre-med! Your perspective on both media and medicine will be irrevocably changed! If you ever have the chance, please do yourself a favor and take it!",
    "Course that examines how medicine is portrayed in America",
    "Course material is extremely interesting and relevant. A fun class and would highly recommend.",
    "This is an interesting class with little work, a good amount of reading, and the midterms and final are not that hard if you pay attention in lecture and section. I learned a lot and found it relevant to everyday life.",
    "Do the readings -- it'll make the course even better than it already is. Courseload is not bad at all. The lectures are interesting and engaging. TAKE IT!"
