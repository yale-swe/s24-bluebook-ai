   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you can! It's awesome. The material is interesting and the classes are fun and entertaining. Professor Ford is great.",
    "If you are looking for interesting stories about trials, this is your class. However, there is very little to apply to your life otherwise. Don't think that this will help you with a legal career in any way.",
    "absolutely recommend this class, it's amazing",
    "This is a wonderful class to take if you get the chance. Professor Ford is a superstar in his field and is knowledgeable and passionate about the course material. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Without a doubt one of top 3 classes at Yale. Fun, thought-provoking, with a manageable work load, if you can possibly get in this class there is absolutely no reason not to take it.",
    "Really fun! Low-pressure! Yes, take this course.",
    "Yes, definitely. If you can get in, take it.",
    "brief recountings of various significant trials",
    "Each week you discuss a different 'trial of the century'- OJ, Clinton Ipmpeachment, Linberghs, etc. (See syllabus) There's a 5pg paper and a 15-20pg term paper, and one week you lead class. Very straightforward. Class prep is readings&a movie- do one or the other, both is redundant. (I only watched the movies and was fine and could contribute positively.)",
    "Absolutely! If you get into this course take it! It's interesting and the videos, readings, and class discussions give you a very thorough understanding of the trials and cases as well as the events surrounding them.",
    "Take it for an relatively easy and interesting overview of cases in the 20th century. More of anthropological perspective rather than strict legal interpretaion."
