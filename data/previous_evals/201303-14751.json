   "comments": [
    "It's an interesting idea, but ultimately a boring class. You can definitely get by without attending lecture or doing the readings, but you don't leave the class feeling like you learned anything. I would definitely recommend ProfessorEisenberg, but not for this class.",
    "This was a fantastic course. I looked forward to going to every lecture, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning material that I otherwise would never have known about the history of American families. The work load isn't too large, but it is enough to keep you thinking about the course. Prof. Eisenberg is dorky, funny, and just awesome. By far the best course I have taken this semester. I am an engineering major, but this makes me consider a double major in American Studies.",
    "Definitely. It is a new spin on American History that makes studying history interesting and relevant to your own life.",
    "Aamerican Families might seem like a fun class if you're looking for something dumb and easy. But you'd be wrong to take this class because you're looking for an easy credit. I did that and regret it so deeply.There was no nuance or rigor whatsoever in this class. I got more from Wikipedia than I did from the lecture notes all year. Lecture was just a lot of Ziv telling us stories about his daughter and playing Louis CK videos intended to show us that parents face all sorts of challenges. I don't know how this got classified as a HSHM, but there's NO history of science or history of medicine here. It's just, like, 10th grade American history dumbed down and focused on YouTube videos tangentially related to the things tangentially related to women or families.I was offended by the extent to which Ziv's arguments were dumbed down (from the slides: \"Raising children is D-I-F-F-I-C-U-L-T\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094he literally spelled it out). But I was also offended by some of the stuff he did in the name of teaching this class. At one point, he brought in, as a guest speaker, his daughter's friend's father, a man who is married to another man. Look guys! Gay marriage exists! At another point, there was a special lecture slide of pictures of celebrities who are married to people of different race (Robin Thicke and Paula Patton! Halle Berry and her husband!) to prove that our nation's law now accepts interracial marriage.Section was also a joke. But not a fun joke. A jokewith required attendance each week. And each week it was the most difficult thing for me to sit through because of the sheer stupidity of it all.American Families was neither interesting enough nor, ultimately, easy enough (final paper AND final exam) to justify taking it as a gut.I don't know what this was, but it wasn't a class. It was a pointless thing that I had to spend time on each week and at the end of the academic year. I hated every moment. Don't make my mistake. Don't take it. Seriously, if you want a gut, take Mambo instead. Or, if you want to learn anything, take George Chauncey's lecture. JUST DO NOT TAKE THIS.",
    "Absolutely! The lecture is so interesting and really any kind of major will take something from this. There's science and medicine between the history and politics. We read primary sources and watch great films. Awesome class about a topic that most people know very little about. Plus Professor Eisenberg is indisputably awesome. He gives the most interesting lectures!",
    "Definitely take it. Average amount of reading, not bad paper and the exams are easy if you've been keeping up with class and the material",
    "This class reinforced my impression of HSHM classes in general: great professor, well-taught, well-organized and very interesting. It offers students an opportunity to stop and think about the evolution of ideas and attitudes toward science, medicine and the family that we take for granted today. Professor Eisenberg is a great lecturer and also a really nice and funny person.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is fun and not too taxing.",
    "Gem of a class, at least as it was taught by professor Eisenberg.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student because I think it was a very interesting view on American History. It was also very fun and I learned a lot.",
    "It was a solid class, pretty easy, if you haven't already taken a bunch of American studies classes, take it. If you have, you might find a lot of this information repetitive.",
    "I recommend this class for anyone looking for a new perspective on American history, as looking at history through the lens of changes and continuity in the family turned out to be really fascinating, particularly when it came to more recent history (e.g. the rise of conservatism). The class is both a HIST and a HSHM class, so you also learn a lot about how the history of medicine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g. medical conceptions of pregnancy, the development of contraceptives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 plays into this history. Eisenberg is a very dynamic and good-humored lecturer; I consistently looked forward to class. Overall, I learned a great deal about American history from this class despite a moderate workload, and I highly recommend it.",
    "Good course",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course. The workload is manageable too.",
    "It takes you through the history of medicine and how it effects the evolution of the American family. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "If you have a preexisting interest in American sociology, especially in the foundations of \"family values,\" then this class will be interesting. If not, it's probably not worth your time.",
    "Yes it was an excellent class, and professor eisenberg is great at teaching it. Definitely would recommend.",
    "If you are interested in family life, women's roles in the family and society, and the changing values of American society, take this class.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "This is a wonderful class that shows you how American has changed for families in an interesting way. Definitely take it.",
    "The lectures sometimes moved a little too fast for me to take down all the notes I wanted to, and sometimes were pretty dry. But other times, the pacing was very good, and the material was very interesting. I particularly liked the way Professor Eisenberg linked what we learned to modern day things, particularly through the videos he showed, which were both entertaining and informative.",
    "its an interesting view on american history that focuses more on families and especially women. i would recommend this class to someone who finds that an interesting topic.",
    "Fantastic HSHM course! Midterm, final, final paper with a section, very typical for the department. Eisenberg is a great lecturer who uses youtube videos, helps you use historical thinking to evaluate current topics. A great lecture class, and the readings are pretty interesting too, one of them was a collection of Monica Lewinsky jokes.",
    "A good survey of issues relevant to family life. The topics are quite interesting and the workload is very manageable.",
    "Take this class! It isn't very hard, but never feels gutty. You learn so much, and it will change the way you think about current topics such as abortion and gay rights. You will have a great time, and you will love Professor Eisenberg! He is the greatest.",
    "So amazing! By far my favorite class this term. Ziv is a wonderful lecturer and so interesting. Take it to learn interesting facts about not only American families but also America throughout the decades!",
    "It's a great fifth class with very interesting material, so yes. The workload is not bad at all either.",
    "I would recommend the course as it provides as unique look at an America institution that is important yet often easily overlooked. Not very difficult and quite enjoyable.",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot more than I expected to, honestly. The information was very interesting and relevant to current issues even when it was over 100 years old. The week on same-sex marriage was more basic than I would have liked, but I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Take the course! You approach American history from the late-19th century to the present through the lens of the family. Looking at history this way helped me to internalize many of the concepts I glossed over in other American studies courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Eisenberg's lectures are great - he's engaging and has a good sense of humor to supplement lectures. For a course where you'll learn a lot and enjoy doing so, this is it.",
    "My favorite class so far at Yale. The lectures were incredibly interesting with Professor Eisenberg incorporating awesome videos often. A fair amount of material was covered in the course and discussion section was extremely helpful. Each week there was a fair amount of reading, however the readings were interesting so I would end up doing them anyways. Overall a great class, and especially for someone who needed a humanities credit.",
    "I would recommend this course."
