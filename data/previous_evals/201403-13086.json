    "Its a lot of work that is made up of little assignments and readings that just add up.",
    "One of the most interesting English classes you will take at Yale.",
    "This is a great course to take if you want to strengthen your academic writing. The papers are very reading based and force you to focus on a claim and really drive home your points. I would recommend this to other students: I felt that I was well-equipped by my high school background to write academic papers, but this course still helped me to become an even stronger writer and feel more confident that my papers are up to collegiate standards.",
    "I recommend this class to any freshmen who want to sharpen their writing skills. This class or any other English 114 class will do that.",
    "English 114 is a class that teaches you the ins and outs of academic writing. The personalized section topics allow for a more intimate involvement with writing. I absolutely recommend this class to anyone seeking improvement. If you want to get A's on papers in other classes, then this course is a great way to learn how.",
    "Writing course that really teaches you how to write! Highly recommend!",
    "Yes, every freshmen should take this class. No matter what level you write at, this class with help you be able to articulate yourself in a way that is not only effective but understandable and educated."
