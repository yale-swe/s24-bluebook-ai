   "comments": [
    "Great for those in public health as it gives you another lens to look of health through. Makes you realize how interconnected everything is.",
    "I would recommend it. It is fun, interesting, useful, and just the right amount of work.",
    "If you are interested in learning about the policies surrounding early childhood development, then take this class. It only meets once a week, but prepare well - you can get a lot out of the course.",
    "ECD, no more no less.",
    "This course gives, as far as it is possible in a classroom setting, a feeling of being a \"real world\" policy maker, and gives, I think, a student real experience in setting policy and justifying policy decisions. i would absolutely recommend this course, especially if the student is interested in development, children, or working in developing countries.",
    "This is a good class if you want to get a thorough perspective on how ECD policy is designed and implemented, particularly in the developing world. It has a lot of great opportunities for interaction and cooperation with classmates, as well as guest lecturers, interactions with other universities, etc.* I should say that a big selling point for me before I enrolled in the class was the opportunity to go to Laos, and see policy being developed in the real world. I was very disappointed that we were unable to go(and considering the recent donation by the Jackson family, I was surprised that we didn't have the money for this IR class to do the trip). However, even if the trip was entirely removed from the course curriculum, I would still recommend it.",
    "It's a great class for those interested in translating research into policy. The seminar style makes for engaging discussions and learning from peers. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in development policy work , particularly in health and education, but also those interested in environmental issues.",
    "It is a good course to grasp the basics of policy making. Similarly, it tackles a not very well-known area -early childhood development- which is worth spending time studying.",
    "A course on early childhood development policy from a multinational perspective.I would absolutely recommend this to others.",
    "I would definitely reccoment this course to another student - in fact, I already have.I feel it gives students a real-life look at the world of policy-making and the issues involved in helping create a better world for children.",
    "this class focuses on early childhood development policy. yes i would recommend it as you will have the opportunity to see one of the field's greatest in action, meet a wonderful person,and learn about a field in a nuanced way that might not otherwise be possible",
    "I strongly recommend this course to students looking for a real-world experience in policy making. Students, regardless of their backgrounds, can really bring their knowledge to use.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for students who have global studies (health, politics, etc) experience and who are looking forward to continuing in the international arena of politics and child development."

   "comments": [
    "I am going to be a child and adolescent psychiatrist so this helped me to understand the importance of ECD in a child's life.",
    "I'm not in the INRL department, so was all new information for me, but more tangentially related to my other work.",
    "I knew almost nothing about early childhood development before I entered this course, and now I think I have at least an elemental understanding of it. This course will be counted towards a development studies certificate.",
    "It really helped with application of my area of study in public health; with focus on translation and implementation of policy. It also gave me insights into the substantive area of early childhood development. Course was unrelated to my thesis research.",
    "Gave significant insight into the practical and 'real' aspects of policy making.",
    "This course helped me gain a better understanding of what is holding back development. I learnt that even though there are countless people with the passion to change their circumstances, this is simply not enough as they have to navigate bureaucracy, resource-scarcity and politics in order to help themselves.",
    "this did not contribute to my research but it opened my eyes to the myriad ways in which ecd might be affected by global health policy.",
    "As someone who is very interested in public policy, I find this course very helpful and satisfying in the sense that it confirms my interest in public policy. I wish there are more courses like this offered!",
    "I greatly look forward to using the content that I learned during the course of Pia's class to direct my future international policy work.Also, I particularly found the course's lecture and group work style engaging. I loved the policy labs and think they are incredibly useful for students to work through.Pia's passion for engaging new means of instruction such as the Yale-Harvard Policy project is just one sign of her dedication for seeking Yale's motto of Lux et Veritas. She is truly a role model at Yale."
