    "This class's biggest strength: providing a fully rounded knowledge on the greatest contributor in the history of western medicine. This class's biggest weaknesses: it is more a history class than a discussion seminar. History to me is more factual than interpretive, especially in an undergraduate setting like this class. Because of this, \"discussion\" in the class (which counts as a majority of the grade) consisted NOT of forming arguments and presenting them in a convincing way to which the class would respond, but actually consisted of asking the professor a question and listening to him answer and elaborate on that question. The bottom line is that yes, I did learn a lot about the history of scientific medicine, but the fact is that I didn't experience the discussion seminar that I wanted.",
    "Highly highly recommend it. The class is not just about the history of medicine (which at first didn't persuade me to want to take the class); it's about learning the biographies and personalities of influential figures that have impacted medicine. It's a great class for anyone interested in what it means to be a doctor. The best part about the class is Professor Nuland, who is not only the author of the book read in class, he's also an accomplished surgeon so he really knows what he's talking about when he talks about bioethics, the art of medicine and the overarching role of a doctor. He's highly personable and inspiring, and the digressions in class are the best part about it. The class is very laid back and low stress with one midterm, one final, one research paper, and a chapter of reading every week. We also went to the Walker Library of Imagination and the Yale Historical Medical Library, which were phenomenal. If you're a pre-med and you came to Yale because of a liberal arts education, take this class because you will learn what it means to be a doctor in the cultural and moral sense.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Especially for you premeds out there who want to examine medicine through a more humanities\/historical lens. I cannot emphasize enough how awesome Dr. Nuland is. He took us (field trip) to the library of Jay Walker (founder of priceline.com), and also brought in ancient texts which are probably hundreds of years old. All in all, this course is so fascinating because we learn how medicine evolves through the ages. As it moves away from the grasp of the Galenic hand, medicine evolved significantly. Also, the readings are genuinely interesting. Great freshman seminar. But please do note that I am writing this evaluation without any idea how I did on the final exam, final paper, and in the course. They were fair, however.",
    "It is a great course for anyone interested in science, medicine or history. I loved the subjects and Professor Nuland's teaching. I would recommend this course to anyone!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a pre-med or just anyone who has some interest in medical history. The workload was pretty light: about 60-80 pages of (interesting) reading per week, a midterm, a final, and an optional 5 page paper. Participation makes up the majority of the grade. We got many opportunities to handle facsimiles and even the original printings of a lot of the texts we were studying. One of those opportunities involved us being invited to visit Jay Walker's personal historical library (Google it. It's insane). Dr. Nuland's also a great teacher and mentor. The class was easily my favorite of the semester.",
    "Fascinating class with a fascinating professor. Dr. Nuland has so much experience and he tells great stories. On top of scientific discoveries, also goes into bioethics a little bit, which is incredibly interesting. Great seminar with opportunities for some really cool field trips!",
    "Personally, I truly enjoyed this class. However, the same may not be said by the majority of other students on campus. This class is great if you plan to enter the medical profession and are willing to do all of the readings (40 pages a week) so as to be prepared for discussions. If you are a pre-med student and want a change of pace, this class is great.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a fascinating class, and changes your world view. The perfect class to take freshman year.",
    "A class that covers the history of medicine since the Hippocratics, looking at several key figures that shaped scientific medicine.",
    "This class is an amazing freshman seminar. Especially if you are interested in medicine, it is an interesting way to look at medicine and how it has developed through out history. The professor is amazing and the workload very manageable. Every class is exciting because you learn so much just from listening to Professor Nuland. I highly recommend it.",
    "Definitely recommended! A great non-science class for those interested in medicine. The professor is amazing! Take it!",
    "TAKE IT. And do the research paper if he gives you the choice. It's worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, as its one of the best ways to really get to know a professor, and the field trip is a lot of fun.",
    "It's an amazing class that shows how medicine has progressed over 2,300 years. Professor Nuland was a great and thorough teacher, the worklaod wasn't too bad, and if you pay attention in class, you'll really enjoy it."
