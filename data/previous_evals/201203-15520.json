    "You NEED TO TAKE THIS COURSE. Johnston does a phenomenal job putting together his lectures, which are a great mix of military history, social and economic analysis, political storytelling, and contemporary archaeological evidence. Unlike many classical historians, Johnston puts a great deal of emphasis on skepticism of both primary and secondary sources and likes to juxtapose common academic claims with archaeological findings that could disprove them. I was unsure if I would like the class at first because I've never liked learning about wars and battles, which are constant in Roman history, but Johnston does a great job of discussing military action in the context of its political motivation.Also, don't be turned off by the workload. It's two papers, a midterm, a final, and a section with a weekly quiz, which seems like a lot, but Johnston and the TA were pretty chill about deadlines and making up quizzes, etc. The midterm and final are about broad historical trends, so you don't need to learn too many details or dates. I would do theprimary source reading, but you can just use the secondary sources for reference.",
    "This course begins with the history of the early cultures on the Italian peninsula (pre-7th century BCE) and follows the history of Rome through until about 44 BC, near the fall of the Republic. (Note: This class does not include the Empire!) It is a brilliant course. Really. Professor Johnston is a fantastic teacher. I learned so much about ancient history, and not just names and dates-- more like how to think about people and culture. Definitely recommend this course, but it's a lot of work.",
    "Roman Republic was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale! I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to another student. Professor Johnston is great: he is a very engaging lecturer and is also very accessible (I have been in some lectures where the professor would probably not even recognize me, but Prof. Johnston knew everyone and encouraged us to come to him with any questions we had). The course does have a fair amount of work, but not more so than any other class, and the amount that you learn both in class and in the readings is really amazing. The class consists basically of two ten page papers, a midterm and a final, along with weekly quizzes in section (which are actually quite helpful as they force you to review the lectures from the week and prepare you well for the exams). So if you have any interest at all in learning about Romans, you should DEFINITELY take this class, or find another class that Professor Johnston is teaching.",
    "yes yes yes yes yes yes yes YOU MUST",
    "Only if you are interested in Roman history. I've personally taken history classes about places in which I found out halfway through the semester that I didn't really care for. It didn't happen here and Prof Johnston's solid lectures and enthusiasm about the topic definitely helped in that regard.",
    "The course is a good overview of the history of the Roman Republic. In terms of workload there are both positives and negatives. On the negative side, you must write two papers on top of a midterm and a final; the timingis such that the papers are due around the time of the two exams, so a lot of the coursework happens at the same time. Plus, you have to take a quiz in section each week (just IDs), which helps later when it comes to studying for the exam (you won't have to study all that much) but is a pain at the time. However, it is completely possible to not read any of the material assigned in this class, since all discussions and the exams are based entirely on the lectures.I wish that Professor Johnston had spent more time on the more popular figures in Roman history. Spartacus got about two sentences worth of attention, and the Civil War was crammed at the end of the semester. Further, I would have appreciated hearing more about the battles (and strategies) in the Second Peloponnesian War, which are fascinating. Instead, Professor Johnston spent a great deal of time on archeological discoveries, which were interesting at first but I would have sacrificed in favor of some more attention to famous Roman moments.However, the class was enjoyable and worth taking if you're interested at all in Roman history or the Classics. You can write your papers on whatever you choose, so that's the real chance to delve into something interesting that the professor does not cover.",
    "If you are interested in the material, definitely.",
    "You should take this class, even if you're only sort of interested in the Roman Republic, because you will learn a lot from an excellent professor. Lectures were enjoyable and informative, the workload was reasonable, and Professor Johnston will help you research an interesting paper. There are weekly quizzes in section, but I found that this meant I had to study less for the final and midterm. Overall, one of the best courses I've taken here.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, and I think it's well summarized above.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in ancient history or classics. This is a subject that is often neglected at the high school level, and I recommend taking advantage of this class at Yale.",
    "The Roman Republic is one of those courses that you must take before graduating from Yale. I enjoyed tracing Roman history from its humble origins along the Tiber River through its growth as a Mediterranean power epitomized by its defeat of Carthage and ending with its slow decline in the second and first century B.C. with the Gracchi, Marius and Sulla, and the triumvirate (Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus) being some of the key players.During the course, we examined primary source material (i.e. pictures of archaeological sights in Italy, the writings of Roman historians and poets, etc.) as we listened to engaging lectures with a wealth of material on the subject matter. We also took a field trip to the Yale Roman Coin collection and had an opportunity to examine and touch ancient Roman coinage. Furthermore, Professor Johnston is an excellent teacher who made his lectures informative and engaging.With that being said, I would advise that you take this course if everything said above interests you. If you are unsure if you would find Roman history engaging, then I would suggest shopping the class to see if you would like it. The reading load for the course is rather great and may pose a problem if the material doesn't interest you.Lastly, the workload outside of the readings is good. We had quizzes every week,2 ten page papers, a midterm, and a final. With the vast amount of information available for Roman history the papers will go by fairly quickly. The key is to make sure you start early and go to the Professor or the TA for help with planning or finding material (trust me, they were extremely helpful)! As a final note, check the syllabus to make sure nothing has changed since I took the course."
