    "How to use econometrics models to evaluate data and make conclusions",
    "learning about math behind OLS, GLS, endogeneity, instrumental variables, bias in regressions, causality, randomized control experiment, diff-in-diff, RD, etc. all the stuff you need to know to do research!",
    "I got an overview of econometric techniques. You also get practice working with data and using R.",
    "How to process data and design a model for interpreting data",
    "Wide array of econometric strategies, with an introduction to theory in the first half and experimental strategies in the second half.",
    "I learnt how to analyse data and apply R to solve problems in econometrics.",
    "You learn many different methods of regression and data analysis like OLS, GLS, Diff in Diff, Panel Data, etc. You practice both theoretical and empirical work.",
    "This course provided a thorough overview of econometric techniques that was very informative in framing much of the other economics related work I have done and will continue to do moving forward.",
    "I got better at coding in R, learned how to conduct basic empirical work, and understood regression and causality at a more fundamental level.",
    "The course begins with a deep dive into the theoretical infrastructure of econometric methods (some proofs involved, though not difficult), and it later develops a more applied focus with discussion of RCTs and quasi-experimental methods (with data analysis in R or Stata -- your choice). Introductory, though thorough, and you'll have broad exposure to all the main econometric techniques.",
    "I learned about the theory OLS regressions in different scenarios (time series, heteroskedasticity, etc) I've become better at deriving mathematical formulas and using R.",
    "Covering from OLS regressions to dynamic models. Not just the theories but also a bit of theory proof when applicable and understandable.",
    "Metrics",
    "This class went way more in depth on the concept and use of regressions than its prerequisite. You really learn how to use different regressions for different situations. Overall, the things you learn in this class and the skills you develop are some of the most useful for any type of work you may be doing that involves analyzing any type of data.",
    "To think about statistical inference in a more rigorous way. Quasiexperimental methods. Bias and consistency. Measurement error. Dynamic processes, generalized least squares. I feel confident making a simple hypothesis and testing it in the data."

   "comments": [
    "Prof went very quick High learning curve",
    "Its math-heavy, even though its ECON 123 and not 135. It can seem daunting and intimidating, but Costas is the most patient and understanding prof youll likely ever have. This is definitely a difficult course, but youll probably have to take it if you want to write a thesis, and regardless, its one that youll be happy to have gone through. Note that there is a lot of homework through. Weekly problem sets, projects, and a midterm.",
    "Strength: the professor and TF are always available to help Room for improvement: it was hard to have projects and homework at the same time while also preparing for an exam",
    "I found the course material hard to understand",
    "Very well taught this semester, although some more theoretical work could have been interesting (especially regarding asymptotics - CLT and LLN were introduced rather cursory).",
    "A strength was that the TA was very helpful at office hours and section but the course just had one TA and maybe two TAs would have worked better.",
    "lectures were very unbearable. Costas speaks by just using his slides as the backdrop, so at time this can make it harder to follow the lecture. The times that he woud write stuff out were the clearest lectures.",
    "Costas was the strength of the course. He is very passionate and engaged with the work and shared his own empirical work as examples. He really wanted us to learn but the theoretical material is sometimes so hard that in class we have no idea what is going on.",
    "Overall, the course was very well designed. The modules were well contained in their respective slide decks, and the revision sheets were critically important as a study tool. I wish there was a lecture or two that did more to synthesize the various topics in the course both at the middle and a more thorough one than we were able to do at the end. This way, the various concepts would make more immediate sense, and make acquisition of new material less convoluted.",
    "Strengths: Kostas and the TF Lucas. Both were amazing. Kostas is one of those professors who you can tell really really cares. He's always willing to engage with you in class or out. Same with Lucas. He was amazingly helpful for making the empirical assignments less vague and simplifying the sometimes complicated stuff we learned in class. Weaknesses: Assignments were really vague sometimes, but I guess this could also be justified by empirical work being messy in real life. Wish there was more clarity here. Also, a lot of focus on derivations which were hard to follow sometimes. Usually don't have to know these. Wish more intuition was provided on them.",
    "This class provides an excellent meshing of theory and data analysis, and the class' structure was refreshing: every new concept builds upon prior knowledge, leading to a very deep understanding of complex models. It is fast-paced, but the instructor is adaptable to the students' needs and level of understanding. There are a lot of assignments -- weekly problem sets, two projects, a midterm, and a final --, and, although useful, the volume of work was slightly overwhelming at times.",
    "The course was very receptive to feedback. Further, the lecture slides were clear to understand. The weakness of the course is that help wasn't always available, and if so, at times that may have been inconvenient to some students. I would consider putting more emphasis on where those times are offered.",
    "I think the course is very difficult, and that is just the nature of the course. It is still an evolving course, and I think what could help is by having guidelines made more clear, especially for the two large projects. The subjects are hard, but the teaching helped us all get through it.",
    "Strengths: We go much deeper in the theory behind methods like OLS and quasi-experimental methods, which I found very interesting. Costas is also very accommodating as a professor -- I met with him many times outside of office hours to ask questions about projects and other things. Also, because the class was smaller, it felt much more collaborative than ECON 117, which I appreciated. Weaknesses: We need more than 1 TA. Lucas was amazing, but I think it's necessary to have more office hours and just more help in general, which one grad student can't do by himself. Sometimes the workload felt a little overwhelming, especially when we had projects and psets at the same time, but it was overall manageable.",
    "I feel like I almost never received feedback on my work, and this was mainly because Canvas only allowed you to see the instructor's comments if you submitted a PDF, which I rarely ever did. Also, I could almost never follow along in class because the lecture slides were so dense, and it was nearly impossible to pay attention to both the slides and what the professor would be saying. The class would be much better if the lecture slides were clearer, had less typos, and were easier to follow.",
    "Strengths: Costas is a very good teacher. Weaknesses: the problem sets came fast and furious at times. (A problem when you need help to complete them.) The slides were a bit more dense than what Costas said in class at first, but following the feedback process, he went through the math he introduced, which was nice."

   "comments": [
    "Only take this course if you need to; even if you're interested in Econometrics \/ data analytics, there are probably more suitable courses in the Stats department for you. As amazing Costas is as a person and academic support, he will really push your boundaries and make the class (psets in particular) a lot more difficult than they need to be. That being said, the content should be useful for writing a senior thesis, but only take this class if you plan on writing one!",
    "Costas was a good instructor. Learned a lot from him and his lecture slides. You're probably taking this course because you want either distinction in the major or to write a thesis. Either way, I enjoyed my time in this class.",
    "Yes but be prepared to work hard",
    "Youll probably have to take it to write a thesis. Or if you want to do econ research... either way, its kind of a necessity, but Id still recommend it. You learn really applicable and useful skills that everyone studying Econ should know!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone seeking further econometric knowledge.",
    "I think that the level of difficulty would make it a very hard class for most students at Yale",
    "Fantastic course and very well taught. Interesting for anybody who wants to continue their study in applied statistics.",
    "If you have to for the thesis. Otherwise no.",
    "Recommended only if you need it to write your thesis or for a requirement!",
    "I would recommend this course if you are ready for a lot of math! It goes a lot into derivation of formulas and I wasn't expecting this from an ECON course, but I was really happy that I took it because I personally found it useful.",
    "If you are writing the Econ essay, take this class if it's taught by Costas.",
    "Yes. If you're considering ECON 123, you're probably considering writing a thesis since it's not a required class. I found the material really hard in the beginning. There were so many derivations and we focused a lot on theory without examples. However, as time went on, you really appreciate having such a deeper understanding of these things. I feel like I could actually understand an econometric paper well. Also, none of the midterms or final really tested the theoretical stuff on a derivation level. The tests were actually really fair and more applied. One knock is that the homework assignments are vague and you often struggle on the lack of clarity, but (1) the TF Lucas was always ready to help, (2) the class is small (around 20 people) so it's a pretty good support system, and (3) real life empirical work is messy so you learn how to deal with real life stuff. Ultimately, Kostas shows he really cares for you. He tries his best to get you to engage in class and out in a non-intimidating way. One of the best and kindest professors I've encountered at Yale.",
    "It's a great class if you really enjoy econometrics and causal inference and are willing to put in the time.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It gives the proper foundations to interpretation advanced data through R.",
    "I think that if you are up for a challenge in the econ major, this is the class to take. The class is almost enjoyably difficult, and I felt that I learned a lot that I believe will be applicable to future research. The subject is challenging, but with the right teaching it is manageable and enjoyable.",
    "I personally think metrics is the most interesting part of economics, so I enjoyed this class (more in hindsight than in the actual thick of things haha). Grading was very fair, Costas and Lucas was great, and some of the projects we did (diving into a data set and exploring it on our own, for example) were very rewarding. Pro tip: brush up on your R or Stata skills!! You will need them for almost every pset and certainly for the projects.",
    "Yes if you want to be able to detect trends and analyze data when you are given a data set. This is a really useful skill, and this course definitely helps you to develop it. However, you may be able to find some Stats classes which also may teach you these skills but even better. If you can get credit for your major from this class, then it might still be worth it depending on how hard you are willing to work and the kind of skills you want to develop.",
    "Yes, if they're interested in econometric research."
