    "I know now much more of the analysis used in observational astronomy, especially how calibrations are done.",
    "Learned how to use the telescope at the LFOP and how to perform basic spectroscopy.",
    "I learned the basics of astronomical observing.",
    "Astronomy 155 was very helpful in developing practical observing skills for optical astronomy and understanding how a lot of the processes involved in capturing an image work. It also provided a base knowledge of astronomy and many of the labs were quite fun and rewarding.",
    "Using a telescope and imaging equipment",
    "I learned how to understand the basic techniques of amateur astronomy. It is incredibly rewarding to know how to use the fundamental tools of physics to demystify the vast expanse of the universe."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures were clear and useful. It was very difficult to judge what was wanted in the lab reports. We had one rough outline on where to put data, results, etc. but most labs never told us how they wanted us to report things like uncertainty. Points were often taken off when we didn't use the desired method. Sometimes many points were taken off with few-no negative comments written on reports, and I would be confused where the errors were and how tp correct them.",
    "It felt like a lot of concepts weren't explained. I learned a lot by kind of being thrown under the bus and having to figure things out as we observed. That style of learning worked for me, but others hated it. Background in astronomy is really important-this class would be pretty difficult without any knowledge on the subject coming in.",
    "Prof. Faison could be more accommodating for the observing schedule. Overall the class covers a lot of basic astro techniques which is good. Class could've been held on main campus rather than the observatory. Also, lab report feedback was poor and came too late for us to implement on our next report.",
    "It was a fine class, but I wish there was a clearer rubric for grading the labs. The score I would get on each, good or bad, was always a mystery.",
    "This course was interesting and could be a lot of fun at times, but it was extremely unclear what the expectations were for lab reports. There seems to have been a lot of inconsistency between the expectations laid out by the professor and the way that the teaching assistant would grade the reports. For example, the professor provided a template with specific things to address in reports, but the teaching assistant would sometimes deduct points for things that did not appear on that template. Additionally, the teaching assistant would return assignments very sparsely and quite late in the semester. This made it difficult to understand expectations on assignments, since there was little feedback until about mid November. It would have been very helpful to have clear and consistent expectations from the beginning! Ongoing feedback would also have changed the course significantly!",
    "Not enough structure and always a little bit unclear on what exactly should be included in the lab reports",
    "Strength of the course is the way in which we were able to have essentially full control over our labs and the telescope. This allowed us to learn the material independently and remember how to operate these techniques when the course finished. Weakness of the course was the timing of the lectures. There was no need to schedule the lecture in the evening at the observatory, since we never really engaged any hands-on demonstration with the lab equipment (except for the software tutorials). I would have also enjoyed more of the videos, which were useful for reviewing the material covered in the first few lectures.",
    "It takes up much more time than one might expect for a half credit. Going up to the telescope can be a pain not only because of the trek but also because of the nightmare-like sign-up process.",
    "The course bills itself as a chance to learn about astronomy at an introductory, non-major level, which implies it will be accessible and geared towards making students interested in astronomy. It wasn't. It consistently felt more like a course in lab technology than in astronomy. Would have been more fun if we were learning about the stars, and WHAT we were observing rather than observation itself."

   "comments": [
    "It's a fine class. The lectures are well-taught and the ideas behind the labs are very cool. Learning how and taking data through the 16-inch telescope is awesome! But there's a bit of guesswork in the reports. Also, take into account the time it takes multiple nights a week (often around midnight,) when you'll be trudging up and down science hill (way past all of the other buildings) to the observatory.",
    "Yes, this course was difficult as we were struggling through it, but now, I am so glad that I took it. I feel like I got a peek into I took it Credit-D and that was the best. The lab reports are tricky and Credit-D relieved a lot of that stress.",
    "Low key take a ton of time for a half credit. Be careful.",
    "Do not take this course!! It takes way to much work and is graded much harsher than expected",
    "Sure. It's a fun lab, way better than physics lab.",
    "Great class; a very unique gem at Yale that allows you to explore astronomy and use equipment you'll never have access to again unless you become an astronomer. Only 6 lab reports, which aren't too bad if you've taken a lab before.",
    "If you are interested in the material take this course, but it is not a gut. There was not an unfair amount of work, but certainly more than I was expecting.",
    "This course is very rewarding, though it is quite a bit of work for only half a credit. If you are a non-major interested in doing some astronomy and want a hands-on way to learn, this course is great, but requires some legwork. If you are an astronomy major, this course can sneak up on you with the workload!",
    "You don't learn much but it is cool to use the telescopes for imaging and observations.",
    "Great class for anyone interested in amateur astronomy. This class definitely taught me skills that I will utilize in the future for fun.",
    "Beware - this class will take up a lot of time and only counts as half a credit",
    "Probably not I REALLY like Professor Faison, he's great, but the course itself felt like it was a burden on him as well as on the students."
