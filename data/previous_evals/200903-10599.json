    "I would recommend French 893 to another student: it's a good entry into the literature and to the criticism around it.",

    "I would definitely recommend the class: to anyone interested in the period and in the genre - and more broadly, to anyone interested in theory and the way it builds critical notions.",
    "This is a course that looks at literary realism within its wider context, how it emerged within a 'realist' society and culture. I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Great course not only for learning about 19th century Realism, but also 19th century cultural history in France."

    "Essential to deepening my knowledge of the canon.",
    "I feel that this course is invaluable to anyone studying French literature.",
    "I want to focus on French 19th century so the class fitted perfectly in my research. Also it gave memore solid foundations in theory: through \"realism\" seen as an \"critical issue\", we have studied many different critical approaches - and major critics - , traced their evolution and know more about the \"state of the art\" in the field.Great course."
