   "comments": [
    "I gained a nuanced understanding of, and appreciation for, Japan from the Meiji period up to present day. I learned to analyze the nation's development through three lenses (but arguably the institutional framework stuck with me the most). I learned how to navigate competing causal arguments and elicit the correct one over the others, and why that was in fact the case.",
    "I learned a lot about Japan, and I also learned how to prioritize readings to better understand the course as a whole.",
    "I had never taken a course that dealt specifically with Japan\/East Asia, and it was a great opportunity to learn about its culture and politics.",
    "Learned a lot about an area of the world I had previously no experience with.",
    "I learned a lot about Japan and comparative politics in general.",
    "This course offers a holistic yet incisive understanding of Japan and its international relations. The readings are intellectually engaging, and the discussions with Professor Rosenbluth and other classmates provided an in-depth understanding and analysis of Japan, its historical development to its current state and prospects of its future development. It also allowed an insight to factors that shape Japan's foreign policy choices and how they play into Japan's international relations today.",
    "I learned a solid amount of modern Japanese history and politics! Really amazing content every class, and I now know about a wide range of issues in Japan today. In addition, I learned how to think through arguments from a more traditional Political Science point of view, something I didn't expect coming into the seminar.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of the development of modern Japan, and also about the intersection between domestic and foreign policy, as well as between politics and economics. I gained a greater appreciation for political science and how it could be used to analyze various trends and issues.",
    "Knowledge of Japan's political economy, and culture. I also developed skills of evaluating arguments in political science and writing research papers.",
    "Great overview and analysis of Japan in many facets: politics, economics, cultural, etc.",
    "I gained an understanding of Japan's role in Asian and global geopolitics, as well as its shifting relationship with the United States."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is strong in that you don't need a lot of background knowledge to feel like you're productively learning and to regularly contribute meaningfully to discussion. Also, the major themes return frequently enough for the major takeaways to be remembered well. However, the low barrier of entry allows for dominance by those who either are (in actuality) or perceived to be the most authoritative on the subject.",
    "I love the format of the assignments- a policy memo, a history paper, and a final paper. However, I found the final paper quite daunting. I also love how Prof. Rosenbluth guided our reading every week and was very helpful in explaining the material. The courseload was not overwhelming, and I felt like I was learning a lot in a meaningful way. She was also very accessible outside of the classroom, which I greatly appreciate.",
    "Really comprehensive overview of Japan, but never too in-depth, which I liked because it enabled us to see a lot of trend and connections that we probably couldn't have if we had dug any deeper into any one issue.",
    "The readings were very intellectually engaging, and the suggested readings were also greatly interesting. Professor Rosenbluth was fantastic in merging the different arguments of the reading and explaining the foreign policies of Japan, while leading productive discussion among students which were greatly insightful as well.",
    "Excellent class overall! I thought each seminar was well thought through, Professor Rosenbluth's expertise is evident in every class, and the guest speakers were interesting as well.",
    "This course is an excellent survey to modern Japan and its foreign policy; however, I dont think there was much incentive to apply the material from the readings to class discussions. Thus, although the class discussions were interesting and thought-provoking, didnt really feel like I dug deeply into any topic that we covered.",
    "Professor Rosenbluth is a real expert in Japan's political economy, so her understanding of Japan was very enlightening. The course as a whole is quite structured and the assignments were fair. As for weakness, the readings could have been more engaging.",
    "Strengths: professor's lecture style and expertise, interesting additional guest lectures, discussion of current events Weakness: readings can be lengthy and not all readings are discussed but professor Rosenbluth highlights which readings are most important",
    "Prof Rosenbluth was phenomenal, and the subject matter is not often presented in classes not explicitly about Japan. The readings could have been more organized, though."

   "comments": [
    "If you have even the slightest interest in Japan, take the course. If you feel like you need to know more about a nation that isn't the United States, start here! Professor Rosenbluth does a good job of appealing to students of all levels (with regards to their knowledge of Japan). It is not an intimidating seminar. Everyone will find their place. Rosenbluth is also frequently willing and able to offer her help. She is a great resource to prepare for the course's writing assignments, sometimes to the point where she will make explicit suggestions for topics (if you come to her with ideas), and reward you for listening to her, if you execute well.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The workload is not heavy, and Prof. Rosenbluth does a good job at explaining the material. There are also no tests, so you feel much more engaged and relaxed. There is only a 2 page policy memo, a 3 page history paper, and a 10 page final paper, so that's nice, too. Rosenbluth is an angel, and she will make sure you don't feel lost or intimidated, even if you know nothing about Japan when you first enroll (she actually prefers it that way).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Rosenbluth did a great job of making the material easy to understand, and created a friendly environment in class where people felt they could ask any questions.",
    "If someone is really interested in Japan, yes. As someone who was perhaps less interested in the specific country and more interested in the region, it was occasionally not engaging for me.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Professor Rosenbluth really knows her stuff and provides a comprehensive look at modern Japanese politics.",
    "Take this course! It will offer a holistic yet incisive understanding of Japan and its international relations. The readings are intellectually engaging and the assignments are very reasonable. Professor Rosenbluth is a fantastic seminar leader and genuinely cares for the students, making sure everyone understands the material and providing assistance and advice for assignments. One of my favorite courses here at Yale!",
    "Yes. Great course.",
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in Japan, this is an amazing course. Professor Rosenbluth is so wonderful (she brings snacks every class) but she's also one of the most well-respected scholars in the field. You'll learn a ton in the seminars, and I would definitely go to her office hours as well. I learned a solid amount of modern Japanese history and politics, but you'll also learn how to think through arguments from a more traditional Political Science point of view - pretty rare for a PLSC course. A really great class in which to write a one semester senior essay.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in an overview of Japan, East Asia, and American foreign policy. I feel much more interested in every aspect of Japan that we covered in the course, but I think it needs to be supplemented by another course that goes into greater detail.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students interested in learning about the political and economic history of another country. I walked in with very minimal knowledge on Japan but Professor Rosenbluth did a great job of making the material accessible and helping everyone get on the same footing. The discussions aren't always heavily reliant on the readings, which I personally didn't mind, and it's overall a pretty relaxed seminar.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, mainly because Professor Rosenbluth's expertise and patience.",
    "Yes, the payoff of this course is just as much as you are willing to put in",
    "Absolutely recommend. Rosenbluth is brilliant and an expert in Japan -- this is the class to take if you want to explore it further or for the first time (like I did)."
