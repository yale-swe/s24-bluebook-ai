   "comments": [
    "More interesting than expected for a lab.",
    "Chem 119 is a good lab course, very easy, but does supplement the class very well. A lot of the concepts that are a bit unclear from class are demonstrated well in lab. The grading is also quite light, just be aware that the quizzes are worth 40% of your grade and can easily destroy you",
    "It's a typical 4 hour lab. The time commitment isprobably the only thing remotely difficult about the course. Lab reports are easy and often one must only do the results& calculations section. There were relevant experiments, a helpful professor and TA's, and no practical. I would base your decision on which chem class you take not on the lab accompaniment but the class itself. However, it's worth noting that this lab isn't actually burdensome in a meaningful way.",
    "Pretty painless, often even enjoyable gen chem lab. Definitely recommend for pre-med reqs.",
    "If you are taking Chemistry 118, then Chemistry 119L is a requirement, so you don't have much of a choice. However, from what I've heard about the other General Chemistry labs, this one is the best because you rarely have full lab reports, and there was no final this semester. I feel like I learned a lot, and it was a good supplement to Chem 118. I probably wouldn't just take it for fun, but since you have to anyway, it's a good course. Studying a little for the lab quizzes outside of just reading the manual really helps with the quizzes which count for a large part of the grade.",
    "Chem 119 is a helpful lab course and ties in well with Chem 118. Being not a big fan of lab, I'm not sure I would recommend it, but of the labs, it may be the best there is.",
    "This course is great for someone who would like to build on their high school chemistry laboratory skills. The weekly quizzes reinforce concepts included throughout the lab as well as drive people to read the lab quizzes before the actual block. This allows for a more efficient lab session. I would recommend this course because it covers crucial concepts for the foundation of chemistry in the form of quite creative labs.",
    "This lab class is mandatory along with chemistry 118, so there's no getting around the work that comes with it. The labs are pretty basic and straightforward, but they can be tedious and doing the lab reports takes a lot of time. The saying for labs as \"half the credit, twice the work\" really becomes apparent with this class. However, if you work meticulously in the lab and come prepared, it is fairly easy to do well.",
    "I took this lab because it was required for chem 118. A lot of work and a big time commitment. I would recommend it as an intro lab class.",
    "This is the class that usually is paired with Chem118. Labs are always time-consuming (they take 4 hours and the post-labs are long), but this one was okay! The post-labs were long and arduous yes, but the time in the lab was pretty low key! Dr. Parr is very chill, but he also will take the time to answer all your questions if you ask them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Not because we're doing groundbreaking lab work, but because it's fun. Professor Parr is amazing, and you get to bond with your chem class. The TA's are generally really good. Study up for the quizzes! They're worth 40% of your grade!",
    "- Pay attention to detail on the lab quizzes- Other than that, pretty easy and helpful lab courseI would recommend it, but seeing as it is required with Chem 118, I'm not sure if this question applies.",
    "I would summarize CHEM 199L as a useless lab. I would not recommend it to another student unless they had to take it. It has no real application nor is interesting during the four hours each week.",
    "Chem 119 is a lab class that explores the foundation concepts of general chemistry, and it is helpful in better understanding certain topics touched upon in lecture. It is a co-requisite for Chem 118, but even so, I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Good first lab course.",
    "A course you should only take if you have to. It says mandatory for 118 but I know someone who took 118 without 119. If you can, and you don't need this as a prerec, just do that. It is an annoying, but straightforward and easy time-sink.",
    "Yes. Take CHEM 119L if you need to fulfill a chem lab requirement. The class itself is quite a good, it's just that the labs themselves are tedious and take a large chunk of your day. Most of the labs took 3.5+ hours. A positive is that most labs writeups only require data and calculations.",
    "Chem 119L is a comprehensive introductory lab course. You will become familiar with basic lab equipment and techniques, and will further explore some of the topics covered in Chem 118.As for whether I would recommend Chem 119L to other students, that question is inextricably tied to the question of whether I would recommend Chem 118 to other students (as 119L is a required for students taking 118). I don't feel that I can fairly answer this question without showing a bias based on my experience in Chem 118.",
    "This lab is a good pairing with Chem 118 and will teach you many good, basic, useful lab techniques.",
    "Pretty standard gen chem lab stuff. I had a great time, but I think your experience depends a lot on who you're professor and TA are since you spend so much time interacting with the people around you.",
    "CHEM 119L is definitely a great lab to take. We don't have to write full lab write-ups every week (we only wrote maybe 2-3 full labs) and there's no lab final at the end (unlike all the other freshman chem labs). There are weekly quizzes but they're not too bad. The TA's are all really great at helping you through the lab.",
    "I feel neutral towards it. It's the first lab I've ever taken and it made me realize that I don't like being in the lab at all but that's just my attitude towards the environment as a whole. There was nothing wrong with the class.",
    "I definitely recommend Chemistry 119L over other General Chemistry labs. The lab reports and quizzes are very straightforward and many of the labs have pretty cool objectives! There is no final for this lab as well.",
    "It's a requirement that can sometimes be annoying, but the grading is nice.",
    "The lab class itself is almost identical to the other general chemistry lab courses. It goes from very simple labs to somewhat more complicated labs nicely, and if you're taking this be prepared to do lots of titrations. Jonathan Parr is awesome. He's great at explaining what's going on in the lab very quickly and simply, and he goes over all needed explanation and calculation before the lab actually starts. Very approachable during the lab itself if you have any questions and always gives you a lot of explanation.",
    "Chem 119L is pretty much what you would expect from a Lab course. Although the corresponding lecture, Chem 118, is an accelerated class, this lab component does not seem too accelerated and doesn't feel any harder than any other lab class would be. However, due to its long duration and possibility to conflict with other people' schedules, I would only recommend if you really like chemistry and research, or if it is required.",
    "Lab lecture followed by a short quiz, and then off to do the experiment. None of it is terribly taxing, though it's tedious because some experiments take the entire four hours. It's a lab credit for premeds\/science majors.",
    "Yes! Excellent lab.",
    "Dr. Parr explained concepts and summarized each lab very clearly and with precision. Very enthusiastic to help individual students. Sassy, witty, very knowledgeable.",
    "Even though the lab is painful, it is worth taking just to complete lab requirements. Do not procrastinate on lab reports and do not get on Dr. Parr's bad side.",
    "It's not fun. Take it if you have to, but spend a long time asking yourself if you really have to.",
    "Chem 119L is a laboratory course designed to equip students with basic lab technique. The course is doable, but it assumes a strong grasp of high-school\/ AP Chemistry. Additionally, this course stresses accuracy more than other lab classes. However, with sufficient time investment before each class (reading over and understanding calculations next experiment), this course manageable.",
    "Really great introductory lab, and it's required for 118!Dr. Parr is a pleasure... very witty and funny, but also constructive, and helps you become a better experimenter over the course of the semester.",
    "Take it if you have to. As far as gen chem labs go, this is ok. The only work is the lab reports but they can take a while if you do them right.",
    "Compared to the other offerings for introductory chemistry labs, CHEM 119L is the ideal course to take. Experiments are interesting (but not too challenging), and Dr. Parr is both helpful and witty. Lab reports are not terribly time consuming, though lab quizzes can be more difficult.",
    "Chemistry 119L is basically just a general chemistry lab and what you would expect of one. The experiments were sometimes tedious and rather long, but they were useful in learning the lab techniques. Also, for the time commitment, the class should definitely be worth a full credit, since it takes up more time than a lot of full credit classes.",
    "For someone that has never entered a lab before, it is a good introduction to lab techniques. The experiments were helpful for my general chem course. Be prepared for the quizzes, they are easy but have little room for error and are worth almost half your grade.",
    "Overall, though Professor Parr is snarky and fun, I did not enjoy the chem119 lab because I didn't feel like I learned very much. A lot of the time, the extent of disagreement between theoretical and experimental results, or just lack of noteworthy results altogether, defeated the purpose of lab, which is to supplement our conceptual understanding. That might just be the nature of chemistry labs in general, though, and the lab is required with chem118 regardless of whether or not I would recommend it.",
    "Chem 119L is a comprehensive general lab course to go along with Chem 118. I sould recommend this course to anyone considering majoring in the sciences or going premed, but it is only a half credit and still requires as much work as a challenging full credit course so I would keep that in mind.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot of chemistry, protocol in the lab, and feel very comfortable there now. It was a good way to get back into labs.",
    "Avoid this class at all costs. It is required when taking Chem 118, but try to take the Orgo lab instead. This class is an embarrassment to the University. If you want to dread 6 hours of your week going to and typing these labs then this class is for you. If you want a lab in which you'll actually learn something and enjoy doing it, then take another lab.",
    "Get over the fact that Parr will essentially ignore you if you don't ask questions. Ask questions. And do well. He's not very forgiving. If you can do that, you'll be fine.",
    "You're only going to take this class because you have to, but if you have to take a lab, this is not a bad one to take.",
    "You have to take this class for the 118 course anyways. Its a good lab class. Just do your lab reports on time.",
    "Yes, take it if you have to. Very straightforward and Professor Parr is absolutely fantastic.",
    "This lab has experiments of varying difficulty, but I always found the lab reports manageable and the concepts clear and helpful for a gen chem class.",
    "CHEM 119L is a good lab to take if you have to take a Chem lab. Definitely take it with Dr. Parr, he's the best.",
    "I would recommend it! It is a lot of work, but it's required if you're taking Chem 118. Lab reports are a lot of work, so don't start them at the last minute. Pre-lab quizzes are a pain, so do make sure that you go over the lab in advance! It'll make everything run a lot more smoothly in lab.",
    "In comparison to the comments I've heard from friends in other intro lab courses, Chem 119L is one of the best to learn standard lab procedures. Highly recommended.",
    "Great chemistry lab. Not very difficult procedures and very helpful and understanding TA's. Dr. Parr is a boss and the lab is actually pretty fun. Take it.",
    "Take it because you have to. It's kind of tedious as I assume most labs are. The good thing is Parr rarely makes you submit a full lab report. The quizzes aren't too bad but the reports can be annoying.",
    "A lab course that keeps pace with the topics of Chemistry 118. I would, it's definitely a good refresher for those that haven't been in the lab for a while.",
    "Almost all of the students taking this class are probably taking it because they have to for a major or for pre-med or something. However I would say if you have a choice I would probably recommend against this course because while it was by no means awful, it was a lot of work for half a credit, and I do not feel as though I learned a lot about chemistry. I do believe that my lab skills have improved a decent amount but I did not find the class particularly interesting or inspiring in such a way that I would recommend that another student take this class if they don't have to."
