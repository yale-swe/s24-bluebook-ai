   "comments": [
    "I've learned more applicable finance in this course than all others combined here at Yale.",
    "I learned about corporate finance and private equity in this course, but it wasn't as great as people before me said. It was pretty poorly-taught and the textbook was very confusing and was rambling on. The explanations weren't that clear and the cases forced you to do it in the dark without really learning the concepts that you should use to apply to the case. It was a lot of work but mainly because students didn't know what they were doing. Schmertzler wasn't much help and just rambled without giving descriptions and helping students understand the concept.",
    "One learns a lot about modeling, investment framework, and common themes in private equity business. The most important thing you get out of this class is the private equity lexicon which will help you with your interviews as well as future job. You also learn the failures of private equity business which is most often not out there for one to see.",
    "This course allowed me to refresh my modeling skills and taught me about the priorities of private equity investors. I feel that I have a much better idea of what inverstors think about when making decisions.",
    "I learned so many things, it's impractical to write them all in this textbox. But, to name a few, I learned how the private equity market works, which are the generic big players that participate in PE deals, how they work, and what are their incentives (for example, we delved into the economics of lending, and into understanding the termsheets lawyers use). I also learned the mechanics of leveraged buyouts, leveraged recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions, growth and venture capital investments. This knowledge also came together with its corresponding skills, such as negotiation, leadership and modeling, because throughout the course we solved many practical cases in which we applied what we learned.",
    "I loved this class because I finally learned things that would be useful to me after college. the class was taught by a professor who is also a business man and it put an entirely different spin on the entire class. I highly recommend the class"

    "The class follows an inscrutable textbook. If you do not start one you hit the ground, you will never catch up. The material workload is a lot and not intuitive. The classroom is not nurturing at all. You need know your stuff and be able to defend it once Schmertzler starts grilling you. It can intimidating and quite frankly the most stressing class at Yale. If you do the work, you'll get skills out of the class. These are tangible skills, unlike any what you find in a typical Yale class.",
    "The course is a tremendous amount of work, which is particularly difficult when you don't know exactly how to do the task at hand. You can learn a great deal by floundering and then discovering the insight, but this does not always occur, and when it does, it tends to require an all-nighter. This class could be improved by providing the students with feedback on their work and with the answers to the cases once they are finished, as well as a reduction of the workload.",
    "The professor is an amazing human being, a very intelligent and ethical person, as well as an extraordinary teacher. The textbook is written by himself and he knows it like the back of his hand. And he has designed the course in such a way that we learn by doing mistakes, as in real life: almost every class we have at least one practical case in which we apply what we have learned. I can't think of anything to improve.",
    "More structure to the way it it taught. Not as ambiguous about what is and is not graded"

    "Take it if you are Type A person. If you are relaxed about it, Schmertzler will shake your confidence as well as your dignity.",
    "In most circumstances, I would not recommend this class to other students. While it can be a phenomenal way to learn more about the industry if you are able to truly engage with the material and devote hours and hours to reading the chapters and working through the cases, the course is enough work to force a weekly all-nighter and adversely affect your ability to complete your work for other courses. If you cannot model, you should not take this class, or you will be overly dependent on other people in your groups and will likely not be able to add value at times. Unless you hve a very light semester and are sure you're interested in finance, with previous exposure to financial services through internships, do not take this class. If you do meet all those criteria, you have still been warned.",
    "Yes!!! Take this course. Prof. Schmertzler is a wonderful human being and a fantastic teacher. This course is the sort of material that will give you the practical tools you'll need to get into this very competed workfield.",
    "Yes absolutely! Best course I ever taken at Yale",
    "Best course at Yale in the Econ department",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in the material and willing to put the time into the class. The class takes a lot of work, but is entirely worth it if you're willing to put the time in. If you're not willing to put the time in each and every week, Schmertzler will know, and will not hesitate to call you out. I absolutely love the class and learned so so so much."
