    "No. Boring.",
    "This class started with studying Alexander the Great and continued down through Hellenistic history to Cleopatra. It was a great course!",
    "lots of funinteresting subjectnot much workcool readings",
    "I would recommend it. A series of very interesting topics in Hellenistic history. It's not quite as much about Alexander as the course description would lead you to believe, but that opens up lots of time for great topics like the Ptolemies, Seleucids, rise of Rome, etc. Overall a bit scattered but always interesting. I took the class as a non-writing credit, which made the workload extremely manageable.",
    "Pretty interesting material (some notable slow parts though). Don't really have to do a whole lot of the reading if you pay attention in class. Overall a pretty easy class but not trivial.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to other students. You have a reasonable amount of reading, lectures are always really interesting and engaging. ProfessorManning is wonderful!",
    "Ray was an awesome TA, and clearly knows an incredible amount about Hellenistic history",
    "Good way to get a non-Western history credit (you just have to submit a petition form and write certain topics for the papers).",
    "Honestly, take another History course. Read Plutarch's account of Alexander the Great in \"Lives\" if you want know about Alexander. Besides that, it's a rather unrewarding history course.",
    "yes",
    "Yes",
    "I was shopping for a writing credit, and I settled on this one and given the limited options, this was a good choice. Professor Manning is GREAT--a rare student's professor, always fair and never unreasonable. And if the next class is similar to this one, every single TF will be fantastic and extremely intelligent. By and large, Professor Manning makes the material interesting and easy to understand. Prepare to do poorly on the first paper, better on the second, study for the final, and you'll be fine.",
    "Beware: the class covers Phillip and Alexander the Great in two weeks. The rest is Hellenistic history. If you're really interested in Alexander, you won't get much in this class.",
    "A look at Alexander the Great in the beginning but spend a lot of time on the history after him, which is interesting but boring at times, like when discussing the cultural stuff. I would recommend it if you like history from the time period, its cool to connect Classical Greece to Rome",
    "I really want to say that I loved this course, and mostly because my two instructors - Professor Manning and my TA, Ray Lurie, were so wonderful. Professor Manning clearly cared tremendously about his students, going out of his way on multiple occasions to post lecture notes and slides, point to optional reading material, mix into the course fun elements like movie clips (watch \"The Good the Bad and the Ugly,\" you won't regret it!). Ray, for his part, was a terrific TA. He was very communcicative with us students, highlighting the essential components of the lecture, and was agreat discussion leader in section. Ray provided the best comments on my papers that I've ever gotten from a TA - he really took the time to read the essay, and thought about it on a line-to-line basis, for which I am very grateful.And yet, I can't say that this was a good course. Professor Manning was so kind and funny and well-intentioned, but the course failed in terms of its structure. Put simply, the lectures felt rambling and unfocused, and it was very difficult to create as a student a narrative of the course. Besides the lectures, the course succeeded - the readings were quite good. But it's hard to rate high a course that you have trouble showing up at because the lectures are so hard to follow. I hope very much that future iterations take this into consideration, because I think that this course has tremendous potential.",
    "This class was decent, but definitely not the best History class I've taken at Yale (speaking as a History major). It was kind of easy to not listen to the lectures, and a lot of the reading felt laborious and unnecessary, but in the end you just don't have to do all of it. If you're interested in the period, go for it, but know that you stop learning about Alexander after the first few weeks, and you cover a few centuries afterwards.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It is a good way to knock out a writing credit and Professor Manning is great",
    "I'd recommend it if you have a real interest in ancient history. If not, don't worry about it.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting course, if you enjoy classical history.",
    "Nice course with a manageable workload, as you can do as much reading as interests you (and the reading list is very interesting and nice, although you will probably not have time to do it all) Take it not to learn details about the hellenistic kingdoms, but to be inspired by alexander the great and the overarching themes of change\/continuity in the hellenstic world.",
    "If you need a pre-industrial and\/or if you're a history major, take it. The subject matter can be dry but JGM is a good lecturer and it teaches you about issues of studying history. Again, it's probably one of your best options if you need a pre-industrial.",
    "I would not recommend the course to a fellow student, since the overall experience was more frustrating and aggravating than it was rewarding.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in ancient history \/ Hellenistic culture. The material is fascinating. I just thought the teaching\/lecturing was nothing extraordinary.",
    "The essays aren't terribly difficult as long as the reading is done. Very interesting class if you are interested in history.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in ancient history, I did not share the same level of enthusiasm as other students in the course and thus did not enjoy it as much as I could have. The readings are manageable and some are pretty interesting. The two essays and final are a good, but not overwhelming amount of work.",
