   "comments": [
    "Enhanced writing and reading skills.",
    "If you participate in class and do your homework, your speaking, comprehension and writing of French will definitely improve.",
    "You learn more complex grammatical structures, e.g. with direct and indirect objects; more idiomatic expressions, and a good range of vocab. You also learn, albeit in not much depth, stuff about the Belle Epoque period in France, of writers such as Camus, and other topics like sufism.",
    "By taking this course I improved my grasp on French grammar. I learned new vocabulary and increased my reading capacity as we read a few novels in class.",
    "I learned new vocabulary and more complex French grammar. I also gained skill in speaking, reading, and writing French.",
    "This course was super fun. I learned a lot of french this semester and I feel much more confident to use the language when talking to friends of abroad.",
    "I learned how to be much more proficient in speaking, writing, reading, and listening to french.",
    "I developed the ability to read more advanced literature in French while strengthening my knowledge of grammar and syntax."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very few weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: An eclectic range of material is engaged with, from the children's book Le Petit Nicolas, to Camus' novel L'tranger, to two films by Truffaut that deal with varying themes. The audio exercises are quite helpful. Improvements: Less time could be used in dealing with Jules et Jim cause it feels like a tedious stretch towards the end of the course. Also don't think the MMPs are particularly helpful compared to the other audio books.",
    "This course and the french department in general is strong in that it really gets students to command the french language. I was able to clarify and fix problems I had from grammar coming from FREN 110 & 120. As a result, my reading comprehension skills have significantly improved. The only weakness of this course is the hefty workload, however such results wouldn't be possible without such a workload. I think the course could be improved with more ways of being able to speak more and develop fluency in speaking.",
    "This course requires a lot of effort and participation. The homework and classwork cover every important grammar and vocabulary topic, which is nice, but the homework is sometimes long and frustrating due to the inability to adjust audio speed. Considering how much homework and classwork we do, I feel like that should make up a bigger portion of the final grade.",
    "It seems that the course curriculum and main materials havents been updates in at least a decade, though Mme Burton makes an effort to provide us with extra material to cover up deficiencies.",
    "The course is strong in that it allows students to be fully immersed in the language and teaches students through varied practices like reading books and watching films rather than just memorizing vocabulary or grammatical conventions. However, the class is very intense and often leaves students with upwards of hours of homework a night.",
    "I found the literature focus to be less useful for developing conversational skills but useful for future research using written French. My one comment would be that less is more in terms of learning objectives and vocabulary, at times I felt that there was too much material to internalize to the degree that it was in one ear and out the other."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It helps significantly develop your language skills.",
    "Yes because while some of the non-grammatical content can be a bit boring, the grammar is really useful and necessary to move on to higher levels where more interesting stuff can be discussed.",
    "I recommend this course if you really have a desire to learn French. It is a lot of work as the class meets daily and work is due almost every class. It is a really amazing class though in that you get to read novels in french and watch french films. If you do all the work, you will be immensely proud at the end of the semester. French at Yale is no joke. The grammar is for the most part a review of 110 & 120 and some new material. It's a lot of work but definitely worth it, in my opinion.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they really want\/need it to fulfill a requirement or are really passionate about learning French. It is far too intense to take as an extra course.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes, this is a great french class, and if you have to take it, take Mme. Burton!! She's amazing."
