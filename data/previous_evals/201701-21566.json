    "Not much--this felt like high school physics with slightly more math.",
    "PHYS 430 is a very thorough undergraduate course in classical E&M.",
    "I learned E&M more in-depth than I ever had before.",
    "This class presents a more rigorous derivation of Electromagnetism and light than will be seen in introduction classes, but we did not really discuss optics at all.",
    "I feel like a have a very good handle on E&M after this course. I also learned a lot of important solving techniques for physics, especially separation of variables and boundary value problems.",
    "I learned how to solve difficult Electrical and Magnetic Systems",
    "This course provides a very solid foundation in electro- and magnetostatics. It provides a slightly less solid foundation of electrodynamics and Maxwell's equations, but I also learned more about the application of Maxwell's equations to physical systems.",
    "We covered Introduction to Electeodynamics by Griffiths. Look up a pdf, we covered everything in it except for a few sections at the end. We did not cover anything not in it",
    "In taking this course, I have become intimately familiar with Maxwell's equations and have developed a good understanding of what is fundamental in the theory as well as how we can derive other concepts from it.",
    "I learned about electromagnetic fields; I learned about optics.",
    "All kinds of electrodynamics -- but we did not even touch optics.",
    "Learned a lot about electrodynamics, some good things about solving differential equations.",
    "Standard, solid knowledge of Griffiths-level Electromagnetism and Optics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength and the biggest weakness are both that the course follows the textbook very closely. The advantage of this is that the textbook is very good, and it's okay if things don't always make sense in lecture. The disadvantage is that this course does not provide anything valuable since one could get the exact same experience (perhaps even explained more clearly) by reading the book. It is telling that even though there were over 40 people enrolled, 10-15 attended lecture on an average day because it was so useless.",
    "The material is interesting and varied. The psets are long but absolutely worth it. I wish that we hadn't rushed the last few chapters. It may be possible to save time by skipping chapter 1 (most students in that class will have taken multivariable calculus anyway) and by maybe moving faster through chapter 2 (which most students will have covered in intro physics)",
    "Honestly, the course was poorly run and poorly organized. We spent too much time on basic topics near the beginning, like vector operations and electric fields, and then moved incredibly quickly through more difficult topics like conservation laws and electromagnetic waves.",
    "The class has very fair problem sets that don't take too long and gives the students a firm understanding of electrostatics, electrodynamics, magneto statics, and electromagnetic waves. However we did spend a lot of time on very basic Gauss' and Ampere's law problems and kind of rushed through the end of the class. I felt like the class could have been a little bit better structured assuming most of the students had a basic understanding of E&M.",
    "The topics covered were great, I also liked that Professor Poland stayed pretty close to the book. The pacing of the course could have been better though, I would've liked to spend more time on the later material which I found more challenging.",
    "Strengths: The material covered is mostly relevant, and the griffiths textbook is excellent. Weaknesses: See below for my comments on the professor.",
    "Strengths: Electrostatics coverage Poland's lectures Weaknesses: Optics? There wasn't any optics in this course. Electrodynamics felt rushed. Improvements: The part on electrodynamics in special relativity was really well done - this should be expanded and not at the end!",
    "Lecture was not worth attending. We covered the material and examples exactly from griffiths and griffiths' presentation was better. Also, we spent forever on the first two chapters which should have been review and spent three weeks on the last five chapters. Seeing as how the most challenging, and interesting material is presented in the last five chapters, it would have been better to have spent half the term on the.",
    "The course had a very good coverage of the material, and the assigned homework problems made sure we had a good understanding of the material. It would also be interesting to see more extra things such as the levi civita tensor or special relativity tensor notation towards the end.",
    "I had mixed feelings about the fact that this course was, more or less, straight out of Griffiths. This was nice because, well, I didn't have to go to class, since I personally love reading Griffiths don't love walking to Sloane Physics Lab and missing lunch. However, it wouldn't have hurt to have a few problems every now and then brought in from other sources (including Poland himself!) just for a bit more diversity than being able to flip back to find the equation needed to evaluate a problem. I'm sure Poland mulled this over himself prior to teaching the course, but it's something I'd suggest revisiting and reconsidering year-to-year. Just as a side note, the midterm exam contained well-chosen material (challenging but not impossible) but, frankly, just too much of it. I talked to several others and found the common theme that several people just didn't have enough time to finish yet aced everything they were able to cover. Final exam was great.",
    "People may point out that the course was more or less taken straight from Griffiths Electrodynamics textbook, but I point out that there is a reason that Griffiths is the gold standard of undergrad E&M -- it's the best. I'm happy that the curriculum was designed that way.",
    "Strengths: Poland is very clear and goes through the material slowly to make sure you understand it. Weaknesses: The problem sets are fine, but they are right from the book and you know that 99% of the class is just looking up the solutions manual online. I really wish Poland would mix in some of his own problems that he makes up. Something I'm neutral on: The course is pretty much right from Griffth's, which is fine (it's a good textbook).",
    "Very traditional, chalk and blackboard, weekly pset kind of physics class. Which is fine. Perhaps it was a little too easy to get away with just looking at Griffiths answer key for the homeworks, memorizing formulas, and not getting a deeper knowledge of the material. It was there, but nobody made you find it."

   "comments": [
    "No--don't take this course unless you absolutely have to for your major. E&M isn't an exciting topic to begin with, and Professor Poland doesn't make it engaging. Especially if you have taken E&M in a physics survey course, Physics 430 won't feel very new conceptually.",
    "PHYS 430 is a great thorough undergraduate course on E&M. The material is very dense (we cover chapters 1-8 + some of chapter 9 and 12) so the ride can get a bit bumpy. But it is so worth it to get such a thorough understanding of classical E&M. The material is interesting and engaging and Prof. Poland is a really good instructors. The psets take a good amount of time but they are worth it. The midterm was fair (can't comment on the final yet!).",
    "AAAAA. Okay this should now be near the top of the reviews if they're alphabetized. Anyway, going to lecture seemed pointless; the professor just goes through Griffiths, example-by-example. However, Griffiths is actually a great text, and you will do fine even if you never attend lecture but study on your own. The exams were fair.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student; you can learn the material on your own from the textbook as well as you can learn it from class.",
    "Take it if you're a physics major or if you're genuinely interested in learning more about the physical properties of electric and magnetic fields as well as their interactions.",
    "Definitely, Professor Poland is great and you'll walk away with a very good understanding of E&M. The homework was pretty reasonable (all out of Griffiths) and the exams were challenging but fair.",
    "It's a requirement for the Physics Major (intensive) It's hard. Week 1 is trivial, weeks 2-10 are difficult, weeks 11-12 are disgustingly fast paced and incredibly difficult. Most p-set problems were out of the book, so you can easily check solutions with the internet, but the content was nuanced and took time. I spent about 7 hours a week on my p-sets (the last two took more like 12 a piece). Material is cool. Hopefully Poland does a better job next year, or they move him to a more appropriate class and get someone else in.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who does not have a solid foundation in electrostatics. I didn't learn that much about electrodynamics and\/or the general form of Maxwell's equations.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to develop a good understanding of electrodynamics that is built upon the fundamentals and also goes into detail with the derivative concepts, such as the solutions to the wave equation in the context of E&M. This course also made me intimately familiar with Maxwell's equations and gained me a better appreciation of electrodynamics. Such a nice theory!",
    "E&M is kind of the most vanilla of the core physics courses. Lots of vector calculus, lots of Griffiths, lots slogging through boundary value problems. It's something you have to learn (and should want to, if you're in the major!) but it's not the most elegant of the physics subjects when compared to the magic of quantum and stat mech and the symmetries of classical mech. Unfortunately, there's nothing to really do about this is an instructor, and David Poland's method was to just make everything as straightforward as possible. I didn't mind (I also didn't go to class), and I felt like I learned plenty, but I admittedly didn't feel all that engaged at the same time.",
    "If you want to go to grad school in physics, you should take 430.",
    "Poland is very clear, albeit pretty much right from the book. That being said, Griffth's is a good textbook so being right from the textbook is not a bad thing. He's also a really nice guy and he goes slowly through the material because he want's you to understand it. The course doesn't get through a ton of material because he goes slowly. But he does a good job of the stuff we do cover. The tests are fair (final was hard, but probably a decent test of your knowledge). You could tell it was his first time teaching the course, but he seems eager to do a good job, so I'm sure it is worth taking.",
    "Math requirements: Math 120 or similar - lots of line\/surface\/volume integrals. If you've taken intro physics, this was pretty accessible without the other 400-level courses. (with David Poland, I think it depends a lot on the professor.) Otherwise, it's the sort of course where if you have to take it, you take it, and if you don't, then you should want to learn about electromagnetism or you won't last!"
