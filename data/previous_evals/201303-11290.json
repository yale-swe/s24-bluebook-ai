    "1. This is a literature class, not just a particularly interesting writing class. Be prepared to shift to a different way of thinking if, like me, you don't do much literature. (It's not a bad thing to shift.) This class covers many plays from the Greek, Renaissance and Modern traditions, and charts the evolution of what tragedy is over time. Once you hit Modern Drama, it'll be very easy to empathize with what you're reading, while at the same time understanding why it is so important to learn the tragedies of previous periods, because certain themes are echoed or because there are changes of significance to the way such themes are interpreted. Do this if you want to understand how human beings are like (from a certain angle, of course).2. This class helped improve my writing massively, and in ways applicable to other courses, at a far greater speed than what my other courses did for me. Perhaps it is because I took a political philosophy class and an ethics class, and I'm more familiar with those issues, so I take certain premises for granted in those sorts of essays - when my brain finally got the hang of analyzing literature, it made analyzing familiar subjects far easier.3. There are many opportunities to experiment with your writing (because improvement is quite obviously never linear) without significantly impacting your grades: 4 papers x 1700 words, and students of Prof Homans can send her multiple drafts of every paper before submitting the official version, plus revise their papers even after the first official draft is submitted (the original and revised grades are averaged to provide the final grade). I do not think other sections get to revise ALL their papers.4. Conversely, however, the grading for this class is not easy; the opportunities to improve are there because the class demands reasonably high standards. This should not be a problem for sophomores (I am a freshman). Do not worry; if you demonstrate considerable improvement over time, I believe the more recent grades will be weighted more heavily.5. Professor Homans has a knack for pulling wonderful ideas,(seemingly, but not really) out of nowhere, while at the same time committing her students to be logically rigorous in the discussion of alluringly interesting issues. She's also pretty knowledgeable on other issues outside of literature (which then play a role in interpreting these works). She's seriously good...6. Workload: this is sort of DS lite - there is a lot of reading, but if you do them regularly they will be bite sized (except for the Iliad during the 1st 2 weeks - it's a lot of reading to do per session, but learn to skim, just for the Iliad - I promise it'll get a LOT better after that). Writing is manageable.7. Recommend that you have some background in literature. If you don't, be prepared to hop on the struggle bus, but you should catch up pretty fast anyway.8. Class sizes are small - that offers opportunities to participate and for dedicated feedback on essays.",
    "This class is hard. It's excellent, but really hard. Professor Homans is undeniably brilliant, but she expects quality work, and if you're not used to writing quality papers, the adjustment will be hard. Mostly prospective english majors take this class. As a science major, I struggled, but it was good struggle. Professor Homans is brilliant, your writing will improve, and the discussion is quality. There's a lot of reading. Be prepared.",
    "Summary: English 129 takes you through the course of European literature from the Iliad to modern day, entirely through plays with the exception of the Iliad, and covers many of the major themes regarding what makes a tragedy a tragedy. If you love English or theater and would like to improve your writing, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 129 to a student that was interested in the body of work we read. This class was a lot of reading, and I would not recommend it to any student that did not have an interest in the material covered.",
    "I would wholly recommend this class to another student! It felt like DS for students who want to spend time taking courses that are not DS, and it was a fun, highly educational experience. You learn so much from the course, and you get to read so many amazing books.",
    "Wonderful! Professor Homans was simply magnificent. There is a lot of reading, but you get used to it after awhile. The class itself is quite relaxed - you just have to read the play beforehand, and then you get to come in and discuss. Professor Homans really lets the discussion go where the class wants it to for the most part. For the writing assignments I'd recommend doing those in advance, and then sending them to Professor Homans\/meeting with her to go over them. She is so wonderful about helping during the initial draft stages, that then by the time you turn in your paper, you know you have something that she'll enjoy!",
    "Yes, if you want to read great books and learn great things, yes. It is time-consuming, and some of the longer plays may feel like they're not worth the effort but overall, all worth it.",
    "It is a fantastic class if you like reading literature (or plays) and then talking about it. If you enjoy that take it with Prof. Homans!",
    "The readings for this course were incredible. I especially enjoyed the later works but feel as though I would not have been able to fully appreciate them without having first read the earlier works. One weakness of this course is that, since we were reading essentially one play per class period, we were not able to discuss each individual text to the extent that I would have liked. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this course for anyone who enjoys literature, especially drama.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENGL 129 to anyone who has ever enjoyed reading literature. This course traces the development of the tragedy: stories and ways of story-telling that leave audiences hopeless, confounded, uneasy, frightened, or lost in grief. Through the span of the course, we build concepts and make connections in relation to diverse topics, including the peril of theater, the theatricality of real life, the extent of human agency, the role that \"gods\" play in human interpretations of events, and the power and limitations of language. My classmates and I have all discovered those two or three plays that speak to us personally, but we would not have made these discoveries without the lessons learned in other works."
