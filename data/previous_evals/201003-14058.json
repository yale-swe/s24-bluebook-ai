   "comments": [
    "This class has a discussion based platform in which the primary literature is utilized to explore current areas of study in the field of chemical biology. Presentations are given by students as a final project that further explore the areas not covered in the class discussions.",
    "Chemical biology is a class in which you learn about the history of chemical biology and review relevant current literature. It is very helpful in learning ways in which chemistry has been engineered to address biological problems, and I would recommend this course to all chemistry and MB&B majors.",
    "Its a good introductory class for learning about chemica biology.",
    "Its a literature survey course. It involves reading a lot of high impact publications, but you will learn a lot of methodologies. The course would only be worthwhile if a student were pursuing a project in chemical biology or maybe bio-organic chemistry.",
    "A reading intensive course that will teach you about all the things currently happening in the field of chemical biology. Its a bit time intensive until the second half of the semester but any student wanting to learn more about chem bio should definitely take this course."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided a great insight into a field that I have not thoroughly research previously. The method of investigation in the class was most beneficial as I had not yet had the opportunity to learn how to effectively and critically read the primary literature. I feel that my skills in this area have greatly improved and will continue to benefit me as my education progresses.",
    "This course has laid a foundation for chemical biology which I will continue to build upon throughout my career as a graduate student."
