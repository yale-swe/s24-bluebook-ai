    "Excellent class with an excellent professor. The works explored in this class are underrated, underread, unexpectedly beautiful, and speak to philosophy as it's practiced, not just as it's thought. Prof. Zhuo is excellent and particularly good at facilitating and contributing to seminar conversation and was a real gem in this context. Definitely recommended.",
    "If you're very into this work, it's a good course for reading important texts and talking about them. It's not a good introduction to the context of 20th century French thought.",
    "It is an overview of the way in which the question of community and communication - its conditions, its needs, its possibilities - has evolved from Bataille onwards in France. I would recommend it to a student in interested in this era of French history or the philosophical questions it involves. Because of the density of the texts read, a familiarity with the authors studied, or with those they had read - German philosophers or contemporary anthropologists and sociologists - wouls greatly help with the course."
