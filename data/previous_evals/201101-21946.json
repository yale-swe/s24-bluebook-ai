    "Obviously if you are considering Latin 141 you are either a Classics\/Classical civilization major or need to finish your language requirement, so either way you are going to take this course eventually. I would recommend taking it as early in your Yale career as you possibly can, as it is truly very good if you are interested in Latin\/Virgil, because it will open up even more interesting classes for you, and because the strict schedule gets annoying juggling junior and senior responsibilities.",
    "This class was a great to read an entire book of Vergil in the original, and to place it in the context of the rest of the book.The coursework was challenging but manageable, and classes were helpful in working through the translations.I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The professor, the material, and the small class size were all contributing elements in making this class a very positive experience.",
    "The course was excellent -- we read only one book of the Aeneid, but we spent a third of the class talking about it as a piece of literature, not merely a piece of text to be translated. I wouldn't have minded if we had branched out and looked at other poetry especially near the end of the term, but everything about this course was very enjoyable and edifying. In particular, reading articles about the text was a lot of fun and then talking about them was very enjoyable. Although this was mostly a Latin class, I would have enjoyed writing a longer sustained paper on the text, although we did plenty already.Prof. Kraus was a great teacher of the Aeneid. She consistently led discussions well, and she brought her vast knowledge of Roman culture to the class. She always tried to explain what we were translating, referring constantly to maps, artistic depictions, and related texts. For wayward translation, Prof. Kraus would try to encourage correct interpretations of the text, not merely telling it. She discouraged memorizing translations, and she forced us to think about the Latin text in different ways through passage-analysis assignments and through analyzing gobbets of text. I thought about Vergil in new and exciting ways because of the things she would encourage us to think about in class."
