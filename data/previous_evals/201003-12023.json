    "What's there to say? If you're a religious studies major, you'll write a thesis. Otherwise, why the hell are you reading this?",
    "I love the RLST major so much! The senior seminar is really chill for the first semester. We meet every other week and discuss our ideas and progress as we gather material for our papers. It's a really tight knit group as we all know each other from the junior seminar last spring. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling to go to class each week.",
    "Well, if you're a Religious Studies Major you're going to have to take the course, BUT you should be really excited. It's really great spending time with all the people in your major.",
    "It's awesome!! Yeah Religious Studies!",
    "The required senior seminar is not really a seminar but more a \"support group\" to help you write your senior essay. You meet about twice a month wiht your peers and hand in preliminary steps to your senior essay, including a paper topic, prospectus, researchplan, and outline. You gotta take this class whether I recommend it or not, but it is truly helpful if sometimes a little silly.",
    "You have to take it as a religious studies major.",
    "You will appreciate the fact that unlike other majors, RLST's senior essay is structured and helps you when you need it. All my friends were asking to borrow my senior essay manual. Obviously it doesn't matter if I \"recommend\" this class because you have to take it, but it is quite fun, and you only meet 5 times during first semester.",
    "This course helps guide you in the senior essay process. You meet with the other Religious Studies majors appox. 5 times during the first semester for about an hour each time. During these meetings you discuss the logistics of the senior essay i.e. finding an advisor, deadlines, and grading. You are required to do a few small assignments such as a 1 pg summary, 2 pg prospectus, 5 page annoted bibliography, and a 10 pg draft all due throughout the semester. It's not too strenuous if you stay on top of your work and you get to learn a lot about a subject of your choice and hear a little bit about what your friends are doing. I highly recommend this course, especially if you want to graduate...",
    "Class helps you stay on track for senior essay.",
    "Yes, it is very useful"
