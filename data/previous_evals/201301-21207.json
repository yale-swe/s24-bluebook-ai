   "comments": [
    "This course looks at the development of intellectual history in the area of statecraft and diplomacy, starting with the Ancient Greeks and working all the way to modern times. Reading load is completely impossible to complete; you have to pick and choose which of the required texts you want to read. All primary texts -- classics from the Western Canon (i.e. The Republic, The Prince, War& Peace, etc.). Coursework simply a final exam and a substantial term paper on a topic germane to the course.",
    "A great overview of the history of thought on the subject of world order. Heavy on the classics (Thucydides, Livy, Burke, etc) as a tool for examining the topic.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the development of political and philosophical thinking. It's especially helpful for those who wants to put IR theory and policy into historical perspectives.",
    "Great class to learn about the history of political thought. Mostly just lecturer and only two assignments. Requires an interest in philosophy and history.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "I would recommend the course to those who would like to get a better understanding about the political thinking and international relations theory.",
    "I would highly recommend Strategies of World Order to any student who wants to understand the origins and foundations of humanities, liberal arts, and the western international order. This is a great course that takes you through history and gives you basic analytic tools for power, international relations, and human development."

    "It triggers my interest in the contemporary world order structure.",
    "It contributed to improve my understanding of current political thinking.",
    "This course was the perfect rounding of historical, sociological and political knowledge. It is always important to have strong foundations in order to advance in any field of study."
