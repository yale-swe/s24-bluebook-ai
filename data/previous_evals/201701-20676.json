    "I had no experience with Haitian and Latin American history, so I was glad that we ease in by examining first the American Revolution to provide a strong platform for later learning. We worked extensively with primary sources at the Beinecke, which will be helpful going forward.",
    "I deepened my understanding for historiography and have observed how one's background can affect their interpretation of historical facts.",
    "How to write a great research paper; how to use\/find historical sources (and how to use beinecke as a resource); context of where the American revolution fit into the era of revolutions in the rest of the Americas.",
    "I learned how to think in a historical way and analyze primary source documents.",
    "I learned how to access and utilize various of the resources available at Yale including the librarians and the Beinecke. I also learned how to analyze primary documents effectively. I also explored the history of the Americas along with concepts and topics that are not a part of an average U.S.A curriculum."

   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of this class was probably Professor Echeverri herself. (See the professor evaluation for more info.) One possible weakness was that examining the totality of the various revolutions was hindered by an unclear understanding of the facts (timeline, key players, etc.) within the revolution. The secondary sources we read packed a lot of information into a small number of pages, and I would have liked to have firmer grasp on the particularities of each revolution before trying to connect their themes and implications.",
    "Seminars are great because they allow everyone to speak. The workload was also very manageable.",
    "Strengths: small class size, incredible discussions with prof, essays are approachable, fun, and rewarding at the same time; fascinating topic Weaknesses: sometimes the reading is long and difficult to absorb all at once.",
    "The small seminar nature of this course is great. There is a lot of discussion and personal involvement. Less reading would be nice.",
    "I enjoyed all of the readings and the discussions. I also think that the variety in the three big written assignments worked well."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. The reading is substantive but not overwhelming, and the discussion was both fascinating and well-facilitated. I learned a lot about the ways in which American revolutions interacted and influenced each other in the eighteenth century and beyond, as well as how liberalism, racism, and colonial came to bear on the development of the era.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great overview of the history of Latin American revolutions. Professor Echeverri is really kind and engaged.",
    "I would recommend this course as the material itself is very interesting and introduces students to Latin American history.",
    "This is a great class. By far the heaviest reading load of any class I've taken.",
    "YES! A great class for any major :)",
    "For sure! This is a wonderful course. I learned so much about revolutions in the ameeicas through different viewpoints than the ones we usually look at these events through.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it introduces a very important and interesting aspect of history. Professor Echeverri also challenges your understanding of revolutions as you explore the social and political thought as well as race and class relations in a new light."
