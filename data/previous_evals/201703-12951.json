   "comments": [
    "I learned about animal models of depression, anxiety, Parkinson's Disease, schizophrenia, PTSD, drug abuse disorder, and Alzheimer's Disease. I learned the basics of neurotransmission and got a sense of the complexity of the brain, its regions, its neurotransmitters, and its method of signalling. I learned about different experiments that have used animal models and different drugs that have been used to treat these disorders.",
    "This was a fantastic class - strong in theory and practical approaches to mental disorders.",
    "I learned a lot in this class about drugs and animal models of those drugs pertaining to opioids. depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Parkinsons, and anxiety. We learned a lot of information about the drugs and how they work in the brain.",
    "I learned the value of animals models in shaping the development of medicine. I learned to critically analyze experimental studies in light of the questions asked.",
    "Basic thought procedures of developing animal models to study clinical disorders; how human brain functions and characteristic breakdowns related to mental disease; scientific habit of thought",
    "This course goes very in depth as to how certain clinical conditions affect people's brains and lives.",
    "I learned a great deal about how the brain works and changes over time.",
    "I learned a ton about the disorders we studied (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia, and drug use disorders): how they arise (where that information is accessible), how we recognize them, and past and upcoming treatments, as well as how those diseases and treatments have been tested in animal models.",
    "great class, learned a lot about different research and experimental methods in translational medicine\/psychiatry",
    "I learned so much about diseases and the brain. Very interesting.",
    "This course is great for anyone interested in learning about the scientific discoveries underlying treatments and cure development for psychiatric illnesses.",
    "the biological mechanisms of clinical disorders, animal models, and treatment approaches",
    "How to better think about scientific papers in terms of their methods of going about trying to solve mental disorders, as well as he importance of the results",
    "This class will teach you about mental disorders and their physical and physiological symptoms. For students interested in how treatments are created, this class helps bridge the gap between bench work and clinical trials. \"Animal Models\" gives you a good idea what this class is about. This class taught me to view psychiatric treatments as a long effort that begins at the bench and undergoes many steps before it is considered a viable treatment.",
    "I learned a lot about clinical disorders and what is involved in the many scientific discoveries we benefit from. I learned the tremendous cost to what these scientists do, but also the battles they face with incredible diseases and the deterioration of the brain."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting topics. Good introduction to neuroscience and psychiatric disorders. Good, varied choice of topics (disorders) discussed. Weaknesses: Boring\/disorganized slideshows (words against a white background - could use occasional photos, better organization, etc.), could have used more supplemental material (when videos were incorporated into lecture, they were great). More reading material aside from the course packet would have been interesting, and a good supplement to the notes, especially since so much is going on in neuroscience research today.",
    "I loved this class because Professor Donegan explained cutting edge scientific research to us in layman's terms",
    "The tests are very difficult in terms of them being a lot of memorization from everything from lectures and readings. It is a very information heavy class, and the tests are difficult.",
    "HANDS DOWN. One of my favorite courses at Yale. Professor Donegan is great--he has so much passion for animal models and the people affected by these disorders. The course builds up over time and begins with foundational science\/neuroscience--which was perfect since I don't have a strong science background.",
    "Course was a bit fast paced and more time could have been spent in explaining fully how chemical mechanisms happen in the brain. There could have been a more detailed breakdown.",
    "Very organized and the lectures were fun.",
    "The course was well-organized and on, to me, a quite interesting subject. However, I often found it quite dry and somewhat repetitive. The exams were extremely focused on memorization which was a bit frustrating.",
    "strengths = very accessible for non-stem students, gives most up-to-date research and facts weaknesses = the course packet is unnecessary",
    "I thought it was not engaging at all even though I found the material to be very interesting. Exams were very difficult.",
    "I loved the regularity of the course schedule and format. However lectures were typically quite dry.",
    "There were 3 tests, a final paper, and a final exam. The workload at the end of the course was too much.",
    "Interesting material, well taught, and taught me a lot! Weakness would be that there were a lot of people and the level of engagement with the TA was minimal",
    "I think this class does a good job of grouping disorders into similar symptoms and such, as well as spacing out tests well. One thing that could be improved would be to space the term paper either earlier or a little later from the final exam.",
    "This is a pretty good course. The professor is certainly dedicated to the material which is interesting in itself. The classes are pretty well structured so if you put in the work you should be able to do well.",
    "It was really interesting to have been presented with a comprehensive, up to date overview of various disorders within the context of animal models and clinical drug trials. There were times when the lectures were a bit slower and there was an apparent larger focus on topics regarding drug abuse (at the beginning of the semester) in comparison to the other disorders talked about at the end of the semester, which were covered sufficiently but felt a bit more rushed."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to a student who wants to be a neuroscience, psychology, or biology major or to a student who is interested in how we use animal models in research.",
    "It was okay, a lot of memorization and pretty neuroscience-y. I learned a lot and if you want to take a class involving a lot of brain processes and learn about drugs for different disorders it is a good class for that. Professor Donegan was very knowledgeable but also very monotone and bland. Difficult to sit there for the full hour fifteen at times.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. One of my top 2 favorite courses at Yale. If you are someone without a strong science background but who is interested in mental disorders...take this course! It is structured very well for someone who wants to learn neuro but is nervous about it.",
    "Very much so. Clear instruction is one reason. More importantly you have exposure to some of the forefront neuroscientific research of the time -- some from our very own Yale Medical School -- that you would not have learned from textbooks, and it is amazing that this course is not textbook-based\/centered in any way. Everything you learn is new, and I'm sure this is one of the Yale exclusive experiences.",
    "I would not list it as a course for non-science majors",
    "Yes!",
    "If you're interested in learning about a variety of diseases and how we model them and treat them in animals, yes, take this. Just be warned that lectures can be a bit dry so it really helps if you're already interested in the material. Also, tests are extremely memorization heavy.",
    "absolutely! easy gut for psych\/stem students",
    "I would recommend the material but not the Professor.",
    "Yes, as long as you are very interested in the material and willing to listen to what is quite often a dull and dry lecture.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the sciene of clinical disorders.",
    "I would! It helps to understand many psychology papers!",
    "I took this as a science credit. It is definitely not a gut class but the workload is manageable if you put in the time to do the readings and go to lecture. As a mon-science person, I thought that this class was very interesting.",
    "I recommend you take this course if you are genuinely interested in the physiology of mental disorders. That being said, there is a lot of biology involved in this course and less about how people with these disorders are affected(beyond symptoms). If you are into neuroscience, like I was, I recommend this class, since it will give you an idea about how psychiatric research is conducted.",
    "I would recommend this course. You learn a lot and the material is interesting. The professor wants you to learn the material and if you study it and ask questions he tries to explain everything and be helpful."
