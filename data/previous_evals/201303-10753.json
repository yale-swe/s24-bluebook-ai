    "Seminar-style course that allows you to critically think and read deeply into the most important papers that opened up the field for further biological research. Beyond giving me the opportunity to synthesize knowledge from all past bio courses, this class really gives insight into how research works, and how to read and understand a paper.",
    "Definitely take this! A fabulous class.",
    "Phenomenal class with a phenomenal professor. I wish I could have met Prof. Rosenbaum earlier in my career at Yale. He is a true inspiration and an excellent discussion leader. I highly recommend this course to future students -- I really enjoyed my time in MCDB 435.",
    "Wow! This course helped me grow so much in the way I approach science\/biology. You read one landmark paper a week in close detail (which will require some background reading) and talk about the logic and methodology behind the authors' experiments. I expected this to be a fairly easy course and so I was a little overwhelmed at first. If you feel this way after the first few classes, don't be discouraged. After putting in the work, I got the hang of it, and the class ended up being incredibly rewarding for me. Also, Professor Rosenbaum is a wonderful teacher and person!",
    "MCDB 435 is the class that every MCDB major has been waiting for. After years of undirected learning about techniques and pathways, you finally have an opportunity to put it all toGether and Use thaT knowledge. The class covers many fundamental papers that establish many of the bioloGical concepts we now take for granted with data. It's incredible to see both how ingenioUs our forerunner's were and how They erred. You'll learn how to read a scientific paper for content and context, and you'll have fun doing it. The best part is that your only responsibility durinG the class is reading the assigned paper and coming to each session having done the appropriate backgroUnd reading To understand all the procedures and methods and reasonings of your paper. That's it, no tests, no homework, no projects, no exams. It really is the best deal, and it's only a bonus that Professor Rosenbaum is ultra-legit and has been in the game for all the important stuff from the last half a century. You'll learn a lot from him not only about how science has changed since his start, but also how the work you do in your lab can have consequences that cross the boundaries of many fields.tl;dr: Take this class. Absolutely.",
    "Yes, take it! Prof. Rosenbaum is such a nice man, and the class is really enjoyable! I think I'm faster at reading papers now, and honestly modern papers seem to be much more organized than the older ones we read, so I'm always prepared for the worst, and then it's not that bad!Take this class. It's a pretty even stream of work throughout the semester, and then you're done with no final.",
    "Landmark papers is a GREAT class to cap off the MCDB major. Essentially, you are going through Cell Biology from the perspective of the original papers themselves, drawing on everything you've learned to discuss the methods, the discoveries, and their importance. This class teaches you how to critically think about and evaluate the science as well as to become more comfortable talking about it. I think your experience could vary on the makeup of the class but we had a really interactive group of students and thediscussion--think journal club, complete with food--was always fun. Each week, you go through a landmark paper chosen by Prof Rosenbaum with a powerpoint presentation and discussion led by two students. Preparing for this class does take quite a few hours each week but that is the only requirement as your grade is based entirely on participation. It is difficult to tell where you stand gradewise because of this but you should take Landmarks regardless!",
    "A must-take course. Interesting papers, low workload, awesome professor, and a great way to really get to know the other people in your class."
