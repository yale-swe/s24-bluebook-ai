   "comments": [
    "Art and Industry-- with a lot of emphasis on the industry, how the Hollywood system affected the art. Interesting to learn from this POV, but keep this in mind before enrolling. The Professor is very good, though many of the things he discussed were quite complex and unfamiliar to me as an Art History student.",
    "take this class. if it were up to me you would not have a choice.",
    "Take the class! It's a really great class, super interesting, especially for those of you who love old movies.JD is a really great lecturer, he's practically a walking film encyclopedia, and the lectures were always interesting. You learn about social context, production code, film analysis, actors...There are classical movie screenings once a week with additional clips shown in class.Sections are mandatory, they meet once a week and are group discussions about the films\/genres\/ideas discussed that week in lecture.There were three essays, and a final. And weekly readings.It's a really great class!",
    "I absolutely loved this course. It's not by any means a walk in the park (you must take it Cr\/D\/F if you don't want to do the work)--if you want a good grade, you must do the readings, go to the screenings and lectures, and think about these issues in a clear and intelligent way. What you get out of the class is well worth all the effort though: JD is a brilliant young professor, the films are AMAZING, and the skills you get in dealing with old Hollywood movies will nest an appreciation for Hollywood classics deep within you. Great class, definitely the best of the semester for me (and I am not a film major). It was my first film course; intro film is not a prerequisite but definitely would have been helpful. Still, I felt inspired by the course without that background.",
    "This class was fantastic, and I'd recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone interested in film, American cultural history, art history, or any of the other cross-listed department headings this is listed under. (It's a class that wears many hats and wears them well.) JD is an awesome, witty lecturer and a great resources outside of class; he was always available to talk about papers and seemed to really enjoy talking to students. He was committed to exposing us to not only a variety of films\/genres\/time periods\/etc. but also to a variety of critical approaches, which made it a really excellent first film course without ever feeling basic. Cool syllabus, with readings that were not high in volume but were surprisingly dense. Unfortunately, this isn't being taught next year, but if it's offered in the future, try it out. It's a good, satisfying time.",
    "If you're interested in Hollywood at all and have time to go to film screenings and write a lot, I definitely recommend this course. It totally reshaped the way I experience American cinema. There's a lot of paper writing, and the grading is pretty tough, but I found that we got to write about such interesting topics that I usually didn't mind. (Professor Connor makes you work a lot, but consequently you learn a lot ... about really cool things.)I definitely recommend taking it Credit\/D if that's an option for you ... it's a super great fifth class if you're more concerned with exposing yourself to Classical Hollywood films and theory than you are with getting an A!",
    "Classical Hollywood is an informative look at the American film industry from 1920 to 1960. It weaves typical film analysis with technological, political, and economic history. Films are assessed from a variety of angles, examining the ways in which the artistic contributors to the film influenced and were influenced by more external factors such as studio politics, world wars, technological innovations, and business model changes. The class is a really cool way to see a LOT of great classic films (Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Dracula, The Jazz Singer, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Psycho) as well as some slightly lesser known favorites (His Girl Friday, Out of the Past, Imitation of Life, She Done Him Wrong). JD Connor is one of the best film lecturers out there. He knows SO much and is such a great person to spend class time with.",
    "This class is a lot of work and seems a bit wild at certain points. However, the professor is absolutely fantastic and the TA's are just as competent. Take this class if you have any interest in the workings of Hollywood or if you'd like to have an incredible professor.",
    "This course gives great exposure to many classical Hollywood movies that one might not watch otherwise. Lectures are interesting, J.D. is very knowledgeable; however, there is too much work. There is a lot of class time, section, 2 hour film screenings, three papers and a final exam. At the end, you come out with a great deal of knowledge about the films and the context from which they came from.",
    "Take this course! It's fascinating and the films are uniformly wonderful. JD is great--he's incredibly knowledgeable about what he does and very approachable. Take advantage of office hours. Be warned that there are a lot of readings and screenings, and grading is not a joke. It's a difficult class, but worth it."
