    "I will definitely recommend the course to all my classmates and new comers to my program.",
    "Introductory sessions seek to cultivate a working knowledge of theories of politics\/aesthetics, which in turn serve as a collective lens through which to view\/analyze ethnographies in the later part of the class. This is an insightful and productive course set-up and I would recommend that another student enroll.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Since taking it, it's been impossible to think of my dissertation project as I had prior to the course. It's quite a lot of work, but it definitely pays off in the end.",
    "Strongly recommend. Continental theory read against ethnographies of popular culture, lots of multimedia (film, music). Fun but high-flying and challenging. Don't take it if you can't handle the Russian Roulette."

   "comments": [
    "The course was not directly related to my discipline, however it helped me a lot my own research.",
    "See above.",
    "More than anything, this course gave me a variety of frameworks for considering my project as an aesthetic practice with political implications. Though not all the readings were particularly relevant to my dissertation, it seemed that nearly every week's reading provided at least an important rethinking of an argument I'd come across previously.",
    "This course was able to broaden my sense of anthropology's engagement with critical theory. I think certain key concepts, like 'distribution of the sensible' will likely stay with me in dissertation research."
