    "This was a fantastic course and I learned an incredible amount. At times I felt slightly lost on the final project and it seemed hard to get information but it was doable.",
    "I love this course. It taught us something practical that we could use in our academic and research career.I thought that perhaps, sometime could be dedicated to just go through RevMan. I felt loss when I had to key in the data and analyze it. It took quite a while to just figure how to use it.",
    "very good interaction between instructor and students.",
    "Great course and introduction to systematic reviews. The lectures were great and full of interesting examples that really made the topics understandable.I think a more hands-on or technical approach to the review would be helpful. Perhaps running some searches in class? Or running the software in class? Or a practice review or something along those lines.",
    "More direct practice with the software -RevMan in class."

    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Bracken was a great professor whose wealth of knowledge is amazing. Powerpoints were always helpful and thorough.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Prof. Bracken is a fantastic instructor that did not disappoint. He is so renowned that I have heard of him before I enrolled at Yale. I wanted to take the course last year but could not because of schedule clash. I'm glad it worked out this year.Prof. Bracken is a heavy weight and pioneer in this field and he presents current material. I like his anecdotes. He seems to know enough about any field to engage with us from different backgrounds.He's a good facilitator for class discussions and has to ability to bring out the best in our projects.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Wonderful teacher.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is fantastic. He is clearly a well respected and known researcher. The lectures were very interesting. Again - as above - I think a more 'practical' angle could be taken with the actual performance of reviews.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Strengths- Dr Bracken is very knowledgeable.Weaknesses-Students who are struggling may feel left out in class"

    "This course, while it is upper level, is absolutely worth taking and the professor is fantastic. I learned a great deal about the lack of evidence-based medicine that is occurring and the necessity of well conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This course might be more helpful for those who are progressing to a PHD or med school (or are in one of these programs already) because it is heavily focused on medicine.",
    "Useful.",
    "A lot of information to absorb during the semester. Final project can be tough if you don't work on it consistently during the semester.",
    "Absolutely and highly recommended.",
    "Definitely recommend course. It is a very instructive course"
