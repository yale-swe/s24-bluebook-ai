   "comments": [
    "How to be happy, use my body effectively, read analytically, analyze information I don't agree with, and be concise",
    "I learned so much about myself in this class. Through the exploration of movement, I really became more self aware of my daily actions I take and why I take them. I learned a lot about the connection between the mind and the body, and how that connection can really alter your life for the better or worse. Most importantly, I learned the importance of taking care of your body, and taking time to self reflect on a daily basis.",
    "In this course, I learned about the general anatomy of the body (focusing especially on bones), and about various movement philosophies from modern dance thinkers. I gained a lot of insight into alternative movement therapies and physical therapy, as well as how movement philosophies are applied to everyday actions such as sitting, standing and walking.",
    "I learned different approaches to the field of kinesiology.",
    "I learned a few new ways to look at bodily movement, and gained a solid understanding of anatomy"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - great professor, lots of room for error Improvements - maybe more structure to doing the readings every time",
    "strengths- everything about this class. The class was very engaging and interesting because it was a class that I never knew much on, except the anatomy part. I believe there was a good balance between the anatomy portion and the motion part. The amount of activities in class were perfect, and it was a good wake up class for a 9 am weaknesses- nothing",
    "I liked this course for its approach of movement and because it incorporated simple physical exercises into classwork. The structure of the class was also well thought-out, with each reading flowing nicely into the next and the discussion questions delving into interesting material. If there was one thing I wish the course would have done better, it would be have more guidance with regards to the two papers. The criteria were explained briefly in class, but I would have appreciated a concrete assignment description.",
    "I think the environment of the seminar is very friendly and low-pressure. I like that most of the class is in class exercises and motion rather than solely discussion.",
    "Strengths: Subject material was great, as was the professor Weaknesses: Quizzes felt random and we did not closely follow the syllabus"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it. I learned a lot from Proc MacArthur and she was patient with teaching. I read a lot, wrote a lot, and used my body for expression a lot. I gained invaluable skills.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to another student. Before this class, I thought it was just really an anatomy course, but it is so much more than that. Yes, you learn basic anatomy of a skeletal structure, but the real important part of the class is exploring yourself through your own movement. Being able to talk about movement in a way I never did before was really interesting, and learning about my body I feel was worth the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student seeking to better understand their own bodies and physiology in general. Professor MacArthur is extremely good at explaining the differences between each movement philosopher's ideas, and at leading the class in exercises that are educational and relaxing. This class is great for someone looking to increase their bodily awareness and learn about the history behind the study of movement\/dance.",
    "I would recommend. Fun seminar.",
    "Yes! It's not a field of study you'd be exposed to in any other way (unless you've grown up in dance; even then, you will learn new things here). Just don't assume the quizzes will be as easy as they seem"
