John gave me very useful feedback the weekly crits were definitely intense (don't take this course if you want a light workload) but they were worth it. We learned about different photographers Arbus, Friedlander, Winogrand, while taking our own pictures.",

    "The course was very unstructured and based primarily around conversation and critique. At the beginning, I did wish that we had more critique (it kind of felt as though the class really \"started\" around the midway point) though I realize now that this foundation was fairly necessary. I don't really see how it could have been changed or improved."

    "I highly recommend taking this course. It is a big time commitment and you would want to be motivated to produce the best work that you can in order to get good feedback. Being cognizant of this fact, however, it was a great experience."
