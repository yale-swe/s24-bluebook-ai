    "I would not recommend it. You won't learn any new skills.",
    "If you are interested in early childhood development policies and issues in both developed and developing country this course will introduce you to the theory and the evidence and provide country example of policies",
    "Definitely recommended for students with a keen interested in policy. Pia does a great job in taking students to a real-life policy workshop which was fantastic.",
    "Totally recommend if you're at all interested in development issues. Much more relevant for someone who cares about development than someone who cares about foreign policy at the national\/multinational level. Very good for public health minded students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Any student \u0096 regardless of field \u0096 can gain a great deal from this class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to get a good understanding of international policy development especially around early childhood. Additionally, there is typically a trip over spring break to see it in practice for one week if you feel you can make this happen - it is very worth it."

    "I didn't really. I do not have a dissertation.",
    "Very much.",
    "This class focuses on policy, which is very helpful within the IR\/Development space. It also took a very applied approach, which is great given that a lot of graduate work is more theoretical in nature.",
    "This course gave me a better understanding of policy development especially at the national level and feel it will be useful as I move forward to focus on other international issues outside of early childhood development."
