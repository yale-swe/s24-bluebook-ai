    "Absolutely, take anything that Prof. Cole is teaching.",
    "There is something very elegant about this seminar. You read and discuss some important literary theorists, critics, and translators, and at the same time you work on a substantial translation project of your own. The class meetings are split: one class you will discuss theory and look at some neat (or brilliant, or scandalous) existing translations, the next class you workshop a draft by one of your classmates. Peter Cole is superbly suited to teaching this course: his experience as a translator and poet guarantees that it never becomes too academic. Overall, if you're interested in translation and have a good command of any language besides English, definitely take!",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I could tell that all of the readings were carefully selected and lots of thought was put into the syllabus and the whole trajectory of the class. Every Tuesday we would discuss the readings for the week and Thursdays would be workshops where each week one of us would have our personal translation projects workshoped. The workshops were all extremely insightful and it was lots of fun to read everyone else's work.Professor Cole is one of the kindest professors I've had the pleasure of taking a class with at Yale. He was always available to talk about my project and made a really effort to get to know each of us. He is extremely knowledgeable in the area of translation and had really valuable advice to give us even if we were translating pieces that he had very little experience with.If you're interested in translation or even just creative writing, take this class!",
    "Unlike any other course I've ever taken, a course on the theory of translation with a workshop for one to test out one's own translation.",
    "Absolutely take this class."
