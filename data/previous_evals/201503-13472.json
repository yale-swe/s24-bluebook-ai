    "A great class on general forest processes. Also very valuable from a general ecosystem dynamics point of view for building a framework to understand structure, function, process and the many factors shaping vegetation across landscapes.",
    "I really enjoyed class. Sometimes I felt the class was too big. The material was incredibly useful and helpful.",
    "Field trips: The GMF trip left a little to be desired, but that might have just been the weather. The ADK trip was amazing! I would strongly recommend that to anyone in this class in the future. In class:, Ann is a great teacher. She explains thing well, and in terms that students can understand. I wish that there were more lectures, rather than the student presentations at the end of the course. It also would have been nice to incorporate the readings into the lecture, rather that doing a big discussion at various points in the semester.",
    "Ann is an outstanding teacher who explained concepts exceedingly well while providing personal antidotes and engaged the class in every lecture and class trip. She will be sorely missed at this University!",
    "Ann is a firecracker of a personality in a great way, but is clearly ready to retire. Her stories are priceless.",
    "I find Ann to be a very well organized and clear presenter. Her classes are structured in a way that is very easy to follow and I feel like I am getting invaluable knowledge from her experience on the ground and in the classroom.",
    "Dr. Camp is a great professor who cares very much about her students learning the content of the course in a way that is valuable for them. Great course.",
    "Question 1: The readings for the course were great, but it was not clear which readings were required and which we were responsible for knowing and would be assessed on in tests. The Oliver-Larson book was constantly referenced but no assigned readings were taken from the text. Question 4: The pace was ok, because lectures tended to get at the material from different angles, BUT the pace of individual courses was far too quickly paced. Less material per lecture with a few more lectures would be much more useful, in my opinion",
    "Questions 5-7: I was unable to attend the one optional class field trip.",
    "EXCELLENT COURSE."

    "Ann is a great lecturer and presents theory that is broadly applicable with examples for how it fits into specific situations. Very engaging and fun.",
    "Annotated bibliography and presentation. I really enjoyed applying what I learned to my interests and hearing the same from others",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures and field trips. Ann is an engaging teacher, and the slideshows and her descriptions illustrated the concepts very well.",
    "Stand dynamics is very important for forest managers. I cam away from this course with an excellent understanding of the concepts. Students are encouraged to be engaged on many levels . Presentations,research and exams. Concepts are explained using New England forests as the backdrop but tropical elements and western elements were also included.",
    "Most lectures were great, peer-led discussions were particularly valuable.",
    "just well structured course overall. everything flowed nicely, and really enjoyed the student presentations more than any other student presentation i've ever been a part of, learned a ton from them.",
    "I appreciated that ann supplemented lectures with student presentations and discussions the made the class much more interactive and made lectures more applicable.",
    "I found the combination of student presentations and lectures to be timed perfectly.",
    "This class is a great overview of forest development.",
    "The subject matter of this course, is incredible and should be required for anyone interested in anything to do with forests or for that matter anything to do with environmental management. Cannot express how valuable I thought the material was.",
    "Learning the basics of growth and yield modeling. Learning the overall stages of stand dynamics.",
    "All aspects of this course is excellent.",
    "The presentation slides had great visuals. The teacher moved at a nice, fast pace. The assignments were few but thoughtful and were effective learning tools. The field trips were great teaching tools. This course is a must for all FES students.",
    "All aspects were wonderful. The course is well-thought-out, well-delivered, of-a-piece.",
    "The teacher, classmates presentations, readings discussions. I learned a lot from the readings, studying the content and taking the exams. Also enjoyed my class group and relationship between us and Ann.",

   "comments": [
    "N\/A",
    "Maybe an assignment in the first half of the course to keep students engaged",
    "I sometimes wish that the course was a bit more complex. It seems like we skipped over a lot of quantitative data like stocking charts and models. I realize that you could take a whole course on each of those topics, but I think that would improve the course.",
    "Class trip needed a little better organization otherwise nothing.",
    "I felt that the final exam format was a little strange and inconsistent with the kind of thinking and evaluation present in the rest of the class. Our midterm was essays and short answers, which allowed students to really dig into a problem...the final exam was T\/F, multiple choice, and fill in the blank, providing little opportunity to demonstrate knowledge application or work through the complex problems and issues that are a trademark of this class.",
    "the tests are ridiculous. For somebody who is so conceptual in nature and wants us to be able to apply concepts in different situations, her tests are so particular. She has a specific answer in mind to her very vague question, which isn't always very obvious or the only possible answer. She'd then say well i'd probably mark it wrong but you could argue for your points back. And the number of questions that require knowing a specific definition, even if you understand the concept, were cray. Just a total mismatch from lecture style to exam style.",
    "Midterms covers so much material, would be helpful if it was earlier so semester was more evenly broken up.",
    "I though mainly in the pacing of the lectures and organization. Often unclear what exactly was required for readings etc. as often focus was placed on the unrequired readings. Also thought that the discussion groups could have been better, but this was likely due to class size.",
    "Course lectures and slides seemed somewhat disorganized. The topics and content presented sometimes seemed disjointed and did not flow as well as possible.",
    "I can't think of any.",
    "The methods of testing used in the course were not congruent with the manner of instruction. For example, certain terms and scenarios may be used when describing tree growth in class. However, on mid-term\/final examinations, the wording or scenarios presented may be new material not presented in this year's class, or the wording may be completely different. I believe the instructor was trying to challenge the students through the questions presented, however, the questions were often misleading and confusing which resulted in competent and well-prepared students not being fairly assessed for this course. I am not particularly concerned about my grade in this course, but if I were an undergraduate student concerned about grades, I would intentionally avoid this course because of the erratic and inconsistent grading. Also, a good teaching assistant is absolutely necessary (which we had this year in Elliott van de Kolk) as a liaison between the teacher and students to clarify questions. All told, however, this class was very informative, moved at a good pace, and was taught by a passionate teacher.",
    "Probably the content was too much for the amount of time during the semester. Covering management practices after every chapter would have been very useful.",
    "Many of the reading were very outdated. I understand the need to read old research papers to understand successional theory, but too many of the other research papers were outdated. I feel like I didn't learn enough about up to date theories and issues facing stand development."

Maybe could divide the class up into separate sections so that it was a bit more intimate and people would be more comfortable participating. Also I would eliminate the portion where students lead discussion, just leads to the leaders actually doing the reading and everyone else just answering their questions.",
