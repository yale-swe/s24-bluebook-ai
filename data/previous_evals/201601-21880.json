   "comments": [
    "Great way to knock out a writing credit for an engineer. The weekly lab reports aren't as bad as you'd think, although it definitely deserves the full credit that it counts as. Required for ABET, but otherwise a solid elective that helps with distributional requirements.",
    "Interesting and useful! Labs are overall pretty cool, if a little tedious sometimes, and the report writing is straightforward once you get the gist of what's expected (only 3-5 pages, with Prof. Brown at least). The 9 AM Monday lecture slot was kind of a bummer, but Brown does a good job of teaching the data analysis and report writing techniques.",
    "This is a pretty good lab course. You learn a lot very quickly about writing better lab reports and determining the best procedures in lab, as you are kind of thrown in the deep end right away. There is a lot of support, and Professor Brown is very concerned with making sure he is available as much as possible. That said, the course is also good for helping you to do better on your own, without asking too many questions, and is forgiving enough that you are not afraid to make mistakes and learn from them. Many of the labs themselves were interesting, while others were obviously less so. Towards the end of the semester the process of performing and writing up pretty dense lab reports became kind of tiresome and uninteresting, though.",
    "Cool experiments that shed light on stuff we have learned in Thermo., Fluids, etc. Don't underestimate the amount of work, though. One long lab report per week should not be taken lightly.",
    "MENG 363L, the fluid and thermodynamics lab course, allows students to engage in foundational experiments while also teaching them how to write scientific lab reports. The course is a learning process. As the semester continues, students learn the reasons for why points were deducted on their first few lab reports in order to score better in the later lab reports. The experiments in this course (i.e. solar\/fuel cell, jet engine) are also very engaging!",
    "Most of You are taking this because You have to but it's actually fairly fun for a lab class and the workload is constant the entire time which is nice because You know what You have to do by the middle of the semester.",
    "Take this lab if you have to for your major. It's cool to see the concepts you learn in fluid mechanics come to life, but this lab is also a lot of busy work. You have to write a report each week in a research oriented fashion, which gets old really fast. Overall though it's not too difficult.",
    "Great lab class that reinforces the thermo and fluids concepts. If you are abet, then you will take it. If you are thinking about it, then this course is a relatively easier 1 credit from the MENG department and teaches you a lot of important and practical skills about MENG concepts.",
    "If you're looking at this class, you probably have to take it for the mechanical engineering major. While this class is very time intensive, it is packed with interesting experiments. Make sure you set aside a day or two each week to finish the lab report; you'll need it.",
    "A lab report every week sounds like a lot, but this class makes writing reports completely automatic by the end of the semester. Some of the experiments are interesting, some of them are very dry. But in general, writing that many lab reports makes you much much better at writing them, which is an incredibly important skill for all engineering disciplines and careers.",
    "This course is fine. There's no sense in me recommending or not recommending this course because you would only (I hope) take it as a major requirement. It was not a huge amount of work, but the work was consistent. Every week, we had to turn in a technical report. They usually ended up being four to six pages long including figures and graphs. The majority of the time spent on these reports was spent in the data analysis\/number crunching. The lab experiments themselves were generally not super difficult or complicated. They were often tedious though, and I found from experience that having a decent amount of sleep is a must. The lectures were kinda unnecessary, and the large majority of the class didn't show up for them. If Prof. Brown were a more resentful guy, he would have stopped showing up himself."
