    "A lot of work, but if you want to learn the language, take it",
    "If you can, take it with Madame Burton. I almost withdrew from my summer course so I would be able to take 140 with her. However, both my french profs at Yale are great, so I doubt you'd go wrong with any professor here. French 130 is a great course to have under your belt. I feel confident reading French texts now, or going to French movies. I find it is a good platform for taking speaking risks off of. If you can do it, you should.",
    "Though it is annoying at first to have to meet every day, in the end you get used to it and in some ways it's nice, as you really don't have time to forget anything before the next class. The workload isn't light, but most nights it's nothing too crazy. If you plan on taking more French or if you need the class for a requirement, it's definitely worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn French because I have personally seen a drastic improvement in my French.",
    "I took it with Burton and I would definitely recommend that. With Koundi? I dunno. I shopped her section and really didn't like it. The course interesting enough, a lot of work, bi-weekly tests, not too hard. I wasn't a fan of all of the material, but a least we get a variety of books and movies. My reading comprehension improved, I think, which is a lot of fun.",
    "Yes, definitely recommended!"
