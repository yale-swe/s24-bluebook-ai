   "comments": [
    "ENGL 126 is perfect for anyone who is passionate about literature, poetry, or wants to learn more about poetry. The class looks in depth at four poets, Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and a modern poet (sometimes Eliot, in my case Yeats). The language is not too hard to understand, especially when compared to what is covered in ENGL 125 and can be a great introduction to English verse.",
    "Don't take it if you're not an English major or planning on being one. You'll get lost in this stuff.",
    "ENGL 126 covers four poets from the 17th century to the 20th century. Professor Bromwich's section covers Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and Yeats. There are four main papers, two of four-page length and two of six-page length, and one or two small extra assignments. There's a lot of discussion, but Professor Bromwich is really good at leading the class in the right direction instead of using simple open-ended questions. I would recommend this course and this professor. You will definitely get a better feel for each poet and what their motives were in each of their works.",
    "This class is a great way to learn how to love the great poets."
