    "Ancient Greek 110 is a solid introduction to the weird and wonderful language of Ancient Greek. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to take up the language.",
    "Most of this course is spent on learning forms, with reading of actual, interesting texts reserved for later terms. It is a delayed gratification model, then, so I see this course appealing most to students who intend to stick with the language rather than just dabbling.",
    "Ancient Greek 110 02 was an intensive survey of pretty much all of introductory Attic Greek grammar. I would recommend it to anyone seriously interested in reading ancient Greek authors in the original; the class would clearly be frustrating to anyone without that motivation."
