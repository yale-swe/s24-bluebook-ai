    "Yes, I would recommend HIST 931 01 to another student. It's a great course to get an insight into the variety of literature in the field as well as into the many topics and problems the field is working on.",
    "Highly recommend! Couldn't recommend highly enough! This course was a great introduction to some of the current questions in the field of History of Science, and more importantly, an introduction to thinking about the role of historians and historical work in addressing issues of social justice.",
    "If you love HSHM (and have an accommodating semester schedule), take the damn class. It's a lot of work, but you get out what you put in. As an undergrad, I felt like I was jumping into the deep side of a pool, but in the best way. The readings are wonderful. The class is wonderful. The grad students are brilliant. It was a 9:25a this semester, but it's worth it if you love the material.",
    "If Henry's teaching it, take it. If Henry's not teaching it...maybe wait and see if he's teaching it the following year."

   "comments": [
    "See all points above--this course helped to develop a way of thinking about key questions of the field through a lens of social justice, which is something I'd definitely like to take with me in my own research moving forward.",
    "Besides introducing me to specific scholars I'm likely to draw on in future work, it was great just to see examples of politically engaged academic research."
