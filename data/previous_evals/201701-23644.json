    "I learned so much about witchcraft in Puritan New England I had a lot of misconceptions coming into the course (burning at the stake! water dunking test!) which were very quickly cleared up. I also learned how to properly analyze historical documents and not take them necessarily at face value (understanding the context they occurred in, potential biases, etc.)",
    "I learned a lot about analyzing historical documents.",
    "I will never look at witchcraft in movies, books, etc. the same. I am so much more critical of representations of witchcraft and witch-hunts, as well as just Puritan culture in general, as a result of taking this class. I feel like an expert on the topic now!",
    "This course offers an in-depth look at colonial New England. The subject of witchcraft allowed us to discuss religion, gender, and politics. We looked at different historical interpretations of the same issue as well as different methodological approaches to studying one issue. For instance, we analyzed historians' use of psychology and sociology."

    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Tannenbaum is wonderful and the readings are great. You will learn so much and have a great time doing it.",
    "Yes I liked it",
    "Absolutely take it if you are at all interested in witchcraft, Puritans, or early New England society.",
    "Take this course! Prof. Tannenbaum is an excellent professor and the subject of witchcraft is fascinating. You'll never be bored in class discussions and you'll learn a lot about colonial America and early New England towns - and New Haven!",
    "The most fun class I've taken so far at Yale. Class conversation flowed easily and interwove with the course readings. Very interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes. Everything about this course is great. Must take this course if you have even a little bit of interest in this topic.",
    "Yes! This is a great history seminar if you want to dive into a subject. We spent a lot of time with primary sources and discussions were always thought-provoking. Witchcraft is so fascinating for thinking about gender and religion and Professor Tannenbaum does a great job of bringing in the modern day relevance of the subject."
