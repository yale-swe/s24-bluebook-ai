   "comments": [
    "If you enjoy French, you'll enjoy French 150. It's centered mostly around literature, and you read for the most part some great French works, and spend most of your time discussing them. Professor Charney is a delight and keeps the class discussions lively. There's also afocus on grammar concepts, which you go through at a pace that's brisk enough to keep from being monotonous but not too fast that you feel like you're falling behind.One note: There's a deluge of work. I had more work in this class than any of my other classes this quarter--honestly, more than in some of them put together. This really should be a 1.5 credit class. The work isn't particularly hard and is graded quite fairly, there's a just a lot of it.",
    "A comprehensive look at advanced French grammar and vocabulary through famous works of literature and film. You'll have ~4 essays, ~5 quizzes, 2 Oral presentations, and a few movies to watch, but trust me, they're all graded fairly easy, and are actually kind of fun.",
    "It's an extremely good basis for French language, grammar, writing and reading. It is a lot of hard work but I definitely recommend it.",
    "For anyone who has comprehensive experience with French grammar and speaking, the class is not challenging content wise. The difficult thing about this class is that it's a lot of assignments, that never die down at any point in the semester. That being said, as long as you keep up with the work, understand the grammatical concepts, and participate in class, it should not be problematic.",
    "I'd definitely recommend to another student who is looking to be more proficient all-around. I felt myself retain and improve a lot just by doing the work that was assigned. This section was particularly engaging in discussions.",
    "It is a rigorous but rewarding course, in my opinion. There was a good deal of daily work so I felt like there was never a break, but overall the work wasn't too difficult and the stories we read we're interesting. Most of class was just discussing short stories and movies.",
    "Yes if you need to review grammar; if not, skip to 160 or 170.",
    "Great class, take it with Professor Charney, would recommend it",
    "French 150 provides a thorough review of french grammar while also improving one's french writing and speaking skills. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially someone who has a firm grasp of the french language but is still a little shaky with some of the grammar concepts.",
    "French 150 is a great course for expanding one's confidence in spoken and written French. Though the grammar topics covered are not new, this course covers the fine details of many different aspects of French grammar. The grammar exercises are tedious and take time; however, though they are not due in class, it is necessary to take them seriously or risk being unprepared for the next test.The works of French literature and cinema covered during the course are diverse, interesting, and never dull. Discussion comes easily for most of the works covered and class meetings can be very enjoyable as students expand their confidence in speaking French while bouncing ideas off one another.I don't know much about the other French 150 professors, but I definitely recommend Mme Charney. She is very enthusiastic about the course and is very helpful in addressing students' questions and concerns."
