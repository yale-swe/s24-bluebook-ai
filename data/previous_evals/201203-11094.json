    "Yes, it is a class which teaches you how to think differently about measurement in nursing research and challenges you to employ this in a practical proposed study.",
    "Yes, I will recommend this course to other students, as instruments are important part of our nursing research. Instruments are cheap ways to measure changes in outcomes that we intend to detect after implementing interventions in nursing research.",
    "N903 is a course pertaining to measurement. I would recommend this course to another student because it is essential for students to have knowledge of measurement when designing research studies and to evaluate research."
