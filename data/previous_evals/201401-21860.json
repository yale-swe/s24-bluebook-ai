   "comments": [
    "The class is a continuation of the first level of arabic, it was in my opinion much easier to manage and be accustomed to than the first level. I would recommend the class to those that are willing to put in the time to focus on the language.",
    "Arabic is really about the professor. So if you like the professor, then you should take it.",
    "If you are considering taking L2 it's because you took L1 and thus have to. I would DEFINITELY recommend Hasmik's L2 class, she is one of the best teachers at this school. She's nice, sweet and really works with you to improve your Arabic. Unfortunately she will not be coming back and the other L2 teacher (Aziz) is horrendous. L2 is not as much work as L1 and it definitely gets easier along the way. Try to find a good teacher, as hard as that may be.",
    "It is great for continuing 110. I would recommend it if you want to learn Arabic and continue on to level 3 the next year.",
    "Yes, it is intensive and great, I hope next year I can move my Arabic to the next level.",
    "Great course. Well structured, fairly tested, and not an overwhelming amount of work. Classes were so much fun to attend, and we learned loads. Hasmik was a brilliant professor. Her classes were the prefect mixture of fun activities, and hard work. It is very easy to get lost in the thousands of rules of Arabic grammar, but Hasmik made sure that never happened. As a result, we learnt the material well, but never felt bored or burdened in class. It's a shame that the Arabic department has decided to bid adieu to their best teacher....",
    "I would recommend ARBC 120 to anyone who enjoyed L1 Arabic - especially if their classroom experience is like what I had with Hasmik. Since she's leaving, I'm not sure what ARBC 120 will be like, but it won't be the same."
