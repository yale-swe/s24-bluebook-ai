    "This class fell apart, and the professors seemed entirely unaware of it. The class is meant to be cumulative. However, Edgar failed to recognize that students did not understand the material in class. When students told him they did not understand the math he was using, he said that they learned linear algebra in high school. No, this is not part of the American high school curriculum! When they stared dumbfounded, he was consistently unable to read the total confusion in the room. Problem sets that followed befuddled students. Students who came early to class got help from TAs (I very imperfect system). TAs would teach students, who would teach one another. Students proceeded to then do fine on the homework, and professors thought this meant they understood the material. Edgar often taught with his back to the class, and failed to discern between what was material to students versus what was \"above and beyond\", leaving students in the dust and shaking their heads in frustration.",
    "I despised this class. We received the same lectures over and over again with new examples. Mostly anecdotal stories from Marian which were interesting, but we didn't feel like we were learning anything.",
    "This was one of the worst academic experiences I've ever had and I've worked in academia for the past three years. The lectures were essentially a re-telling of the reading, which seemed like a waste of time. I effectively stopped doing the readings since there was no point as whatever information needed to be learned could be learned in the lecture. Discussions in the class seemed fairly banal and geared towards those with a firm understanding of economics (e.g. dominated by the joint degrees with SOM). This is fine, but make it clear in the course description that knowledge of economics is needed. Grading for this course seemed completely arbitrary and no one really knew why their grades were reduced or what one needed to do to get an A. This was incredibly evident for the mid-term project, where a number of groups had points deducted for not adding stuff that wasn't even mentioned on the syllabus. If you're into industrial ecology, you have to take this class. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "The course was rather hard to keep up with because of the mathematical concepts that were immediately thrown at us. Retrospectively, I don't think the material was very difficult per se. If there was an extra crash course section on just the mathematical concepts used in the course, I think this course would have been superb. I would advise the instructors to consider the refresher\/crash course next time the class is taught.",
    "Before I came to shop this class, I didn't know what Industrial Ecology was. In the first class, Marian was great, and I realized that Industrial Ecology was exactly what I was interested in. Unfortunately that first class was the best class of the whole semester (except for the two classes in which we brought in the jet fuel guy and the Ingersoll Rand guy - those were great!). I wish there were field trips, and I wish there was weekly worksheets instead of just one worksheet for LCA, one for MFA, etc. Would have better ingrained how they worked into my head. Even after taking the whole course, I don't really feel like LCA, MFA, etc etc are different. I kind of felt like every class was exactly the same - it's just inputs and outputs. A concept I already understand. And I didn't like the midterm project. Wish it was focused on individual companies or cities, and more on flow of materials.",
    "The course material I thought was slow\/repetitive at times and other times presented way too quickly without going into enough depth (mostly those that correlated to homework assignments).",
    "Edgar is incredibly knowledgable, however, he has no idea how to clearly communicate concepts in a entry-level survey course like this. While it is important for us to understand how various models work and the reasoning behind different industrial ecology concepts, his way of communicating this was extremely difficult and often exclusively variable based in a way that made it difficult to understand. The majority of actual learning in this course took place during the problem sets, where extensive help sessions with the TA's and working together with peers helped us tease out the jumbled concepts from lectures into actual applicable knowledge. I think the content of this course is extremely, extremely valuable, and I am still glad I took it. I think the partner teaching might work in the long run, but the continuity of the subject matter and Edgar's ability to communicate with a generalist audience needs work in order to be effective.",
    "Question 15 : Speaking to some of the other students, we all agreed that IE is fascinating and a great systems thinking course, however many of us wondered how we can apply IE to our work. Personally for me IE provided a knowledge foundation that I suspect will simmer over time and may be very valuable in future work opportunities.",
    "Marian and Edgar complemented each other well as instructors. Marian gave more of a practical explanation of the material while Edgar focused on the technical side of the material. It might have been helpful to have one additional class in which there was an algebra review.",
    "Instead of covering too many topics, if more emphasis would have been given on some important concepts like MFA, LCA, circular economy it would have been more helpful.",
    "This was my favorite class.",
    "Marian's lectures were more theory- and case-based. Edgar's lectures often were physics and linear algebra-based. I didn't think their lectures were as complementary as they could have been. The disjointed feeling may have been a result of the two instructors teaching together for the first time. I think I learned most from the assignments. I wish the first input-output assignment was better explained via lessons prior to us being issued the assignment. In contrast, I thought David did an exemplary job explaining the basis for the numbers we saw in the IO matrices, and the class tutorial was helpful for bringing everyone to the same page.",

    "The concepts of this course are great. The course should focus on the concepts not the math behind them. I will never need to use linear algebra in my career, this should either be clearly listed as a prerequisite for the course or should not be required to do the HW assignments.",
    "The assignments were the best way to learn the material (LCA, IPAT, MFA, Input-Output) because the in-class lecture was not sufficient in explaining the concepts. I mostly learned these skills through trial and error while working on the assignments.",
    "Big picture concepts",
    "This course provided new concepts and framework in looking at environmental impact and sustainability which I highly appreciated. I am intrigued to see how I can apply IE concepts in my work in corporate sustainability. I enjoyed the combination of guest speakers, group project and debates in class. I found the assignments also to be valuable as they gave an introduction to different tools and methods to analyse impacts.",
    "I think the coarse provides a broad survey of the importance of industrial ecology. The material is extremely interesting for those interested in industry, energy, climate change, and many other disciplines. The biggest challenge is that as it is a survey coarse, it is not possible to delve deeply into many of the topics.",

The core ideas of I-O, MFA, LCA, etc. are not too hard to understand - this was made clear by the fact that students figured everything out with the help of Chris and Will. However, the class functionally fell apart.",
    "The assignments (with the exception of the Sankey diagram) were too technical for a management degree. The policy questions were much more interesting, valuable and likely to used in the future. Basic understanding of data analysis is great, but sometimes it was too burdensome.",
    "Increased coordination between Edgar and Marian between their classes would be appreciated. The jump from full conceptual to full mathematical application was rough.",
    "Organization",
    "Ridiculous mid-term that was a lot of work with terrible, confusing instructions. The final took me 3 days and I could barely answer the questions...this just reinforced that we learned nothing in the course. I honestly have a lot of respect for Edgar trying to teach us the LCA\/IPAT\/INPUT OUTPUT equations and calculations. It is kind of sad than none of us could master this, we ARE at the grad student level.",
    "I've heard that this course used to be a gem, but the current iteration doesn't work. Its not okay for the instructor to assume that everyone knows linear algebra. Similarly, there's no point in coming to lecture if the only thing going on in lecture is a re-hash of the readings.",
    "Better clarification and help on the quantitative aspects of the course. The quant isn't difficult, but just needs to be clarified better by the professors.",
    "see Q 16",
    "I know that this is an introductory survey course but I'd still prefer to have more skills building components. I like the exercises we did and wish that we had more time to discuss them and do more of those, so that we can actually know how to \"do\" industrial ecology instead of just understanding it conceptually. I also think that we need more detailed, step by step explanations of the mathematical methodologies. I didn't really understand matrix inversion etc. until the second time we covered them (first time was in Input-Output table, second time was in LCA).",
    "Hands down the quantitative side. The pacing of these lectures was WAY too fast, and with the assumption that we knew the math already -- most students did not, and were left asking each other what variables and letters stood for, let alone what we were supposed to do with them. The TAs wound up re-teaching most of the material during their office hours and quantitative problem sets were almost always done in groups, where no one person would be able to complete it on their own (or if they did, they wouldn't understand what exactly they just did in Excel or why they did it).",
    "The lectures on how to do the excel work were very confusing",
    "Assignments should be much more clear. NO linear algebra or matrix multiplication! No one understood what this really meant, we just learned how to do it. The concepts of this course are what is really valuable, and assignments should focus on application of these concepts.",

    "Little more organization would have been nice.",
    "I wish that we were able to go on at least one field trip, or I wish students had a chance to create an MFA using pre-collected data or by visiting a site. This course could be improved by giving students sometime tangible to work with and show for ourselves. In addition, Edgar's lectures were hard to follow. It's not that they didn't make sense, but it's easier to understand what variables represent if he can show us in an well-paced tutorial. I felt that the midterm so tangentially touched upon IE concepts (at least for my country, where there were no footprint datasets available) that it was not helpful for reinforcing the lectures and concepts we had been learning. My group and I did not understand the point of the exercise as far as IE goes.",

The diverse settings (companies, cities, countries, trade flows) that IE addresses also positions the course to easily connect\/intersect with other courses I am taking. I believe I will continue to reference IE in future courses and and work. Coming from a developing country I also see many issues where IE can make a valuable contribution, I am intrigued to see how IE will weave into my body of work.",
    "Industrial ecology is extremely relevant to my background of energy and climate change. It provides a different lens to examine energy and climate change that is not simply economics. Very valuable.",
    "I'm studying energy systems and finance, so understanding the foundations of energy and material flows aligns with my other studies. It was nice to work through LCA\/IO problem sets where we got to calculate GHG impacts from activities because this is something I would want to understand if I were to look at fossil fuel combustion for power plants and emission mitigation measures then calculate GHG impacts. IE is also applicable to facility energy management. Conceptually, this is a relevant course for me. I wish we had more hands-on practice with IE concepts.",
    "I am interested in the Industrial Ecology track, so this course was foundational for my studies."

    "Interested in corporate sustainability and the hard skills that IE provides.",
    "Because this is a course about networks, and it is fascinating to understand how they interact and operate.",
    "I took this class on a whim and I'm so glad I did. As a student interested in big-ag, methods such as material flow analysis provide an incredibly valuable framework in identifying and understanding seemingly understated flows. In toying systems elastic boundaries, we can identify patterns on different scales, note flows that were otherwise not at the forefront of ones attention and better understand the distribution of impact. This knowledge is particularly valuable in that it facilitates framing the interaction between material and flows in order to harness and direct the change we desire. Further material flow analyses of large-scale agriculture might make change more possible.",
    "I am interested particularly in LCA",
    "I intended to study industrial ecology.",
    "Understanding material\/resource flow is key to sustainable living",
    "I found the introductory class more interesting that most of the foundational courses I was considering, and wanted to explore the field.",
    "I am interested in corporate environmental management",
    "I took this course because I plan to incorporate IE into my future career.",
    "I was initially interested in cradle-to-cradle and circular economy concepts that are relevant to my focus in corporate sustainability.",
    "I was interested in the subject material and in taking a class with Marian and Edgar.",
    "I wanted to focus my degree on Industrial Ecology.",
    "I wanted to apply the concepts to energy flow analysis for a given system.",
    "I wanted to understand the Industrial Ecology field to see if this is the direction I want to pursue for further study."

    "Yes.",
    "I had no expectations but I am grateful with the knowledge I gained from this course.",
    "In terms of systems thinking and conceptually, yes. I enjoyed the qualitative aspects and more simple diagrams of material flows. I did not come into the class with quantitative expectations.",
    "More or less. I now have a basic understanding of the fundamental IE tools, but I will need to take future courses to gain an in depth understanding of how to really apply those tools.",
    "Not really. I understand that this is a survey course, but what I personally got out of it could have been presented in only a few lectures.",
    "Yes, I think this course is great and has the characteristics of what I look for in a course: a combination of new thinking, exposure to tools\/methods, and exploration of emerging issues or trends in the field.",
    "I learned many useful tools that can be applied in the future.",
    "No.",
    "Yes, the class covered majority of what I wanted to learn about industrial ecology.",
    "I wish we had more hands-on experience with MFA or setting up an MFA so that it would feel like we actually gained a toolkit to apply to other fields and projects. I think I gained mostly theory-based knowledge, and I'm not sure yet how to apply any skills I've gained.",
    "Yes, I am still interested in studying Industrial Ecology after taking this course. I gained a better understanding of material flows and tools for further analysis."

    "It was fine",
    "Debate with one other classmate was really fun and challenging. We learned a lot and I made a new friend.",
    "Felt like it was a little too much and we were a little blind on where to begin. If it was less (like a company or city as opposed to a country) we could have delved deeper into each aspect. And printing a poster - why does F&ES not have a printing office? I had no idea where to go for this kind of thing which I took for granted (apparently) at my previous institution. I can't believe my classmates paid the amounts they did to print a professional poster at Kinkos. There must be one we can use for free at Yale?",
    "The mid-term project was great and we had good team dynamics.",
    "Learning from peers",
    "(+) Working out the relationship between the tools we were given together. (-) Difficult to coordinate midterm project because it spanned over a break. It would've been nice if there had been checkpoints to hold everyone accountable.",
    "We were able to build on individual strengths and divide labor in a way that efficiently and effectively produced a better product than any of us would individually (for the midterm). I learned a lot from my teammates along the way.",
    "I enjoyed the group project very much and can see how outputs of such projects can be relevant and valuable in analysing",
    "The group work was interesting. We had two group projects. One was a debate, which I found to be a great exercise. The other was a midterm project. The midterm project was interesting and in particular, if it is maintained, then the evening presentations should also be maintained.",
    "I loved the group work.",
    "It was great to get others' perspectives on how to analyze and summarize our data and create some accountability.",
    "The group work was overall positive and allowed for a better understanding of the subject matter."

    "Not worth it until Edgar and Marian smooth out what the class is supposed to convey.",
    "Be prepared for technical assignments; get comfortable with Excel.",
    "Do not be intimidated by the matrix algebra. Talk to David Fonseca and Chris Shurghue.",
    "Probably don't need to take this course...instead read a little about Kalundborg.",
    "don't take it unless you have to. Take CEMS instead.",
    "Probably helpful to get the related courses that will come after it.",
    "This is a good class for students who are interested in sustainable supply chain and sustainable material management. You should be aware that this is a survey course so it doesn't go too deep. Be prepared to do some math but it is not too hard.",
    "Really consider what you want to gain from the course, whether that's an introduction to the concepts or hard mathematical \/ quant skills. If the latter, and you have a recent background in linear algebra, this is for you. If not, you'll only benefit from ~60% of the lectures, and the minority of assignments.",
    "I would not take this course unless you plan to use IE in your future career. The skills are hard to learn and this course only provides you with a basic understanding of the tools. However, it is a fascinating field and Yale is definitely the place to study IE.",
    "Keep an open mind and you will enjoy the ride. As it is a systems thinking course a lot of the 'practicality' will depend on our own ingenuity as practitioners\/ professionals. But I believe the framework IE provides is very valuable. Take it if you're looking to expand your perspective in understanding environmental impact and sustainability.",
    "Take it. It will provide you with a set of practical skills that can be used throughout your career.",
    "I strongly encourage anyone who is somewhat interested in learning industrial ecology to take this course.",
    "Take this course if you have never worked on problem sets analyzing input-output flows or lifecycle analysis. The course is like a general overview of industrial ecology concepts, but you don't walk out with a clearly-defined skillset or professional project.",
    "If you're at all interested in Industrial Ecology, take this course!"
