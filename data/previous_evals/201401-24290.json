    "Very appreciated perspective from a practitioner",
    "Larry knows a LOT about the subject. He's a bit new to teaching, but his concern for student's learningis evident. Fewer text on the slides would help. Guest speakers were great and helped to break it up. Class was more engaging the more interactive it was.",
    "This course was excellent!! I am so grateful to have Mr. Reilly teach for us here and appreciate the administrations effort to meet student energy demands. This is a spectacular addition to the energy course selections. In addition, I find it refreshing to have a experienced professional from the electric utilities sector share his experiences in an unbiased and critical manner. I appreciated his candidness and interest in thoughtful discussion about the future of electric utilities. I would take this course again and again.",
    "Overall, I think Larry did very well considering this was his first time teaching the course. The material covered in this course is desperately needed at FES and Larry is the perfect guy for the job. He has a ton of experience in the electric utilities industry and his insights are top notch. He brought in some excellent guest speakers which really added to the value of the course.",
    "Very valuable course, and I think Larry has a lot of potential, but sometimes it felt like we moved\/glossed over a lot of fine print very quickly that no one but a few people who had interned or worked in the electric industry understood. Thankfully my peers could answer questions, and Larry was welcoming too.",
    "There were no field trips, though it could be interesting to take a Friday visit to ISO-NE in Holyoke, MA.Larry was fantastic overall. He is extremely knowledgeable and articulate. I, and others, spoke of how great it was to have a utility executive teaching the course.He brought in some interesting speakers too.",

    "Course materialsHaving slides to refer back toGreat guest speakers",
    "Larry is a wealth of knowledge. To understand where the energy system is going, we need to know where it's been. Larry has been there and done that for electric utilities his entire career. His lectures were helpful, but the Q&A we did every session was even better.The homeworks were generally very helpful and forced us to dig into the issues.I also appreciated that Larry brought in guest speakers. Based on the feedback Larry collected in class, I think guest speakers will be even better next year.",
    "Practitioner's perspectiveLecturer was responsive to student questions and interests, both in and out of the classroomTight presentation of material in powerpoint decks",
    "The fact that it exists. This is a space a lot of energy people at FES want to enter, and this course allowed us to get a better sense of the industry.",
    "Excellent content that had both breadth and depth.Experienced professional *with a strong a genuine interest* in teaching his studentsHe appreciated the opportunity to teach at Yale and is committed to that purpose.challenging homeworksexcellent reading and supplemental materialVERY organized",
    "Cleared up a lot of difficulty I had understanding the ratemaking process. Really glad the course covered that",
    "Professor Reilly was incredibly knowledgeable and shared a lot of personal industry experience. The other students and Matthew were very helpful in contributing to the discussion, drawing on personal experiences to comment on speakers. The speakers were also a great part of the course.",
    "Larry has great industry experience and can organize a classroom well.He makes a dry subject interesting.",
    "Larry's experience in the field, topics covered, and guest speakers. It was also great getting all of the FES energy nerds into one room. Loved the people in this class and the discussions in class were excellent.",
    "The guest speakers were excellent! Larry's real-world experience and ability to bring in examples from his professional life was great.",
    "The subject matter. Very very useful for the energy people here at FES.",
    "Learning about a topic of immense interest that had not been offered elsewhere at Yale before Larry arrived.",
    "The assignments were all different prompted me to think differently each time. Responses required strategic thinking and role play.The division of course grade between the assignment and final project worked wonderfully because the course load was spread evenly through the semester. Also the course got over earlier than others, which was great too, because it reduced stress towards the end.",
    "Great insider's view of the utility industry."

    "Pace -- too fast for non-expert energists.",
    "I think Larry will get a little more comfortable with lecturing as he gets more practice at it.",
    "More detail on rate making contentMaybe a speaker or two less?",
    "I think the course needs a better framework. As-is, it feels a bit like a description of all the different aspects of the industry. Which is fine, but it would be better if he could put them in a larger context. How does the electric utility compare to other regulated utilities? What is the future? Just zoom, provide a framework that helps us to understand generally how these various things fit together. More towards theory.",
    "there are no aspects I feel need particular improvement. This was a great first run.further thought could be put into who is invited to guest speak, and some lecture segments could be replaced with either different topics or further depth into topics we covered.",
    "Sometimes the classes were a bit of information overload. The slides were all very busy, which is a good thing if we want to go back and reference them in the future, but difficult to manage when actively in class.",
    "At times the 3 hour class could seem very long. There was also not a lot of opportunity to see how I was doing in the class, and it was hard as an undergraduate to feel like I could match the experience that some of the graduate students brought to the table. I feel like I would have benefited from an exam to show that I had mastered the material, as the problem sets were out of limited points and it was very easy to do poorly on them by missing a question or two.",
    "Sometimes lectures dragged on.",
    "I think Larry's lecture structure, timing, and delivery could use some work. However, it was his first time teaching so I can't blame him too much for that.",
    "The homework needs to be better tied to the course material",
    "The grading on the final project felt a little unfair...like Larry only gave us credit for the parts of our paper that he had prior experience with and thus felt able to assess.",
    "Probably the lecture delivery. Powerpoints were nice but I felt like we could have taken out a couple lectures and focused on the less obvious things (e.g. rate making, PUCs), and gone a little more slowly over those.",
    "Probably some earlier deadlines on the term project to ensure groups are making progress.",
    "Need more focus on tools to analyze different problems facing utilities. Sometimes it seemed like we were just going down a huge list of bullet points.",
    "Make the slides more interesting. If possible, break into 2 lectures per week. 3 hours of monotonous slides is tough to process."

    "I'm interested in how utilities can solve many of the problems facing countries on the energy front, and am majoring in Economics and Environmental Studies.",
    "I'm interested in utility-scale energy efficiency programs and this was the perfect class to round out my experience at Yale. It is critical to understand the inner-workings of the utility industry to enact change in the energy sector. This class provides that.",
    "Understanding utilities and the regulatory systems in which they live is essential if you want to work in energy!",
    "Energy class for an energy person",
    "My studies are focused on energy. Understanding monopolistic utilities is critical in expediting the world's transition to a competitive market place for energy.",

    "I should have worked in a group for the first two homework assignments. they were challenging and I should have recognized the need to get help from the TA or meet with friends.",
    "Advantages are that we were able to accomplish a pretty detailed project in a short period of time. Five heads are better than one.Disadvantages are that it's always difficult to coordinate meeting times. Also, the quality of the final product depends heavily on people's commitment. It's tricky to coordinate input from five different people for a paper, and have the paper appear professional.But, in the end that's a life skill we'll all have to deal with in the real world anyways. So it's a good thing to practice now.Overall, I think the pros of groupwork definitely outweigh the cons.",
