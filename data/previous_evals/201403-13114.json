    "I would highly recommend the course. Professor Strebeigh was amazing, and I learned an incredible amount from him.",
    "Take it; don't be a coward. Don't take 114. 120 is worth it and manageable.",
    "ENGL 120 is a good and fun course which exposes you to the techniques of creative non-fiction writing. Prof Strebeigh is a passionate and engaging lecturer, who is excellent in teaching and in inspiring in us a love for writing. It was a challenging course for me because I was not used to writing in a creative manner (having not done so for a good number of years), but I feel that I came away from the course with a better grasp of creative writing techniques and personal style. It was also painful having to draft and redraft the essays every single week - especially amidst competing obligations throughout the semester. A LOT of self-discipline and time management is required to stay on top of this course. I recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in creative non-fiction (writing along the lines of The New Yorker). :)",
    "POSITIVELY. STREBEIGH WILL SEND YOUR WRITING THROUGH THE ROOF. DEFINITION OF COLLEGE WRITING CLASS.",
    "I would definitely recommend Engl 120 to others. Before taking this course, I did not think of myself as a creative writer or essayist. I could write research papers and analysis essays, but was never comfortable with creative writing. However, I felt that this was a valuable skill I needed and wanted to obtain, and I could not have been more glad that I chose to do 120 over 114. Discussions during class were insightful and fully engaging, especially since class sizes were relatively small. We analyzed published pieces (mostly from the New Yorker), and figured out what made these pieces great, how did the author draw in the audience's interest, and various ways the author conveyed his\/her point. Everyone's writing speed is different, but the class is relatively fast-paced with an essay due every week(alternating between draft and final). The grading scale may be slightly harsh, but I've learned so much from this class that it was very much worth it. Even if it was difficult at times for me to transfer the skills we learned in class into my own writing, I am now aware of what makes a great modern essay piece, and this allows me to appreciate them more than I ever could before.",
    "I would highly recommend English 120 to other students. It is the perfect class for freshmen who consider themselves decent writers but who a) want to try avenues other than literary analysis and b) want to put their writing to the test.",
    "If you are serious about learning to write better, take this class. It is not academic writing, but is applicable in a much broader sense. The format of the class is very repetitive, but also very effective. Your essays will challenge you and by the end you will feel like a writer who is very much in control of your craft. The readings are also all very interesting.",
    "You will learn more about writing than you ever did in high school. Instead of writing an essay and then learning what you did wrong, you learn the different tactics to put into your essays even before you write them. You will read a lot of good writing by impressive authors, but the work load is heavy. If you're serious about writing, take this course.",
    "ENGL 120 was everything I could have dreamt of and more as one of my first courses at Yale. The course was very interesting and the sort of enjoyable challenging that's fueled by a desire to improve. I learned so much as the class progressed. I highly recommend the course.",
    "If you get in, TAKE IT. A lot of work, but an absolutely wonderful class. Strebeigh is the god of creative nonfiction. The best professor I've had at Yale so far. Readings were entertaining to read, and discussion in class was dynamic and enjoyable. Ten out of ten, would recommend.",
    "Be very careful which teacher you choose for English 120, because they can make or break your experience. Regardless of whom you choose, english 120 is not an easy course and you must be prepared to work very hard. The class isn't geared towards literature, but almost only towards writing. You'll study New Yorker style writing in order to improve your own.",
    "Yes definitely! Learning to be a better writer is necessary and this class teaches you."
