   "comments": [
    "The course was fun and interesting. William kept us working hard but also kept class fun.",
    "A fun, intensive course in writing and analyzing.",
    "ENglish 114 is one of the most important classes a freshman should take. Even if you were a good writer in high school, that fact is you probably don't really know how to write at the college\/real world level. This class will help you become a real writer. Recommend it to all students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all students, as argumentative writing is a skill that is extremely useful for many other classes as well. I really did enjoy writing the papers, especially the research paper. I feel that I have improved a LOT since the beginning of the semester as a result of the numerous workshops, peer reviews, office hours and just being able to practice consistently. For this section, our class had so much fun watching the South Park episodes. I especially enjoyed the first lesson when we deeply analyzed the revenge quotes taken from Call of Duty.",
    "Fantastic class especially if you are as bad a writer as I am",
    "I would recommend this as an introductory composition course."
