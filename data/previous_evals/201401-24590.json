    "I would definitely recommend this course to Accounting PhD students and other business PhD students alike. Not only did the papers provide me with interesting topics in accounting research, it helped me put myself in the writers' perspectives and look at how they viewed a research question, whenever I had to present the authors' work. This course will really help develop your public speaking skills, your ability to address questions on-the-fly, and help you develop a better academic mindset, with which to approach your own research."

    "Jake's course has been extraordinarily important in my academic development, in my personal opinion. His approach towards looking at papers really put a different angle on how I thought about research topics and how to approach others' work in the field. I feel that Jake's teachingmethodology was useful in helping us think about the papers during the presentations with a very rigorous academic lens. This will be needed in developing well written and well developed research of the quality required to reach top journals in the future. His course provided me a wonderful foundation in empirical thought that will serve me both as a PhD student and later on as a researcher."
