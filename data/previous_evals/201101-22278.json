   "comments": [
    "At least shop the course, this is truly a unique opportunity, there are very few students so you definitely get to actually learn something rather than sit back in lecture and take down notes furiously. Highly recommend this class, be sure to go to office hours, and don't hesitate to reach out to Professor Fotos, very nice guy!",
    "Take this class--although it will largely depend on your seminar peers, the course material is interesting and relevant regardless of whether you are interested in American policy, global politics, or institutional design... plus the guest speakers were a nice touch.",
    "Interesting seminar. Readings and discussion about federalism and public administration in the first part of the course were fascinating for me. Second half of case studies was ok. Professor Fotos does bring in, or has the class web conference with, great guests. Check the syllabus to see if you are interested in the material. It's worth shopping.",
    "If you regard yourself as a real \"political scientist\" then you and I don't think along the same lines and I don't know how helpful my opinion can be.I probably wouldn't recommend this class because its main takeaways are from the readings. The actual classes are usually good discussions, which, if you find yourself at the right table in the dining hall, you could have over a meal. The two classes we had talking to US Army Personnel were pretty awesome and very valuable. I don't know if they justified taking the class or not, but if you're into that sort of thing, take the class.",
    "This course is very different from others at Yale- it starts with a rather rhetorical, ideological, analytical framework for institutional design (that is, the Ostrom framework), and then scales up to deal with two major case studies: Disaster relief and emergency management, and counterinsurgency. The strengths are certainly the real world applications. You can really apply some of this ideology of institutional design to the real world, and use it as a lens through which to evaluate our government's performance."
