    "No, I wouldn't, not yet, maybe it will be better in a few years.",
    "Picture Book to Graphic Novel is exactly what it says - you read picture books for the first half of the course, then read graphic novels. In seminar, you discuss topics such as the formal layout of the comic and what that does for the message the author is trying to convey, the picture book\/graphic novel as a genre, some cultural history. A lot of discussion on formal attributes, I guess, since it is cross listed as an art history course too and because that is one of the things that defines the graphic novel. There was a theme for every class meeting though not so much an overarching theme for the course overall. You write three papers doing close analysis of the texts. An enjoyable class because the material is accessible and fun, and the professors are great at leading interesting discussions.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE ITIt is so rare to take a course as a undergraduate in which you're charting uncharted territory. It was truly a pleasure to take such a novel course. Every class meeting was an exciting adventure! Not to mention, you get to engage with texts such as Curious George and Watchmen in refreshing and serious ways. TAKE IT!",
    "It is unfortunate that this class may never be offered again, but if it is YOU MUST TAKE IT. It was absolutely amazing, and I looked forward not only to the reading and class discussion each week but also to the papers.",
    "Take the course. We read graphic novels that will keep you flipping pages, flipping back to pages, and straight flippin.' But in all seriousness, this class tackles a field that is pretty young so you feel as if you are contributing to a conversation and adding new thought through discussion and papers.I thought it was refreshing from the other lit classes that I have taken because we get to stare at pictures for once.",
    "I would recommend this class if you like analyzing visually and are looking for something somewhere in between art history and english.",
    "absolutely worth taking---definitely out of the box.",
    "I didn't really enjoy this class very much. It meets at a confluence of art history, art, and english that allows a bunch of different views to come to the table. Unfortunately, it didn't really work out that way. Class discussion never really flowed, and I rarely felt that my own (or other) contributions, while interesting, were building towards a better understanding of the text. Also, there was an unforeseen delay in grading near the end of the class, resulting in not having the second papers back before submitting the finals. It was very frustrating not having that feedback, especially because working with image and text simultaneously is difficult to manage."
