    "Probably one of the best taught classes at Yale! I would describe it as close to perfect. Be aware that Chinese is difficult and requires one-two hours of work every night\/morning. However, the teachers are incredibly patient and enthusiastic. The other students in my section are likewise enthusiastic and made class immensely enjoyable. The grading is easy, but you will still be shocked by how much Chinese you've learned by the end of the semester. Highly, highly recommend if you are willing to put in the work!!",
    "If you are interested in Chinese and can commit to the workload, then take this class! The teachers are all enthusiastic and you'll find yourself being able to hold basic conversations in Chinese after just a few weeks. There will be a quiz\/oral presentation\/test every day, as well as homework every night, which includes workbook questions, listening exercises and memorizing chapter dialogues. But if it weren't for this daily work ethic, you wouldn't learn Chinese as quickly as you do in this class. The work in this class is difficult to manage when midterms and projects from your other classes roll around but don't be discouraged if you do badly on a couple of quizzes - there are so many that it won't be detrimental to your final grade. If you mess up an oral presentation, don't despair because you can redo them with your TA until you get a 10\/10 (I'm not sure how exactly this is factored into your final grade but it is). And if you have time, go to the language tables that the Chinese teachers host. You'll get to know them personally and practice Chinese in a relaxed setting. Also, it shows the teachers your interest, which is especially invaluable if you decide to apply for summer fellowships.",
    "Definitely take it if you want to take a language. I know ppl always tell you Chinese is tough, but actually if you like it, you'll find it very rewarding and empowering.",
    "This class was rigorous but worth it. It is incredible how much we have learned. I would only recommend this class to someone who has a very high level of commitment and who will be persistent when they are going through periods of difficulty. I wish that I had a better grade in Chinese, but I am extremely proud of how much I have learned and look forward to continuing with the language.",
    "ONLY take Chinese 110 if you have time (so do not take 4 other classes in addition to Chinese). This class is very time consuming but it is incredibly helpful. I can carry out a simple conversation with my Chinese friends and that is incredibly satisfying.",
    "It's an amazing course with great instructors. Take it if you need a language credit.",
    "It is a lot of work, but you receive a lot of individual attention and improve very quickly."
