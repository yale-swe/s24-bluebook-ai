    "Absolutely take this class if you have any interest at all in film or the 1960s\/70s.",
    "I would very highly recommend this course. The films are excellent and a very engaging jumping-off-point for discussion. Workload is manageable. Papers are very easily personalized and a wonderful learning experience. Professor Kerbel is a lovely human being. Plus: highly exclusive 35mm screenings of such classics as \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and \"Nashville\". Take this class!",
    "Amazing class, absolutely take it if you get the chance. Michael is a wonderful person and he puts everything he's got into making the class a great experience. We watched a large number of fascinating and highly entertaining movies (Psycho, Dr. Strangelove, The Graduate, Jaws, Taxi Driver, etc.) and explored them as art, literature, popular entertainments, and historical artifacts. There's too much reading but you can always do what you can and it's all very interesting. Fun, open-ended paper assignments, never felt like too much work, grading is not bad at all. The class group will determine what your experience is like to a great extent, but given Michael's selection process you should have good company.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. You get to explore highly interesting films in long papers any way you want, the flexibility is great, although you can get away with a lot too. So it is, as with most courses, what you make of it. Certain readings are phenomenal and I recommend doing as many as you possibly can, although the syllabus is really too ambitious.",
    "Definitely take this class! You'll watch some great movies and learn a lot about American culture and history during the 1960s and 70s. The readings are fun, light, and easy to read. The work load is manageable, and Professor Kerbel is an excellent professor. The screenings can be a little bit much, but you have to go to them. Overall, FILM 438 was a great course! If you can get in, don't pass up the opportunity to take this class!",
    "This class is absolutely fantastic. The class consists of a weekly seminar. Kerbel definitely leads the discussion, but i think that this is for the better, as his insights consistsntly surprised the class an led to interesting discussion. It is in no way a lecture, though-- he is most definitely a guide. I really enjoyed this class-- by far my favorite one of the semester, and among the favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. Professor Kerbel is kind, enlightening, and totally interested in the subject matter. The films are interesting, with a range of classics as well as more avant garde films. The papers were a lot of fun, and I enjoyed the readings-- I was always sad when I didn't get to finish them. This was one of those classes that made me feel truly intellectually curious-- I loved the work, and didn't do it only thinking abou my grade or just to complete things. My favorite part about the class was Kerbel's insistence on looking at the films' historical contexts, as well as how the films reacted to and responded to one another. Not all film classes have such a wonderful mix of literary and historical analysis."
