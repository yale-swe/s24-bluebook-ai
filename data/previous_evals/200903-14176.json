    "Refugee Law is a perfect class for people interested in going to law school or people interested in refugees. If you don't fit either of these, then don't apply--the workload is WAY too high if your heart isn't in it. Otherwise, an amazing class. Take it!",
    "Take it. It was incredible!",
    "great class. LOT's of work. great people (really, i've never had a class at yale with better people than this). the work load is INCREDIBLE at times -- you have to team up with others to deal with it. teaches you how to make a legal argument. comparable to professor klevorick's class on antitrust law -- they both use a classic \"law school\" class format.",
    "If you do not apply for this course, you are an idiot. If you do not take this course, you are an idiot. Sorry to be so frank, but this class is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. I have learned so much about Refugee Law and Policy, more than I have learned in any other class. I don't care if you aren't even interested in the subject, TAKE THE CLASS. Professor Dufresne is intimidating, but don't worry, she's all bark, less bite. It's a lot of reading and work, but it is SO worth it. TAKE IT.",
    "Absolutely. It's a lot of work, but don't be intimidated by it. If you're willing to commit time to it you'll do fine, and it's definitely worth it. By far the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Refugee law and Policy starts with an overview of some basic legal concepts and a survey of the most important American legislation relating to refugees. The bulk of the course is reading cases and debating them in class--hashing over whether they were consistent with law and precedent, what their policy implications would be, etc. There are two final projects, one policy-based and one law-based: researching and proposing a reform to the American refugee system, and writing a legal brief. But most of the work is in the weekly \"problem sets\" that generally involve writing up your thoughts on a complicated legal or philosophical issue--I don't think I've ever written so much for a class in my life, but Professor Dufresne is basically grading on the quality of your ideas and not a polished product (except w\/the final brief).",
    "YES YES YES BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN AT YALE. changed my life. it's a lot of work, but it's totally worth it.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT! This is the most demanding class I have ever taken, but it is undoubtedly the best course at Yale. Professor Dufresne is extremely knowledgeable and engaging. She conducts the class like a typical law school class, but she only does this so that her students can learn the materials and can be trained to think like a lawyer. She really wants you to get something out of the class, and she puts a lot of effort into the class. She was extremely helpful and always carved out some time out of her super busy schedule so that she could meet with us and answer any questions. The course really challenged me intellectually, and I am so glad I took this course. The workload is a lot, but it is definitely manageable if you put a lot of time into it. If you are not serious about refugee law or just want to take this class for fun, then you should not take this class.",
    "A look at US policy regarding refugees",
    "If you can get it, absolutely. A word of warning though that this class may take over your life, but it is worth it.",
    "This class is simply incredible. I don't think a single of my classmates who took this class thought it was not the single best class they had taken at Yale. Of course it is a tremendous amount of work. Not only do you have plenty of reading and basically you need to write 5 - 10 pages every other week, but you also have to prepare to sumamry every single case you read in the textbook and be ready at any moment to give oral arguments on a small selection of the cases that she tells you the week before. All that said, it is managable, and most students do fine. Just the class simply becomes a priority. The real amazing part about the class is that students enter it so well prepared, that it is unlike any other seminar you have ever had. The conversations are all on point, the students and professor Dufresne make exceptionally brilliant comments, and usually (I know this because professor Dufresne described past classes) the students become extremely close and are constantly working with each other to prepare for class. It is exactly, exactly how a seminar should be. You will join the Dufresne cult if you take the class, but it will be worth it. Honestly, I probably know more about refugee law now than some lawyers in the field! and that applies to virtually all of my classmates. If you want to do law or humanrights anything, this is definitely a life-changer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as it was my favorite course last semester. Professor Dufresne is amazing (engaging, wonderful in discussions, with a really great grasp of the material). The material is interesting, especially if you have an interest in law. There is a lot of homework, so be prepared to spend 5-10 hours a week doing reading, preparing the homework etc (but your grade is also mostly based on this homework, and it is definitely not busy work).",
    "Work is substantial, but is not tedious or mindless reading. A lot of original thinking exercises. Dufresne is both knowledgeable and passionate about her field, and the class quickly turns into a community bent on keeping each other afloat. Previous experience with law classes is helpful but certainly not necessary. Work is front-loaded, so the first five or so weeks of class involve homework equivalent to at least 2 full classes, but it levels off to some degree as the semester wears on and you learn how to deal with the work. Don't start with it Credit D, because there's no way to half-ass the class. Either you do the work and do well, or you don't and end up dropping the class. Overall, it's a great class, but be aware when picking the rest of your schedule that this will demand the majority of your time.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student, but please be aware that I put more work into this class than into my other three classes combined. If you are willing to devote your semester to this class, you will be rewarded. This class was the best I've taken at Yale, and I don't know if I can possibly find anything in the next three semesters I have left to top it. You'll get as much out of it as you put into it, and by the end of the semester, I don't think I was the only one who had dreams about asylum applicants and social group constructions. Professor Dufresne is fantastic-- so engaging and passionate and fun. This is the only seminar I've taken where we've all gotten to know each other and groups of students met regularly and voluntarily outside of class to prepare. Absolutely take it if you can get in, but make sure you don't have a heavy workload that semester.",
    "The course was amazing. I usually don't like seminars, but this was honestly one of if not the best classes I have ever taken. Partly because Professor Dufresne picked great students for her class. Everyone was so great about helping each other and sharing ideas; no one was interested in keeping their thoughts to themselves in order to seem smarter. Many of us met at least once a week outside of class on our own just to discuss the cases and better understand and argue the material. This was the only class where this was even considered, partly because the class required so much work that everyone needed the extra help but mostly just because everyone was so great and really wanted to help. The material itself was unbelievably engaging. Almost every week I found myself talking about the cases or topics with my friends, suitemates, family, or continue talking about it with the other students in the class even when the class was over. I definitely drove my parents crazy as I couldn't talk about anything else except the final case over Thanksgiving break. I've never put so much effort into a course (and most of that effort was just in thinking about the cases, not in any actual writing or reading work, even though that was extensive as well). The course was just so interesting, you couldn't help but think about it even when you didn't have to. The class was unbelievable not just because of the material or the other students, but mostly because of Professor Dufresne and how she taught and structured the class. She kept every class extremely interesting and intense - their wasn't a day when I wasn't anxious about being called upon, and yet when she did call on you, whatever you said was met with a smile and encouragement. As scared as you were about being called upon, and prepared extra hard just for that moment, you weren't worried about being humiliated. It truly was just about the learning experience, which I greatly appreciated. Professor Dufresne was the best professor I have ever had the pleasure of having. She made each kid strive to do better and work harder, because they honestly wanted to, not just in the hopes of getting a good grade. We all had several conversations about her with each other outside of class, and they all revolved around how much each of us loved her and thoroughly enjoyed being in her class. You will not find another professor who cares more about the students or who inspires this kind of effort and interest from the students about the topic. Taking this class was honestly the best decision I've made at Yale. I can't even express how much it meant to me or how unbelievably great it was, and I came in not that interested in law or especially refugee law. Professor Dufresne just made it an unbelievable class.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. You will not regret it. Be prepared to dedicate yourself to the workload - the class is \"front-loaded,\" and that comes as a relief towards the end of the term - and don't be intimidated by the firstfew assignments. Do your reading. Get sleep the night before classes so you can talk intelligently. Stay on your toes and prepare to be called on at a moment's notice. And care - the failings of our immigration and prison systems are striking, and you better want to fix them."
