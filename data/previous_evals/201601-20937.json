    "Seema Ji is incredible and one of the kindest professors I've met at Yale. She went out of her way to make non-native students feel welcome in the class. There were lively discussions every week about the nature of the Indian identity in the context of the diaspora. There were several papers\/reflections that had to be written and a presentation based on an interview we conducted with members of the Indian immigrant community in and around Connecticut\/New York. We read numerous pieces of diaspora literature and watched many films. Every year, Seema Ji also invites all the Hindi students to her house for lunch, which was an incredible experience. Overall, this class was great!",
    "Take this class! It's a great way to improve your Hindi, and especially if you're an Indian immigrant yourself, get in touch with your roots. Seema Ji is a wonderful professor, and the workload is fairly light.",
    "Seema Ji is a great teacher and an amazing person. Very well taught class with very interesting material. Overall, the class is very rewarding. Would definitely recommend this class."
