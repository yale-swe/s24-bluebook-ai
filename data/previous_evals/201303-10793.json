    "It's a survey course in Spanish literature from the Middle Ages to touching upon the Baroque and focusing the most on Golden Age Spain. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it's a perfect 5th class with extremely reasonable amounts of homework, very manageable paper\/exam load, and interesting class material every time.",
    "Definitely take this class. By far my favorite Spanish class that I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class to students studying Spanish who would like to challenge themselves because the Spanish used in the readings is very antiquated. But still good because it's nice to see where the language comes from.",
    "If you're looking for an \"easy\" literature course, this might not be it - just because some of the text we read are so old and not in modernized spanish. But, you should still take this course. You read some very important (and some not-really important) works from the time periods, and it's overall a great course. Not much writing - just three 3-4 page essays - that you can usually write about without a problem. I honestly don't have much to say as to why you shouldn't take it...",
    "Yes! Professor Poole is an amazing professor and this class will expose you to a new culture! It is a class that is very do able and a great opportunity you shouldn't miss out on.",
    "I would summarize this class as a small seminar on Spanish Literature between the years of about 1200 and 1680. It is a pretty standard seminar format, where you read the works one night, then discuss them the following class, but there is not a lot of reading assigned every class, since the professor does need time to go over the context of the class. However, the readings to take a little while to do since the Spanish is outdated so there are different words and grammatical structures. Overall, I would say that is a pretty low intensity way to work on your Spanish reading and writing (there are three essays throughout the course. And i would say that is not as intimidating as the course title implies, and in fact it is actually a lot of fun.",
    "This course is amazing, made so by an amazing professor. I think Medieval literature gets a bad reputation for not being relevant to modern day texts but it is the heart of everything we read today. This course did a wonderful job of proving that. The pace was perfect, we read some awesome texts and even watch a wonderful movie adaptation of a popular work. Great class, take it!",
    "It was less work\/ easier than I expected, and the papers were graded less harshly than I had anticipated. A good L5 option if you're looking to complete your requirement. There was more focus on history than I thought there would be, so if you love literature it might not be the best option. Other than that, though, it was a very manageable workload.",
    "An inevitable problem with courses like this is that everyone's Spanish is at a different level. There will be native speakers in the class as well as people who have been taking Spanish for two years. I don't think this was too much of a problem, as Prof. Poole makes his lectures very understandable. If you are comfortable conversing in Spanish and willing to read with a dictionary on hand, you should be fine.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who would like an overview of Spanish literature in an accessible and interesting way.",
    "The class is an intriguing high-level spanish course with some challenging literature, but a manageable course load."
