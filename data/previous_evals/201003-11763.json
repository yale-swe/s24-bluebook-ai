   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class, taken with Safille. My Spanish actually improved, and it was nice to be in a more intimate environment.",
    "I would highly recommend Spanish 130 for a fellow student, as the class was fun and interesting as well as educating.",
    "Fast moving, but not too difficult high-school style spanish course. I would recommend it for someone trying to fulfill their language requirements for sure. Steady half hour per night work, but nothing too bad at all.",
    "This class will improve your grammar, saying that, I will also say you will do A LOT of worksheets and not necessarily a lot of speaking. But Prof. Safille makes it all worth it! She's amazing!",
    "A great review of Spanish grammatical concepts.",
    "Spanish 130 03 was a great course! I genuinely feel that I have learned more about the Spanish language in this one course than I did through all of my high school years. Professor Safille was absolutely amazing and it was a joy to come to Spanish class every morning. The work load was manageable and I enjoyed many of the lectures and readings. The class ended with a wonderful film that was inspiring and interesting. Overall, the class is a great enrichment of the Spanish language for intermediate level speakers.",
    "If you're reading this, then you're most likely choosing between different sections of Spanish 130: in short, if your schedule can manage it, take the section with Safille (though the section would not be worth failing to take another class in which you are very interested). Even though the class was held during the wee hours of the morning (read: 9:20-10:10), the excitement and energy of Safille ensured that no one fell asleep, or was disinterested. She's a fantastic teacher, and I heartily recommend her section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a fellow student. It is good for a student who has taken four years of high school spanish and understands written and spoken spanish fairly well. It was a great class and the class interactions lend to a better learning environment."
