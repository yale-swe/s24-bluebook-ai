    "This class provided a good introduction of mental health and covered many of the core topics relevant today. I would have liked to see more connection to the \"big picture\" and current practice - the curriculum often felt fragmented with review of seminal articles and themes but not as much connective tissue between them.",
    "I loved this course. I have no background or experience with mental health, so at times I felt like I was in over my head. However, Megan was an incredible professor. She did a great job of explaining the material and engaging us in discussion. She presented on relevant topics. The assignments were interesting and helped me delve deeper into the class topics.",
    "This was an excellent class- the class was always so engaged in the topic at hand. I loved breaking out into groups and learning from my classmates as we attempted to work through difficult problems and find solutions to them. The orientation toward policy change and advocacy worked well, especially given the current political climate and the class' interests. I also really liked hearing about people's interests during their presentations.",
    "This class met my overall expectations. It made me really think about the challenges and the complexities in delivering appropriate mental health care to those who need it most. In general, the readings were disconnected from the lectures and the course assignments were also very different from the lectures. It was as if we were simultaneously managing two different classes. Because of time, I stopped reading the articles and just participated more in class to understand the concepts.",
    "The content and readings were very interesting. Instructor was very well-versed in the subject, kind, and engaging. The TA is fantastic and very responsive to students. The atmosphere between the students, though, was not warm or welcoming- often felt combative. I often hesitated to volunteer in class because fear of judgement or criticism from other students. This was unfortunate, as I really enjoyed the instructor and the subject.",
    "Very interesting material, but discussions could be better",
    "Overall, really great and engaging course. I wish the key concepts and interventions were a little more outlined, it would be helpful in writing our papers and incorporating key themes into our interventions.",
    "Great course! Strengths - allowed people to engage with their interests. Utilized various methods to engage with course material. Informative and interesting course.",
    "I really enjoyed the structure of this class, as it was very different from my other classes and very focused on discussion of the concepts. I did find the reading list for each week somewhat heavy, but I was so interested in the material that I always enjoyed completing the readings. The class discussions were almost always very thoughtful and I felt that my comments and questions were welcome and encouraged. I generally enjoyed the homework assignments for this class, and I was thankful to find out that instead of weekly discussion question assignments, we were expected to engage with the material throughout class discussion. I thought the student presentations throughout the semester were very engaging and an excellent way to have us students learn from each other. I also enjoyed some of the in-class exercises such as the family exercise on trying to get our families into mental health care, as it illuminated the many significant barriers to receiving quality mental health care in the U.S.",
    "Wonderful.",
    "Great combination of lecture\/discussion. Strengths: professor expertise, good class dynamic and intersting well presented information Only con: a lot of hours of reading",
    "One of the most organized and well presented courses I have taken. Covers a lot of ground and offers nice introduction to ways of looking at social and cultural factors in mental health and illness, whether it be childhood factors, ethnic, racial, gender, economic, social and so forth. Lots of discussion of mediator and moderator effects which I was unfamiliar with before.",
    "A nice, friendly environment in which to learn about mental health from a public health perspective.",
    "This course was excellent in setting foundational understanding of the public health intersection with mental health, as well as the nature of the policy and political framework around the discipline. I enjoyed learning so much about the different areas and demographic groups (age, sex, race, etc) affected by different forms of mental illness. Professor Smith provided us with a wealth of information but pushed us to understand patients and families as well as policy makers and political forces.",
    "- wasn't enough focus on cultural factors - too much packed into each class - good reading suggestions - enjoyed learning about Dr Smith's own work",
    "Instructor is great, reading materiels are good.",
    "This course is probably the best course YSPH has to offer. I was extremely impressed by both the breadth and depth of the lectures and readings. I thought the workload was very fair.",
    "It was a great class. Good reading, assignments, lecture\/discussion breakdown-- everything."

    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Capable lecturer, although it would be great to find ways to improve classroom participation. It often felt like she was pulling teeth to get a response.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan is a great professor. She's so well-versed in the topic and does an incredible job of presenting the material and engaging students. She's very approachable and always willing to meet outside of class. She does incredible work.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Professor Smith is a passionate, considerate, inspiring, and thoughtful professor. She encouraged students' sincere engagement with the material and issues at hand.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan is great and really understanding of situations that come up (especially if a topic of discussion is triggering). She allows everyone to speak and for some of us who do not openly engage in conversation in class, it was refreshing to always be supported by the professor. Her grading of papers and assignments was also enlightening for she never was in disagreement with the analysis, but rather understand your viewpoint and suggested another, if she had one. She treated us with respect, and that was appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Fantastic instructor who was engaging, welcoming, and very well-versed in the subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Fantastic, kind and knowledgeable. Very encouraging of students, and was so knowledgeable of the material and the field overall. Students were a bit timid to participate, and discussions could have been better",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Overall really great and engaging. Readings were interesting and relevant. Maybe more focus on the guiding questions to anchor the discussion.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Great professor! Focused on students learning content and engaging with material as opposed to grades, which fostered a positive environment for rich discussion and great lectures.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Professor Smith is an outstanding professor. Her knowledge of the public health-mental health field is phenomenal and her presentation style was well-organized and exceptionally clear. As someone who often hesitates to speak up in class, I felt very comfortable asking questions and offering feedback or opinions when I had them. In addition, she was very accommodating in setting up times to meet or otherwise offering useful and thoughtful feedback. I do wish that she discussed more of her research throughout the semester, as she conducts very interesting research projects and it's always helpful to connect class concepts and themes with real-world research in New Haven.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0She's phenomenal.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan is an excellent professor! Great mix of lecturing discussion and class activities",

    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Professor Smith was amazing in her delivery of the material and quite comprehensive of the material needing to be covered. Her knowledge of the material was sound, and was open to student participation and questions, providing excellent and challenging responses. Professor Smith brought in outside expertise for a few subjects and well incorporated students presentations into the courses as well, providing framework herself and allowing others to flesh out other areas. Hearing about her research was additionally amazing to hear, as it incorporated well with a few items we learned during the course.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Smith provides dynamic lectures and is a leader in her field. She was responsive to students' questions and comments. Provided great feedback on assignments.",

    "Good introductory course on key topics on mental health research.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The topic is so interesting, and the professor is amazing.",
    "The course encapsulated the varying challenges that are presented to those of differing social and cultural backgrounds as it pertains to mental health. Each class is devoted to a certain topic of interest (i.e. prison, babies, immigrants, etc.) and explores each concept individually.",
    "An interesting overview of mental health topics in the framework of public health and social determinants of health.",
    "Great course, especially for understanding this topic.",
    "Great course that talks through barriers to receiving mental health care including personal, cultural and structural.",
    "Great course! Would definitely recommend this class to another, as it provides foundational subjects within mental health that people should be aware of and it very well structured.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who have any interest in mental health. The weekly topics for the course were always interesting, and the class atmosphere was engaging, welcoming and inquisitive.",
    "Overview of mental health over a life course. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Above average course, with excellent professor. Course load was just right",
    "Very interesting course to learn about the ways researchers and health officials are trying to understand how public health issues interact with mental health.",
    "Overall, a good introduction to the state of mental health from the public health perspective. Friendly environment that revolves around discussion. Readings are not so hard, although a lot are given. One can get away with doing just one or two of the readings, but it helps to glance at all papers to the get the most out of class. There are no longer weekly reading responses, just a couple papers throughout the term and a low-key presentation on a topic of interest.",
    "The course provides a great, comprehensive look into mental health in the United States, as analyzed from many different points of view. It offers information on several mental illnesses, as well as how they are interacted with in a research and public health sense. It allows significant student involvement and directive in understanding their topics of choice, and pushes them to grow in their preparedness for being involved in the field.",
    "Great!",
    "I would highly recommend this course",
    "This class is great!! I learned so much and would highly recommend."
