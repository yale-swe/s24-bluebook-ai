    "I learned a lot of vocabulary and grammar in this class. I loved that the classes were conducted entirely in Spanish because that really allowed me to practice speaking and listening to Spanish. I think that I became a lot more fluent because I was able to practice the vocabulary and grammar we were learning every day in class.",
    "I learned Spanish in a manner better than I had in any other foreign language course I've ever taken. I also learned many new techniques for learning foreign language, such as skillful use of context when reading and listening, immersion in the language, and, of course, constant practice.",
    "I became a lot more comfortable with conversational Spanish because the class is run completely in Spanish. I also learned a few new verb tenses and lots of vocabulary.",
    "I feel like I can definitely understand spanish much better. I am able to speak the language much better as well, but I often try to translate in my head rather than just producing spanish.",
    "Reading, writing, speaking, and understanding Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is that it allows students to practice speaking and listening to Spanish every day, which really helps students become more comfortable and fluent. I also really enjoyed reading Spanish short stories and learning about the culture of different Spanish speaking countries. The weakness of this class is that the nuances of the grammar points are not alway made clear when we are learning them.",
    "Strengths: Emphasis on constant use of Spanish, use of creative activities, emphasis on learning both the language and the culture. Weaknesses: Needs even more emphasis on practice and more practice exercises",
    "The strength of the course is that it is taught completely in Spanish and there are activities and conversations that force students to improvise and become more comfortable with the language.",
    "The course is very engaging and it allows for quick learning of spanish. The only thing is that there was not enough time to complete the tests and have time to look answers over. I didn't complete any of the exams due to time.",
    "Strengths would be the everyday engagement with the material.",
    "I think this is overall a great course, but I think the amount of busy work in addition to the syllabus detracts from the quality of the class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because it is a great way to learn and improve in Spanish. Even though the class meets every day, having to speak Spanish every day really helps with fluency and comprehension.",
    "Yes, I would recommend any language course to another student because the foreign language program at Yale seems exemplary.",
    "I would recommend this to students who are placed into L2. I hadn't taken Spanish for four years and enjoyed the class.",
    "This course is great if you want to learn in depth spanish quickly.",
    "I would because I feel like I learned way more than I thought I would going into the semester.",
    "Yes, very effective class for learning Spanish."
