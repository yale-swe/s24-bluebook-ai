    "YES! This course is amazing. It is an intimate seminar in which you will meet a ton of prominent urban studies guests from around Yale, New Haven, and New York, and get to know them and their work on a personal basis. I was always impressed with how accessible the course and our guests were. I would say that this is an essential course to take if you're a sophomore, interested in urban issues, and want to take one of the jewels of Yale. Prof. Wexler is a fascinating professor with a really interesting back story, and incredibly witty and articulate to boot. He had, at some point in the past few years, lost his voice, making it necessary for him to be heavily miked to be able to talk, but don't let this superficial \"problem\" stop you from looking at the course. You will cover themes from all over urban studies, including community organizing, education, housing, public-private development, crime, and urban planning and architecture. This class is a gem. Couldn't recommend it more.",
    "Every week, there's a guest lecturer on a different topic relating to urban studies. You get the chance to speak with a lot of experts in their respective fields. There's a lot of reading, but it's not necessary to do all of it. Grading consists of class participation, weekly reading responses, and a final paper on a topic of your choice. Since you get to choose your own topic for the final paper, it becomes a rather fun paper to write and is more enjoyable than the typical paper. If you get into the class (it's a pretty limited seminar), definitely take it!",
    "This course needs to be offered next year! Sophomores interested in urban studies should petition to have it offered again. Professor Wexler is fantastic and the speakers that he brings in are equally wonderful.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It gives a great overview of different topics in urban studies and allows for growth as a student in developing ideas about topics that you may not have been familiar with before the course (the breadth of topics really ensures this). Class discussions are very comfortable, dynamic, and engaging. It is a great course.",
    "If you get it in, take it!",
    "Take this class!!!! It is fantastic. Obviously it is only really worth pursuing if you have an interest in urban issues, urban politics, urban planning, or any sort of related thing, and it is especially rewarding if you come to the class with a bit of background and\/or experience on some of the topics. If these are issues that are relevant and interesting to you, then this class will teach you so much and give you a really strong foundation in the wide variety of issues and perspectives related to urban studies. The guest speakers and the class discussions are all great, and both speakers and students had some really interesting things to say. The workload is reasonable and well-chosen, so you always feel like you are doing something worthwhile whether in class or doing work outside of class. In summary: it is a great experience!! I would absolutely 100% recommend that you take this class.",
    "If you get into this class and have any interest in urban studies, TAKE IT. This was my favorite class this semester and perhaps at Yale so far. Some guests were more engaging than others, but the class as a whole was fantastic. We covered everything from education to new media to community organizing to urban ethnography, but the wide variety of topics was made cohesive by an emphasis on urban studies. Maybe this is because I was already pretty interested in the material, but I came out of so many classes intellectually invigorated and excited about what I had just learned. Professor Wexler is very kind and invested in his students, and he has so much experience in New Haven. Workload was standard for a seminar, weekly reading responses and a final paper.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It offers the incredible opportunity of discussing various aspects of the city with different professors for two hours each week. The sessions were without fail stimulating and fun, and the reading is very interesting. If it's offered, try to take it!",
    "Yes, hands down.",
    "If you want to meet fellow urban studies enthusiasts and capture a picture of the discipline as it is studied here at Yale, go for it. It's not terribly repetitive from other courses like New Haven and the American City or Study of the City. Be prepared for a few dull weeks and many excellent ones. Professor Wexler is a kind man and widely knowledgeable about urban life from both pragmatic and theoretical perspectives; don't hesitate to ask him for his thoughts or approach him after class!",
    "It is an introduction to the discipline of urban studies. It can be a depressing course at times, but the subject matter is all quite interesting. The variation from week to week can be hit or miss, but the seminar as a whole is worth taking.",
    "I would thoroughly recommend this class to anyone. Not only will you meet a class full of like-minded sophomores, your horizons will be expanded and I assure you that you will never look at a city in the same light or with the same eyes ever again.",
    "If you get in and have an interest in urban studies, definitely take it. A survey course that's appropriate for those with no prior coursework, as well as those a little more well-versed in urban studies. Interesting readings, discussions, and speakers, and Harry Wexler is awesome."
