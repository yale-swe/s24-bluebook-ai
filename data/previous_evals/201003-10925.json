   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in taking an intermediate microeconomics course. It might not be rigorous enough for students with substantial economics backgrounds, but Cheryl made that point herself early on.",
    "Assuming it wasn't a requirement, I might recommend it to someone who really wants to learn the basics. As long as you remember to relate what you learn in this class to other classes that really interest you, you can get a lot out of it, a helpful analytical perspective on other courses. Cheryl does a good job of helping you make that connection, but she doesn't facilitate vibrant class discussion, so you've got to really engage yourself with the material.",
    "This course is great for students who do not have much of a economics background to obtain a good understanding of microeconomic theoretic concepts and useful tools for economic analysis. It makes a good connection between theory and practice and helps better understand and critically assess economic articles.",
    "Its good course to take because it teaches how theory is applied.",
    "Not really. It's a lot of work, and is not very exciting."

   "comments": [
    "The course not only reviewed economic concepts from my undergraduate economics class, but it also improved upon my understanding of those concepts.",
    "The main lesson I got from the course is a way to discuss the effectiveness of certain policies as a factor of economic reactions (utility, elasticity) and to understand what variables affect policy reactions (information, substitution rates, prices). I won't likely be conducting in-depth economic analysis using what I've learned in the course, but it will be helpful to understand the analysis of other scholars and professionals. Also the content of the articles related to economic development and public services were interesting for me, but I would need to spend a little more time with them to really deepen my knowledge of the subject.",
    "This course encouraged me to take more economics courses next year, as it seems to be an interesting field of research.",
    "it allowed me to see how economic analysis can be applied to policy questions.",
    "It enabled me to meet one of my economics requirements."
