   "comments": [
    "I would! There's a lot of material covered, and p-sets are long, so you can't expect to take it easy. Sohrab is a great teacher!",
    "Take it",
    "It teaches you to solve differential equations. I would recommend this only if you need to take it for a requirement. It is not interesting otherwise.",
    "Be careful with this course. The material seems deceptively straightforward and mechanical, but somehow turns for the worst on exams. The problem sets are all mechanical grinding, and some are incredibly long. They're not particularly helpful, though, because they don't encourage a deeper understanding of the material. Professor Ismail-Beigi is clear and incredibly helpful outside class, so I don't think it's him, just his problem sets. Overall, though, this class ended up taking a lot more time and energy than anticipated, and has been bad for my GPA.",
    "Fantastic math class, better than any you would take in the math department. You learn a ton.",
    "Hard work pays off. That's how I would sum up my experience in ENAS 194. Differential equations are not easy to master, but attention in class and putting in adequate time on the problem sets makes the class manageable. Professor Ismail-Beigi gives a lot of work, and the main learning of the class takes place in doing the p-sets. My primary complaint about the class is the mandatory nature of the weekly review sessions; they really are not much help if you understand the material. The grading scheme makes the class a bit of a grind with constant worry about the quality of p-set solutions, but pays off when the final's only worth 18%! Overall, I did very much enjoy the class, and I know I've learned a lot.",
    "This class was difficult, but not bad. Sohrab is definitely a fine teacher, and though the problem sets were challenging, they definitely helped me learn the material. This class won't be the worst pre-req you'll have to take.",
    "The ENAS Differential Equations course is supposed to be an alternative to the more proof-heavy version offered by the math department. In that respect, I have to assume it does a pretty good job. Most things were tied in pretty well into physical phenomena. You probably have to take this course, anyway.",
    "ENAS194 is differential equations without proofs, and with a variable amount of actual application work depending on the professor. There are problem sets every week, including reading week, and class often runs into reading week as well. The material uses some matrices, so either take Linear first or be prepared to learn and practice some tricks on your own (pretty easy). Also, a background in engineering would have helped, as some of the applications that we did cover assumed this knowledge.",
    "Taking it with Sohrab is much better than Smooke in the spring. Sohrab is probably more mathematical than engineering and his problem sets involve more thinking. But he is much clearer and more enjoyable than Smooke.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially if Sohrab is teaching it. Sohrab was really good at explaining the material, with just the right amount of proofs for a slightly theoretically inclined mind (but someone who didn't want to take analysis after math 230). He was always really willing to help students out with any problems they had with the material, even when they were really difficult to answer.I found the problem sets just the right length, and not just full of drill problems as I've heard some people complain in the past. The tests are usually reasonable, but sometimes he asks questions about material that didn't seem to get much focus in the class, like convergence.",
    "If you're interested in engineering or math definitely take it. It's pretty good.",
    "THE COURSE WITH SOHRAB IS GREAT. (PLUS, MATT -TA- WAS GREAT) If you are not understanding the material in Spring Semester this class is not nearly structured the same, and has fewer people, so there is a bigger focus on the 30 or so studetns.",
    "This is an interesting quantitative math\/engineering course, and the material doesn't get too difficult, if you stay on top of your studies, until the end. I took this class because it was required for my major, not for enjoyable purposes, and did not have fun. However, its manageable, just be very sure you want to take it and shop it through the first week at least if you are not a math\/science person.",
    "If you're anything other than a math major then I recommend this class. Everything is designed so you learned the material as best as possible, and Sohrab is great.",
    "Yes I will. Out of the courses that would taeach you diffeq, Thsi is probably the best taught.",
    "Definitely take this over the MATH version because my suitemates told me that one is miserable. This class is actually pretty useful and Professor Ismail-Beigi is excellent. Very clear lecturer and always trying to help his students, but what makes him great is that he actually listens to our suggestions. He had us all write ways that he could improve about halfway into the semester. He also listened when the TAs told him things that students complained about and actually fixed them (he started the semester writing super small and in invisible chalk but later bought his own huge sidewalk chalk and made the effort to write bigger). Be prepared for a pset over Thanksgiving break and another one over reading period though.",
    "Great class! The material is really interesting, and you can really see how Diff Eq lies at the heart of many science and engineering concepts. I definitely enjoyed this class and highly recommend it.",
    "It covers a lot of material and problem sets take forever. Once again, unless you really love math or need to take this course, just don't....Its not well-taught enough to be worth otherwise.",
    "Recommend",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The calculus isn't very hard since the math is very procedural and not theoretical. H",
    "Must take class for engineers and mathematicians. Even if the blue book does not list it as a requirement, the earlier you take it, the better you perform in your other engineering classes. It is however massively time consuming. The weekly problem sets are a pain, but good for keeping up with the material, especially if you zone out in lectures like I do. You also get to review Taylor polynmials, which were an Achilles heal for me before this class.Overall, you learn a lot of useful stuff, but as it is a hard class, your grades can take a hit.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENAS 194 to other science majors because you learn a lot of useful skills from the class. There is a fair amount of work from the problem sets, but the problems really help you understand the material. Sohrab is a good lecturer and teaches the class well too.",
    "ENAS 194 will teach you ordinary differential equations (and in the last week or so you will learn a bit about partial differential equations). Take this class if you are interested in a discipline that will require you to use differential equations to solve problems. Take the equivalent course in the math department if you are interested in proofs as this course focuses on applications.The psets are pretty leniently graded and there is always extra credit. The exams are fair, but occasionally there will be a question on material that was not emphasized in class. Also, the second material covers about twice the amount of new material as the first midterm does which makes it difficult to study for.",
    "A great class. I started out not knowing anything about differential equations, and by the end I was comfortable solving any linear ODE, and even some non-linear ones and PDEs. The professor was great and homework was useful (although sometimes a little long). I took it with Phys 410 which was a great idea. They complemented each other well.",
    "This course takes a lot of work, so if you don't need to take this course for your major I wouldn't take it. The problem sets are extremely long and you have to go to weekly hour long sections. Although in these sections you can sometimes get help with homework.By the end you will feel like you do know a lot about differential equations but that will only be after you've dedicated a tonne of time to reading through the textbook and trying to understand. Sohrab is very helpful if you go to his office hours so make use of that!"
