    "I would recommend Directed Studies to other students. I believe that reading literature from the past enables us to understand how the ideas and literature of our own time. When else in your life will you have the luxury of devoting the bulk of your time to study of the classics? The negative side of DS can best be described by a metaphor: I love chocolate cake, but I don't love eating 10 of them at once. Sometimes, the amount of reading assigned is so great that it's hard to enjoy it. Nevertheless, I think it's really worthwhile to take DS and get a strong foundation before continuing your studies at Yale. Being in tiny seminars with a bunch of students who chose and want to be there is amazing.The philosophy class is very much a survey class. You do a little of everything, but not too much of anything. Most students have never done philosophy before coming to Yale, and instructors recognize that and ease you in. This is definitely my favorite DS class because it involves a sort of logical thinking and argumentation that doesn't happen elsewhere.",
    "Directed Studies Phil is a great introduction to philosophy. I had never been exposed to philosophy before, and though we moved quickly, it's a great overview of a subject I wanted to learn about, but don't see myself pursuing as a major.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is very self-motivated and who is okay with re-reading and re-reading texts. The works that we read are difficult to understand, and the discussions are not always so clear. So, a student who is willing to put lots of work into analyzing the texts would do well in this course. I did enjoy this class, and I think it was a great introduction to philosophy.",
    "This is definitely a course you want to take. DS Philosophy is one of the best courses I can imagine you can take at Yale. You get an overall feel for the great philosophers and see how philosophical ideas develop over time in different eras. The most exciting thing is feeling how your brain is turned like a clockwork by the different ideas as you grapple with the concepts of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas etc. This is probably the most enriching course I've taken this fall.",
    "This is a fun and challenging class where you will not only discuss philosophy, but also what it means to be human. The work load is not very bad, although you should participate in class and work hard on your papers. The grading of the papers is harsh, but the professor will mark your improvement and acknowledge your efforts.",
    "It's a lot of arguing about issues that you probably think aren't that important, like whether the human soul is split into three parts. But if you like arguing, you should take it.",
    "You'll get a good basis of the classic philosophers.",
    "It is a chronological, survey-style introduction to philosophy and philosophical analysis. I would definitely recommend it, particularly in the context of the rest of DS. Philosophy does not come easily to me, but I still found the experience of learning how to process arguments invaluable. I believe this is a skill I will carry with me throughout my academic career and beyond.",
    "DS Philosophy is a pretty standard introduction to the history of the field. I think it is probably the weakest of the first semester DS classes, however: but for the time spent on Plato and Aristotle, it often lacked unity. The week spent on Arab philosophy in particular was not well-integrated, or at least didn't seem to be.Goldman is nice, but he isn't the best. He doesn't know Greek, and doesn't seem to have very complete ideas about any of the authors we read except Aristotle and Anselm. He's not the strongest classroom presence, and when he does get involved, he sometimes isn't the most helpful.",
    "It was exactly what they describe it as, a crash course in Ancient to Medieval philosophy. It's a good amount of work, but certainly manageable. I absolutely would recommend it to another student. I had never really taken a philosophy coursebefore and was a bit wary, but I am significantly glad that I took it. It requires a different mentality and frame of mind that I found rather stimulating.",
    "If you happen to be assigned to Professor Goldman's class, you're in luck. Probably the best instruction among all DS Philosophy teachers, and you will leave this class with a solid understanding of the readings. There is a considerable amount of reading, though less than in other DS Sections. Highly recommended."
