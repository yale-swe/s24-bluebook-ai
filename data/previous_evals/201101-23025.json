    "Don't hesitate for a second. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, with a serious, thought-provoking approach to a discipline that Yale largely ignores. Professor Maralani is wonderful and is genuinely dedicated to her teaching, not just the subject matter.",
    "If Vida Maralani is teaching this class and you're remotely interested in demography, check it out. This class is less focused on \"gender and health\" than you'd expect-- it's more of an introductory demography class. The readings can be dry and dense, but never overwhelming, and Professor Maralani always explains them in seminar discussion and she keeps the classroom environment lively and fun. We spent a good deal of time talking about birth rates, contraception, marriage, infant mortality, women's schooling, and gender differences in mortality. If you're interested in any of these topics, I'd highly recommend this course.",
    "This is a great undergrad\/grad cross-listed course that serves as an introduction to the main topics in demography: fertility, migration, and mortality. Prof. Maralani's approach to the class includes a mix of short lectures when appropriate, traditional seminar format, and small group discussions which are helpful for thinking about the readings. The reading responses and literature review project were also very manageable.Definitely take it if you're interested, since there aren't many demography courses offered!"
