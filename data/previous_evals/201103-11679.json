    "THIS IS WHAT YOUR ENTIRE ENVE DEGREE HAS BEEN WORKING TOWARDS.",
    "About seven problem sets over the semester, the first midterm was pretty easy but then the second midterm was a wake up call to everyone in the class. The final was very difficult. Professor Mitch went into so much detail that is was hard to decipher what we actually needed to learn and what was just extra material. Topics can be a bit boring at times but the real-life examples done in class and on the problem sets are interesting.",
    "The material is all very important stuff, but it is all very hard to grasp and understand well enough to apply. Also, the class isn't taught in a very engaging manner. Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Undergrad engineers, this is one of those courses you need to take for your major. If you want to do well in the course go to every class and be sure to get down the notes then try to understand them while doing the problem sets as best you can. It's not the greatest class, but it's not terrible. Try to stay on top of the material and get down all the notes.",
    "This entire class is about learning what happens to contaminants once they are put in a system. you learn to figure out where they go, how they transform etc etc. It's a pretty cool topic but Mitch kills it and it will not be an enjoyable experience I assure you. Take is after CENG 210 if you can...",
    "You are most likely taking this because you need to. Regardless, make sure you pay attention at all points of the lecture because it is easy to fall behind and things get complicated pretty quickly.",
    "This is one of those classes you're probably taking because it's required. Overall, it's certainly not easy, but stay on top of psets, work with Ning, study with friends, and it's totally do-able.",
    "First year with a new Prof teachingthis, but clear that teaching on the blackboard was much more accessible than powerpoint lectures in Prof. Mitch's Water Quality class.Information was fairly well-organized and covered a wide range of topics - with relevant applications, which was nice - some overlap with the FES class \"Organic Pollutants in the Environment\", although this goes into far more detailed equilibrium models. So much information in every lecture it was sometimes hard to take in.Problem sets were challenging and relevant, but very difficult to understand without help from the TA, who was a hero. Always get as far as you can on the psets on your own before the help sessions, but don't expect to be able to finish them by yourself if you start at midnight the morning they are due.Exams became increasingly difficult, and the final included the most complicated mass balance system we'd ever seen (in homework, discussed in class or otherwise). This was frustrating.",
    "If you are taking this class it is probably a requirement. Study for the tests more than you think you have to, don't do the problem sets last minute and go to the TA's office hours and get help. Professor Mitch is hard to take, but if you studied over everything after each lecture you would be golden.",
    "This is the PERFECT course to take if you are thinking of majoring in Environmental Engineering because you will see exactly how mediocre this department is. It's not awful, you know? It's just...all like ENVE448."
