   "comments": [
    "Yes, take it.You learn interesting things in a laid-back format: read, discuss, do an exercise about it. You get to pick a presentation topic too.",
    "Take it. If you're even remotely interested in law, and you want a fun way to keep your Spanish fresh, as well as a very easy A, there's no reason not to take this class.",
    "This is a wonderful class. You probably won't speak as much as you may in other classes (unless you're the obnoxious person who think he knows everything or the law student who actually does know everything) but it's a great way to learn interesting material, keep up your spanish (kind of) and get to know a WONDERFUL professor. seriously, she's great.also, this is never really said, but the material is actually really, really interesting.",
    "I would recommend Legal Spanish highly to another student, with the caveat that it is not a good opportunity to improve one's grammar. It is a great chance to learn more about Spanish-speaking countries, legal practices, etc. and improve on conversational skills especially when speaking about a topic that most people are unfamiliar with. Take it especially if you have a lot of hard classes during a particular semester.",
    "It is like taking an introductory legal course in spanish; it is a great course, I recommend any student interested in learning formal and technical spanish to take it.",
    "Yes, take it if you're looking for a really easy L5 Spanish credit.",
    "Take it if you are a continuing spanish student, have a firm grasp of the language, and are interested in learning about basic law in the US, latin america,&spain. Its more lecture-esque than discussion based so don't take it if you're specifically looking to improve your conversational\/grammar skills.",
    "This course is a relatively simple introduction to various legal concepts, primarily based on the Spanish legal system. It effectively introduced those basic concepts, and in the process strengthened the Spanish abilities of its students. The greatest weakness of the course is that students do not have the opportunity to speak for any extended period on an individual basis, due to the teaching style of the instructor.Mercedes Carreras was a very personable and effective instructor. Her grasp and explanations of legal concepts are truly phenomenal. Her grading is generous and she definitely cares about her students. The only criticism I have of her teaching style is that she does not allow students to speak individually for any extended period of time--she mostly asks questions with short answers, calls on a student, and then continues her lecture after the brief interjection.",
    "This is a fantastic class. It's relatively low key, there's not very much work at all, and the subject is extremely interesting. Carreras is an amazing instructor, and I really improved my oral and written skills. Take it!",
    "I think that anyone who is interested in law and improving\/using their Spanish speaking abilities should take this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course; it's a fun way to learn both law and spanish.",
    "I would recommend it as an opportunity to practice Spanish ability in a low-stress environment, while learning about comparative law."
