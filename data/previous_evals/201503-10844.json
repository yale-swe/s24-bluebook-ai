   "comments": [
    "Synthesis, Characterizations, applications of materials chemistry",
    "This is a must-take course if you are interested in materials chemistry",
    "Yeah! This is a pretty cool class with a very light workload. You get to learn how a Tesla's battery works. It'll be fun!",
    "This course is a seminar-styled class that has a relatively low stress-load. There are weekly homework assignments, but the absence of exams is a nice plus. If a student is interested in materials chemistry, I would recommend this class.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to anothor students who want to do research in materials science. It is very useful, especially covering many update on energy realms. From basic knowledges of cystal to the materials level studies, this course may cover all the thing you need to know.",
    "Very dependent on the teacher, I believe the previous year it was a lot more work while all we had were 30 minute homeworks and one 4 page single space paper. Don't expect it to be much work nor to get much out of it, tho start the paper early.",
    "It's a great introductory course to materials chemistry, in particular the field of nanomaterial. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "The course covers a good amount of materials chemistry information, but goes very in depth in some areas that may or may not be relevant to your research. Overall, the material covered in the course is quite interesting. The techniques section was really helpful. Since there are no exams in the course, it is a fairly easy class with a reasonable amount of homework and one final paper.",
    "Yes, it's a great course because of the contents and nice professor",
    "I would summarize this course as a broad overview of materials chemistry with an emphasis on special topics. I would certainly recommend this class to anyone interested in topics concerning or related to materials. As a chemist who does NOT work with materials, I found the course to be an excellent supplement to my chemistry and, in fact, help me better understand concepts out of the material chemistry field.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I found it very useful, I truly learned a lot and enjoyed the content and the style of the course."

   "comments": [
    "much more comfortable with the language of materials chemistry now and will be ready to review parts of the course I did not understand for my research",
    "This course introduced me to a branch of chemistry that I had not previously been exposed to, so it broadened my knowledge of the field as a whole and gave me a greater appreciation for chemists who do work outside of the area I have been doing research in. It did not directly contribute to my research, but I feel that gaining a deeper understanding of one kind of chemistry can only aid me in thinking about other areas.",
    "As a student studying materials in the energy application, I gained a lot of knowledge from this course. I knew a lot of phenomena before, but did not know the fundmentals behind. After this course, I feel confident that I can explain them. It also update my knowledge on batteries and catalysis, which is very useful for me to carry on my research topics in energy area.",
    "Gave me a better understanding of characterization, which is very beneficial for me.",
    "The course mainly familiarized me with the important means of material characterization. Also, through the final project, I am acquainted with a specific topic on the research frontier.",
    "The techniques section covered some new methods that I may use in my research and the crystallography information was useful for me.",
    "As a chemist who does NOT work with materials, I found the course to be an excellent supplement to my chemistry and, in fact, help me better understand concepts out of the material chemistry field. I will certainly reference the course material during my research.",
    "Most of the topics covered in the second half of the course and the final project most significantly contributed to deepening my knowledge of the field. I also attained enough knowledge to delve deeper into specific topics within materials chemistry, for which I previously was less prepared for."
