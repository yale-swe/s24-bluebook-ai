    "A fair class. Take it",
    "A great review of intro Macro. See if you can sneak in without taking intro Macro if you want to learn the material in a better environment.",
    "Intermediate Macro is a class with interesting topics. The problems it faces are similar to all of the other required Economics classes for majors, but I enjoyed it a lot more than macro. The work load is not too bad and Professor Nordhaus is pretty funny.",
    "Yes, cool concepts and Nordhaus tries hard and sometimes his humor works out well. =)",
    "Yes, for the econ major.",
    "Good course if you're interested in Macroecon. Best econ course I've taken at Yale, but I've also only taken Intro Micro and Macro before this. On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give this course a 7.5.",
    "Great course. You have to take it for the major so take it with Nordhaus!",
    "Even if you aren't an econ major, this is an econ course that everyone should take. Most of the material is review from intro, but this course does far more than fill in gaps in your understanding of the subject left by the intro course. I loved this course.",
    "This is a great class. Make sure to take it with Nordhaus.",
    "It's a requirement.",
    "Yes, for econ majors obviously. For an average person, maybe not - I'm not sure how much more a philosophy major would get out of intermediate macro than intro macro. For a polisci person - yes, the goings on of the macroeconomy are obviously very important",
    "Not too hard. Generous curve. Read the book. You will learn a lot",
    "It's a required course for econ majors. Useful knowledge if you want to learn about the economy, current trends and policies.",
    "Take it if you are an Econ or EP&E major.",
    "It is a broad overview of intermediate macroeconomics. Pretty light workload, decently interesting material if you're interested in econ. Not a bad course at all. Would recommend it to people interested in econ.",
    "With Nordhaus, it's less boring than with another professor, but it's not an incredible class. You will learn a lot because it's intermediate economics, but the most interesting things (like the current financial crisis) won't be in the problem sets as much. Overall, make sure to read the book and go to section, and (mostly) lecture, and you will be fine. Though the exams are pretty tricky.Recommendation: Take it if you are REALLY interested in macroeconomics, or if you have to (ie you are an econ or econ&math major).",
    "dropped",
    "Most people take this class as a major requirement, but it's definitely a worthwhile course. Be careful if you haven't taken Intro Macro though. Many of the concepts are glossed over very quickly and it can be difficult to learn them without a strong background. Still, overall the course teaches a lot, not only about academic models and theories, but also about real-life applications. It is very relevant to current events and that's definitely an added benefit.",
    "Take it. Obviously it is required, but I can't imagine that anyone does a better job at it than Nordhaus so take the fall option!! This is also a good course for those interested in \"less\" mathematical econ (e.g. poli sci majors would benefit still, even though they may find it harder). The class is not at all difficult in terms of homework, but you need to stay on top of all the material in order to do well in the end.",
    "This is a great class for people of all majors. It provides a worldly perspective on macroeconomics, all the while working through the fundamentals of macroeconomic theory. Definitely take it.",
    "Nordhaus is pretty good, probably better than whoever else teaches the class. There is a lot of repeated material from Ray Fair's macro stuff, but Nordhaus does a bit more application and talks more about economic history (and we go into more detail with more complicated models).",
    "If you're an Econ major it's required; if you're not, don't bother. It's really boring and I don't feel like I learned anything relevant. Also if you like math you might try Macro Theory; I wish I had.",
    "Intermediate econ is an interesting class, but the exams were by far some of the most painful I've take at Yale so far. Exam questions are tricky, most of the time ambiguous, and the tests themselves are very long, and a time crunch. The final was a three and a half-hour time-crunch -- not fun.",
    "It's a pretty good course. The material is interesting, and Professor Nordhaus is a pretty good lecturer. The p-sets aren't too bad (we had about 8), plus there is reading, a 3-5 pg paper, and a midterm and final. This is definitely your best choice for Intermediate Macro.",
    "The book is great and tells you all you need to know",
    "Yes. Only half the problem sets are graded and Nordhaus is the best professor you can get for intermediate macro.",
    "Take it for the major. If you are just looking to learn more about economics in the world, another course might be better for you as this one had a lot of theory, models, etc. that aren't necessarily applicable to your real world understanding. For the major, I would recommend taking this course with Nordhaus. He is a much better and engaging teacher than some other professors in the department.",
    "The workload is pretty isn't bad at all and Nordhaus does a pretty good job teaching the material. If you had a pretty good grasp on the topics covered in intro macro then you'll do fine in the class.",
    "It is a course about large scale factors of the economy. I would recommend it if you want an in depth look at what happens.",
    "Econ 122 with Nordhaus is the best option for intermediate macro. It's not easy, but it's better than the other macro class.",
    "Yes, I my understanding of US and global economics has dramatically increased. And it's nice that every other p-set was ungraded. Midterms and exams were VERY hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even if you're not an econ major. It's not any more difficult than intro, and it's definitely a lot better. The professor is great and the material is interesting.",
    "Gives you a great understanding of the world around you.",
    "Depends what you're looking for.",
    "Typical macro econ class. You get out what you put in. Nordhaus was the best econ professor I've had so far. I'd recommend taking Macroecon with him.",
    "The class is good, a comprehensive and difficulty-appropriate intermediate macroeconomics class. It isn't easy, but you don't expect intermediate macro to be. William Nordhaus is a good professor, and teaches the difficult concepts well, but sometimes the slides are so filled with information that it is difficult to understand the theories. However, since the textbook explains the theory well, as long as you read the text you can understand the lectures",
    "It's necessary for the economics major but for someone who isn't considering it because of their major, I would recommend it even though it is difficult. It's very relevant and useful information to know. The problem sets are weekly and alternate graded and ungraded, which relieves stress. There is only a midterm, short paper, and final exam. The final exam was painful.",
    "Ugh. Take it if you have to take it -- I've heard it's easier with Bruegemann. Struggle to stay awake in class, do problem sets that take ages longer than they really should in order to teach you nothing, do a completely useless paper, then get killed on the exams. So yeah, it's a typical Econ class. Go Yale.",
    "Pretty straightforward course--exams, problems sets, a short paper. The material is about what you would expect and is challenging but not absurdly difficult or math-based. This is the only high-level econ core requirement that I would recommend to non-majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend Economics 122, especially if Nordhaus is teaching it. The material is important to know because it is so relevant and Nordhaus makes the class exciting.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, or just really like macro. The material is interesting, and the tests aren't too hard, but lecture is dry and uneventful.",
    "Hard course. Teaching is OK but not great, you have to do it if you're an econ major so just take it, it won't be enjoyable but you have to get through it.",
    "Definatelly, if you can take Intermediate Macro with Nordhaus.",
    "i would recommend taking econ 122 with Professor Nordhaus. (the class is offered by him every fall semester) i have the feeling that in one of the classes in the coming years, the students will need to stand up before class and clap for him in october, though we don't have this honor this year.",
    "I would recommend it. It's what you would expect from an inter. macro class. Not hard and not extremely informative either.",
    "yes. it's definitely the better core economics class.",
    "A very practical econ class. Gives you a great understanding of international economics.",
    "Recommended, especially for econ majors",
    "Yes - it's an interesting mix of theory, history, and problems that will save your interest in econ from the misery that is inter. micro. It provides a deeper understanding of current problems and policies, and should be of interest and use to non-econ majors as well.A note to sophomores: if you want to take this course, switch your major to economics. Nordhaus, who by and large is an interesting and engaging teacher, caps the course at around 120. He will take all the juniors and seniors, but if you are a sophomore and not registered as an econ major, you'll be stuck in a lottery facing tough odds.",
    "Good course, not too hard if you keep up with the readings. I recommend it.",
    "Yes; it's clearly organized and effective at getting the ideas across.",
    "This was a decent class, but honestly it didn't live up to the god-like expectations that I had for professor Norhaus. It may be a bit over-hyped.",
    "I wouldn't take it unless you're an econ major, but if you are then take it with Nordhaus.",
    "It's hard to compare Nordhaus' intermediate macro class with any other since I haven't taken any one else's, but I will say that you would be lucky to take it from such an expert in the field as Nordhaus. This class is by no means an easy A, but sometimes learning from the best is more important than having a perfect transcript.",
    "yes, this course will allow you to understand the economy in ways we read about on the news and discuss the most. and so, it is indispensable.",
    "Yes, the course covers the essential topics of macroeconomics well, and I think is on the better side of such required core courses. I heard taking it iwth Professor Nordhaus is the better option. The lectures are good, slides are regularly posted, the website is well-organized, and the textbook is the most helpful resource. You learn what you need to learn. The structure of the class is also good. I felt that the midterm and the final could have tested better, covering the materials more fairly.",
    "This is required class for econ majors so given that you have to take it, I'd take it with Nordhaus. His class does a great job of focusing on the important stuff and the tests are rather creative applications of the material.",
    "It's required if you're an Econ major, but this particular class (with Nordhaus) is an excellent choice. It's capped at 120, but if you're an Econ major (declare early!) or if you're a junior, you get an automatic seat. Taking this class is definitely a worthwhile experience and probably the best Intermediate Macro is ever gonna get.",
    "It's a req, so you have to take it."
