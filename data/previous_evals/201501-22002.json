   "comments": [
    "ENGL 130 is a lot of reading but well worth it. After taking this class I feel well versed in the european literary cannon, and all of the books we read are amazing!! I highly recommend the class, especially with Professor Neuman who is an amazing professor.",
    "I would highly recommend Epic to any student who is interested in guidance and motivation for some seminal texts in the Western Canon. The reading list is great, albeit a lot; I read every page and it was totally doable. The amount of time spent on covering each book can be frustrating at times, but as a narrative arc and a brief introduction to each epic, it does make sense.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Get ready for a lot of reading, but the class is worth the work. This was my favorite course this semester. The class discussions were amazing, and Professor Neuman is great at directing discussion while still giving students plenty of freedom to delve into the topics that interest them.",
    "This is a really great class. Professor Neuman is a lot of fun, if demanding, and really makes these books (some of the best ever written) come alive. If you are prepared to do all the reading (which is very heavy, particularly later in the course), you'll gain a lot of insight into these great works of literature, and learn a lot about intertextuality within the epic tradition, which references itself almost constantly. Sometimes the class can become a little hectic: we often had over 150 pages to cover in 75 minutes of class time, and the main complaint is that the class doesn't do these incredible texts justice. However, I found the teaching great, if a little quick. Lastly, Professor Neuman grades very hard but gives great feedback and encourages you to really explore new ideas and ways of approaching texts.",
    "A very large quantity of reading. Even if you think you can handle the reading amount, consider whether you want to, not just in terms of \"will it be fun to have to work this hard,\" but also, \"is this how I want to read these books.\" I personally did not end up feeling satisfied with how I had experienced these texts. That said, if you're less of a purist than I and can handle the reading, go for it, these are some of the greatest works ever written.",
    "Epic with Professor Neuman was one of the most enjoyable courses that I've taken thus far at Yale. The syllabus of this course is great and will allow you a strong grasp of some seminal works in European literature and key themes that run throughout the European literary tradition. I loved that Professor Neuman included Infinite Jest on his syllabus (each of the Epic professors includes one epic of their own choice on their individual syllabus), which was both a fun and insightful read -- it fit in well with the rest of the syllabus and I'm very glad to have been able to read it in this course with Professor Neuman. Professor Neuman himself definitely was largely why I enjoyed this course so much. His ideas are always very interesting to hear, and he guides discussions in a way that made them very open and enjoyable. You can tell that he's genuinely interested in what we have to say, as well as challenging us to think more deeply about the ideas we discuss. He's very helpful with papers as well, and meeting with him always allowed me to develop my ideas and think more critically about the themes and works in this course. I felt that I gained a lot out of this course, including reading skills that Professor Neuman taught us (skills that I feel I otherwise would not have gotten out of a college English course). I definitely recommend taking this course with Professor Neuman! Even if you're not an English major, you will get so much out of this course and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did!"
