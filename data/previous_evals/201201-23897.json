    "My expectations were to a formally radical design with minimal concern for program. I was surprised that program took such a central role in the studio, and while I think it was very useful it would have been helpful to include the importance of program in the studio brief to clarify the intention for how the design is going to be presented and explained. I think I was expecting the design to be explained more by diagramming or formal constructs than by program.",
