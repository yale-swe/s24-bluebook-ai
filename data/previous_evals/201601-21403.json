    "Don't take it with Bookman and you'll be fine. Take your time in the beginning to grab a hold of core concepts and then just keep up with the work as it builds upon each lesson.",
    "Hard. Like really hard. But once you get it it's actually a really interesting class. Be prepared to do countless problems in each topic before you really start to understand everything.",
    "It's a tough class that requires a lot of time and effort to be put in, in order to do well. I would recommend Math 120 to students that are prepared for a rigorous course. You will need to go to office hours in order to do well.",
    "Subject matter is super interesting. Consider taking it in ENAS 151",
    "You should take it if you need it as a prerequisite for other class.",
    "It's really hard. Take it if you reeeeally need it.",
    "MATH 120 is a difficult course and requires a lot of practice, however there are many resources to help students in the course. I would recommend this course to any student, but advise that they take the time to understand the material and reach out to instructors as soon as they do not.",
    "Math 120 is very straightforward, but challenging. Be prepared to work through all of the practice problems and go to office hours when confused. This class can be very rewarding if you work hard."
