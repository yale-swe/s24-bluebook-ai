   "comments": [
    "It's really interesting, but dont be fooled by the \"not for science majors\" description. It's hard!",
    "I would definitely recomend this course to anyone who wants a really worth-while science credit. By the end of the course you really feel like you have accomplished something.",
    "Don't take it personally if you get a grade lower than you expected for this course; the material is TOUGH. That said, you will walk away feeling fulfilled for having examined a topic like cancer on a deeper level and understand so much more than what's covered in the media.",
    "A tough non-majors science class, but one that is rewarding and makes you feel like you're actually getting your hands a bit dirty (not actually--there are no labs!). Be prepared to do some serious thinking, but also be prepared to know a whole lot more about cancer than most non-medical people in the world do.",
    "Yes. A confusing yet interesting topic that not many people learn about that are not science majors.",
    "\"Cancer\" was a manageable science credit. I definitely feel like I learned a lot from the course, maybe too much. You'll find that pretty much anything can lead to cancer and it's kind of unsettling. Anyway, Prof. Belperron is accessible and entertaining in class. The grade is divided among class participation, 3 quizzes throughout the semester, a midterm, a group presentation, and a final paper, which is good because the quizzes can get really hard even though they're only worth 5% each. It's nice to take a science class in a seminar setting, and although Cancer cannot be deemed a gut of a science credit by any means, I'd still recommend taking it. The topic is really relevant and the lectures are pretty informative. Couldn't think of a better way to get a science credit.",
    "Best science at Yale!",
    "Great class. You'll learn a lot about the biology of cancer. This disease probably will affect you at some point in your life (if it hasn't already) so you might as well understand it.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. It's a really interesting class for non-science majors and a great way to get distribution credits done. I would say that it is helpful to have a Bio background (like AP Bio). Also, it's not easy...BUT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It will change how you think, and it will make you more informed about one of the most interesting and scary diseases out there.",
    "Its a really interesting class with a decent amount of work. The quizzes and midterm are quite hard. The information is really interesting, though, and final paper can be rewarding, if tedious. The course is really not a seminar, however: each class consists of a 75 minute lecture.",
    "This course is a great science credit for nonscience majors that teaches students about the science behind cancer in terms of causes and treatments\/preventions. It's definitely not a gut - there is a lot of material - but if you put the time into it, it's a great class that let's you walk away with a good introductory understanding of how our bodies work normally and how they malfunction. There's a few quizzes, a midterm, a presentation, and a final paper. And the class is very science-based.",
    "Not a bad science credit. More science than a non-science person wants, but probably not in depth enough for a true science student. If you can put in the work every couple weeks, it's not too painful.",
    "Take it if you are super excited about the biology of Vance and are ready for a science heavy non-science",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. As a class for non-science majors, I still felt very engaged with the material and learned quite a bit. Professor Belperron really wants her students to understand what theyre learning and so she is willing to take the time to break down every scientific process she mentions. Additionally she is extremely patient with students.",
    "Very good course. Professor Belperron is great and the material is interesting. I found the tests to be challenging--make sure you study well."
