   "comments": [
    "Ximera was finicky and often difficult to type in long derivatives\/antiderivatives. Some concepts were only briefly mentioned, so it'd be nice if the course moved a little slower.",
    "The lectures were too slow for me.",
    "I think the course needs to do more example problems that increase in complexity. I found myself not getting much out of the class sessions themselves, but through resources such as the textbook and online tutorials, along with office hours.",
    "I do not think the PSets reflect the level of questions on exams, they were much harder in general.",
    "The small class sizes are very valuable to students and allow everyone to ask as many questions as they would like. The material was often not taught in preparation for the problem sets and exams which were often quite difficult compared to the material.",
    "The course works well as an introduction to calculus if you've taken some calculus in high school. The Ximera assignments were good for review, but making the way they were graded and the fact that their deadlines were often weeks ahead of the class material meant that they were mostly an annoyance."

   "comments": [
    "If a student needs to take a calculus course, this is a great option. Otherwise, it felt really repetitive from high school. But in a bad way because I remembered doing similar things but not actually how to do it so it was more confusing the second time.",
    "Yes. It achieved what it promised to.",
    "Yes its easy",
    "Yes. If you've taken calculus in high school it's a good course to take. If you haven't I would recommend taking 110 and 111 instead.",
    "I would",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as an introductory math class.",
    "If you're not really required to take it, there are more interesting courses at Yale. If you thought that calculus was interesting in high school and want to learn just a bit more, this course is a solid, albeit uninspiring option."
