    "I would summarize it as a basic beginner's calc class, but definitely not easy.",
    "Math 112 is a good course to take if you want to learn calculus for some reason, or if you are interested in practicing thinking in a mathematical light. Though I had a small background in calculus when taking the course, I still learned a ton of new stuff.",
    "I would recommend math 112 to someone who is interested in and willing to work to attain a background in calculus, not solely interested in a QR credit.",
    "The concepts covered in math 112 are certainly important ones to know, regardless of the major. Therefore, this is a crucial class to take at Yale. However, the class goes by extremely fast due to the nature of its semester length, and do not expect the teachers to help you at all. The textbook is also not comprehensive enough. It is a difficult class, despite the connotation that rides with math 112 being an intro class.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you need to take it for a prerequisite.",
    "I would recommend it. It was not that hard, and I found it very enjoyable."
