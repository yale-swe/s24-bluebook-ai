   "comments": [
    "I gained a basic familiarity with some of the most prominent essayists of our time and learned some of the basic techniques in writing different genres of essays. More importantly, I think, because I probably will not write similar essays in the future, I learned how to emulate writing techniques.",
    "I learned a lot about the Modern Essay, which in my mind was a very abstract term. Although we did not study its history or evolution, you read many examples from a variety of different authors , and so you are able to form an understanding of what exactly constitutes the modern essay. I learned a few technical skills, such as how to use footnotes and the different types of dashes. Most of all, I gained a lot of insight into how essays are constructed. We spent a lot of time parsing sentence structure, diction, and tone. Regardless of how conscious one believes the author is of the choices they make, I am now able to identify a thoughtful, good essay from one with merely a few outstanding vocabulary words. As with much of English, the way one perceives an essay varies a lot from one person to another. However, English 120 taught me how to explain my view of the author's choices and state how this made an impact on the essay.",
    "I developed a better sense of how to analyze literature, how to read between the lines and best understand how something is written and why it is that way. I am more conscious of the way I write now, not simply what I write. That is a lesson that I have not learned in the past.",
    "Really makes you a better writer, read some incredible modern essayists and learn what makes them work so well and how you can emulate some of their techniques in your own writing",
    "Close reading and analysis of essays, how to write personally.",
    "I had a lot more practice writing creative nonfiction, a kind of writing I was never asked to do before. The course challenged me to write and think differently from my previous writing classes.",
    "None for wiring, I felt my writing barely improved and only through the volume of writing, not from the feedback, texts read, or instructor comments. However, I think my analysis of \"modern essays\" improved as well as my ability to discuss with a group that shares different viewpoints.",
    "Crafting an essay that demonstrates themes rather than explicitly stating them Describing scenes accurately and evocatively Analyzing one's sourroundings through a creative journalistic lens Uniquely structuring an essay to mirror its contents Incorporating into an essay the relationship between writer and subject",
    "I developed a love for the modern essay in this class. I learned about writing techniques, devices for humor, drama, and all sorts of effects. There is a lot of peer-critiquing and there is a lot of valuable feedback from the professor, which is good for improving your own writing and taking criticism. I learned how to write a modern personal essay.",
    "Learned how to write essays, especially creative non-fiction.",
    "English 120 is a lot of work (and the grading system can be frustrating), but it's rewarding. I took it because I wanted to take a writing course that would allow me to escape the formulaic writing of my ap lit and ap lang classes in high school and engl120 did not disappoint. It gave me newfound appreciation for creative writing. I often felt paralyzed with options in the revision process because Engl120 expanded my knowledge of the many forms each essay\/paragraph\/sentence can take, but I'm glad I had this experience. In the past, I was used to explaining everything to the reader and Engl120 teaches you a nuanced version of \"show, don't tell\". The idea of essays having a public point is also a huge emphasis (and something I struggled with)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I was very pleased with the syllabus and the variety of essays that we read. The readings were manageable and actually very enjoyable. Another strength was in the discussions. The discussions were lead very well, and discussions were engaging and fun. Overall, this course had many more strengths than it did weaknesses. However, I found myself a little frustrated by the grading, because it seemed a little subjective. I think the course should shift evaluations from how \"well-written\" the essay is to how well the student emulates the specific techniques we talked about in class. Overall though, I wouldn't change much about this course.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was all the different essays we read. A weakness of the course was that each week we wrote a different type of essay, so I never felt that I improved at one particular style. That said, they were all closely related, and over all my writing improved.",
    "The texts read in the class are very relevant to the essays that students write. The essay topics are great because they are open ended but direct the energies of the writer towards a public point, and reason to write.",
    "Overall, I loved this course. I found the readings all really interesting and diverse, and Palmer's instruction and guidance with writing personal essays was phenomenal. Before taking English 120, I always considered my strength in writing to be analytical, but I've since learned a lot about the structure and content of creative non-fiction.",
    "The workshops offered a new perspective on how others were drafting their essays and helped to write ones own drafts. The essays chosen were for the most part interesting and pertinent. I wish there were more time for completing the essays however.",
    "Strengths of this course are the consistency of the schedule and the quality of the assigned reading. It is a lot of work, but the readings are enjoyable. The conversations can devolve into people just making stuff up to sound smart, which is a little annoying. Palmer is fantastic. He is able to guide discussions without taking them over and gives clear and helpful feedback.",
    "Reading was a strength, I loved the texts and the discussions, but the feedback I received on my writing was a clear weakness, I thought it could have been far more helpful.",
    "Strengths: Palmer's feedback is thorough, specific, and easily accessible through email. The draft-revision system allows students to really understand and incorporate Palmer's criticisms into their writing. All the units are exciting and informative. The vast majority of the texts are riveting and provide a model for inexperienced writers. Weaknesses: Workshops can sometimes lose focus and confuse an author. Some of the essays could be replaced, particularly in the comedy unit.",
    "This course was very well-balanced. The readings were never too long, always very engaging, and the essays were fun to write. The discussions are very enlightening too. As for weaknesses, sometimes the peer-critiquing is unhelpful and the discussions become tired. But 99% of the time, it was a really great class and I looked forward to each one.",
    "This course was well structured. We read a very diverse set of material and many examples of great writing.",
    "Strengths: Great readings. Discovered some of my new favorite authors The workshopping process is awesome and it's inspiring to read other students' essays Weaknesses: Does a sloppy job at teaching footnotes in Chicago style The essay on profiling a person was by far the most difficult because I felt we weren't given enough direction on how to ask good questions in the interview. As a result, I think most people ended up with a patchy summary of the interviewee's life which was difficult to form into a coherent essay Grading can be frustrating (not exactly a weakness, just something you have to learn to deal with)"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a really fun and solid class. I'd especially recommend this course to someone who enjoys writing with more creative freedom and less restrictions. I'd tell a student interested in this class that it may spark or renew a love for writing. After this class ended, I found myself still wanting to write and considering joining a few publications.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a fun way to give an overview of the Essay as a form of writing. The work is manageable, and I found that it is really easy to be creative in this course. As I like to say, if you take English 120, you should come out of qualified to write a good Op-Ed or column.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any Yale student from any background of English class experience. English has always been one of my weakest subjects and while I am not sure how I measure up for comparison with other Yalies, I can definitively say that I felt confident in my ability to succeed in English 120.",
    "Definitely recommend, I think every student at Yale should take it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, even if they aren't interested in majoring in English\/anything in the humanities. The readings are objectively interesting, and Palmer is an attentive and accessible professor.",
    "I think if you're an English major or STEM, it's a good course to take that'll improve your writing. Expect a decent workload however.",
    "I would recommend this class. I learned a lot about how to relate my own stories and identity to the wider world and loved the readings. This class worked its way into most of my other classes, and I think I became a better and more articulate speaker because of it.",
    "Maybe if they only cared about reading a lot of modern authors, but already knew how to write well and were willing to copy the style of other authors.",
    "This was by far the best course I took first semester freshman year. It vastly changed not only how I write but also how I see the world. While it sounds cliche, I now examine my surroundings with a journalistic eye, and feel inspired to continue writing creative nonfiction.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I have never enjoyed and improved my writing so much. I have never enjoyed reading for an English class so much. Each essay is given an appropriate amount of time to be completed, and each one is very fulfilling.",
    "I would recommend this if you would like to improve your writing. Many call this course \"how to write a good college essay\" and it certainly feels that way. I do think my writing has improved despite not getting the best grade in this class.",
    "Yes. At first I was undecided between Engl120 and Engl114 and I'm glad I went with 120 for two main reasons: I think the readings are much more interesting (The New Yorker! David Foster Wallace! Joan Didion!) and I enjoyed the reflective nature of writing about personal topics. I took English120 the fall semester of freshman year after hearing from other students and professors in the English department that this class is the gem of the Yale english department that everyone must take it before they graduate. While I'm glad I took it early because it did help improve my writing for all future courses, I wish I had realized that engl120 is offered literally every semester of Yale, while other intro courses are only offered in the fall each year. If I was more strategic, I would have taken engl120 in the spring semester."
