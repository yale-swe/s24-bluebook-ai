    "I would definitely recommend EVST 261 to another student! The material is really interesting, the professors are wonderful, and we had great guest lecturers too. The workload was manageable, and the work was rewarding. Amazing course overall!",
    "Do not take it.",
    "A decent survey course, but don't expect to leave with a deep understanding of anything except for your elements you wrote about for your midterm and final paper.",
    "This class is an interesting cross-over between geology and health. If you are interesting in environmental studies or environmental medicine definitely take this course. I thought it was interesting and had great guest lectures. Al the material tied into almost ALL of my other classes; this class is great at realizing the relationships you have to the elements we take into our bodies and what that can affect.",
    "There are no exams which is great because you get to just sit and enjoy the guest lectures, with worrying about being tested on anything they say. Also for a minerals and human health class there is very little being taught about minerals. This is more of a broad intro class to environmental health.However, the midterm and finals paper became increasingly difficult because Blake and Skinner expected you to be able to really delve into scientific literature without really teaching us how too. There were also no clear expectations for the papers, but I didn't receive a good grade on my midterm paper because I didn't meet their expectations that were not clearly explained. It was annoying to be honest.Also the grading distribution wasn't given out until reading week, and you go into reading week having no idea how you did in the class because we didn't receive grades on almost anything we did. Which is just not okay.So I do not recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are fundamentally interested in many different science topics and can make yourself focus. The papers and presentations allow you the flexibility to investigate those areas that interest you most, but be careful if you expect it to be a well-structured class.",
    "While this class lacks focus - it bounces back and forth between many topics, mineralogy, health, disease control, to name a few - you walk away with a lot of knowledge and an appreciation for mankind's inherent relationship to the earth from which he is made. The papers offer a lot of latitude and, when you take ownership of them, can result in great research and writing. Plus, taking any class with one of the Skinners is a must do for any student of the earth or environment."
