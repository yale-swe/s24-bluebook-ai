    "I feel like I eventually learned a fair bit from this course due to the homework assignments and the TA. The lectures went right over my head ... I think most times I understood less than 10% of what was going on.",
    "The lectures were very theoretical, and would be easier to understand if more examples were provided. Homework assignments were relevant to the course material, but the instructions to complete them were not adequate.",
    "Strengths: homework assignments were comprehensive and practical application of the material. TA was very helpful.Weaknesses: I had trouble following lecture\/ lecture notes.I would recommend this course in the final spring semester of courses for CDE. We had not learned the basis of much of the material that we were expected to know when homework was assigned (we learned during categorical\/ linear data analysis after these homeworks were assigned). I feel we would have gotten a lot more out of the course if we had already completed the foundational courses prior.",
    "This is a good course for students who are truly interested in Epidemiology.Weakness: it can be pretty abstract and hard to get the point of some of the lectures. The homework assignments aren't always clear what exactly is being asked.Strengths: It's interesting to see inside the models that we use everyday in Epi, to think more about the assumptions, and to question the standard procedures to see what is really important.",
    "The major strength of this course is the wonderful practice you get analyzing different types of datasets. The Friday discussion sections were also a very valuable resource. The only weakness is the heavy math focus of the lectures that was difficult to follow at times.",
    "I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THIS COURSE. SUBJECT MATERIAL WAS MORE STATISTICALLY ORIENTED. HOWEVER, IT HELPED ME UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS OF VARIOUS EPIDEMIOLOGICAL METHODS.",
    "I really liked the class."

    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch is incredibly intelligent and that is obvious, but he cannot communicate his knowledge in a way that a student could possibly understand. Luckily, the TA was able to simplify some concepts, but there is still so much that was inaccessible.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch is clearly very knowledgeable about the course material, but lectures would be easier to follow if they had more relevant examples.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Extremely comprehensive.Emphasis on mathematical foundation of epidemiology was informative but left me confused in many lectures.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch did a great jobThe lectures are full of information, and may need to be re-read a time or two to get it, but he was always willing to answer questions as many times as necessary to get the point across.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Extremely intelligent, interesting professor. Very glad to have taken the course with him.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0HE IS A GENUINE PERSONALITY. HE WANTS EVERY STUDENT TO LEARN THE MATERIAL. HIS METHOD OF EXPLAINING IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER INSTRUCTORS. BUT YOU LEARN TO COMPREHEND HIS THOUGHT PROCESS EVENTUALLY. OVERALL, HE IS A GENIUS, HE KNOWS HIS MATERIAL, AND A GOOD TEACHER.I WOULD REQUEST TO HIM TO GIVE HIS EXAMPLES IN SAS, RATHER THAN GLIM.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0The instructor knows his subject matter and therefore has been able to put together a course that is a good mix of theory and application. Really like the notes.In terms of HW grading, it was a bit prescriptive on the TA's part. She handled my countering points well though :)"

She was always available by email or for meetings, she prepared for every discussion and helped us to understand concepts that we were unclear on. She is a wonderful TA and will be a wonderful teacher someday.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Josefa was an excellent teaching assistant. She was knowledgeable of the material and very generous with her time at office hours and during discussion.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Excellent TA. Pleasant, approachable, well informed. Excellent communicator. Would not have gotten through the homework assignments without her help.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Sefa is awesome! She was always there to help explain what the homework assignments are asking for and to make sure we get on the right path.She would answer the questions shecould, and ask Dr. Risch about the others.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Sefa was amazing. She was able to explain things clearly so that I understood each component of the weekly homework. She also was wonderful in answering questions on her own time either through email or by appointment. She is one of the best TAs I have had at Yale!",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0SHE IS AMAZING. THIS IS MY SECOND COURSE WITH HER. SHE IS GREAT PERSON AND A VERY GOOD TEACHER. SHE IS VERY SENSITIVE TO OUR CONCERNS. SHE CAN EXPLAIN EVEN DIFFICULT QUESTIONS WITHOUT AN EFFORT. IF SHE IS NOT SURE OF SOME THINGS, SHE ALWAYS ASKED THE INSTRUCTOR AND EMAILED US HIS RESPONSES.ADDITIONALLY, SHE RESPONDS TO EMAIL QUESTIONS WITH AMAZING CLARITY.I AM NOT SURE, IF I COULD HAVE DONE WELL IN THIS COURSE WITHOUT HER.",

    "Do not take this class unless you are required to do so. We started out the semester with over 30 students and almost every student who didn't have to take it dropped it. We were left with 8 students.",

    "This is an advanced epidemiologic methods and theory class. The later homeworks can be quite time consuming, but you learn a lot about model building (from a certain perspective which may be different than other classes).I would recommend it for students who have a deep interest in the subject.",
    "Take it if you want to take epi to the next level by actually analyzing interesting data. Great complement to the statistics courses--actually helps you understand why you are doing what you are doing!",

    "I would recommend this class if you had already taken more elementary Epi and Biostats courses. I was very glad to see that the instructor incorporated statistically challenging models, such as non-linear models - thank you!"
