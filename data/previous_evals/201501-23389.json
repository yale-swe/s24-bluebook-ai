   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Very interesting topics were covered during the course, and it was very helpful to understand the US health system. Weaknesses: Long class, hard to keep concentrated for 2 hours. Some of the articles for the policy memos needed to be bought online. I think it would be great to have articles that we don't need to buy for the assignments.",
    "Strengths: great instructor Weaknesses: too much workload; wish there was more \"economics\" than policy.",
    "This is overall a good course with a strong emphasis in practical skills for Health Policy.",
    "The course does a good job in introducing key concepts needed to understand the complexity of the US healthcare system. There were a lot of comparisons to England's system (may be due to his educational background). TF office hours were inconvenient especially if you really wanted to take advantage to improve on policy memos. Level of expectation for case studies are above the level of this course. He wanted us to analyze the papers with a level of scrutiny that only he understood.",
    "Really enjoyed the course. As someone with little background in economics, I thought the pace was great and the explanations were great.",
    "good class, professor was very engaging and thought provoking, i liked that",
    "Great course. Learned what I wanted to learn with Health policy. Policy memos were a great exercise.",
    "Strength: Good overview of health care financing. Weakness: It is redundant. I thought this course had a lot of overlaps from Intro to Health Policy course offered in the Fall.",
    "Excellent course! Best course I have taken this semester.",
    "Solid course that teaches the fundamental principles of health economics. Professor Cooper is excellent. My main suggestions for improvement are: 1) break the class into two one-hour sessions rather than one two-hour session per week, because it's really hard to focus for two hours straight, 2) fewer policy memos because they got really tedious after a while, and 3) class not on Friday afternoons. I think some of the policy memos could perhaps be replaced by quizzes on the material -- that would solidify our understanding of the pure economics rather than only applied case studies.",
    "good course learned a lot, different from howie's class liked the lectures and discussions, felt like i could participate",
    "This class was awesome!!!!! I learned so much about the health care industry through an economic lens. I also learned the skills to write concise policy memos. This class was fairly graded and extremely well taught.",
    "Strengths: 1. A break helps students to re-focus 2. Learning points\/guiding questions on the board assist with the understanding of the lecture material Weaknesses: 1. Dr. Cooper uses a lot of data and quotes to prove a point. In my opinion, these goals can be accomplished with less but more concise statistics. Sometimes, it is easy to lose in the data presented. Shorter presentation would be helpful",
    "My favorite course of the semester. Engaging, interesting, relevant. I'm confident that the skills I learned as a consequence of this class landed me my internship and will serve me well in my job search.",
    "I honestly felt this course was great. The teaching style was well suited to discussing and learning about the topics covered. Timely responses were given on all submitted homework and the memos were a great learning tool. I personally will not find much use for learning how to write memos, but I can understand the rationale of why they were chosen. I'm not sure I have any strong recommendations for improvement, and I felt this was a very strong class.",
    "A phenomenal course. Should be required for all students and taught after micro econ. Helped me understand economic theory and how it relates to healthcare without being boring. Definitely a lot of work, but the memos are important and very helpful in preparing for my summer internship. Give more feedback on the memos though - there's no way I write a perfect memo. Provide constructive criticism without necessarily taking off more points. Very much worth taking this class.",
    "strengths: policy memos! BUT, to get more out of them, I wish I would've started ahead of time. There were a couple of times when I was confused which readings I should use, so I'd also suggest skimming everything before starting on the memos. weakness; slides - could be more informative Case study - loved them, but would've been helpful if there was a guide (like there was for policy memos) for how to prep for them; also, would be helpful if a copy was available at the library.",
    "Very positive about this class. The standard is set high during the first week and you cannot get away with being unprepared \/ not showing up. The memos make that you will learn more in depth about certain topics discussed in class. Also, very relevant and interesting aspects of health econ are covered in this class. Improvement: personally I wouldn't mind a bigger emphasis on econ concepts (and a quantitative part) during the first classes because now its pretty much focused on intuition.",
    "The course was a great introductory overview of the US health system and the economic principles that underlie it. Having had very little background in health economics entering the course, it provided a gentle primer on the topic. However, there were parts of the course when lectures\/discussions got meaningless bogged down in excessive debate, or where Professor Cooper strayed into territory that was not well explained in the course readings or in the lecture slides. Overall, though, a very strong course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is a very good professor, he knows a lot of what he is teaching, and explains things in a very simple matter, not needing to have a strong microeconomics background.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Great instructor! Very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper is pompous about basic economic concepts. That being said, he is passionate and a dynamic lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0One of the best instructors at ysph. very approachable and willing to answer any questions you may have regarding health economics, or healthcare in general. very intelligent, cold call policy helps to stimulate class discussion.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Did a good job, very knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0I thought Dr. Cooper did a nice job making lectures interesting and interactive, I enjoyed going to class.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0good class, professor was very engaging and thought provoking, i liked that",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Prof Cooper is very knowledgeable and personable.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Zack Cooper is an awesome professor! Very cool, and very knowledgeable. The policy memos were designed very well and I learned a lot from this course.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Great professor. He is always articulate, engaging, and sensitive to student needs.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0total bro awesome dude great speaker great guy learned a lot",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He is an amazing professor. He is extremely intelligent and presents the material and concepts in a very clear and comprehensive way.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Uses too many data such that I forget what the point he was trying to prove. Going over the policy memos AFTER they have been graded, such as on the common mistakes people made, and how students can improve for the next one would be helpful. I understand that there was no right or wrong answer for each memo, but I didn't think I had adequate amount of guidance when it comes to the writing part.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0I greatly enjoyed learning from Dr. Cooper. He was always engaging and knowledgable, even when sick. He has a great interactive class environment and succeeded in garnering more class participation than any other instructor I've had from this program. It was a pleasure to be in his class and made for a fun semester.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0The best teacher I've had at YSPH. Provides a great narrative, has a wealth of experience, is responsive to students, but challenges them as well. I would encourage all students to take classes with Professor Cooper.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0decently nice. interesting research.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper was an absolute delight. With a clearly comprehensive and impressive grasp of the material, he skillfully taught each lecture with flair and successfully kept students engaged. His lecture slides frequently had typographic mistakes, which made them a bit difficult to review, and he was also unreliable in posting lecture notes online. Aside from issues with lecture notes, however, he was a fantastic professor to learn from."

   "comments": [
    "It is both an overview and a dissection of the current US health care system, which is already very complex to understand to begin with. I really enjoyed it and learned a lot from it. You also learn to do policy memos, which are very helpful.",
    "I would recommend taking HPM510 to fulfill the MPH requirement because of the workload, but this class is definitely an informative class for policy students!",
    "Great course - very engaging lectures and fun policy memos throughout the semester with well-thought-out prompts. Assuming that Zach wrote the exam himself, it may have been the most smartly-written exam I've taken - really great at testing for knowing the general principles, not too much trivia. Incorporates lots of his groundbreaking research into lectures, stimulates class discussion effectively while tying everything together at the end of every lecture to make sure we have take-home, big picture understanding of the content for the day. Maybe, MAYBE, just a little too much emphasis on England's NHS compared to other health systems to be used as comparison to US'. However, Zach's background is with NHS, so this focus makes sense and is very insightful due to his actual experience. Not that much overlap with Howie Forman's class at SOM, but still many of the same topics are covered. This class is more centered on health economics, where Howie's class is more finance\/business of healthcare.",
    "If you do not have a policy background, this course may be of great challenge. However, TFs and professors are willing to work with you as long as you put in the work.",
    "Definitely recommend. Very practical and eye-opening.",
    "good class, very engaging lectures",
    "Anyone interested in the healthcare system should take this class",
    "I would recommend this course only to students who have no background in health care financing and\/or insurance mechanisms.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "Very good course on the fundamental principles of health economics. Professor Cooper is excellent. The seven policy briefs do get tiresome after a while, though, so be prepared to spend your Thursday days \/ Friday mornings churning out a policy brief.",
    "good class, take it",
    "This course is a MUST TAKE at the YSPH. It is a great course on the economics of the health care industry and you learn how the health care sector is unique. You get so much experience writing policy memos but the work load is totally manageable. You have to write 7 2-page policy memos, 1 in class midterm, and 1 take home final. TAKE IT.",
    "I think this course has a lot of strengths. It covers a number of important topics in health policy. But improvements can still be made such as more rigorous approach for the writing of the policy memo, more detailed and TIMELY feedback. Reinterating how the topics all fit into the big picture throughout the semester would be appreciated.",
    "A great overview of U.S. Health Policy and the basics of health economics, with an emphasis on understanding how health economics may be different from classic economics. The class also does a great job of teaching where the failings in the system are, from where they arise, and provides some insight into how they might be addressed. I would definitely recommend this course as I had a great time learning, and for the first time feel as if I can actually debate health policy in a meaningful way.",
    "A great course, especially you're interested in how economics influences choices made in healthcare from an individual as well as organizational\/state perspective. It's a lot of work but very much worth the effort.",
    "recommended most to those interested in us health econ (or london's as prof. cooper draws from his experience\/research in london as well)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is one of the classes during which I learned most about health econ en US Policy. There's really an incentive to perform well in this class which enables you to get more out of the class. Pace can be quite slow sometimes.",
    "A great introduction to health economics and contemporary debates in US healthcare policy. Strongly recommended for any studentgraduate or undergraduatewith an interest in the topic, especially considering the relevance of the topic in current politics. Lectures are enjoyable and the workload is entirely manageable: 6 two-page policy memos, a midterm exam, and a take-home final. Definitely take this course!"
