    "Only with a sufficient programming, CS or cog-sci background.",
    "After taking this course I realized AI is a field that sounds far more exciting than it really is. In reality, there are too many details to worry about when solving even the smallest problem.That being said, this course is a good overview of the topics in AI, and I don't think you can find a more articulate and knowledgeable professor than Scaz. The problem sets were long, but really fun (especially the last one where we got to simulate the evolution of ants).Word of advice: The prof says the exams won't include a lot of memorization, but trust me, they do. Make use of the one piece of paper you're allowed to bring, and fill it up with facts from the lectures.",
    "Still in the early stages, since this was the first year it's been taught. The lectures are clear and interesting, but this year at least the assignments and finals were not really reflective of how well you understood the lectures or how much work you put into the course. This class also suffers from a lack of practice problems. You'll like the course for the lectures and the material, but you'll also be mad frustrated by the psets and the studying.",
    "Scaz gives great lectures, and I enjoyed this class - I'd recommend using as an elective if you're a major. That said, I'll focus on the negatives, since the positives are apparent to a shopper. If you're going to pick one of his courses, take robotics.-This course was clearly composed several years ago and hasn't been updated since. Slides and tests (and maybe problem sets) are direct repeats of previous years.-Suprisingly time-consuming problem sets, often in vaguely busy work kind of ways.-Worst TF\/professor communication ever. There is no way to know what will be on tests, and the TF clearly didn't have a hand in writing most of the problem sets. TF interactions were very frustrating.-There's some overlap. People who took robotics did much better on tests.",
    "Take it if you want a general survey of AI. The material is interesting, problem sets were doable but challenging. Be prepared for a ridiculous midterm and final.",
    "Easy CS elective.",
    "Definitely. A very good introduction to Artificial Intelligence.",
    "This is a great course. The lectures are really interesting. There's a fair amount of work, and some of the programming can be a bit frustrating, but it's not too heavy a load. There's quite a bit of overlap with Scaz's robotics course (473), though there's still a lot of new material if you've taken that.",
    "Overall, a nice survey of AI. A few problem sets, a midterm, and a final gave the course a very predictable and manageable workload. A lot of information that will give you a solid base and understanding of a variety of AI topics, all with great lectures."
