   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take it! A 5-pg (thematic) paper, 10-pg (source analysis) paper, midterm and final. It may seem like a lot of work but it's really worth it. The papers were actually fun to write. I personally really enjoyed learning about church history, the crusades, and petty animosity between various monarchs.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. History of the Middle Ages 1000-1500 covers the growth of papal power, centralized power within states, knights and castles, growth of cultural exchange, etc. Not only were the topics very interesting, but the lecturer was also quite good. And, if you have the chance, try to get into Aaron Vanides' section.",
    "I would recommend this clss to another student. We learned about the history and interactions between culture, politics, religion, and academia in the High Middle Ages, focusing on causes, consequences, and the evolution of Europe as an entity.",
    "Interesting class on the high middle ages. I would recommend it if you care about the material. I had never taken an actual history class at Yale and I'm glad I took this one. 2 papers, one is 10 pages and seems monstrous at first, but is actually quite manageable. You get to pick your own topic and I found myself actually enjoying the research process. Prof. Freedman is super nice.",
    "Do not take this class as a freshman! Very quick pace, lots of reading, tough grading on papers and essays.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a period of history we rarely learn about in depth and Professor Freedman is great. There is a lot of reading and you need to go to lecture, but it is mostly interesting. I took the class Credit\/D which helped take the stress off of reading every single thing, so I'd definitely recommend that as an option.",
    "I would recommend it for non-history majors who want to get some idea of the time period. The class does not go into depth and does not effectively contextualize the material or follow themes throughout the semester.",
    "Take it credit\/d for sure, you'll get to listen to one of the greatest lecturers at yale!",
    "Yes, great class. Fun, interesting lecture, entertaining section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a wonderful way to learn about a period of history commonly overlooked.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is very interesting, especially considering the amount of media made based on the middle ages. This class taught me about the reality of the middle ages and cleared up some misconceptions. It taught me about the role of religion and the aristocracy in revelatory detail. The lecturing was clear and easy, the reading was necessary, and sections were useful.",
    "If you don't know anything about the Middle Ages, then this class is great. If, however, you already have some background in the time period, then the superficiality of the course can be frustrating. Also, the class is very Kings and Popes heavy. It would have been nice if we had talked more about women, minorities, and ordinary people. Freedman is a fantastic lecturer. Work load was a bit heavier than expected, 2 papers, midterm, final. The final was cumulative, which was a bit annoying, but overall not too demanding of a class.",
    "The perfect lecture course. Paul Freedman is a boss. Incredibly engaging lectures, super interesting readings, not too much work. You'll come out of this course confident about the contours of 500 years of really important history. Even if you're not interested in the material, shop it. I didn't think I would be interested in this stuff, but Freedman made it super interesting. This stuff is so important for today. Take it! FANTASTIC history course!",
    "This was a very good class. Freedman was always engaging and insightful. And the many different aspects of the Middle Ages were always interesting to learn about. Unfortunately, two of the reading assignments were pretty pointless: the Black Death book and the Peasant's Life book. But other than those two, the rest of the reading assignments were great, the Tierney and Jordan books in particular. The workload was completely reasonable and actually mostly enjoyable. I can't say I liked the lack of IDs on the midterm and final, but at least both exams still had very reasonable expectations. I'd very much recommend this course, as it's nice to know that the Middle Ages really weren't that bad after all.",
    "Definitely take it. You'll have a better understanding of church and state relations and medieval culture. A workload larger than the norm: readings, a midterm paper, midterm exam, final paper, and final exam. Very humorous lectures from Paul Freedman.",
    "Take it if you like European history. It's dope sauce",
    "take it cr\/d",
    "It was a good history lecture.",
    "If you're looking for a funny, engaging European history professor, then you absolutely have to take this class with Prof. Freedman. Even if you are not eveninterested in Medieval Europe, Prof Freedman lectures guarantee fun and a more light-hearted approach to what could be a terribly boring subject.",
    "If you're interested in medieval history, I would recommend this course. However, don't expect to walk out knowing about all the important wars that happened in the Middle Ages, etc. It's more of a broad social history than a nuts-and-bolts here-are-the-facts kind of history. That's not to say you don't learn anything -- I know much more about the Middle Ages now than I did before I took the class, especially with regard to the conflicts between the church and the state, which is the most interesting part of the course. Just be aware that you're not going to walk out of this class an expert on the Hundred Years' War, etc. Probably a good class for history majors to take.",
    "This was one of the best courses I've taken thus far at Yale! Professor Freedman gives very interesting lectures, and there's hardly any work at all- just reading for section each week, 2 papers, and 2 easy-to-prepare-for exams. If you have any interest at all in the Middle Ages or history, you should definitely take this course.",
    "It is a fantastic, fairly easy, and interesting class. If you're interested in medieval or European history at all, you should take the class. The professor and TFs are amazing. I never wanted to miss a lecture or a reading.",
    "This was an absolutely perfect History lecture. I\"m a history major, so I've had some experience with different kinds of classes, and this was the perfect blend of informative, entertaining lectures, personalized section, and enlightening but not overly heavy reading. I'm so happy I took this class. From a personal learning perspective, it gives a great background and understanding for the rise of the modern state and the Catholic Church\/the Papacy. If you really want to understand why Europe is the way it is today, take this course. You won't regret it!",
    "Paul Freedman is a great lecturer, and this class was well-taught, well-organized, and fascinating. Even if it's not a period of history that you've ever thought about or thought you were interested in, you should take this because it will give you a new appreciation for elements of modern society, both inside and outside of Europe, that we take usually take for granted.",
    "Great class. Lots of reading, but it is all useful and informative. Professor Freedman is wonderful. Take it!",
    "Great! Took Credit\/D so didn't do much of the reading, but going to lectures was fun. The midterm and final are not too difficult, but there are two papers - one about 10 pages - so keep that in mind.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Birth of Europe is a great class, definitely a must take for history majors interested in Europe.Definitely more focused on high politics of papacy and kingdoms, but it is balanced by considerable attention on culture, trade, disease, and persecution.The readings were for the most part incredibly interesting, and it is abundantly clear which readings you need to do and which ones you can skim.As a whole, not too much work, and a ton of reward.Professor Freedman is also fantastic--I often found myself laughing out loud in lecture because of his jokes.",
    "If I could do it over again, I absolutely would not take this course. The workload was not that heavy, but I knew a handful of people in the class and NO ONE gets above a B on ANYTHING. I guess the grade deflation has already begun...",
    "Yes! Take it!!!!!!! This is a wonderful history lecture. The best I've taken at Yale. Well organized , fairly graded, great TFs, and super interesting topic. I had no interest going in, but Professor Freedman is one of Yale's best and makes what could be a dull topic extremely fascinating!!!!",
    "Interesting lecture course from an expert professor. Prof. Freedman is also a very funny and genuinely friendly person. The workload was very manageable, especially if you don't procrastinate on the final paper. It was a good survey class, but difficult for a freshman like myself because there areonly four grades in the course, not many chances for feedback.",
    "Pretty basic history class. 2 papers a midterm and final. Not too much work but I learned a lot",
    "Its a great overview of the history of medieval Europe. The material may at times seem like a lot, but you really only have to know big themes and important events and people in detail.",
    "Take the class if you find yourself beforehand at least somewhat interested in the material. The class, overall, is not too hard. Your discussion sections can also make or break the class. Professor Freedman is a solid professor, but nothing spectacular in my opinion.",
    "I took this class credit d. It's fun, and not too much work. A good way to learn about something you might not have much experience with before.",
    "I would totally recommend it! You learn a lot about a crucial time in European history with fun and interesting topics. Professor Freedman knows how to instill in each student the curiosity needed to success in History, so if you want to get a taste of the standard History lecture at Yale go for this! Reading is light and not really necessary sometimes. Midterm and final are straightforward and requires knowing well about a few topics and making connections between them. Still it takes effort to get a good grade, but don't worry if you get decent ones on the first few assignments.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning more about this time period in Europe from a Professor who makes it interesting.",
    "If you are interested in the history of the Middle Ages or looking for an interesting credit- take this. It is not a ton of work (2 papers, 2 exams)- a lot of reading but not totally necessary to do all of it if you go to lectures, which you should.",
    "Good history class. I really enjoyed it. If you are interested in the material and the time period it is well taught and has good readings. I recommend.",
    "NOt the most organized lectures. Freedman would sometimes ramble. The lectures weren't too connected and were not in chronological order. If you don't have to take this for a per-industrial then you should take a different preindustrial class.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The topic is very interesting, and Professor Freedman is a wonderful lecturer. The reading can be boring, though. The Jordan book especially I found hard to get through. But the primary source material is pretty interesting and very readable.",
    "Yes I would recommend it - it gave me a great background knowledge of the Middle Ages. Freedman is a great lecturer: his passion for the subject really motivates you to learn the material properly.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking it. The Birth of Europe was honestly one of my favorite courses I've taken so far at Yale. The material was extremely interesting, Freedman is incredibly witty and relatable and my TA (Christian Burset) was probably the best TA I've ever had at Yale. Very few other history courses allow for a manageable work load and really make you feel like you have mastered a topic. You'll be surprised at how much you've learned and how interested you were by the end of it.",
    "Yes. Freedman's lectures are great and the material is very interesting - a crucial transition period in European (and world) history from the Dark Ages to the age of colonization and from feudalism to the growth of the state apparatus."
