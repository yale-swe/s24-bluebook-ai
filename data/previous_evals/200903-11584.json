   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student, if at all interested in screenwriting.",
    "The course is entertaining, informative, and enjoyable. Lapadula sure is a character. Lapadula is a guy filled with wonderful stories and a guy who knows a lot about the business. He's very accessible and refreshingly and at times scarily honest.",
    "This class is great. Definitely take it. It really helps with your writing structure. Lapadula is great as well, and it's nice to get support from your fellow writers.",
    "Its a bit unorganized. Filled with women, and you read good scripts and listen to decent stories",
    "This class is great. Entertaining but also insightful, and you learn a lot about how to unfold a narrative as well as just about yourself. It's about how much you want to put into it, so take it if you love investing in the creative process, and you'll learn a lot and have fun along the way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in writing. It's a lot of fun and you learn a lot.",
    "It's an incredible class- Marc Lapadula is outstanding- and you'll definitely have a blast. I recommend it full heartedly.",
    "This course is an introductory course and at first you learn the basics but you o so through fun methods. I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to expllore this field.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that teaches you how to format a screenplay and leaves you with an 8-to-12 page screenplay that's been peer reviewed and given sound advice. It's a good start, it teaches you some of what you need to know to work more on your own, but you definitely get out of the class what you put into it - the more screenplays you read and the more you meet with your subgroups out of class to get your screenplay reviewed (which involves getting everything that's going to be due done a little bit early), the more you'll learn and the better off you'll be."
