   "comments": [
    "The format of the seminar could be updated to facilitate better open discussion between the students or students & instructor. Perhaps doing more of the small group activities will encourage more of the students to speak and share their thoughts with a smaller group rather than the whole class and instructor. Structuring the seminar in a way that depends on student participation and discussion could be another way too. The class readings, material and discussion put a lot of emphasis on the western history of science and did not at all mention or explore the history of non-western science. I think this is a major drawback in every classroom, but especially for a class at a \"global\" institution like Yale. Another are to improve is to introduce the review paper assignment early and stress the importance of it and how it is set up to help the students start thinking about their prospectus. One idea is to have the students introduce an important paper that they are citing in a short (3-5min) and informal way to their classmates two times throughout the term.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was the ways it encouraged us to appreciate and take advantage of the interdisciplinary environment at the School. I wish we had more time dedicated to learning more about each other's research and putting into practice some of the interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration we were discussing in class. I also liked the final assignment (i.e. lit review).",
    "The syntax for textbook was quite difficult to read. I also think some materials discussed in class were basic (e.g., distinction of incremental vs transformative science), for which I think less class time could be allocated. It was very helpful to learn about alternative career paths to academia. However, I would have liked to have more input on what it takes to pursue the academic career path, which I am interested in taking. Apart from that, it was very interesting to learn how doctoral students are expected to engage in the communities of FES, Yale, academia, and broader society."
