   "comments": [
    "It offers many insight in the relationship between human and nature through globalization",
    "Wouldn't recommend this course unless you're really into theory. The answer to pretty much every question in this class is \"it's complicated.\" Some of the readings were really interesting, but many were very dull and technical. Prof Hebert does a great job helping the class understand the material, but she often speaks in very vague, generalized terms. There is a lot of reading and writing in this class, but it's all manageable.",
    "Definitely an engaging class on a really interesting and important topic! Prof Hebert is great; it was run kinda like a hybrid between a seminar and a lecture, since our class was like 20ish people, so at times it'd be like crickets chirping - but I definitely appreciated that she wanted us to actively participate and when it actually happened it was great. Wish it was a WR credit also though, cuz we definitely had so many reading responses (3 interspersed through the semester, 3 as a midterm take home exam, and then 3 more as a final take home exam.",
    "Yes, take it!! I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It really questions your perspective on a whole range of different issues related to globalization. The readings are diverse and captivating, though some are also esoteric and a bit hard to get through. You can get away in class with not doing the reading, but you'll have to do a lot of catch-up for response paper and the take home midterm\/final so you might as well just do it before class. If you're interested in either the political, environmental, or social effects of globalization, take the class--it will expand your perspective and make you look more critically at all those effects and more.",
    "Definitely recommended. Professor Hbert makes the class and readings come alive in engaging discussion each week.",
    "A fantastic class! This course offers food for thought for everyone, regardless of major. Professor Hebert is great - a good lecturer and a really nice person. You will be doing some interesting reading. And if you are prepared for a bit of discussion and occasional essay writing, you will do fine. Anyone with an interest in the environment, labor issues, international relations, and the history of any of these things will enjoy this course.",
    "Yes! This course covers a lot of different aspects of globalization (such as food, product certification, history, etc) and has a little something for everybody. The grading is a little strict and you have to adhere to the reading response requirements to get a proficient grade. The work load isn't too much but you have to think very critically, analytically and creatively to get top marks. Overall a very fun, engaging course!",
    "A good class if your thinking of anthropology but don't take if you want to study environmental science",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anthropology majors, but also anyone within the realm of social science. This course addresses a broad selection of pertinent, contemporary issues -- from industrial food, to payment for environmental services (PES) programs that pay for conservation, to sustainable development projects. Although you do have to adjust to the prevalence of anthropological terminology, writing styles, and approaches to inquiry, Professor Hebert makes these more accessible by offering explanations in her Powerpoints\/lessons. The fact alone that this is an Anthro course should not turn you away from this class if you are less familiar and\/or enthusiastic about the discipline. The readings, after all, offer a mix of intellectual approaches and writing styles to address the course's themes; not just one type of anthropologist."
