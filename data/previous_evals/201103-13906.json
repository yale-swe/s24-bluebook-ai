    "Survey of Islamic architecture from the 7th to 20th century. Covers a lot of material.",
    "I really liked learning about a religion and different regions of the world through its architecture. It was really valuable in that respect. However, it's difficult to break into the material if you don't have a background in architecture or Islamic art.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The subject matter is fascinating and it is well taught.",
    "The course is a good intro to islamic architecture, with an emphasis on the cultural aspect of the buildings and their development. Expect to look at a lot of mosques. The second half of the semester is more interesting than the first, as the buildings become more complicated architecturally and socially.",
    "Yes.",
    "I absolutely loved this course, and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the subject matter. Although I went into this course with only a basic understanding of Islam and a limited knowledge of this style of architecture, I feel like I was able to gain a lot from the course. Professor Rizvi is very clear and thorough in her lectures, but completing all of the readings is very integral to performing well in this course, as it provides a lot more depth to the themes presented in the course. Admittedly, this course is very art history friendly, but the course's approach from an architectural perspective is effective. This class is fantastic.",
    "I recommend this course. The work load is really light especially since you don't really need to do the readings. It's also the only course at Yale dealing with Islamic architecture so if that's something that aligns with your interests definitely take it.",
    "Take this class! It's really interesting and you learn about things you wouldn't otherwise learn about in another class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "If you are interested in learning about Islamic architecture - a great course! This is a really a course for you if you are interested in both Islamic culture\/ history as well as architecture\/ art history. This is an intro course - so both are covered in more general terms. But you will leave with a pretty good understanding and intuition for understanding Islamic architecture. Not a very heavy workload - just one or two weekly readings. midterm, final and a small paper. Really manageable! great 5th course."
