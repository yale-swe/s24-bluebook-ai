    "Where MATH112 is right now, I wouldn't recommend it as an easy QR, and would highly discourage anyone from taking it that isn't interested in Calc. I spent a lot of time in this course dazed, confused and frustrated.",
    "There is not a ton of homework, but what you have to do is pretty much impossible. I would not recommend this class unless you have to take it. It is not an easy QR, and all the instructors are quite unable to actually teach in a way that will help you understand.",
    "It's not too bad of a math class, so if you need math credit or are a math major then definitely take it.",
    "one of my favorite classes at yaletaught so welli really felt like i learned math",
    "Math 112 was unnecessarily difficult and stressful this semester.",
    "I would recommend section 4 of Math 112 to any student who has taken AP Calc AB in high school. Professor Orszag does a great job at preparing his students for the exams.",
    "A pretty hard Calculus class.",
    "Don't take it, unless absolutely need to. The material seems understandable until it comes up on the exams and you realize you have no idea, the professors aren't very good, and it's kind of made me hate math.",
    "I would summarize it as an unfair and overly difficult course that could not possibly make anybody excited about math. I would only recommend it because it is necessary to some important majors.",
    "Yes I would but I would tell them to expect to have to study a lot out of class because the lectures do not cover the topics very fully.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! If you have to for premed or whatever, shop each of the sections to find the best TA\/professor. In this class, Professor Orszag was not that. He just was not a good teacher. Coming in to college, math was my favorite subject. Taking this class took away ALL of the love I once had for math and just left me confused and hating it. Only take it if you need math for something, not for fun. And if you do, try and get Andrew as your teacher.",
    "Not at all. If you can take ANY course instead of this one, please do not take Math 112. It will make you miserable."
