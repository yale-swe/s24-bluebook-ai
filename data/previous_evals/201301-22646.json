    "WAYYY too much work for a language class. Super hard. Struggling to get above a C. occasionally interesting",

    "Professor Sabe is great! There was a lot more work than in L1, but they are often very interesting materials and the professor tries to make the class fun and enjoyable.",
    "Good continuation of elementary Spanish. If you want to learn this is the way to go",
    "Would recommend it because you have to take a language and spanish is very organized."
