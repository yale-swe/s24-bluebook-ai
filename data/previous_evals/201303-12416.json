Really, the problem is that there are almost no courses for graduate students, and the ones that do exist are strangely (and somewhat pathetically) bad. It might be the lesser of evils, in the sense that at least it doesn't take up too much time and prevent you from being in lab.",
    "I will recommend fellow students who has interest in stem cell or would use stem cell as material in their research for the class.",
    "Yes. Excellent class",
    "I would recommend it. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of stem cell research.",
    "Yes. One of the advantages of being at yale and listen to lectures from great professors."
