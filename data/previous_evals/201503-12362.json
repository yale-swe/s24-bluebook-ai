   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because even though it is difficult when you have not had experience with this material, it is very rewarding when you have worked really hard and can finally understand the concepts taught in the course.",
    "If you have taken Calc BC before, you should be taking Math 120. I made this mistake and spent the entire semester reviewing material that I already knew. It won't be as interesting, challenging, or rewarding as taking Math 120 would have been.",
    "I would recommend this course if it may help you later in life or you would like to learn about intro calc concepts",
    "I would probably tell a student who doesn't need to take it not to take it. For example, say a friend of mine who didn't need Math115 for their major was considering the class. I would tell them to turn and take something like econ to fill their QR requirement - especially if they were as bad at math as I am.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you need it as a pre-req for something more interesting. It was very boring, the tests were very difficult, and problem sets were hard and often took 4 or 5 hours each. It's also not a good way to teach calculus the wide and unrelated set of concepts were glossed over in a very harried way and the things you learn in class and in the mandatory prep videos are not necessarily indicative of what you'll find on problem sets or tests.",
    "I would recommend math 115 to a student who took BC calc before in high school since the course is tailored towards those with prior experience in the subject.",
    "I would recommend this class! It is probably best for students who have already been exposed to the concepts before in high school (ie BC calc) otherwise it might be pretty difficult.",
    "Take Jim Rolf's class",
    "I would not recommend this class unless extremely interested in calculus, or if it was a prerequisite for a major. Otherwise it felt like high school all over again.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think the method of videos and prep problems is effective.",
    "Math 115 is integral calculus. If you've done BC Calculus, I would skip it. I took BC and this made me more confused and less sure of what I knew about calculus.",
    "Tough course",
    "Yes, Math 115 is a solid calculus class. I would recommend for someone who needs to take the class or just wants to learn more about math. I learned a lot this semester, though I prefer a traditional classroom to a flipped classroom.",
    "It's a pretty standard calculus class. It'll teach you what you need to know to move on to higher math classes\/for your major. It's not too difficult as long as you keep up."
