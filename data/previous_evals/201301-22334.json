   "comments": [
    "I really don't understand why this course is necessary especially since it wasn't necessary before.",
    "Though it has no prerequisites, this class is a lot more difficult if you have had no prior experience with statistics, linear algebra, and\/or programming. This is not to say that its not manageable, but it is much harder to really understand the material (of which there is A LOT)",
    "Good (and helpful) overview of many different ways of how to get a mathematical solution to a problem. Beware of a slight spike in difficulty towards the end of the course.",
    "good overview of matlab and many engineering topics, but a bit fast and not in depth for many topics.",
    "A required class for a BME major, so you'll have to take it. Since it's relatively new class, Professor Carson is still trying to figure out how it should be taught. At this point, I think that there is too much material being covered and students often feel lost and confused doing the problem sets. However, the material being covered is very interesting and is probably useful in the long run. I think that after a few years of refining the class (and ideally covering less topics), this class would be great! Problem sets do take a while and may be stressful at times.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's most likely because you're a BME major. The info is pretty useful (or it seems to be so in my mind) especially if you've never done any programming or statistics before. I had zero background in both of these fields, which made the class tough, but I'm glad to have finally gotten an introduction to them. So overall, the subject matter is kind of dry but it's useful.Professor Carson is alright... not a very good lecturer to be perfectly honest. P-sets are a big portion of your grade, so get a head start on them each week (I never did). Section was never really helpful, but that depends on the year I guess.Tl;drTake it if you have to. It will be fine and you'll learn useful stuff. Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Not unless it is for the major.",
    "BENG 249 is a necessary evil, so if you're taking the class you want to be a Biomedical Engineer. Be prepared to do outside reading on the material.",
    "Helpful if you don't know statistics already, but I recommend against going into it without a statistics background if you don't have to. Teaches you Matlab basics, but really not much. The class could have been really good, but in the end I don't think it taught me very much, due to the density of the lectures and the fact that the psets were way too hard.",
    "Take it if you are a math or BME major (as a sophomore) but beware of math preparation. Linear algebra and dif. Eq would be very helpful to have taken before this class.",
    "This class is utterly confusing. The tests are weird and you're never sure of what you're learning until the very end. Take it if you must.",
    "I would not recommend it for a non biomedical engineering major, but for those that must take it, it is truly something to look forward to, not to dread.",
    "Take it if you must. Find a friend to go through it with. DON'T take it if you don't have to.",
    "BENG 249 is a fairly good course in that you learn a lot! I came in with no knowledge of programming or statistics and came out with a working knowledge of both. There is a lot of work associated with it and the problem set sessions are immensely helpful if you have a good TA. The midterm is fair and the problem sets while work intensive are a good way to apply what you learn. The final is hard though, so study up or you will regret it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a BME major or know how to program in Matlab and have knowledge of Differential Equations. Even though it's difficult, it's something you'll kind of enjoy because you need to know this stuff for the major anyway and BME is super interesting.",
    "If you're looking to take this class, you probably have to take it for BME. It's covers a fairly rigorous amount of both Matlab programming and statistics, so if you've already taken stats a lot of the material shouldn't be too difficult. The lectures were really fast-paced, though, which means I did most of my learning through the problem sets and in section -- hopefully Shuo will be TA-ing again, because I couldn't have survived the class without her -- but Professor Carson does really try to keep the class entertaining and engaging.",
    "Do not take unless required",
    "This class was my first exposure to Matlab. It was hard to get it to do what I wantedin terms of programming statistical problems. I had previous experience with Java but it wasn't much help. Most of the problems came from the math itself. Richard Carson is a great person and a decent professor. However, he went way too fast on the later lecture. I would have preferred to have taken more time starting with unit 4. However, as this is now a required BME course and it covers useful material I would recommend taking this class.",
    "Don't take this BENG 249 if it is not required for your major. This class was the worst BME class I have taken at Yale and I feel bad about that because I love my major. The problem sets were difficult to do by yourself, the material was confusing, the professor wasn't a great lecturer, and MATLAB sucks.",
    "Intro MATLAB, most people taking it have to take it, and I feel like most people did not actually enjoy this course, but I sort of liked it...",
    "just take it if you have to. otherwise, dont",
    "It's useful to know MATLAB, but this class won't teach you everything. Definitely look into learning it on your own. Problem sets were manageable thanks to the teaching fellows (which I think were a new addition this semester), but the final and midterm were both very difficult.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and had no prior experience with programming or statistics. Theproblem sets were challenging but worthwhile and tests were difficult but fair."
