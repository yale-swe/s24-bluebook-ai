   "comments": [
    "-The case method is good, but incredibly repetitive. I think there should be 2-3 fewer cases supplemented with in class discussion of non-cases and\/or more frequent guest lectures from actual healthcare managers.-The workload was fine, but again, fairly repetitive. I don't think writing up two cases is twice as good as writing up one case. In fact, I don't think writing up cases really adds much value at all. I understand the concept, but the cases do not always connect and so I don't feel that I'm leaving this class with the the skills that I would need as a healthcare manager.-We spent a lot of time on the insurance business and hospitals and almost none on pharmaceuticals, tech, private practice, etc.",
    "Perhaps more cases outisde the context of hospitals",
    "The course was good..Liked the manner the class was conducted.. Lot of discussions.. facilitated thinking out of the box..the class had a good way of tying theoretical management concepts to healthcare and then li linking to the cases..The presentation opportunity at midterm and finals was a tremendous learning.",
    "Best course I have taken! Loved the broad range of topics.",
    "A comprehensive ending for the health management program that included analysis across the healthcare industry (e.g. case studies in hospitals, insurance, etc.)Strengths: In-depth case analysis. Opportunities to apply managerial frameworks (e.g. RCA, SWOT analysis).Weaknesses: Despite a comprehensive view of the healthcare industry, more focus was placed on hospital cases. A more consistent distribution may be more beneficial for students graduating into other sectors.",
    "This course is great! The structure, the workload, and the assignments were all very good. I did not feel like my time was wasted at any point.",
    "very interesting and practical; fun discussion in class",
    "I thought the course was great and really essential to a lot of the issues that came up in my interviews for jobs. The only thing I'd prefer is a broader application of these issues represented in the cases- eg not just hospitals.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at YSPH. It is extremely organized and there is a different case with a unique focus each week. I really liked the mix of students in the class - it provided for a good discussion each week. I appreciated that the syllabus contained prep questions each week, so we knew what to focus on when reading. I also thought Ingrid's wrap up at the end of each class to cover broader topics and the other readings was very helpful. Talking to other students in the class, the only thing that I can come up with to be improved upon is having more cases that aren't hospital focused. \"Healthcare Organizations\" covers a wide range of entities but only 1 or 2 of the cases we had this year were outside of the hospital world.",
    "enjoyed case study format",
    "Strength: Cases based, selected cases are very representative, relevant to every aspects of health care delivery. Active in-class discussion.",
    "This class is an amazing wrap up of the HMP program\/curriculum. Dr Nembhard is a thorough and very competent professor who teaches with amazing grace, style and has set up a very comprehensive course",
    "It was a great course. Good Cases. Great hospital management lessons. Great Instructor.",
    "This is a good class. Its primary strength is that it integrates the other courses that make up the Health Management curriculum. The format starts to wear toward the later 3rd of the class, though, making the last few sessions feel less engaging\/challenging.",
    "Excellent course with great cases and structure to classroom discussions.",
    "Excellent choice of case studies and material - I would have appreciated more variety beyond hospital cases but still, excellent. Informative discussions, excellent readings and ppt presentations from the faculty. The only thing I would add to the course is perhaps a little more focus on practical analytic tools such as financial analysis etc. during the class case study discussions.",
    "Very good management course for non-management students."

    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0-Ingrid was a very well organized professor. I did not connect very well with her and didn't find her to be particularly helpful outside of class but in class she was excellent. She clearly has a very solid understanding of the material and takes the course very seriously. It would be good if she waswilling to go the extra mile in mentoring students, especially for the capstone experience.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Perky.. friendly.. energetic...facilitated thinking... was good facilitator.. Her class slides are valuable.. could be used even later..",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is GREAT! HMP is SO lucky to have her! Her manner in addressing the class is so wonderful and engaging.The material she covers is wonderful and her slides will be a reference for years to come. I site material learned outside of class all the time!",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Very knowledgeable, approachable, and able to tease insights from students. A model YSPH teacher.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is an excellent communicator, an engaging teacher, and a passionate academic. She is very pleasant, yet stern and strives to get her students to think outside the box.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0great teaching style and very well-spoken",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid was really supportive and did a great job encouraging students to think rather than spit out a generic answer",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is excellent and a perfect professor for this course because she is engaging and encourages participation without being annoying. She knew the name of everyone in the class by the second or third week. I have had some professors twice and I still don't think they know my name. Being in the Health Policy&Administration track, I thought I was going to have to fight to get into this class, so I was thrilled when Ingrid sent all of the 2nd-year HPA students an email inviting us to check out the class during reading week. The feedback on the two group assignments and two individual assignments was extremely thorough and some of the most detailed I've received at Yale. Also, Ingrid invited Cleve Killingsworth to speak to our class. He is definitely one of the best speakers I've seen at Yale and I really appreciated that it was such a small venue because I got even more out of it.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Smart and good at teaching.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Organized; very thorough; prompt in response; very available;",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Great teaching material. Clear class agenda. Great for feedback and assessment.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Professor Nembhard is a great, enthusiastic teacher. She is clearly committed to her students and her material, however she rarely seems to deviate from pre-planned lessons. A bit of flexibility might make some classes more engaging and less formulaic.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid was just FANTASTIC. She was engaging, empathetic, knowledgeable and approachable. One thing that I think would be really helpful is more criticism over students' in class comments.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Knowledgeable and engaging, she obviously loves teaching and it comes through. Takes her work seriously and is truly dedicated to helping students learn. One area of improvement could be avoiding to give the impression that students are held to different standards, I think this may not be the case but some students may have felt this way.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Highly enthusiastic and engaging. Makes learning a very active and interactive process. Great use of practical examples."

    "You'll read a lot of HBS cases, get a lot out of them, and then experience diminishing returns as the semester progresses. I would probably not recommend it to a student who did not have to take the class. I don't think I gained very concrete skills.",
    "good course..definitely recommend it",
    "We are lucky to have this course included in the curriculum. If it weren't required, I would say it should be!",
    "Yes, a strong primer course for students entering the health management field.",
    "A great course on leadership and managing organizations. I would recommend ALL MPH divisions to take the course.",
    "a must take for everyone who is interested management or hospital adm",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if that student is in Health Policy but much more interested in the operational side of things (as opposed to high-level theoretical topics covered by the Policy Capstone). The case-based structure of the classes and the 4 assignments give you real world examples and practical skills that we can actually apply. I even talked about one of the cases in a job interview. The 4 assignments are a lot of work (especially coordinating with your team for the 2 group projects), but I got a lot out of them, especially because of the detailed feedback we got. Ingrid is awesome and dedicated to making this class the best it can be, so I can only see it getting better.",
    "Big YES!Strength: Cases based, selected cases are very representative, relevant to every aspects of health care delivery. Active in-class discussion.",
    "this is the best class of the entire HMP program. very comprehensive",

    "This is a good class. Its primary strength is that it integrates the other courses that make up the Health Management curriculum. The format starts to wear toward the later 3rd of the class, though, making the last few sessions feel less engaging\/challenging.",
    "Excellent course for anyone wanting to enter health care leadership in any way shape or form. Brings science and credibility to organizational behaviour theories and concepts.",
    "Absolutely recommended. This is one of the YSPH courses where you actually learn a lot and are actively engaged throughout the semester.",
    "Excellent course to take. It gives you an insight into real world issues of health care organization management, helps to work your way to find a solution."
