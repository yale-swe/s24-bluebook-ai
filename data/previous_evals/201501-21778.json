   "comments": [
    "If you're on the fence for DS this semester and get Professor Levin STICK WITH IT! The texts this semester are a lot more relatable and have a lot of variety. Plus, Levin's amazing. It's worth it!",
    "DS Literature looks at Western novels, plays, and poetry from Petrarch to Don Quixote to Virginia Woolf. I would recommend for anyone who loves to read.",
    "Normal ds class with amazing lit books",
    "This class is an excellent overview of major works of Western literature from the Renaissance to the present, with extensive reading and writing. The reading list is very interesting and engaging, and it is a great experience for anyone interested in the history of great works of literature.",
    "Way better than first semester. I was much happier with the diversity in styles and forms.",
    "DS Lit with Professor Levin is a blast. She really pushes you but does it earnestly and with a real desire to help you as a student. Discussions are engaging and full of participation (she often has students read passages aloud to engage everyone and make it easier to chime in), and usually looks at specific passages to explore the broader themes. In essays, she likes for you to be close to the text. Jane Levin is an enthusiastic and inspired professor. She comes into each class with the energy and the focus to create a dialogue in class that illuminates the works we look at. What's most valuable with her is her desire to meet with and work with individual students to explore the parts of the class that challenge them. If you take her class, be sure to meet with her regularly to understand what she hopes you'll get out of the class, because in doing so you'll jump leagues ahead in your understanding of the material.",
    "A simply fantastic class. Would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Challenging, but if you are in Directed Studies you should already expect a challenge.",
    "DS Spring Lit goes from Petrach and Don Quixote up to (my year) Virginia Woolf. It's a great syllabus of books I feel like I need to have read, though the arc of the semester is less cohesive than last semester. Last semester focused a lot on epic heroes (a theme which reverberates in Paradise Lost), but otherwise this semester moves into family and relationship dynamics much more. Levin is awesome. She leads class discussion (read: no discussion starters) by working through passages she finds important, so sometimes the discussion itself seemed a little forced into the mold of where she wanted to go with it. But LISTEN to how she analyzes the passages becauase THAT is how she wants the papers done. She'll say before each paper that she want you to come meet with her: TAKE HER UP ON IT. Go in when you're still figuring out the direction you want to go with your topic, and just write down everything she says. But more importantly, try as hard as you can to have a rough draft by Wednesday, and meet with her with that. I only figured out what she wanted in our papers on the last one. But overall, everyone does fine grade-wise (like most of DS), so don't worry about that.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Levin's class to anyone. She was truly incredible and I learned so so much about Western Literature. Not only that, but I grew to love it. I am sitting here in my house over the summer rereading Faust because I enjoyed it so much. This is something I would have never imagined for myself."
