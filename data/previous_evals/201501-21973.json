    "Above all else I would say that you should base your desire to take this course on how well you think you will get along with the personality of Professor Spillane. Shop it and see how you feel.",
    "Absolutel would recommend. I think my writing improved drastically and I could see the progress throughout the semester. If you enjoy any of the art forms covered in the class-theater, film, dance, and music-then take it and enjoy learning so much more about the ones you're loess familiar with. Readings are on interesting and relevant artists, and the final paper is a profile on an artist of your choosing. It's a lot of little assignments but overall a super chill writing credit since four of the five papers are 2 pages.",
    "This is a wonderful course, taught by a wonderful professor. Reviewing performing arts seems like a pretty oddly specific topic, but if you have any interest in learning more about the craft that goes into reviewing and the intricacies of the industry (across film, music, dance, and theater) this is a terrific class. The workshops were very helpful, the class was very collaborative (in person and on the course blog), and the seminar rapport was always very high. Sometimes the readings were excessive or didn't seem necessary, especially during the writers' profile section of the course, but the accumulation of very readable, interesting material made the process of writing, replicating, and developing craft much easier.",
    "If you thought you didn't like writing, but love the performing arts- TAKE THIS CLASS - you will enjoy writing more than ever before and actually see an application of your interests into papers.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for anyone who is looking to learn. I would not recommend this to someone who is only in it for the grade. This class relies on collaboration and support from peers; not competition for scores. The class will teach you how to write well about several different performing art media. There were no tests, but be prepared to be writing\/revising papers 2 out of every 3 weeks. In class there is a lot of discussion and very little lecturing.",
    "Take it! You'll feel cultured and know how to maneuver through the frou-frou and the fabulous with a sharp eye and an open mind.",
    "This class is an overview of how to discuss and review the different performing arts. Students watch or listen to examples of film, theater, dance, and music, read reviews pertaining to these specific art forms, and then write reviews of their own. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in improving their writing or simply improving their knowledge of the performing arts."
