    "This lecture was really comprehensive in terms of macroeconomics and growth theories. In addition, beyond macroeconomics, this is also focused on recent real economic phenomenon. Beyond macroeconomic theories, many research achievements were also helpful to understand recent macroeconomic trend.",

    "Modelling growth",
    "I learned to apply concepts taught in class as the problem sets were far more difficult than I had first thought they would be.",
    "Fun and great syllabus. Interesting course content",
    "Macro frameworks and quantitative analysis of models",
    "A better understanding of the many factors that affect long term economic growth and how they relate to each other. I was introduced to many new models. Zilibottis insights on China I found particularly interesting.",

   "comments": [
    "The course covers a wide range of topics. Maybe the course should include fewer topics but in more depth.",
    "Since this lecture was relatively focused on empirical approaches, students who are interested in empirical analysis should take. Lecture pace was not relatively slow, students strongly recommended to look through the course materials on the Canvas beforehand. However, students should also care about materials since those are often revised.",
    "Strenghts: 1. It was a very interesting course. The choice of topics was excellent and very well focused. 2. The problem sets were very well thought and made us go really in depth in all the models and topics covered in class. 3. The professor is excellent and is clear he knows a lot because he was able to create an outstanding course and answer all our questions in depth. 4. Lectures always started on time Weaknesses: We could not go very in depth in all the topics covered, but is the cost you have to pay for covering more topics.",
    "Strength - high expectations of students, difficult homework problems Weakness - unorganized course, difficult to figure out what assumptions are being made in a certain model, and almost impossible to follow changing notation. Poor feedback - never knew if I had done something correctly on the homework, because problem sets are graded without any commentary and the professor won't let us see the homework solutions.",
    "Strengths: china Weaknesses: too many topics",
    "The classes could be a bit more interactive and include some application of the theories taught.",
    "The course structure was very comprehensive which meant not enough tim could be spent on a topic to understand in depth. While getting a survey of several topics is a pro, it can also be a con given a masters level candidate does not get an in depth insight into a topic in a specific.",
    "It was very research focused. I would have preferred more conceptual discussions.",
    "the content was interesting but updated slides could be posted earlier",
    "I suppose the weakness was that by covering so much, it was much less possible to go into as much depth as I think Zilibotti would have liked. But this is just the limitation of it being only a one semester course. It was an excellent overview however. And sometimes by having to simplify a model in order to present it to the class, he distilled its essence, which was invaluable. I would hope for future cohorts that Zilibotti be able to impart more of his own insights garnered from his own academic journey, in addition to the mathematical models. Some of my favourite discussions were when he had the time in class to discuss limitations of the models or data that he could only know from serious academic experience. The course should definitely not be moved before 9am in future years, because at least a fifth of the class was never on time for the earlier time.",
    "Very well-planned course"

    "If you are interested in empirical analysis, then yes you should take this course since the lecture covers very comprehensive and informative in terms of recent trends of macroeconomics.",

    "Not as in depth as i hope and final was harder than midterm. Would recommend it if You like decelopment econ",
    "I'm not sure. I would not recommend this teacher, because I think his goal was to minimize his own work and prevent students from cheating. His goal was not for us to learn.",

    "Yes",
