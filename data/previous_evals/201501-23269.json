    "Take it for the amazing professor and the incredibly important topic of education\/support for all children.",
    "Easily the best course I have taken at Yale (after 4 semesters). The topics were incredibly interesting, relevant and important. We talked about various groups of children that are sometimes seen as \"problems\" including: children with anxiety disorders and learning disorders, psychopathic children, sexually active and pregnant teens, criminal and violent children, transgender children, children with physical disabilities and child prodigies. While this class expanded my understanding of children and the various challenges they face, it is not limited to topics exclusively related to children. Our conversations included topics such as education, policy, medication, parenting and teaching strategies, and gender & race discrimination. The readings were manageable and really interesting. For 3 out of the 4 papers (including one Op-Ed), we were free to pick any topic of our choice, which I really liked. Writing the papers was rewarding, and Professor Christakis returns your papers with an entire page (single spaced) of feedback, which is just amazing. She is incredibly knowledgable on many aspects of children's lives, and more importantly she is incredibly kind, empathetic and compassionate towards children and towards her students. Absolutely try take to this class, and consider yourself very lucky if you are able to get it.",
    "This class has been one of my favorites at Yale. This seminar is phenomenal and Professor Christakis is, hands down, my favorite professor that I've had while I've been here. She is so kind, warm, and supportive and does so much for her students (she frequently brought us dinner! and snacks!). She gives great feedback on essays and is excellent at leading class discussion. Not only is Erika amazing, but the class material is so relevant, poignant, and moving. We had some really incredible, deep, and important discussions about children's rights, child behavior, parenting, and social injustices during seminar. I felt like the class gave me a wonderful opportunity to explore my own interests related to children within the course framework. The readings were all very interesting and do-able and the papers were very manageable. Take this course!",
    "Absolutely! Take this class if you're lucky enough to get in and if you have an interest in children. Prof. Christakis is so kind and caring, and the topic material was fascinating and varied. The workload is extremely manageable (3 five-page papers spread out throughout the semester), and Prof. Christakis picks relevant, interesting readings that you'll really want to take the time to do.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in education and\/or child development. The best thing about it is the freedom you have to explore your own ideas within the confines of this class. Class discussions are always very vibrant and wonderfully led by Erika. You will struggle to find a better seminar on this campus!",
    "Coolest class I have ever taken. The readings and discussions I will remember forever and I just value this class so much it has taught me about deaf children, transgender children, pregnant teens, black boys, psychopathic children, everything. we look through so many lenses and we see children from so many points of views. it is a challenging class in that you want to do well and you want to learn so you challenge yourself. I have never done so much reading for a class until now because I wanted to be able to engage in discussion and I wanted to read what Erika had assigned. I love her and this class was so dope",
    "I am physically incapable of accurately describing this class. No words I could write could ever properly emphasize the incredible, mind-blowing, utter genius that is Concept of the Problem Child. If I had sat on a beanbag chair eating jellybeans every minute of every day of my Yale career, but had still taken this class, then I would have had a wonderful Yale experience. This class goes beyond just being a fascinating topic, and that's almost 100% due to the perfection that is Erika Christakis. Erika is the most devoted, brilliant, enthusiastic, and simply kind professor that I have had the good fortune to know. She leads 2-hour discussions with no pause in debate, she writes detailed and helpful comments for every paper, she is open to any and all suggestions of how to improve the class, and on numerous occasions she brings in pizza and homemade cupcakes. Most importantly, she is a genuinely kind and remarkably caring person. Her devotion to her students and desire to have them enjoy this class and really learn something is completely unmistakable, and it allows students to really open up and express their thoughts. This seminar has been one of the most life-changing and remarkable experiences I've had at Yale. As cheesy as it sounds I have learned so much more about myself in this class and have grown as a person from taking it. Summary: TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD IT'S THE BEST CHOICE YOU COULD EVER MAKE. I'M GOING TO NAME MY FIRSTBORN AFTER THIS CLASS IT'S SO GOOD.",
    "YES!! You will learn a lot about children, examine the assumptions that you, or society in general, tend to make about children, and tackle difficult topics both personally and academically. Erika is an AMAZING professor, and makes covering potentially sensitive topics bearable and actually productive. There is a LOT of variety in the subject matter, and the writing assignments let you focus in greater depth on a topic that interested you coming into the class, or that you become interested in because of the class. Take this class, and go to her office hours!!",
    "Absolutely take it if you get in! Concept of the Problem Child is hands down one of the best seminars I've taken while at Yale. The readings are all incredibly interesting, especially the Andrew Solomon book, Far From the Tree. Professor Christakis cares so much about her students, is super approachable, and does a great job of creating a relaxed classroom environment. She provides really detailed feedback on your essays and makes a point of getting to know and understand each individual student. I found that the topic of \"problem children\" was something that just resonated with everyone on a personal level, so our discussions were great because they were a mix of stuff related to our readings and personal anecdotes\/insights. The assignments were 3 5-page papers (which you could pretty write about anything related to \"problem children), one short op-ed, and participation (both in class and on a classes.v2 discussion board thing). This year, there were over 100 people who shopped it for like 20 spots, so I was really lucky to have gotten in. Even if demand is just as high next year, definitely try to get in, because if you do, it'll be one of the best experiences of your time at Yale.",
    "CHLD 132 is a course about childhood! The reading can be a little heavy at times, but Erika makes an effort to select readings that are interesting and meaningful. Overall, the class is fantastically taught and is likely especially useful for anyone interested in teaching, child psychology, and youth development.",
    "Easily one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, to the point where I would have reconsidered my major had I not been a senior. Erika is an incredible professor. The readings that she chose for this class were very thought provoking and made for great class discussions; they very quickly became my study breaks and while sometimes long, never felt cumbersome. She is very generous in her feedback on papers, giving as much as 1-2 pages of helpful feedback. Very fair grader, you get as much as you put in. Papers were generally fun to write. Office hours with her were great, even if you don't have any questions just going in to talk to her about her field is super interesting. If you can get in, absolutely take it!",
    "Would definitely recommend. Take it!",
    "This class is a good one. Erika is a joy, and a generous person and pedagogue. If this is something that matters to you, take note that the readings (subject to change, of course) are not always very grounded\/theoretical\/academic. This at first felt like a downside, but I came to mostly feel that that was right for the class.",
    "An amazing course for anyone that wants to understand the various reasons that children are considered problematic. This goes way beyond kids that whine or have tantrums. It focuses on social and psychological causes for why children act the way they do. It also focuses on how society may label children as problems simply because they do not understand or tolerate them. Racism, classism, developmental disorders, parenting methods and more can cause children to act and be treated in a variety of ways and this course taught me how to see that. Professor Christakis is amazing at inspiring discussions on so many topics related to problem children and makes every student feel comfortable and special. She is an amazing professor that I suggest everyone has a chance to learn from. I would recommend this course a million times over because it has helped me the reasoning behind so many actions and personalities that children take."
