    "As survey course of a number of designs and technologies, mostly dealing with microfluidics. It covers a tremendous amount of material but can sometimes go too quickly, so you feel like you understood about half the material presented. Laid-back professor and minimal workload.",
    "Doesn't waste time by going into detail about things that aren't in use anymore, which means that the information you are getting is actually up to date and useful practically.",
    "I took this class as a physics major, and I found it very interesting. There's not much work, especially after the midterm (which was pretty difficult), and it's definitely possible to take as a non BME major with reasonable math and bio backgrounds. Is suggest taking with a friend, as the final project can be frustrating if you don't know your partner well.",
    "BENG 411 is a great course to give you an understanding of emerging nano and micro technologies. The subject matter is extremely interesting and the workload is very, very manageable.",
    "This is a good course that is not too difficult and can be quite interesting."
