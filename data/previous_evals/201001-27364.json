   "comments": [
    "Wide range of readings to engage a theoretical lens - postcolonial feminism.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. Whether you do explicitly WGSS work or not, taking this course helps one avoid the blind spots that ignoring race, gender, and colonialism can produce. Should be mandatory in some form.",
    "WGSS 630 is a graduate seminar that engages with the the current debates and issues in postcolonial feminist studies. I would recommend the course to other students because it highlights the importance of thinking through the field from multiple perspectives and in new and thought-provoking ways.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone--with the preparatory warning that there's definitely a lot of reading that may be difficult to wade through if you don't already have a background in some of the relevant theory. I was initially a little thrown off by the way texts were talked about (as this is an English course) and I'm not accustomed to a literary vocabulary. It wasn't anything I couldn't get used to though and conversations were still interesting and helpful if not always 100% accessible.",
    "yes i would recommend it, although the readings were tough ... i learned a lot.",
    "definitely - esp for students of contemporary social theory",
    "The seminar was appropriate for students who had some grasp of feminist and postcolonial theory, and were interested in going outside of their respective fields to engage with scholarship from other disciplines."

   "comments": [
    "See question 3.",
    "The course readings and the related discussions deepened my knowledge of postcolonial feminism. The course was directly relevant to many aspects of my dissertation research in more ways than I had originally anticipated. Professor Grewal assisted me in developing new perspectives on my research questions that have contributed greatly to my project.",
    "More perspectives and access to a whole additional world of thought and written work that I otherwise wouldn't have known existed.",
    "allowed me to read about theory and practical applications of it in a variety of fields and then apply it to my own fieldwork",
    "While this course involved a diverse range of readings and therefore was not always directly applicable to my research interests, it was extremely helpful in challenging me to think beyond my own approach to my studies and consider how to engage with issues in a way relevant to those working in other disciplines as well."
