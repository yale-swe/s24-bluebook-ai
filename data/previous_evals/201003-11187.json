    "Phonetics is the study of the science of speech, and thus this course covers topics including the anatomy and physiology of the vocal tract and the auditory system, the aerodynamics of speech production, and the acoustics of the speech signal. Students are required to learn the International Phonetic Alphabet for transcription and production of the world's languages. The final project involves working with a speaker of a language unfamiliar to the student in order to develop and record a wordlist demonstrating all the sounds that contrast in the language. The course is well organized and covers a wide variety of topics, so if you are interested in the field, this is a great course to take."

    "As a phonologist, having an understanding of the physical properties of speech is essential. I will draw heavily on concepts learned in this course in my future work.",
    "Covered a lot of the same material that I'd covered as an undergrad but in more depth, which I appreciated."
