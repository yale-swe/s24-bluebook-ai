    "I thought that the NMR section of the course was not very useful, and he should have talked more about how we could use it in our own research. Also, looking at the machines wasn't super useful either, because it was very difficult to hear in those rooms and we were in a huge group. I really liked the mass spectrometry lectures, and actually learned a lot about how I could actually use it in my own research. The microscopy lectures by Prof. Bewersdorf were great as well. My major criticism of the course is that when we had discussion sections, they had us in two groups in the same room, and it was incredibly difficult to hear what was happening because both groups were talking at the same time. I think it would be really useful to book a second room, so that each group can have its own room.",
    "this course is great for students looking to carry out biophysical or biochemical methods in their research, however I found that most of the lectures did not seem to be applicable to anything I would do in my research",
    "This class is great for students that are likely to use biochemical methods, I presume. However, given that most of the methods presented are not relevant to my research or my lab, it was a struggle to stay engaged. I also wish we had more practical time with some of the techniques. The CYTOF , Mass Spec and chemistry area tours\/tutorials were extremely useful and it would have been great to do something similar with the microscopy cores. The homework questions definitely helped us stay on track with the course, but I felt that the majority of the discussion sections focused on papers that were pretty old, and the discussion was focused a lot on the chem\/physics which made it hard to think about how we could apply this kind of thing to our own work, and difficult to understand with very little physics \/chemistry background in recent years.",
    "Being a student in genetics whose project is not conducive to using biochemical methods, I wish the class could have been more applicable to my research, since we are required to take the class.",
    "the breadth of what the course covers is remarkable and actually quite useful. definitely learned a ton.",
    "The largest strength of this class is its excellent professors!",
    "The strengths of the course include the formatting of the homework questions, the fact that each professor prints out their slides, and the peer-review study session for the final proposal.",
    "The strength of the course is its breath of subjects covered. In my opinion, the greatest weakness was the organization of the last few weeks of the course. I think we should have spent more class time discussing the final paper and the expectations for it. When we went over the outlines in class, most people hadn't followed the directions, so clearly not enough information was given about the assignment. It would have been helpful to get another round of feedback after this session. Additionally, the last few homework assignments were very close together, giving insufficient time to complete them in good quality. Finally, I do not think the class benefited from going to observe the CyTof and other facilities. While the accompanying lectures were interesting and useful, the equipment we viewed on many of these trips amounted to a plastic box. A picture of the machine on a slide during lecture would have been equally helpful. It was also difficult to hear, and impossible to take notes, during the lecture portion of these trips, which meant we retained less of the information.",
    "Fantastic course! TP is a legendary lecturer!"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they want to learn about more techniques they can use in their research.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this course if it wasn't a requirement and\/or if the person wasn't interested in deep biochemistry and physics. I didn't think it was modern enough, or quite practical enough, since many of these things we would just end up taking to a core, speaking with an expert to make it work for our experiment without having to know the precise details of the physics behind how the machine works. I appreciated Dr. Pollard's incredible enthusiasm for the course material but had trouble applying the methods practically.",
    "Yes, I think this was a helpful course.",
    "Yes, this is a great course to learn some common biochemical research techniques and the theory behind them",
    "Yes. It teaches the students how to complement biological assays with thorough biochemical and biophysical approaches, which makes the end product of your research more complete.",
    "I have already recommended this course to others."
