   "comments": [
    "this is a course on the interactions of biomaterials with the body. you learn a lot about the foreign body response and also about various implants in use today and what their limitations are. i would definitely recommend this course",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It has interesting material and is more than just an introductory course on biomaterials.",
    "This is a solid course which outlines the interactions between the human body and different implanted materials. Keep in mind this is NOT a biomaterials course - it does not show which materials are right for which applications, etc. Rather, it studies the fairly uniform \"Foreign Body Response\" that the human body has to almost any implanted object. It also goes over, in some detail, the different ways that this response can be modified through genetic engineering and different drugs. I would recommend it for anyone interested in tissues work. Although the lecture can get a little slow at times, I came up with some of my best ideas in this class - Kyriakides will often throw out little tidbits of cool information which will really get you thinking.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "Yes.Take it. Don't need any prior bio knowledge, although it helps",
    "It was a very fun interesting course and seemed very similar to a grad school level class. Not a lot of work and Kyriakides gives you chocolate if you ask questions. He's a great prof and I would totally take this to fill one of your electives.",
    "The class, for undergrads, is 40% midterm, 40% final, and 20% short report. The only assignment is the short report on a biomedical device, which takes a lot of research but not long to complete once begun.The course is a great overview of the foreign body response and specific applications related to the FBR. The details of the lectures are easy to forget, but students will leave the course with a great appreciation for the problems posed by the FBR.Professor Kyriakides is extremely knowledgeable about the foreign body response and is direct in explaining each slide of his lectures. He is soft-spoken and will spew many details quickly, so he requires complete attention to be grasped properly. He ensures understanding by drawing diagrams by hand when necessary, and takes a long time to be thorough with every slide. Lectures are totally worth going to because exams are based completely on them. Reading assignments are few and far between."
