    "A relaxed L2 language class, mostly focused on grammar. It didn't feel like a 1.5 credit workload, but I still learned a lot.",
    "PORT 120 was definitely a step up from PORT 110, but equally an amazing class. It focused a lot more on grammar skills and developing writing skills.",
    "A fun and informative class. Not stressful. I wish I had started taking Portuguese earlier! It was cool to learn about Brazil and its culture. the class involved a lot of reading and writing, but not a lot of speaking, so I am nowhere near fluent. I am still glad I took the course, though.",
    "Great class to get your basics on Portugues! Try to find space to speak it outside of class",
    "I would recommend."
