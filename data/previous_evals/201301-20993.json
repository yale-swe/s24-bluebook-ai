    "You translate the entirety of the Beowulf poem from Old English into modern English over the course of the semester (about 400 lines a week). There are some auxiliary texts and secondary readings, as well as an in-class presentation and short paper. There is a final exam.",
    "Summary: A course based around the translation of Beowulf, that used the poem as the springboard for discussion about broader interpretive issues which ran the gamut from Anglo-Saxon culture and Anglo-Saxon literature, to modern literary critique of Beowulf, and Philology.I would highly recommend this course to a student, assuming that the student was really willing to work hard and throw themselves into what could be an all-consuming process of translation, re-translation and interpretation.In that vein: I'm saying that \"work load\" and \"difficulty\" (below) were \"appropriate\" because I think they were given what we were trying to accomplish, but it should be noted that this course required significantly more time\/work than others I have taken this year."

    "Both of Prof. Frank's courses opened up the world of Old English for me this year. I still don't know how I will incorporate this into my dissertation, but I am very glad that my understanding of \"English Literature\" will forever extend back far enough to include Anglo-Saxon literature."
