   "comments": [
    "I thought Phil 125 was a great introduction to ancient philosophy and philosophy in general. Prof. Harte is excellent, and the TA's are also helpful. Very fitting as a first philosophy course for freshmen or sophomores. But beware- since it's a required course for the major, you're also likely to get a few senior philosophy students in your class who just need the credit, which can be a bit intimidating.",
    "I don't necessarily regret taking PHIL 125, but I felt like it left a bit to be desired at certain times. I enjoyed the sections on Plato and Aristotle, but didn't care much for the other material. Only having three assignments for the entirety of the semester is equally satisfying and daunting. It's nice to only have those three assignments, but it's also incredibly intimidating to have your whole semester's grades depending on those few papers, especially when the grading is much more difficult compared to other classes. Verity is a wonderful lecturer and I enjoyed having her as a professor, but I just couldn't get into some of the lectures.",
    "PHIL 125 is a good survey of ancient philosophy taught by a great professor. I don't deny, however, that I would have not taken this class (especially as a Senior) unless it was required for the philosophy major. The reading is more than manageable, lectures and sections are interesting, and the grading is fair.",
    "I would recommend PHIL 125 as a broad overview of ancient philosophy - Plato, Aristotle, and later schools of Hellenistic philosophy - to students who are interested in gaining a broad knowledge of these philosophers and their works. Lectures are adequately interesting and clearly structured, while discussion sections and papers are challenging but manageable.",
    "Take it. Great class.",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless you know that you are interested in Ancient Philosophy. Professor Harte is interesting, but the course gets easily bogged down and becomes uninteresting very quickly. If you are passionate about philosophy than take it, but I would recommend other intro courses for a freshman looking to find an introduction to philosophical thought.",
    "Summary: appropriately challenging, engaging introduction to ancient philosophy. If you care about philosophy at all you ought to take it.",
    "It's a good introduction to the way a person needs to think while doing philosophical work, but it just covers a sliver of what you'll engage with in future philosophy courses - if this is your first philosophy class, please don't get dissuaded just because you don't like this particular material, I think it gets much more interesting.",
    "An overview of ancient philosophical schools of thought, with a majority of the class time spent on Aristotle and Plato. Excellent course; I would recommend this course to any other student interested in philosophy or history. The essays were difficult, but lead to a refined ability to write concise and logically valid papers.",
    "Only take this class if you plan on majoring in Philosophy.",
    "This class is hard. You need to pay attention. But only in the lectures on topics that are relevant to your essay question. (Basically the whole of your grade in through essays you pick yourself so there shouldn't be any surprises.)",
    "A great introduction to philosophical thought, especially for those with little to no formal experience in philosophy. I was of that category, and quickly learned - thanks to very honest grading - that I had much to work on in the realm of philosophical argument. The grading system for the course was helpful: out of three papers, the one receiving the lowest mark was worth 10% of the student's grade, while the other two were weighted at 40% each. Professor Harte is lucid and communicates sometimes dense material with ease. She was also readily available for help, as was my TF. This class ignited my interest to pursue philosophy further. For those willing to struggle (especially initially), Philosophy 125 can be very rewarding.",
    "I would highly recommend the class to students interested in learning Hellenistic philosophies, given there contextual importance to later developments in Western thought and philosophies. However try to have some idea of the larger questions Hellenistic philosophy discusses before taking the class. Otherwise you may find yourself lost by the middle of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in philosophy, but hasn't had much exposure. The readings each week were short and built upon the ideas from the previous week. The three papers were graded rigorously, so I would recommend spending a lot of time reading the guide on writing philosophy papers that professor Harte provides.",
    "I think though Philosophy 125 can be a bit sluggish in terms of the material, the class is still worth taking. You probably will not do as well as you expect, but it provides an opportunity to grow as a writer. Even if you're not keen on ancient philosophy, I think it's one of those classes that might be worth taking just as an experience, and to be a more educated person.",
    "A lot of reading, difficult but engaging material, very toughly graded papers, I would recommend it for someone serious about philosophy.",
    "Feels less like philosophy than a history class some times. Professor Harte was engaging most of the time but not always. Good but not great.",
    "Take it if you are interested or curious about philosophy, just realize that the papers are very different and what you learn can be very dense at times.",
    "This is a course that goes through the main philosophers of ancient times and looks at their works in order to create a base knowledge of how philosophical arguments are constructed and carried out. It also helps one learn how to interpret such texts and builds one's own opinions of the topics discussed. I would recommend it because the course has some very interesting readings and a good professor.",
    "It is a good into course. However, you need to know that it's def not a gut class. For the students who have no philosophy background, this course could be quite challenging."
