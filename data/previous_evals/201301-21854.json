    "This class is A LOT harder than L1. The grammar is really tough and sometimes it moves really really quickly - we learned two MAJOR concepts in the same week, and another we did nothing besides talk about Switzerland, so it was kind of like...why?Also, I love Theresa but if you ever take a class with her, make sure to get on her good side early. This means brown-nosing, because apparently that works. I write as someone who did not try to play teacher's pet and noticed a significant gap in how she treated me vs. others. However, she's a really great professor - its a huge plus to have a native German teaching the course as opposed to an American TF.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Theresa. It is not impossible to do well if you work hard and keep up to date on your assignments.",
    "Take this with Theresa. You will learn the language, you will learn about the class (in German, naturally) , you will learn about Germany, and you'll learn all of this in the most relaxed and natural of atmospheres. Theresa is particularly good at maintaining a productive but friendly classroom, so if you possibly can, get her.",
    "I took this class forfun, to balance my schedule from math-heavy courses and because I like learning languages, and it was definitely worth it. Theresa Schenker is a wonderful teacher, and I fully recommend you take the class with her.",
    "You have to take German 120 if you took German 110, but I would advise a student looking for a good grade to take anyone but Frau Schenker. The graduate students tend to be gentler and more reasonable\/negotiable.",
    "L2 German is a very straight-forward and easygoing class, but you still learn a lot and are held accountable for that material. The class is small, meets every day, and concentrates heavily on promoting ease of conversation, and so we built up many easy friendships and a great community within our classroom. L2 has a lot of grammar: you'll cover all the verb tenses and learn touse more complicated sentence structures. The department cares a lot about getting students involved in German cultural events, so mandatory components of this class had us going to German coffee hours, seminars by German speakers, German film nights, and participating in discussion forums with high school students in Germany. Most of the time these are fun, but sometimes the expectation seems to be that you have a stronger grasp of German than that with which you truly feel comfortable. Focus on the fun parts: enjoy the movies and German games and don't allow yourself to become overwhelmed by what you don't yet know.This class has a lot of in-class mini-projects. These are never stressful, and can usually be enjoyable, but it can also feel like there's too much time spent in silly video animation or powerpoint production, etc. and that we get to the end of a two-week unit having had only one or two days of actual lesson. Use the homework assignments to make up for this lack of vocab\/grammar review, and know that you can always email Theresa with questions, which she is incredibly quick to answer.All in all, a great class. I felt much more comfortable with the language after only one year than I would have thought possible. And a lot of my current best friends were in this class with me.",
    "This was great. I would definitely recommend this course! Know that it will be a lot of work, but take it anyway.",
    "In German 120, you'll pick up where you left off in 110 and learn some more advanced grammatical concepts in German. You'll do a lot of conversing in class, learn about German, Austrian, and Swiss cultural issues, and will greatly improve your German abilities. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's a great way to become better at speaking, reading, and writing in German.",
    "Definitely take this class. Language is relatively easy\/straightforward and if you do the work you'll learn a lot and it won't be too bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, as it is a fun and enjoyable class, Theresa is the most wonderful teacher ever, and you will learn a lot of German without even realizing it! You will be surprised at how much you have improved in your spoken and written German by the end of the course!",
    "Yeah, German is an interesting language. It's not terribly difficult and you come out with a solid knowledge of how the German language works.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. If you can, take it! Professor Schenker is an amazing professor, and the amount you learn and the amount your German develops throughout the semester is astounding."
