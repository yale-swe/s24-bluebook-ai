    "This class provided a space for students to explore poetry in a low-stakes, nonthreatening capacity. It was very self-motivated and the student got what they put into the class.",
    "ENGL 246 has made me a more carefree and honest writer. This has been one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale, and I only wish I took it earlier in my college career. In terms of writing, Ive learned to be more intentional with my word choice, imagery, sounds, and structure in my poetry. Writing a poem each week and revising our poetry throughout the semester kept me disciplined in constantly thinking about my writing. Professor Zarin is so encouraging and incredibly smart; I loved hearing her described on how a poet creates the effect that he\/she does in poems we read in class. Especially helpful were office hours, where our conversation touched on both the technicalities of writing and the magic of poetry. Writing poetry under the tutelage of Professor Zarin has taught me so much about myself. I began to see the things I fixate on and things in my life that I am continuously processing through. Very thankful for this course!",
    "Not only do you learn about writing poetry, but also how to be a better writer in general. This course greatly improved my essays in other subjects!",
    "I learned how to read poetry looking for techniques as well as how to develop my own poetry. A big part of the course was focused on editing and streamlining the students' work, which was really helpful. I feel like the skills I learned in this class are also applicable to prose writing such as essays.",
    "I lernt how to be a better writer by thinking critically",
    "The course allowed me to gain gain understanding of a variety of different forms and strategies for poems, producing one week each week, on a specific prompt or form. Toward the end of the semester, it becomes a bit more open-ended to choose what you may. And still, within the prompts, there is of course great room to do with them what you want and make them your own. In that way, I have learned how to develop a personal style, and translate it into a variety of forms. You will learn what you are drawn to or averse to, picking up along the way the strategies that work best for you. The focus is on craft, not formal analysis. There is an emphasis on structure, subject\/ overall content, and perhaps a bit less so on \"local edits\" for diction and rhythm, although these are discussed of course too."

   "comments": [
    "The workload is very manageable, but not easy. You still must write a poem a week and some weeks they come easily and others they take a lot of time. The class is very self-driven, so you can write about anything, which is both a plus and a minus because sometimes it's hard to figure out what to write about.",
    "Office hours were immensely helpful. The workshop style, in which we read each others poems and gave constructive feedback, was also helpful. I do wish Professor Zarin assigned poems for us to read. Sometimes, she would recommend a poem for a student to bring in, and those poems tended to be the most interesting for the class to read and analyze together. I wish that would happen more often because for someone inexperienced in poetry, I often dont know where to start in finding a poem to bring to class.",
    "The course is designed to be guided my student interests since the poems we read each week are chosen by students. It is also a very small class which helps increase intimacy and the time allotted to workshop each student's work. One helpful improvement would be to let the class know of the poems that will be discussed beforehand so that everyone can familiarize themselves with the work and develop opinions. This could be done via emailing the whole class or compiling the chosen poems on the class page on classesv2 or Canvas.",
    "The class is very unique because of its small size. It develops an intimacy we all share as we read poems.",
    "The prompts each week are very well designed, and provide a good deal of variety in what you will produce. The workshop style of the course is something I loved, and an excellent opportunity if you are looking to get feedback on your writing, which happens for about half of the class time, The other half is spent on \"anthology\" reading, analyzing poems that the students bring in each week to discuss, picking up strategies to employ. This part of the class is incredible, in the way that Professor Zarin leads an incredible on-the-spot discussion of commonalities and differences within a selection of a few of these poems that we look at in depth. I think it would be great to have a bit of shared reading assigned, to provide a stronger background for those who have little exposure. One of the greatest strengths of the course is its accessibility, and how it may appeal to a wide variety of levels of engagement and experience with writing. Although the application course may make people hesitant, as an introductory course, prior knowledge of anything formal is not really assumed. It is perfectly fine for non-majors (almost all of us) and complete beginners at creative writing (several of us) alike. And yet, the course can be stimulating for those who have some experience writing and want to gain more practice in poetry. Professor Zarin goes out of her way to strike this balance, and really succeeds at it."

    "Yes, take this class. It's an excellent way to start writing poetry and see if it's for you.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Take this course early and invest in your poetry. You will learn not only about poetry but also about yourself. ENGL 246 has made me a more carefree and honest writer.

There have been moments in office hours where Professor Zarin pointed out things about myself that were reflected in my poetry that I was never aware of before. So grateful for the ways this course has helped my writing come alive.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! It is really enjoyable and not too much work. One poem a week and one essay, then a final portfolio which you work on throughout the whole course. Professor Zarin is wonderful!",
    "Yes, it is an excellent class to take if you have any interest in poetry regardless of your major.",
    "I would because it is a fun way to get introduced to poetry but also learn from fellow students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to another student, who has or believes they might have an interest in poetry, but have not yet been in a setting to delve deep and receive lots of feedback on their work. I would recommend the course to those who may feel like it is stepping out of their comfort zone, whether that is for it being outside of their academic area of expertise, or for lack of experience. if you come with a love for writing and producing creative work and a committed interest, it will be a fun and rewarding class."
