    "While I see the point of the reading as useful for learning the material and using the class as lecture, I would have liked to have had more opportunities to discuss them. I was expecting it to be more of a seminar style course. But I understand this would have been difficult with the number of people in the class.",
    "By far my favorite class at YSPH so far. Similar to Marney's class, but I feel like I learned a lot more.",
    "This course gives a great overview of mental health issues in general and social and cultural factors that influence these issues in particular. It gives also a possibility to explore more in-depth the topics that represent the major interests.",
    "The course lectures were very interesting and generated good discussions. Sometimes classes were rushed. If possible, this course could meet twice a week.",
    "It's an excellent overview course.",
    "I really loved this course. All of the lectures were interesting and I learned a lot in this course.",
    "Overall, this was a great course in terms of the volume of information one learns. However, the information was very dense and a lot of material was covered per lecture. It was very difficult to absorb all this informatio at once. It would be better if the material was explanined more thoroughly, rather than having it covered at such a quick pace.",
    "Loved how the lectures ended up being very discussion-based....everyone who wanted to share their thoughts was able to.",
    "The mental health course by Dr. Smith is currently the only mental health class at YSPH and one of the most interesting electives I have had the chance to take. The assignments, lessons and class formats were all conducive to our understanding of concepts, focusing on those aspects of mental health we found most interesting. The only potential improvement for this class would be allowing it to extend into more detailed subsections in additional courses.",
    "Great course to combine mental health and public health.",
    "This course was a very good introduction into mental illness and mental health in the U.S. I really appreciate the two homework assignments that were given. Even though they were both on different subjects they allowed me to reflect on the concepts we had covered in class and to really understand how those concepts apply to real world situations. The in-class activities were also very useful and allowed us to think and apply what we had learned in class to real life situations. The student presentations and the guest speakers were also very great.",
    "This course was a wonderful introduction to factors involved in mental health and illness. The weekly readings were well-chosen, and the class discussions were stimulating and relevant in thinking about practical points of entry for public health. There was a good mix of lecturing, discussion, and student presentations. The course could be improved by creating a greater emphasis on the final paper throughout the semester.",
    "Favorite class this semester; incredibly thought provoking; loved the topics",
    "Strengths include a variety of in-class teaching techniques (lecture, group activities, movies, special guest lecturers) and assignments that promote useful public health skills (presentations, critical reading and discussions).",
    "I enjoyed the course a lot. Mental Health was not something I had a lot of information about before starting YSPH, but I feel I have left this class with a better understanding. Lectures were very interesting, and it was nice to be able to cater assignments to our individual interests. It was a great elective class that I am very happy haven taken."
