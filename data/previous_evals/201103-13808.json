    "Yes! Take anything and everything taught by Lofton.",
    "If you are an RS major, you have to take this. If you are not, and Lofton is teaching it, still try to get in because she's fabulous. The syllabus will change depending on who is teaching it, so it could theoretically be a completely different course next year, so I don't know what to tell you to expect. I had a great time though.",
    "It's required for junior majors, but it's a really interesting class nonetheless. You'll def be pushed",
    "This course is required for the Religious Studies major. Having said that, you learn the necessary skills to study religion and craft an argument on a religious object.",
    "Amazing course. Did a great job of introducing us to different professors in the department and to different aspects of the field. The writing assignments, focusing on one object throughout the semester, enable you to really think through an argument and build on your own thought throughout the semester so by the end you can say something innovative and substantial that you are proud of. It also worked through many questions of scholarship (relationship between self and object, between object and context, between your own thought and theory, etc) by looking at how our professors deal with those same questions. A brilliant course!Prof. Lofton is simply the most amazing professor at Yale. TAKE A CLASS WITH HER! She is really generous with her time, so meet with her about your papers because she always pushes you to think harder and deeper about your topic. It is amazing how she seems to be an expert in everything.",
    "Yes! It's one of the few classes I have taken that really force you to think about thinking and not just producing papers by the deadline. That said, this class is stressful and in no way easy. Reading, discussion and papers are challenging. But challenging in a way that has a purpose -- you might struggle but you can watch your reading and writing skills improve. An extremely valuable class.",
    "Amazing. Some of the best seminar discussions you'll ever have with some of the coolest and smartest people here about some of the coolest essays you'll read. Kathryn Lofton, if you didn't already know, is a god. The approach we took this semester in particular, picking our own object and curating it from several different approaches, worked particularly well. I feel like I understand what academic work--REAL academic work--in the humanities means now."
