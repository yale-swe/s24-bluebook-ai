    "Question 3: the out of class assignments were fun and taught a lot. I loved doing interviews and participant observation, but not so much surveys. I still think that while I didn't like doing surveys, they were worthwhile for my learning.",
    "Professor Doolittle is exceptionally prepared for each lecture and willing to spend individual time developing student ideas. She provides concise, timely, and useful feedback on each project which is a great asset to any student.",
    "Great class. I highly recommend it.",
    "An absolutely essential course. Amity teaches it well and does a great job of making us feel prepared to go into the field, write proposals, get grants, and rock the world.",
    "Question 9: We did outside research assignments, but I feel an outside group activity, done with surveying in the class would be beneficial.",
    "Amity is a wonderful, engaging, and dynamic teacher and presenter. I looked forward to attending each class and to participating in discussions. It was a very thought-provoking class and I really appreciated that she actually taught us social science research methods, unlike the natural science research methods class, which I also took this past semester.",
    "This was one of the most valuable courses I have ever taken. It gave me a concrete grounding in the theory and practical nature of social science research, and left me well prepared to begin my MESc research. I cannot say enough good things about the clarity with which Amity teaches, the attention she and Roopa paid to the practical aspects of narrowing a research question, understanding theory and methodology, and developing a proposal. The course was basic and clear without holding my hand, and I left with a feeling of accomplishment and confidence about writing proposals to apply for funding."

    "Writing a proposal as the final paper, and very clear explanations of how to structure a research project.",
    "Amity's lectures.",
    "The goal of writing the proposal for the summer research and how to analyze field data qualitatively.",
    "The instructor was very engaging.",
    "The opportunity to focus on a specific area of interest and prepare a proposal.",
    "We had a lot of assignments that focused on putting things into practice, and the course had a very pragmatic focus in terms of aiming for a research proposal at the end. This was much more helpful than any purely theoretical treatment would have been.",
    "1. The instructor2. The opportunity to learn about social science research methods3. The opportunity to break into groups and discuss our research4. The flexibility of the syllabus5. The chance to go out into the public and do observations and interviews6. Amity provided feedback on our papers in a respectable amount of time",
    "Assignments to explore methods from readings. Feedback form professor and other students.",
    "Amity's responsiveness and clear teaching style. The out of class assignments (observation, survey, etc) were very valuable and the structure of the course built very well towards producing a final proposal."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures seemed a bit rapid-fire at times.",
    "Discussion sections did not give everyone equal time to explore their projects. Students who came in with the most clearly developed projects were able to refine their projects, while it was difficult to explore new or potential research ideas.",
    "NA",
    "Group time spent on proposals wasn't always the most efficient. It felt like the same people kept asking for their proposals to be looked over, and a lot of people missed out and didn't get much time spent on their proposals as a result.",
    "Maybe we don't need to purchase any texts?",
    "It would have been nice if this course was three hours on one day instead of split between the two days.",
    "Sometimes the course became a bit unstructured. Sometimes we had too much time to discuss our projects in groups. It was definitely helpful to do that, but after discussing for awhile I think a lot of people felt like they needed to stop, go back and do some more legwork on their own before they could then return and continue a productive discussion.",
    "1. The lectures were rushed and it was hard to follow at times, especially when jumping back and forth between slides.",
    "Perhaps add a lesson on using Endnote or Ref Works next year.",
    "While they ended up being quite valuable, the field assignments themselves were initially unclear with regards to expectations and desired write up. It would have been good if right from the beginning Amity had said \"the guidelines on these projects are deliberately vague so that you can use them to prepare for your research however you think best, but I am providing some structure in case you're not ready to strike out on your own yet.\""

    "Anytime, and good quality.",
    "The TA was good but she was not very conversant with the core of research. But, she was very helpful as she did her best to make sure that everyone is comfortable in class.",
    "Both were great",
    "Both were very available and helpful.",
    "Professor Doolittle and the TA were both available when needed, and their advice was generally very helpful.",
    "Both the professor and the TA were very willing and able to meet with students. Professor Doolittle was very helpful in office hours discussions. I did not meet with Roopa, but she was very helpful in terms of setting up a forum for people to comment on each others presentations at the end.",
    "Amity had posted office hours, but always seemed to be in a hurry when meeting and speaking with her.Roopa was always available and willing to help out, which I greatly appreciated.",
    "Both the TA and the instructor for this course went above and beyond in terms of support outside of class. The TA organized a gathering outside of class to help students feel more comfortable with each other to encourage more discussion and feedback in class.The instructor held regular office hours for students and responded immediately to emails. Holding regular office hours might not sound that special, but there are some professors at FES that students literally have to track and hunt down if they want to talk to them. The professor was very willing to meet with students and I found my discussions with her to be very helpful.",
    "Terrific. I worked with both several times and received their full attention and great advice."

If you are uncertain what you will be doing this summer, make sure to actively seek out other students who are willing to help you develop your ideas during discussion sections and work on developing methodology for the specific project later in the semester.",

    "Have a clear idea of the research you want to conduct before, or by the beginning, of class. It's not necessary, but it will make the class much more useful. If you want to come out with a proposal ready to submit for funding, start early.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are considering research. Definitely take this course if you plan to work with people and communities and you have no prior background in the social sciences.",
    "Amity is a great professor. If you are doing interdisciplinary research and are thinking about taking both methods classes, take Amity's for sure, but take the other one as well only if it has a different teacher next time.",
    "Don't take advantage of Amity's kindness, but do pay attention and do the work (which is not too excessive at all), and you'll end up with a much better understanding of how to perform research, especially if you haven't done it before."
