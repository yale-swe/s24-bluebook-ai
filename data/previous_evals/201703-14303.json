    "I feel like I better understand the problems at the forefront of research into neural networks.",

   "comments": [
    "Absence of every day discussion on canvas. It is impossible to know what are going on in the class if you miss one class.",
    "The best part about the class was the informal research seminar style instruction. The project also offered a good chance to explore topics of interest. It would be nice if there were more papers to choose from for the project, especially more recent papers. There was a lot of overlap in what people chose, and for some topics there seemed to be relatively few to choose from. Also, many of the potential papers were extremely long (70+ pages) which is not practical for most students for the scope of the class.",
    "Excellent for people with self sustained interest in the material. The professor is exceptionally knowledgable about the material, and you get to witness research first hand. However, it does not provide a structured introduction to Neural Nets, if that is your goal.",
    "the teacher did not have the ppt. And the structure of the syllabus is not good.",
    "Very insightful, but its pace is kind of fast for me to keep up with",
    "Strengths are that the course covers a great amount of knowledge and the instructor introduces it in detail with patience. Weakness is that the content of courses is less organized and sometimes I get lost in class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely, as long as you don't expect to learn how to work with neural networks. You will learn the theory, not the practical applications, of neural networks.",
    "This is a good if idiosyncratic class about neural nets. Professor Barron is very up front about how the course is a way to present his views and his research on the subject. This gives a very interesting perspective as the class gets to the frontier of research very quickly. That said, if you are looking for applications do not take this class, it is pure and abstract theory.",
    "If the student is self motivated about the material, it is an excellent choice. It is a poor choice if they are not.",
    "If they were very interested in the subject. Otherwise, it's a lot of work and theory in the area.",
    "this course is ok for people who are interested in the theory of neural network and have a good statistics background. However, the course is not helpful for the application of neural network.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has known and used neural nets for some time and wants to improve his skills by learning the history and algorithms."
