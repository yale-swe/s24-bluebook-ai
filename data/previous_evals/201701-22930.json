    "This course laid out the groundwork for differential geometry, tensor manipulation, the Einstein equation (including a little bit of the stress-energy tensor), metrics, and geodesic equations. We also dealt with important examples such as maximally symmetric metrics (e.g. FRW leading into the Friedmann equations) and Schwarzchild as well as a little bit of discussion on Black Holes and Gravitational waves.",

   "comments": [
    "Too many discussions irreverent to the material being covered. I should not be able to stop listening for 20 minutes at a time and not miss anything critical. Also, too much focus on E&M. This course is about gravity, and the focus on E&M was unfair to the astronomy students.",
    "The homeworks and midterms were all excellently constructed. Although there may have been a little bit of confusion at first, the professor was always available to clarify. Once I fully understood the questions, I could easily solve the problems and really got a decent intuition about the fundamentals of general relativity from them. The biggest letdown of the class, however, was lecture. The professor did not seem well organized in his notes and well always seemed to be digressing to some weird place that \"we would be covering in a later class.\" It confused the narrative of the material and made attending class more of a chore than a learning experience. Honestly, the best way to improve this course would be to use Sean Carroll's \"Spacetime and Geometry\" as the primary text. I learned a great deal simply reading his textbook since it seemed that the professor was taking a lot of elements (such as notation) directly from this book. If the lectures simply followed the excellent structure laid out by Carroll, they would also be more constructive to attend.",
    "I can't think of any weakness it looked perfect to me.",
    "Very comprehensive. The structure probably has some room of improvements."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course as long as you use Sean Carroll's textbook \"Spacetime and Geometry\" rather than the recommended \"General Relativity\" by Robert Wald. The professor seemed to follow the notation and logic of Carroll and little bit closer, and I believe you would enjoy the narrative structure of Carroll a little bit more. The homeworks and midterms are well made and help develop intuition towards the primary problems of general relativity without being too burdensome. Lectures are a bit of a chore, but the professor is always available to help clarify, so this at least helps. If you want a decent introduction to general relativity, feel free to take this course.",
    "Absolutely. You learn a lot about tensors which gives you a very powerful general way to formulate laws of physics. I think this is a must take course. Also General Relativity is way cooler then QM.",
    "Any student in astrophysics, cosmology, and high energy theory.",
    "I would recommend this class! The material is challenging, but Professor Moncrief is available for questions and very helpful."
