    "Prof. Weiss could engage his students more with current techniques in his own research, rather than techniques in the field at large.",
    "I thought the readings were great and the course was very well formatted. Though the presentation and paper seem like a small amount of work, they actually require significant effort and are great learning experiences.",
    "The passion for the topic the professor brings is a central strength of the course",
    "Overall, the course content and Professor Weiss were great, but I felt that our course discussions were quite repetitive. The readings were interesting, but I wish we had discussed them more in class."

    "This is a great course for anyone who is interested in fully piecing together why civilizations rise and fall. However, it doesn't provide much guidance on future uncertainties surrounding collapse.",
    "Absolutely. It is unlike any other environmental studies course. It really gives you a new perspective.",
    "Absolutely take this course!",
    "Yes, if you are interested in paleoclimate research, I think this is a great class--Professor Weiss is super passionate and accessible. The readings provide a lot of background, but we did not discuss them heavily in class (except for the books early on in the semester). I particularly enjoyed having the opportunity to present and write on a specific article...it gave us the opportunity to hone our skills and enhance our knowledge of the course material."
