    "Not really the \"course\" itself. but i feel that having the rotations together with \"Methods and Logic\" was overly taxing. The latter takes up two afternoon-evenings of a week and requires a large amount of time for out-of-class readings. From what I learned from my friends at MIT, their \"Methods and Logic\" course, which we adapted from, is meant to replace lab rotations in the first semester. Hence, I feel that Methods can be slimmed down to something like \"Advanced Topics in Cell Biology\" to allow more time for rotations."
