   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about Polish film and the politics of Poland post-WWII.",
    "I learned about Eastern European culture through the medium of film, as well as about various film techniques and styles. This class taught me how to read film as a text, and how to consider the world around me in a more perceptive way. I really enjoyed learning about the cultural landscape of post-Communist Poland, and film was the perfect way to explore this topic.",
    "I learned a lot about Poland during the communist era and how it affected the Polish population. In addition, I learned a lot about Polish history and culture.",
    "This class is a wonderful survey of communist and post-communist Polish film. I would happily take this course just to watch all of these movies; they are genuinely enjoyable. The class discussions are incredibly insightful to the films. I've developed a more analytical skill set when it comes to films.",
    "Not only did I learn a lot about Polish culture and film, but learning about the directors approaches to their art, was very helpful in my own practise.",
    "Discussion, interpretation, analysis, political knowledge The way art and global politics and culture can intersect",
    "I learned to be attentive to color scheme, music (digetic or nondigetic), the character development, the dialogue, locations, as well other aspects of a scene in order to analyse the subtext and the surface level themes of the film."

   "comments": [
    "The films covered in the class are very interesting, and overall, the class is very nice to have to balance more intense courses. However, sometimes, I felt that the class was not very engaging.",
    "Strengths of the course include the film selections and Professor Illakowicz's extensive knowledge. To make the course better, I would add more structure to the class seminars. Specifically, it would be helpful to know more about Poland's history to contextualize the film. It would also be interesting to dedicate some time to intellectual history, such as post-Modernism and existentialism, as many of the films fit within these intellectual currents.",
    "The films that were chosen were some of the best in Polish cinema and it was interesting to learn about another culture through film. I liked how we had viewing times on a specific day because otherwise it would have been difficult to obtain the film and remember to watch it.",
    "The class covers a breadth f material and is very enjoyable, though it seemed like we were left with many loose ends.",
    "I think after spring break some of the films weren't as strong as before and less connected to some of the more interesting subjects we had about polish culture and human behaviour in general before. So I think that the discussions became a little bit less interesting.",
    "It was an excellent class. The teacher chose fascinating films to watch, and then gave us the historical, cultural and idealogical background, and then encouraged free ranging discussion that she then subtly guided so that we ourselves could come to insightful realizations."

   "comments": [
    "The class is very fun if you're interested in Polish cinema or communist-era history.",
    "I took this course reluctantly to fulfill a requirement for my major. I was pleasantly surprised. The films were all unfamiliar to me, but they were moving and engaging. I learned way more about Polish history under communism than I thought I would ever learn. Our class discussions were not always passionate or engaging, which was unfortunate because that's mostly what we did in class, but the films were really great.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Illakowicz is a pleasure to learn from, especially during office hours. She is an authority in the field, so I'd recommend taking the time to chat with her outside of class. The film list was fantastic and introduced me to a completely new genre of film that I didn't know existed. This is the type of class that reorients your mode of thinking, and it will force you to consider other subjects and classes along a different perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, I learned a lot and the workload was very fair and I loved the professor.",
    "Yes! This class is a wonderful survey of communist and post-communist Polish film. I would happily take this course just to watch all of these movies; they are genuinely enjoyable. The class discussions are incredibly insightful to the films. I've developed a more analytical skill set when it comes to films, and prof. Iakowicz is a greater leader of these discussions, offering great guidance and historical context. I would have liked to have some more discussion relating films and looking at the Polish film school from a larger perspective, and sometimes it felt like we left discussions about some movies unfinished and just moved on to the next film. Either way, the class is great and not too much of a workload, though it can be improved a bit.",
    "Yes I would. I think the subject of this class is very interesting and eyeopening I think that most of the films are very good and spark intriguing discussions.",
    "YES I would. Excellent films And a caring and excellent teacher leading the class"
