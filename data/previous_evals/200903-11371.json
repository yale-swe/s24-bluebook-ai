   "comments": [
    "This class is what you make of it. If you take it to improve your skills, you'll learn quite a bit and probably find the class to be more enjoyable than those people who are only in it to fulfill their one semester L5 requirement. Kang lao-shi expects everyone to come to class knowing how to read the lesson and complete all the exercises, and the people who come unprepared tend to make the class seem really slow. The structure of the class lets you improve your reading, writing, and speaking skills, but it can get repetitive and tedious by the end of the semester. Having to learn traditional characters for tests is also a major pain, but aside from that the tests are pretty fair.",
    "Chinese 152 is much more intense than 142 and 132, but really interesting and a good class. If you can manage your own time effectively, it shouldn't be too hard. There also tends to be less homework than in the previous levels.",
    "Depends on what you're looking for. If you want to improve your Chinese in a structured way, then this course is not for you. The variance in levels of the people in the class is just too great. Also, the teacher&textbook present a very biased, one-sided view of Chinese society. The only way you will improve in this course is through rote memorization; grammatical and lexical explanations are sorely lacking.",
    "It's hard and lots of work, but you definitely learn a lot of Chinese. If you want to improve your Chinese and understanding of Chinese culture and aren't afraid of a lot of work, then take this class.",
    "Professor Kang is a good teacher when he is going himself, but he's not good with responding to specific students' needs. The class is much much harder than L4--there's a significant jump in difficulty level. it seemed to be tailored for the students for whom this was their first and only Chinese course, taken in order to fulfill the Yale language requirement. Their Chinese was much better than that of the students who had progressed up from the L4 native speakers class that feeds into this one. I felt like there should have been more grammar practice and work on sentence structures. However, the textbook was otherwise interesting. Overall, a challenging class for which you have to work very hard. You'll learn a lot, but you won't feel like there was a community of learners or that you have too much of a better feel for the spoken language.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who want to achieve a higher level of chinese, the frequency of essay writing and presentations makes you more familiar with using chinese.",
    "Great, great, GREAT class if you're serious about learning Chinese (or even if you're not serious and looking for a fun way to learn the language). Definitely recommended!!! (Take it just for Kang Laoshi, even. Or if you're looking for a way to be connected to Yale's Chinese program\/planning for Light Fellowships, etc.)",
    "Good class if you want to learn Chinese. Not an easy class even for native speakers. I would recommend it because it is still interesting and beneficial to take.",
    "A great class for advanced learners. Mr. Kang assumes knowledge of advanced Chinese grammar and advanced speaking and listening comprehension abilities, and does not slow down the pace of the class for anyone or anything. I definitely had fun in his class despite it being a bit challenging at times. Expect to learn a lot of new vocabulary, on average fifty to one hundred words a lesson.",
    "A great course to take if you're looking for advanced language practice in Chinese.",
    "It's pretty cool - the essays aren't much fun to write, but you'll definitely learn a ton. It was the perfect Chinese course for me, and if you're also a heritage learner who can speak well and have some foundation in reading and writing, this course will take you to the next level.",
    "The ability level in this class really varies. Some people are pretty much fluent. Others like myself...not so much, which is why it could be intimidating at times.The class was a good way for me to maintain my Chinese, though. The readings were interesting, too. Also, Kang laoshi is really laidback.",
    "If you are placed into this course, take it. It has a relaxed MWF schedule and Professor Kang is a good teacher. You will learn a lot of Chinese; I improved in all areas (reading, writing, speaking, listening). You will have to put time into learning vocabulary and doing exercises and it might initially seem difficult, but the workload is not too high. People in the course will be of different levels of skill, but if you put work into it, you will do well.",
    "pretty good class for improving vocabulary through readings, weekly compositions, presentations and listening exercises. strong emphasis on writing\/listening skills rather than oral skills. classwork itself is not terrible, with class every other day and usually only a few exercises due for that day. repetitive nature of classwork got somewhat annoying, as each lesson is taught in the same four-day structure. would be wary of exams though, as they are much more difficult than the class itself would lead you to believe. most people experienced a severe drop in grades between the first and second exams--reading comprehension on the exams is near-impossible and there is a traditional fill-in-the-blank section which always killed me. if you're not confident on your chinese abilities (like me), i would take this class cr\/d\/fail.",
    "The work is relentless. For every lesson there's a pre-quiz, a bunch of online homework assignments, a presentation, an essay based off the presentation, and a final dictation quiz to test characters. However, your Chinese will improve so much (at least for me). The presentations forced me to speak more even if in class there were less speaking opportunities. What I liked about presentations being the oral component as opposed to ordinary conversation was that it forced you to practice constructing more complex sentences and thoughts as opposed to the off-hand comment one might make while normally speaking. You learn lots of higher-level vocabulary that's great for watching and reading the news and discussing weightier topics than your favorite foods. You also are expected to read a lot and so my reading speed and ability (for both traditional and simplified) has increased tremendously. The final paper for the class was an awesome testament to how much I had learned over the semester. It kicked my ass while I was taking it, but I'm so glad I did.",
    "Chinese 152 is a lot of work that you need to keep up with. There are weekly essays, along with daily online exercises. Though the exercises aren't too difficult, they are somewhat tedious. Kang Laoshi is a rather entertaining teacher, but I often found it hard to participate in class."
