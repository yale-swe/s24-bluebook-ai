    "Yes. It's not an easy course, but it is also fairly reasonable in terms of what is expected of you. I learned a lot about myself as an artist by taking this class, although I can't identify why exactly. Maybe it was the opportunity to finally paint anything I want (there was only one assignment at the beginning). Rochelle told us not be afraid to fail, and I failed a lot. But by the end of the term, I felt that I had learned something from my failures and that my work was heading in a direction that I was excited about."
