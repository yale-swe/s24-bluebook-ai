   "comments": [
    "The assignment and exam schedule was ambiguous. That being said, there was plenty of time given to complete the assignments and prepare for the exams.",
    "The class should be targeted to environmental health people only. Toxicology is marketed as a class that anyone can take when, in actuality, it is made for people with an environmental background.",
    "Boring, poorly taught, poorly organized.",
    "Weak in terms of structure. Professor should at least provide more homework assignments to review the mathematical problems that would be on the test.",
    "What a terrible and disorganized class.",
    "Good course over really interesting material. It was confusing to know what would be covered on the tests. The textbook was incredible and should have been utilized more.",
    "I was unfamiliar with the material so the class was very tough-- but I learned a lot and got a lot out of it. Clear presentation of material at times, very jumbled at times.",
    "I was a fundamental course in toxicology, I dont know how you could change it much, Your basic tox course. I like the variety of assignments.",
    "didn't think the course was a good introductory to the subject",
    "I love this course because it is very interesting and not very hard.",
    "it's best if you have chemistry background.Otherwise it's going to take a lot of memorization.",
    "While I may not have done fantastically well grad-wise, I am extremely happy with how much I was able to learn in this class. The grading structure strikes me as a bit strict, but I must say, it encouraged me to get my act together for the last paper and the final.",
    "Be careful during the first half of the course! Since there is little homework assigned (two easy homework assignments), be sure to keep up with the material so that you won' be so overwhelmed while studying for the midterm. The material covered in toxicology is actually quite useful, and I think i'll probably see more of it in the future. However, I thought the class overall was disorganized. We don't know what each assignment is worth (homeworks aren't even for a grade), and the professor provides way too much details and examples, so it's difficult to gain a broader picture of the topics.",
    "The material was interesting, as was lecture. But I got the feeling that extra points were rewarded to students who went into office hours.",
    "The class is just one giant tangent, it is completely all over the place with the two instructors, no real syllabus, and no indication of how much anything is worth (papers, midterm). Basically it seems if you suck up to the instructors and you go to their office hours, you get a good grade. I thought every instructor had to tell you what each item in the class was worth?",
    "I enjoyed this class, though I felt that it was harder than many of my other graduate classes. In particular, the grading system was somewhat unclear and sometimes it felt like there was a 'punitive' aspect to it. Also, more guidance for the midterm and final would be been nice. On the final exam, questions were asked about lectures given by guest speakers on the last day of class - without the powerpoints even being posted on the course website. How are we supposed to study for that?",
    "The course is well-organized and provides a thorough understanding of the basics of toxicology. While I do not enjoy reading off powerpoint slides, the slides are clear and concise allowing for understanding of complex material.",
    "This class is terribly taught. I feel like Borak just picked the topics (PAHs, TCE, etc) out of a hat! I learned nothing of any use in this class. There are so many more important aspects of toxicology that would have been really useful in everyday life (like plastics, for instance) that we totally skipped. The best lecture was the lead one (the guest lecture!) -- and that's because it taught at a level that was useful and relevant to the 98% of students who do not plan to go into toxicology.",
    "Overall, it was a decent class. The material was usually interesting and the paper topics helped us apply toxicological concepts to real-life problems.However, the entire course is based on the memorization of hundred of slides. Pure and straight memorization. To do well in the course (and on the exams) you had to sit and memorize every single slide. People thus cram before the test and then retain none of the material. Having other types of assessments (weekly or bi-weekly quizzes, perhaps, to make sure we are retaining the information) would have resulted in a more useful course.The lectures involved almost NO student interaction. It doesn't matter if it's a large course or not--if you want people to actually learn something, then you should encourage much more student participation. The instructor cannot criticize the class for doing poorly on the exam when the entire class consisted of him lecture for 70 minutes without taking a single question.The math assignments should have contributed to our grades. Grading of the papers, moreover, was very harsh. Instead of taking into consideration what each person wrote, points were basedon 5 or 6 key points that had to be included and points were deducted if they were not. Points were also deducted for \"irrelevant\" information, even if it pertained to the topic. Grading of papers needs to be more subjective. By that I don't mean that it should be arbitrary, but the grader should take into account what each person has written instead of just blindly searching for those key points. Just because someone missed a certain point, or added something that the grader didn't necessarily think was necessary, doesn't mean that the paper deserved a poor grade. If a paper was well-written, that should also be taken into account. Content is important when writing papers, but so is style.",
    "I liked this class. I have an interest in toxicology and this class was a good overview of basic toxicological principles and applications. The slides were thorough and detailed enough to understand. Sometimes, concepts were difficult to understand and integrate together.",
    "The class is well taught and Dr. Borak leads entertaining lectures. However, the assignments are a lot of work and grading is fairly tough.",
    "The class not very engaging and difficult to pay attention in. I feel like I have an understanding of what toxicological research is but I learned from studying the slides, not from being in lecture.",
    "I thought that the course was somewhat unstructured. The first two Power Point presentations covered a lot of information that, I believe, would be better learned if separated according to topic. The last few lecture slides were better since they only covered the specific topic. Furthermore, the slides were not very comprehensive.One complaint that I have is in regards to the first paper. Most of the students did not do well on the first paper because five specific points were expected to be covered in the paper that was not mentioned in the prompt. Therefore, many of us were marked off for not covering the information. I had believed that we were suppose to explain what we got out of reading the assigned articles.",
    "It was very interesting material, although I felt it could have been presented in a more organized fashion. The expectations for the class were extremely unclear, and this was very frustrating. It would have been helpful to know the weight of each assignment on our final grade as well as very specifically what was expected for each of the papers.I loved the last lecture about medical toxicology and arsenic poisoning.",
    "Worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "The materials covered in this course concern \"real life\" issues, and is very applicable for those who are interested in making health policy, health administrative, or health professional decision-making from a toxicological perspective. In this manner, I appreciated that the topics were concrete as opposed to abstract. The paper topics were interesting and the exam format was fair and reasonable. This course has many strengths, including a very knowledgeable instructor and intriguing topics, however, the information that is taught in every lecture is very dense and may appear fast pace for some students.",
    "Tox was a good course. Probably one of the more challenging classes that I have taken at EPH because of the biochemistry\/general chemistry concepts included in the course. The paper assignments were very specific, which took some adjustment - usually paper topics have some wiggle room and room for interpretation, but these had specific points that we had to hit. Might have been better just to do a test in this case. Otherwise, it was a challenging, but good course.",
    "Strengths: Student-focussed; willingness to meet with students; real-world problem applicationWeaknesses: Heavy on the PPT slides; lots of lecturing; lacks historical anecdotes; this is a core class, but it seems that those with a limited chemistry of molbio background are left on their own; the mid-term wasn't until November; feedback as slow; guidance for HW was poor; the course seems to be driven by grades, rather than learning--something uncharacteristic for a graduate course. Oh, and the class is WAY too big.",
    "This course was disorganized and unclear as to what we would be studying and why. There was no guidance on how to study for exams or what we would be tested on.",
    "I loved the professors' enthusiasm, but I generally felt unclear about which course material deserved the most emphasis during studying.",
    "The course dealt with great material, and the professor was very passionate about the subject. However, the material was not presented in a very organized manner and often left the class lost. This created a lot of confusion around exam time, and as a result, studying was difficult. There wasn't much consistency between what was stressed in class and what was tested on the exam. I think that if the material was better presented, the class would be more enjoyable. Despite this, the professor was helpful when asked for advice and encourage students to visit him.",
    "Not a good course. Not well organized.",
    "This course was incredibly disorganized and I had no idea what the professor wanted me to be learning at times. The homework assignments seemed to have nothing to do with the course work that we were learning. Although there are no pre-requisites for the course, to really have done well in this course, a biochemistry background would have been extremely helpful. 75% of the class assignments were assigned in the last month of the course. The rest of the semester there were hardly any assignments, yet the professor expected the class to understand complex concepts without any practice. The class was not at all what it was \"advertised.\"",
    "This course was refreshing and covered interesting, practical topics. The lectures could be a little hard to follow sometimes, though. It was also unclear until the midterm what level of detail we were expected to know about metabolic pathways, so it was tricky to take notes.",
    "This course could have had more focus on different substances and their importance for public health. The course had after my opinion too much focus on a few substances."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He presents interesting material in an interesting style. Also, he is willing to accept student questions and provide sufficient office hours in which to discuss any questions a student has. Although I did well on the first paper and exam (and I cannot be sure how poorly other papers and exams were), a teacher should not take the stance that the outcome of a student's grade in a course is only the responsibility of the student. He did give us much of the necessary information for the paper and exam preparation, so they class, as a whole, should have done better on the assignments, but he should not have said that it doesn't matter to him if some students do poorly.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Please teach us how to use the equations instead of us just giving them to us.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Not a great instructor. Confusing and unorganized.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Excellent lecturer in an otherwise dry course. However, does tend to go off tangent.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0This clown has no business teaching. I have never experienced such a disorganized course EVER. Hey, maybe put a syllabus online under the \"syllabus\" tab on classes V2 like everyone else so we know when exams are scheduled. OR, maybe don't ridicule us for not meeting your expectations in an introductory course that we are REQUIRED to take. I hope you took joy in seeing the demoralized faces of those who don't have a strong science background or minimal experience reading journal articles. I have never been so close to walking out of class after that stunt. Oh, and at least pretend you care about us instead of saying outright \"I don't care what grade you get\". Stay classy mr. big important Yale professor.It was clear that teaching was totally a total afterthought in Dr. Borak's busy day and errors were abundant. My favorite was labeling carbons on PAH structures where he \"taught\" us how to do it and then provided examples that were labeled wrong. He insisted that they were an exception to the rules he just taught us to cover his butt and make US look stupid for trying to call him out. Just inexcusable.Oh, and Cheryl. Maybe don't give a review session where we teach you the material and then let YOU know what Dr. Borak lectured about when you were gone.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very knowledgable, his personality added a lot to the class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He offered little discussion. though he stated that he wanted to engage in discussion, he didnt try to actually do that in any way whatsoever",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is fantastic!He would explain the complicated concepts as simple and possible, as well as use examples to illustrate the main points.He'd love to talk with students and invite us to his office hours (though I did not find a time to go).He really inspired me on this course.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is an extremely intelligent person and has several years of experience working in toxicology. However, his lectures are very scattered. He presents tons of examples, so often times he gets off topic.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The structure goes off on a lot of tangents and is difficult to follow in lecture. He also seems a bit inappropriate to his female students and staff and makes a lot of people uncomfortable.Cheryl is really nice, and is better at simplifying toxicology to an easier level, but there are concerns that the only accreditation she has is an MPH, and she isn't the best at explaining subjects, or really 'teaching'. It is kind of all over the place when one of the teachers can't answer our questions, and we never know who is going to be teaching what day.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak was really knowledgeable about toxicology and was interesting to listen to. I guess my main criticism is that sometimes he took a really long time to reach a point that can be more clearly given another way. For example, in our lecture about TCE we covered a mountain of studies giving conflicting ideas about the compound which could have been better summarized in a single slide or two.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is great! He is very knowledgeable about the material and makes an effort during class to make sure students have a thorough grasp of the material. He is not always available outside the class, however, and I wish there was a TA to help with the course.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Borak is a phenomenal teacher in a one-on-one setting. When I met with him in his office, his explanations were clear, his analogies were illuminating, and and I really \"got it.\" Lecture, on the other hand, is the complete opposite! The first three lectures were accessible to non-biochem people like myself, but after that, it was as if he completely abandoned the idea of making toxicology accessible and interesting. He just talked at us about concepts we'd never been exposed to before.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The instructor was knowledgeable and was a clear lecturer. However, after the midterm, he berated the class for 20 minutes for doing poorly. He said that he \"didn't care\" if people did poorly; if one or two people get Honors, then he knows he's \"doing his job\", that if people want to \"bullshit this class\", then that is their problem, etc. Every single student I talked to was shocked after that incident. When a class has done poorly on an exam in previous classes that I've had, the instructor has said things like, \"If you need help please come see me,\" \"I want everyone to do well,\" etc. Dr. Borak said the opposite. It seemed unimportant to him if his students performed poorly. In fact, he explicitly said that he \"didn't care.\" If only one or two students get Honors, then, no, he is NOT doing his job. And I definitely have no incentive to work hard in class for a professor who says that he doesn't care. (I should note that I did extremely well on the midterm, on the papers, and in the class, so this criticism does not come from a place of resentment.)It should be noted that one reason why people did so poorly on the exam was because doing well depended on how well you can memorize 300+ slides. Straight memorization should not be the basis of a graduate level public health course.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is a good instructor. I enjoyed his lectures and examples. I think he intelligently discussed topics of toxicology, which sometimes aided and sometimes hindered my understanding of the subject matter. While, the field of toxicology is very complex, I think Dr. Borak did a good job in helping us grasp the concepts in the course.Ms. Cheryl Fields taught a couple of the lectures on more specific content. Overall, I thought that she was a good instructor and was clear in what she was talking about.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is a compelling teacher and is very good at making complex toxicological concepts easy to understand. There were also numerous opportunities for extra help.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0You can tell that Jonathan Borak and Cheryl Fields are passionate about what they do.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is very knowledgeable in his field but I did not especially like his style. He covers a lot of information that is extremely new to most students and expects his students to be able to comprehend every detail. When we did not do well on the first paper as he would have liked, he expressed his anger tothe students during lecture.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He was exceptionally knowledgeable, however, it would have been helpful at times to have some of the examples he discussed in class orally also included in the powerpoint, as I felt I missed some material because examples were covered quickly.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Worst professor I've ever had. He has thorough knowledge of a narrow field of toxicology. Does not think outside the box. Very rude to students. There are many individuals more qualified to teach this course, such as the guest lecturer now at the medical school Dr. Tomison*",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak and Cheryl are both very knowledgeable instructors who feed students myriad of interesting, real-world examples. They are both very welcoming and encourages all students to visit their offices. They emphasize on the importance of improvement over the course of the semester, as opposed to the grade, itself.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak was an interesting professor - he challenged us a lot and probably didn't seem as approachable as other professors I've had at EPH. However, he always did invite us to go to his office hours - I was just a little intimidated to actually go. At times he spoke to us like we were undergraduates, which was a little frustrating, but overall he was a good, challenging professor.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr Borak was able to make this course interesting and break down complex concepts and materials to be easily understood by the students.Cheryl fields was very good at responding quickly and clearly to questions that I had by email.I learnt alot from this class. I only hoped that we had more homework assignments because the ones we had were really helpful in the learning process for the class",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak and Cheryl Fields are both very accommodating, and invited students to visit during office hours. I wish that the instruction would have been more student-oriented, and less lecture-based. Asking questions and leading a discussion is a powerful way of teaching, that was lacking in this course.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0I really enjoyed Dr. Borak's lectures - he really made difficult concepts clear and digestible. I only wished that there was a bit more overall organization to the class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Professor Borak did not care how his students were doing at all. He had no comprehension of if the class was understanding the course material or not. The professor was down right rude to the class at times and it was really hard to understand what the key points of the class really were. Instead of helping students who were having a hard time grasping the difficult material, he chastised them instead saying that they were \"wasting his time.\"",
