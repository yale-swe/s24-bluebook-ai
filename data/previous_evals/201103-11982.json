    "Great introduction to Japan and the anthropology field, while fulfilling a WR credit. Yes, I very much enjoyed it myself.",
    "Excellent class that gives you a soft anthropological overview of Japan since the 1960s. The readings are interesting and not excessive. Definitely take it with Professor Kelly, whose insight into Japan makes for very interesting lectures (word of advice: even if the lectures are early, TRY TO GO; they're the best thing this course has to offer if Prof. Kelly is teaching). Only downside is the strict section rules (you are severely penalized if you miss more than two sections) and the sometimes stiff discussions.",
    "This is a well-designed course for learning about anthropology by studying Japan. The lectures, readings, and discussions are engaging. Take it if you're interesting in Japan, whether or not you know anything about it (you'll learn more), or if you're interested in finding out what exactly anthropology is.",
    "This course covers modern and contemporary Japan though a wide variety of topics. You don't need to know anything about Japan. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it!",
    "Absolutely. Professor Kelly is a very engaging speaker and the topics he presents are intriguing.",
    "Enjoyable course, with relatively light reading. I feel much better informed about Japanese society and culture. Definitely worth taking!",
    "I took this class because of my general interest in Japan. It was quite a fascinating course. During the first quarter of the course you'll study Japanese culture and society during the post-war era. This knowledge will set the stage for the remainder of the course as you'll study the changes in society, and culture brought after the 1990's.",
    "Course gives you a good introduction to Japan and the field of anthropology. It is well taught and is a good option for a writing credit (manageable workload).",
    "Informative introduction to modern Japanese society, as well as interesting touch on anthropological method. Rigourous curriculum but worthwhile!",
    "Don't take if you are an Asian!"
