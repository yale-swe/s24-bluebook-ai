   "comments": [
    "I wasn't looking forward to the class from the description and syllabus, but it was more fun than I feared. Although a decent number of the readings are overly technical or uninteresting, many of our class discussions were genuinely enlightening. By the end, you are equipped with multiple useful approaches for understanding a work of art, ensuring that you don't stay trapped in your one comfortable mode of interpretation. Required for art history majors, but, surprisingly, worth taking regardless.",
    "I loved this course. One of my favorite courses at Yale. Part of this was the teacher (Professor Rizvi was great) and part of it was simply the material. I'm an art history major, but before I took this course, I didn't really understand my own discipline. This will give you an outline of art historical thought throughout the last couple hundred year (since the start of the discipline,) and will really help you to get a handle on your own thoughts and methods. Additionally, it opened my eyes to entirely new ways of thinking and interacting with the world, bot visual and real. I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in art, culture, or learning how to see and think.",
    "Critical approaches is a required course for art history majors, but it's excellent and you learn so much that makes sense out of everything else you've thought and learned about the history of art.",
    "This class is required for art history majors, so if you're looking at this, you probably have to take the class. This class is all about discussion - doing the readings before class and speaking up in class. It's nice that there is no final and no big paper assignment (just weekly short papers and one presentation at some point).",
    "Most people take this course because it is required for the major. I probably wouldn't recommend it otherwise because there are many more interesting courses you could pick. There is not TOO much work. Talk a lot in class.",
    "This class is a great overview of most of the important theoretical waves of art history. It is required for the major, but this is a class every art history major should want to take anyway. It really depends on the professor, because he or she can very much shape the class to match his\/her own specialty, but with Professor Rizvi, we had a really comfortable atmosphere in which I felt very comfortable expressing ideas. The way our class was run, we had a reading response every week, but no final paper, which really encouraged everyone to actually engage with the reading every week but took away the pressure at the end. I know some people take this as sophomores, but I REALLY recommend taking it as a junior, if only because it was very helpful for me in terms of formulating my senior project. This is a GREAT class if you're at all interested in the history of art, and I highly recommend it!"
