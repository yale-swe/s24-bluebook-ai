   "comments": [
    "Math 301 is effectively unnecessary after math 230\/231, since all the major results such as contraction mapping, Bolzano-Weierstrass, and Heine-Borel are covered just as rigorously in math 230\/231. Series results were proved in AP calc, and there is very little left over. Intensive math majors should skip to math 305.",
    "You most likely have to take this. That aside jones is a funny teacher. The book is bad, but this is not a new complaint. If you're coming from hadari's math 230 you should be more than fine.",
    "Take Math 301 even if you've already learned analysis. You may be bored of your mind, but you'll see some tricks that you would have never seen otherwise (Contraction Mapping Theorem to solve Fredholm Integral Equations for example); also, Jones tells pretty good stories. His teaching style is really hit or miss for students, so shop it and see.",
    "301 is a good introduction to real analysis. If you've taken 230& 231 none of the material is really new, but standards of rigor were much higher in this class than in 230\/231. For this reason, though the material was not very challenging, exams were not easy and it was not easy to earn a good grade. The way in which we plodded through Beals's textbook chapter by chapter seemed somewhat arbitrary, though it is all basic material so why not. Problem sets were generally unnecessarily long, though not too bad. Overall this class is hard, but conceptually the material is straightforward.It is hard to separate Professor Jones from the course since his personality has a big effect on the course. I think Professor Jones is super-knowledgeable and perhaps over-qualified to teach this course, and as a result, though he was very entertaining, there were problems. For one, Professor Jones, probably without trying, often came off as condescending and sometimes flat out rude to students in class, but this was partly the result of the drama of his teaching style. However, more troubling was Professor Jones's style of explanation: once again, possibly because he wanted to add flair, he would always use unexpected analogies to describe mathematical phenomena. This was funny if you already knew what was going on, but utterly mystifying at times if you wanted to improve your understanding. I get the feeling that Professor Jones does this to make the class more enjoyable, but at times it seemed as though he was incapable of explaining things in a lucid and logical way that was mathematical and straightforward. His tests, also, were very much a product of his personality, since the problems were often very difficult to solve without some trick that he would very reveal in office hours or at a review session. This made the tests predictable, but they tested one's knowledge of very specific tricks or strategies, for better or for worse.That said, though, Professor Jones's lectures were generally the most entertaining lectures I've seen; he would often give very funny anecdotes at the beginning or end of class, and made the world of mathematics seem very exciting, which is not easy to do. And, to his credit, I leave the class with confidence in my capabilities in future analysis courses, which you get from putting in the hours on problem sets and studying.",
    "Prof. Jones doesn't respond to his email. Prof. Jones is approachable during office hours, but his lectures are sometimes hard to follow.",
    "Take it if you like math, wand to understand calculus and the real line, and either are quite good or don't particularly care about your grade (or take it Cr\/D). Legend has it Jones curves to a C, and you'll be surrounded by intense undergrads and several grad students.",
    "Derive calculus, learn about real numbers and real functions, metric spaces. Most important thing you learn -- how to add 0 and multiply by 1.",
    "If you're going to take this class, you probably don't have much choice, since it's a prereq for various things. You'll probably be frustrated by the fact that you learned most of it in Math 230. I wouldn't take it \"for fun\" at all much less with Jones. His tests are unpleasant at best.",
    "Math 301 covers the first 9 chapters of Beals' \"Analysis: An Introduction\": sequences, series, power series and radius of convergence, metric spaces, continuity, differential and integral calculus, and infinite products. If you are an intensive math major, then it's required. Otherwise if you are just looking for a challenging math class, there are other courses that will offer a more enjoyable experience. Although technically not necessary for 310, 310 will be a lot easier if you have this material as a point of reference, and you need this material anyway for grad school.",
    "Great introduction to real analysis.",
    "Math 301 is a good class if you can devote time to honing your skill of doing proofs and solving problems. The homework and class time are somewhat helpful for seeing proofs, but the exams (which constitute most of the course grade) are only loosely based on that material.",
    "MATH 301 is a good introduction to analysis and is a very doable class. The problem sets are reasonable (with only the occasional incredibly difficult problem). Expect to not get your problem sets back. The tests are also doable if you review the past midterms\/tests that Professor Jones gives out very closely. They are your most useful source by far in preparing for the tests. The class is very fun to attend. Professor Jones injects some of his own humor and tidbits of math history throughout the lecture and I loved those mini tangents. His lecture is also useful to understand the \"sketches\" of proofs from the textbook and the flow of the lecture follows the textbook Beals very closely. While his lectures are not particularly useful in completing the problem sets or doing well on the tests, they are necessary to understand analysis well and improve intuition on proofs.",
    "I can't tell you how bad this class is. The lectures are rambling and boring; the tests are unfair ,barely related to the material covered in class, and graded quite harshly; half of our homework was never returned. Do not take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to all math majors. While some students felt that they learned very little new material in this class, I found it very comforting to formalize all of the math that you learn in calculus. In this class, most of the grading is based on tests. The trick to the tests is to study the previous tests very thoroughly as his tests are very similar. If you solve and understand every question on the previous tests you will do very well on every test in the class. Overall I was happy with the course and would recommend it to other students."
