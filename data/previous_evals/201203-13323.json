    "If you want to go beyond simple textual analysis and engage with the reading in a more theoretical way, then this class is for you. If you think it's a little over your head, shop it anyway!",
    "The level of analysis that is expected is quite high, so don't go in without some experience in literature or english classes at Yale. On the other hand, there was sometimes some BS analysis, but the kind that is couched in a lot of wonderful words. The syllabus is great and includes some texts that are underrated and brilliant.",
    "This course was a great experience, and I recommend it to those who might find the area even remotely interesting. Prof. Baer leads the class through a great set of texts, whose connections will become apparent through the course, and they lend themselves to great discussions.",
    "Just take it. There are few words I can find to describe the class that would give you an accurate sense of what it was like to take it--trust me, I've tried all semester to explain it to my friends. You will find yourself thinking in new ways.",
    "Take it if it's offered again. A mix of light and heavy reading. This class isn't easy but it was well worth the effort."
