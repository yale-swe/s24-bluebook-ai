   "comments": [
    "This was the most rewarding course I took at Yale. Our conversations were always eye-opening, and the reflections that we wrote (and the comments that we received in response) pushed us to think about things that most people at this school simply don't think about very much.",
    "I learned how to communicate and understand my emotions better.",
    "This course taught me how to become more reflective so that I could learn about my self, others, and the interaction between them. In doing so, I have been able to prepare myself better for my transition out of college and into the real world.",
    "This class was hands down the best I've taken at Yale. I learned to think critically about what it means to be a unique individual and what an \"other\" does in shaping yourself and your view of the word. It's unique in that the class talks over their personal experiences in order to learn about the early adulthood transition. Closeness and confidentiality are key in this group of 18. You learn a lot about yourself and others and what effect this has on your life.",
    "This is a highly unusual class for Yale. Most classes here teach skills obliquelybut this class teaches you how to structure your life and think about it in a way that makes you happier. David Berg is a treasure and must be allowed to continue teaching undergraduates. As I graduate and move into \"real life,\" this class is one of the few aspects of my undergraduate education that will help me be happy.",
    "I gained a better understanding of myself and the other.",
    "I developed skills that i need for my WHOLE LIFE. I learned about \/ how to ask about how people are, how life is, how I am, and why. This was the most phenomenal class I have taken at Yale.",
    "It taught me the value of honest introspection and to start critically analyzing my actions and behaviors.",
    "Learned more about myself from this course than any other!",
    "Though I've been trying to put into words what this class has meant to me for several weeks now, I still fail to describe the extent to which it has completely changed my outlook not only on my academic goals but more importantly on my sense of worth and purpose in general. I am not exaggerating by any means when I say this class has taught me by far the most valuable skills I could get out of my college education: life skills, and a general understanding how to navigate my emotional landscape and how to approach life's biggest dilemmas and traumas.",
    "I have gained an incredible degree of insight into the experience of the early adult transition and my own identity to date. I now have a much better understanding of group dynamics and how I tend to function within my groups. This course has honestly altered the way I view my own place within the scope of my world.",
    "I really learned how to reflect on my life in a new way in this class. While it might have been fun to learn more of the theory behind our personal discussions, I learned a lot about how to process what I've experienced throughout my early adult transitional period. I've had a lot of insights into how I relate to my family, friends and institutions, and what forces have shaped and molded how those relationships have changed over the past few years.",
    "I can't describe how much this course taught me. It seemed like everything I learned was so applicable to my future, my present, and my past, and i wish everyone had the opportunity to take this course because I think we could all learn valuable things from it. I learned a lot about myself, others, and how thin that boundary is between what the self and other. This was an amazing course, and I would take it every semester of Yale if I could."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Berg is the best instructor a Yale student could ask for. I was awed by his thoughtfulness in each response to our weekly reflections, which challenged us and contributed a lot to our growth throughout the semester. The conversations we had in class were always incredibly valuable.",
    "This class has no weaknesses. Its strength lies in the professors investment in each student in his class.",
    "The course is incredibly engaging and requires a lot of personal thought and effort to make it worthwhile. Professor Berg makes the classroom space incredibly open and welcoming, and his willingness to read every single response made the experience special and individualized. Because the reflection activities in class took up a majority of the class, the readings were not addressed too often in class, and I hope that future iterations of the class can integrate the readings into these exercises.",
    "This class makes a group of 18 strangers become close and personal friends. I have never had a seminar do that and it's very special. Professor Berg has amazing insight on the early adulthood transition and that experience and it really makes you sit back and analyze all of your thoughts and actions and what their consequences are. Overall it's an amazing course and I don't think there are any weaknesses -- it's a course that encourages one to give all of themselves. And if they do this, amazing revelations about ones life come out of it. And the transition from college life to adulthood may even become a little less scary.",
    "This course is wonderful. I have already provided some minor feedback to Professor Berg.",
    "Strengths: everything. Unique, interesting assignments, flexibility, phenomenal content, incredible professor leadership -- it was all out of this world! Weaknesses: I would say maybe incorporate the readings a bit more? We focused only on the Levinson reading (which was incredible) but I'm sure a lot of the other readings are amazing too and I didnt really read them becuase they didn't seem to be directly relevant to what we spoke about in class. So i would make it shorter -- like one reading a week -- that's incredibly interesting like the Levinson reading. (But also, I'm planning on doing all of the readings over the summer, because I am sure that they are really interesting).",
    "All in all, great class!",
    "No weaknesses, a great class!",
    "The course is structured around what STUDENTS want to talk about, and that is its greatest asset. The students really are leading the conversation and building a bond stronger than those in most other academic settings at Yale. Through weekly reflections, we discovered such depth to everyone's experiences at Yale, and I never felt more emotionally and intellectually stimulated than in the context of this class. The course truly evolved as we evolved with it, always receptive to change and ready to improve in ways we needed it to improve. Honestly I have no suggestions for improvement other than having more bonding activities in the beginning so the reflections don't feel as terrifying to share -- I think there's definitely room to do more hanging out outside the classroom though I do think it's a bit challenging considering everyone's schedules. But I think that's worth a try.",
    "This course was absolutely incredible! The weekly reflections were a wonderful personal experience, and it was enlightening to share them with the rest of the class. Although we had some trouble connecting as a group during the reflections at first; however, by the end of the semester, I really felt that we were able to support and learn from one another. This course also has some fascinating, interactive assignments to augment our personal reflections. Overall, it was a truly amazing, eye-opening course!",
    "Strengths: it has a really unique structure that really promotes learning together as a community and from each other's lives. It challenges students to reflect on their lives in ways that can be uncomfortable, but rewarding in the end. Weaknesses: Like I mentioned, it might be nice to have a little more theory, but this is mostly because I didn't do many of the assigned readings, so really that's on me. I don't have much else to say.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing",
    "Strengths - really challenges you to approach difficult questions and think about yourself and others in ways that you never have before, or in ways that you previously had avoided doing because it is uncomfortable to own up to those sides of ourselves. Weaknesses - class vibe. For some reason, I never felt fully at ease sharing with every member of the class. It also felt like certain classmates shared more than others, with the result being that I only felt like I knew some of the class and not all. I wonder if those who didn't share felt less included, or why they chose not to share. I think Prof Berg did a sincere job of trying to improve the class dynamic, but I wonder if having more activities outside of class where we worked together in smaller groups (like the 3-way interviews we did at the start of the semester) could have helped."

    "This is the best course I've taken at Yale. If you get in and it's a fit for you, take it.",
    "Amazing class!!! I can't express how much I loved this class. It's the only Yale class where you grow so much personally. I learned to communicate and understand my emotions better. In addition, I got to learn about my classmates and watch them grow. This class is for the student who feels a little lost and wants to find their balance again. Fair warning that this class will always leave you with so many thoughts and emotions. You definitely get out what you put into it.",
    "You should absolutely take this class if you have the opportunity. Especially as a senior, this course helped me to become more reflective in an environment with other students who were willing to be reflective and open. This course is very different from any other one that I've taken, and if you're willing to do the kind of personal reflection and thought that this class requires, I highly recommend it.",
    "Absolutely. This class was honestly life changing and I wish everyone at Yale could take it. If you are looking to learn all about current developmental theories on life transitions, this happens but it's not the main goal: take this class if you want to learn more about yourself and others.",
    "This class teaches you how to live. You will learn how to be happy. It is not much work. Take it.",
    "This is a wonderful class! Professor Berg is great and cares about the students.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS OF ALL TIME. Professor Berg is the best professor I've had, the class is phenomenal, and this is a gift. I can't describe how grateful I am to have been able to take this course. I am just so so so happy that this exists, that I was able to take it, and that I can now use this knowledge in my everyday life. That being said, only take this course if you are willing to open up, to listen to others, and to excavate the self. This is not just an easy course to take (although the workload is not a lot and it is all very interesting) -- but only something worth taking if you will put a ton of effort into your assignments, into thinking critically about yourself, and into knocking down your own walls.",
    "Definitely. If you're at a crossroads in your life, this course will change everything.",
    "This course was hands-down my favorite experience at Yale. Over the semester, I found myself asking important questions about myself, my time at Yale, and the exciting question of what it means to become an adult. I recommend this class to anyone who wants to push themselves to ask real questions we don't often discuss about being a real person. If you're a senior, it's a chance to think about what you want your life after graduation to be, and ask the questions that are important about how you want your family, career and values will fit together in future life.",
    "Yes!",
    "I HAVE been recommending it pretty much every single person I have ever met. I am the person that I am today in many, many ways thanks to this class and I know I will carry on the invaluable knowledge I got from it every I go, be it in the professional or the personal realm.",
    "Absolutely!! I cannot recommend it strongly enough. This course has been one of my favorites so far. It is so different from anything else I have taken, but it has been so essential for my personal growth and my ability to understand others. This course isn't for everyone, but it is absolutely worth it if you are able to put in the effort for serious personal reflection.",
    "YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn so much about yourself and how you move through the world. It's a really different type of work reflecting on your life, so don't worryeven if you have a heavy courseload take it take it. It's not a gut in the sense that you have to be really invested in being vulnerable with others about your feelings and your life. But I've never developed relationships like I have in this class and it's been so wonderful.",
    "Take this course. Professor berg is wonderful and you will learn so much about yourself and your peers.",
    "Absolutely. PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. It will teach you to think about yourself and others in a way that carries over to all of your interactions, everywhere, not just inside class. It provided me with the chance to do that self-reflection that I'd always promised myself I'd do when I had more time, but never actually got around to doing because it always felt like there were other, more important things I should be prioritizing. Don't fall into that trap - self-reflection IS important, and it is priceless, and let this course be your \"excuse\" to start doing that so you can discover how much you more you get out of life once you start developing a relationship with yourself."
