   "comments": [
    "It's a more interesting class than the lecture - Tolga is a fantastic teacher! The material can only be so interesting (it's intro econ, after all), but you come away from the class feeling that you have learned quite a great deal. Overall, I highly recommend this class.",
    "It is one of the most popular courses to take. It sounds as though the seminar was much better than the lecture, and you definitely want to have Tolga teaching you.",
    "If you want to take this class, TAKE IT WITH TOLGA! He keeps the material interesting with crazy stories and random anecdotes, all while explaining difficult concepts in an easy to understand manner. I had no background in economics and have excelled in the class, so do not be scared away. Just do the reading, listen in class and study!",
    "Great course because of the great professor. Definitely moves really fast though, and the curve is not very forgiving.",
    "ECON 110 was hard. If you do not have any prior knowledge of economics (as I didn't), be wary of taking this class. Even as an introductory course, it is intense -- really understanding the material takes a lot of outside effort and textbook reading. The problem sets can be a bit tricky at first glance, but they're not unmanageable. The tests can have some curveball questions, but as long as you study and do the Psets, you should be fine for most of it. By the end of the course (or even towards the middle), you'll know if you want to be an Econ major. That being said, Tolga is an amazing -- AMAZING -- professor! He's incredibly engaging and humorous, often providing examples of his own life and experiences with an Econ twist, or even sometimes just going on unrelated tangents. He does his best to make the [often dry] material interesting, and he's very accessible in terms of office hours. But still -- the curve is pretty harsh, the midterm and final take up a huge portion of your final grade, and you'll be in there with a bunch of students who probably already have some background in economics. If you manage to get into this course, I'd definitely suggest shopping the lecture, as well.",
    "Great introduction to economics. Everyone says that the seminar has a lot more work than the lecture, but this was my easiest class by far. Tolga is a great (and super friendly) professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 110 - not just because of the material, but also because of the structure. The seminar aspect is a big plus, and having at least one class where everyone is a freshman makes things a little bit less intimidating! Also, Tolga made us organize ourselves into small study groups - which, in hindsight, was a great idea!",
    "Tolga makes micro pretty enjoyable. You either like or don't like economics - there is not much middle ground. I had never taken an economics class in high school, and I felt that this class was the perfect pace for me. Good for both the definite econ major and inquisitive freshmen.",
    "If you take this class, you'll have a good time and come out with a solid understanding of microeconomics for laymen. That said, if you actually want to major in economics, you may want to consider transferring to Harvard or UPenn (schools with good econ depts and good business schools), because the intro course here is not good. Tolga is hilarious and tells great stories and gives great examples, but if you want to leave with a super solid foundation in economic theory, maybe try the lecture course. Or Harvard. Also Psets are easy and shouldn't take more than 2 hours.",
    "ECON 110 is a great introduction to economics. The workload is relatively low and the tests are fair. The curve is not as easy as the lecture but Tolga makes it worth it. A high school economics course is not necessary for this course, but if you have taken micro in high school, there is still plenty to be learned by taking this course. I would highly recommend taking Tolga's microeconomics course.",
    "Strengths: 1. The classes are thoroughly entertaining and enlightening. The examples, fun facts, general knowledge and contextual information provided enriches our foundations as beginning economists. I shifted from Professor Katerina to Professor Tolga's classes and I strongly think Professor Tolga's classes are better because Professor Tolga cares a lot more about his students and makes his classes more interesting 2. Professor Tolga is very enthusiastic about teaching and really wants us to challenge ourselves\/understand advanced economics. His best quality is his genuine concern for his students. He empathizes with and understands our pressures and difficulties. He tries to alleviate those pressures by not only giving us some excellent life\/college\/time management advice during class but also holding supremely useful office hours and review sessions. He is sincerely enthusiastic about teaching students and very knowledgeable about history, politics, science and culture beyond Economics. The interdisciplinary nature of his classes makes them very interesting 3. The small size of the class makes a dramatic difference. I used to speak and interact several times during Professor Tolgas classes. I also attended the ECON 115 lectures during shopping period so I know that the interaction really adds to the experience 4. The use of small study groups (~4 students) within the class is helpful 5. Help was mostly available when needed; office hours were a blessing and the review sessions before exams were very helpful Weaknesses: 1. Too many basic (but difficult) concepts, which are covered in the book, are not discussed sufficiently (or at all) in class. These difficult concepts often involve complicated Math or extensive reading. They should at least be covered in class even if they arent tested e.g. more detail about financial markets, monopolies and innovation, more detailed game theory, more\/better explained examples of Coase theorem 2. Sometimes, in class, too much discussion of general knowledge\/fun facts means the actual economics concepts are not explained sufficiently. Too much confusion remains after and during class. It is really important that every example is connected explicitly and clearly to the concept at hand. The professor should spend more time on the fundamental Economics concepts and less on examples. If we understand the concepts well, the examples will become even clearer 3. The mathematical focus of the course should not be reduced but the conceptual focus needs to be increased. The problem sets, for example, should follow every math question with a conceptual\/analytical question. The math for questions is often too mechanical and can be easily memorized",
    "It was a great course.",
    "Take Econ 110 if you want an efficient and comprehensive introduction to microeconomics! And if you can, take it with Tolga. The class is quite fast-paced, and depending on what section you're in, the curve may work against your favor (your grade is curved according to your section). If you're up for a little challenge, then Econ 110 is a great choice. The material can be difficult, but Tolga is really helpful, especially during office hours. He'll ask you to form study groups with people in class too, so maintain a good relationship with your study group and check answers for p-sets due every week.",
    "Definitely take it with Tolga. His sense of humor broad knowledge make the lectures fascinating. He is very competent in his field and gives many examples and applications from real life, which really helps us learn and remember. The course feels more challenging than an intro economics course. You learn a lot.",
    "It's a sprint through high-school micro that transitions smoothly into intermediate micro. I can't recommend it to people unless I know them before they actually start Yale, but if I ever encounter someone in that situation, I will. It's a good class, and way better than the lecture from what I understand of the lecture.",
    "It is hard, and it is not for everyone. It is a good intro class to take, though, as it will certainly help you decide whether or not you want to or can continue in Econ. The seminar class is more challenging that the lecture. I wish I had taken the lecture course, but the seminar gives you a chance to learn topics more in depth.",
    "Don't be intimidated by the curve (unless you're not prepared to actually study). Micro is definitely something you should take in order to be an informed citizen- I started recognizing many of the concepts we talked about in the news. Tolga is an excellent professor who expects students to study a lot but is also very willing to help during office hours. I never thought I would enjoy micro as much as I did this semester."
