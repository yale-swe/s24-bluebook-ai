   "comments": [
    "Great class, meets once a week and discusses modern texts from South Asia.",
    "Take this class! The selection of readings is phenomenal, for those with some background\/interest in South Asian history and\/or literature. Dr. Baer is brilliant and although he tended to dominate the first few weeks of discussions, the seminar became much more interactive as we became more familiar with the terminology and materials of the class. There is a significant amount of reading; however, most of it is very engaging. The assignments (weekly response, midterm paper, final paper) are very reasonable.",
    "I would recommend it!!! Especially if you want to read interesting books about South Asia and have a genuine interest in learning about the countries.",
    "Take the class! It will not only introduce you to some amazing fiction but will give you a deeper understanding of how South Asia has operated from the 19th century onward but mainly in different turbulent eras of the 20th century. This class made my week, and I loved it. The midterm paper and the final was also a great format for a class to follow. This was my all-time favorite class at Yale.",
    "This is a good class that is low stress. Would recommend."
