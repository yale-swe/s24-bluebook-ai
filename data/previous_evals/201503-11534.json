   "comments": [
    "Yes. I fell like I learned much more than an average elementary language course.",
    "EGYP 510 01 will provide students who are interested in understanding New Testament manuscripts, the tool to read biblical documents from the gospel in another language other than Greek. I would recommend this to other students who might want to use an ancient language as a base to understand some biblical manuscripts but are opposed to taking a full-time study of Greek.",
    "I would summarize EGYP 510 as the introductory Coptic course, in which we complete roughly one chapter per week and work through constructed stories to grasp the basic grammar of the language. I would definitely recommend the course to any students interested in Early Christianity or Egyptian history.",
    "Coptic is a hybridization between Greek and Egyptian. If one knows Greek, one will do very well in the course. I would not recommend taking it if one does not know Greek because the book (and the language itself) is so heavily dependent on one's knowing Greek. It also helps to know Egyptian hieroglyphics, but that's not easy to come by. The textbook isn't great, but Scott's teaching makes up for it.",
    "Introduction to Coptic grammar and morphology. Highly recommended for students interested in New Testament and early Christianity.",
    "Excellent and well organized intro course to the language. Yes, I would recommend."

    "Contributed familiarity with a new language and a new body of primary literature."
