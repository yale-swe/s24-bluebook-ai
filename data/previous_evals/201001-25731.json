    "Make sure you like your TA. Chances are, they don't want to be there. Make sure you can understand them, and they break it down in terms you like.",
    "This class was very basic. It's an average math class. It's not new or exciting, but it's a good way to get a QR credit. However, it does require work and the finals\/midterms are definitely not easy.",
    "Easy, take it for an easy QR or if you need a calc class on your transcript.",
    "Only take Math112 if you need it for a pre-requisite. If you want to take it because you think it will be an easy grade, keep in mind that the class if full of like-minded students. Also, the material is more challenging at College level. However, there is something to be said about the value of the material in itself. Shop before you buy.",
    "simple, introductory calculus class. Although it is only AB calc, don't expect an easy A, this is definitely different from high school calc.",
    "The course is harder than its level. Even if you have taken calculus in high school, you will learn a lot",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless you are planning to major in math or if it is required for your major",
    "Yes. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in getting a general knowledge of math.",
    "I would recommend this class to take a break away from heavy essay writing courses and intense reading. And its a great foundation for calc",
    "It is a good review of calculus, and everybody should have these basic math notions, even if they don't need Math 112 as a requirement. But do not think it is that easy... work on a regular basis is essential for not getting lost. Also, the math tutors in the colleges and in SSS were extremely helpful.",
    "Good easy math grade if you took Calc in high school just practice the problems and know the textbook to brush up for tests.",
    "hard",
    "Math 112 is an introduction to Calculus that goes through the Fundamental Theorem and basic integration. I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they have been exposed to calculus before. I had taken it in high school, but had not had math for three years, and so had a foundation on which to enter the course that I believe was very helpful. It may have been more difficult for students who had never seen calculus before. TA Banerjee is a very good instructor if you can get him, and I hear that is not always the case. Once you get used to his demeanor, you will realize that he is supportive, effective, and willing to help in any way he can.",
    "Math 112 is a general math course. If you need to take it, then take it. If not, go find a more engaging course."
