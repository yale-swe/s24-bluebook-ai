   "comments": [
    "This class is a very rewarding one, if the proper amount of time is put in. Because of the small class size, every student is held accountable for the assignments and nightly homeworks, which take on average 2 hours. As a premed student, the workload, although manageable, was quite difficult fit into my schedule.",
    "I would highly recommend Latin Poetry. The workload was reasonable and the course had various dimensions, including a project that was quite fun to prepare, a few response papers on books of the Aeneid, fair exams, and quizzes. This course is a great option for those eager to fulfill the Latin requirement.",
    "It was a great class and very straightforward. You do need to prepare for class and be willing to put time into the course.",
    "A great course! The workload is a little challenging at first but becomes more manageable as you get used to reading poetry. Jessica was knowledgeable and engaged everyone in the material, and seemed to really care about her students,",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to maintain and\/or further his or her Latin skills. The course provides an excellent reinforcement of the processes involved in disentangling Latin syntax, while also allowing students to expand their knowledge of classical myth and epic poetry.",
    "LATN 141 is an introduction to poetry. It is a class that is taught very well and that teaches students how to analyze poetical meaning and verse very well."
