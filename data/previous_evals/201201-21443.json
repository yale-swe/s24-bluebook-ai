   "comments": [
    "ENVE 120 is a good intro course. Lecture is dry sometimes, but you will learn a lot of the basics by going to class. The problems sets are long and difficult, but the grading is easy and the tests are easier than the homework. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the subject.",
    "Take this class if you think you might want to be an EnvE major. This class convinced me that the major was not for me, which was actually helpful information for me. My close friend who took the class decided that this is the right major for her.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENVE120. I feel like I learned a lot throughout the semester, and you could always count on class to be entertaining.",
    "I can't comment on this from an ENVE perspective, but if you're a non-science major: Yes, do it! Fairly easy class that still won't dumb down the material and will teach you very interesting info about important issues. Class covers water\/wastewater treatment, air pollution, and environmental chemistry in pretty good detail. Especially important perspective to have in mind especially if you're ever thinking of doing any policy work related to environmental protection, or something in that field.Also, Professor Peccia is a great teacher and just a ridiculous dude. World's best anecdotes.",
    "If you are interested in the subject, otherwise no.",
    "if water quality and air pollution is your thing, this is the proper introductory course. if you are interested in solar panel and wind turbine engineering (civil side), look elsewhere. i would not recommend this course unless you are considering the major.",
    "I would recommend the class if you want to understand the basic metrics and tools used in environmental engineering. The class has a chemistry focus, so expect a lot of problems instead of a more conceptual approach. Also, the class focuses on traditional environmental engineering and mostly deals with water and air quality. Don't expect to learn a lot about recent developments in the field or about green engineering.",
    "I thought that overall it was a very good course with a lot of the basics of environmental engineering presented to us in a relatively interesting and very accessible manner. It was graded fairly. There was no curve, but also no + or - grades, just A, B, C, D, F. The problem sets were of average length for a science class, but there is where one of my complaint lies. They were often written without the greatest care. For example, Professor Peccia would often forget to include very important words that were needed to solve the problem correctly, mis-label units on the given variables, and expect us to know when we had to use outside information (i.e. Google things) without stating so explicitly a lot of the time. Lectures were interesting, reading were meh, but they aren't That integral. Also solutions to homeworks and test were posted on Classes, but were illegible, skipped steps, and were ultimately un-helpful. Tests were fair. Professor Peccia is an awesome guy. Take it if at all interested in environmental engineering!",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in applications of science in the environment!!!!! The work load is light but the material is interesting and you will learn a little about many areas of environmental engineering.",
    "The topics covered in this class are definitely very interesting, however if you don't have a solid understanding of chemistry it may not be the right time to take the class. The last time I took chemistry was sophomore year in high school and there was a definite learning curve involved in understanding some of the concepts. However, don't let that deter you from taking the class!! Just know that you may struggle with some concepts. The tests are very fair and tend to be easier than the homework's. Professor Peccia was very good, as well.",
    "Relatively easy class. Not much work although the problem sets are pretty time consuming (only had 4 the semester I took it). If you have a decent background in chemistry you should have no problem with it.",
    "Only take it if you are already interested in the EnvE major. It is a good test to see if it is a major you actually want to pursue. If you are not interested in the major, there is no good reason to take this class.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to environmental engineering, both reasonably rigorous and accessible to non-majors. While you will have to work in this class - this isn't a gut - the work is generally manageable and interesting. Professor Peccia isgreat - his lectures are a lot of fun and he's very helpful.",
    "This is a good course if you're interested in exploring the possibility of continuing in environmental engineering. It's not so hard that it will turn you away from the subject matter but it is also engaging. I would recommend this class, but it would be good to have taken some sort of basic chemistry (higher level high school class or basic college level).",
    "Tough if you haven't taken Chemistry at Yale or Chemistry AP in highschool",
    "It is an easy science credit.",
    "Great class. The problem sets were challenging, but the topics were mostly interesting. THIS IS NOT A CONSERVATION CLASS. Don't take if you want to save the polar bears. The chemistry is challenging, and very engineering based.",
    "It's a good course to take to see if you are interested in this subject.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who are planning to major in Environmental Engineering. It isn't as useful of a course for those who are just looking for a QR credit. It gives a good background on environmental engineering specifically, but the problem sets are long and you could find a more interesting QR credit.",
    "A really good introduction to Environmental Engineering. My major is basically the opposite of ENVE; I took this class for the QR and loved it. The first few months are rough if you didn't learn chemistry in high school, and class is disorganized at times. But Prof. Peccia is great. Kind, wickedly funny, and very warm. This class was really hard for me as someone with no quantitative background, but all the same I enjoyed every day.",
    "If you want to be an Environmental Engineer take this class (I guess you have to). It was fairly hard to get a grade in, but not an absurd amount of work. Problem sets probably averaged out to every other week. The lectures were pretty dry although the teacher was funny. I wouldn't take this if you're simply trying to get a science under your belt!",
    "I would especially recommend ENVE 120 with Professor Peccia to an environmental engineering major because it provides a good preparation for the material and math you will encounter later in the major. Lectures and problem sets are very problem\/example based which helps you learn the material throughly. Midterms and the final are nothing surprising, just study all the material well, and know how to do the homework problems and you will be well prepared.",
    "If you are an Environmental studies major, TAKE IT ASAP. SO useful, and will challenge you in different ways than expected. Not too hard a work load either. I never studied too much ahead of time for my exams because I listened closely in class. Class is pretty good.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student looking to fulfill their science requirement in an interesting and practical manner. The material is straightforward and the tests are not that difficult. Additionally, after having completed the course I feel I have a better understanding of the environmental problems facing society.",
    "The course was a good introduction to environmental engineering. I thought it moved at a good pace. Professor Peccia is engaging and funny. His teaching style was a little confusing at the beginning of the semester, as his example problems on the board skip steps (that he does in his head). It got better over the semester though as you got used to it.",
    "It is an ok course. If you are considering environmental engineering as a major, this class will give you a good survey of what is ahead for you. If you are looking this class as an easy science credit, I would say that it might not be as easy as you expect. There are only 6 psets, which is way less work than most science courses. However, you will have to go several times to TAs office hours as PSETs are poorly written. Take it it if you need a survey or science credit. If not, run away from this class.",
    "This class is not impossible to do alright in even with basic skill sets, but you have to be sure to put some time into it. The perspective I got from fellow student who were really into math and science, it was a manageable quantitative class, but the relative consistency of the psets kept you on your toes and it hurt to put them off till the day before. See Peccia at his office hours, he's really helpful.Also it's pretty specific information, so unless you're into environmental engineering, you might find the information very dry. Keep in mind also the afternoon, twice weekly, 1.5 hour class duration = danger of siesta time."
