   "comments": [
    "Not very engaging TA held office hours before every pset and exam which was very nice Material was well organized",
    "The equations of motion really pulled everything together and I think it would be helpful to introduce them earlier in the course. After understanding them, things like geostrophy and the hydrostatic balance become easier to understand and use.",
    "This course does a good job of covering basic topics in oceanography and the types of problems that can be solved by the fundamental laws in each area. The course material was generally interesting but sometimes felt slightly out of date. I wish some newer research had been introduced more often. The lectures could also be slightly faster paced and more engaging."
