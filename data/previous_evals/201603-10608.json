    "I personally feel that I have learnt a lot during the class. Obviously, you should expect to familiarize yourself with the Korean language (alphabet, grammar, sentence structure), but KOREAN 110 will allow you to form rather complicated sentence structure, to write cohesive paragraphs and speak for 5 minutes (or more). In comparison, it took me 3 years to acquire the similar level of English (I am non-native English speaker)",
    "This course allowed me to develop the foundations for learning the Korean language while also becoming more comfortable with reading and writing and learning about the culture.",
    "I developed a basic yet strong foundation of elementary Korean, and learned that studying a new language takes dedication as well as passion in order to learn it well.",
    "I developed reading, writing, and speaking skills in Korean. Since I had absolutely no proficiency in Korean at all before taking this course, all of the knowledge gained was new."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The fact that the class meets everyday. It is certainly a strength, as it allows you to achieve maximum exposure and daily practices of the language. The problem is that it is TOO MUCH, after a month or so, I completely lost all my excitement to come to class everyday. Learning a language is a very exciting journey, but I would appreciate the class much better if it were structured into 3 1-hour sessions per week, for example. I guess there is nothing we can do about it.",
    "The design of this course is very well planned with organized oral and written testing patterns. I think it is well-situated for an entry level language course.",
    "It can be very tiring to have class every day of the week as well as homework and daily quizzes, but they do improve the learning experience.",
    "The speed of which the material is taught at could be a little faster, and I felt like the amount of tests we had this semester was a little low. In addition to having vocab quizzes each day, I wish we had more comprehensive quizzes (including grammar) that tested our Korean ability. I found listening to be the hardest area for me, though I'm not sure how else she could improve teaching that part of Korean aside from what she has already been doing."

    "DEFINITELY, take it !!!!",
    "This is a solid, straight-forward first level language class. Professor Lee-Smith is wonderful (very kind, uses technology effectively, cares about her students and their progress) and the work\/grading system is very clear. There is a short vocab quiz at the beginning of (nearly) every class (which are totally doable if you study for 15 minutes the night before), daily homework (never excessive), tests every two book chapters, a final exam, a final skit, and a final project. Canvas is used heavily, which is very helpful if you want to check what work is coming up. If you're interested in learning Korean in a friendly environment and can plan to take maybe 45 minutes\/day to study and complete homework, go for it. One piece of advice: the workbook homework always took me a surprising amount of time, but it would be totally reasonable spread out over a few days, so start on that before it's assigned.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning the Korean language because it is an enjoyable and educational experience. While learning a new language is somewhat of a struggle, the comfortable environment and well-thought-out organization of this course eases the transition to speaking and writing a foreign language.",
    "If you are interested in learning a new language, this course is highly recommended. It is taught at a steady pace where if you have more difficult classes in your schedule, this class will not burden you with loads of work."
