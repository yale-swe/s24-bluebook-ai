    "I'd be an idiot not to.",
    "I concluded my paper course evaluation, \"I am a much, much happier person.\" Hands down the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Anne Fadiman is the best teacher at Yale, obviously. TAKE THIS CLASS! Anne will spend over five hours with you in one-on-one conferences! Does this happen to any other class ever? No!",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. If you can, you must. It is guaranteed to make you a better writer and a better person.",
    "All strength, no weakness. Great for improving writing skills and for learning both with and from your Yale peers.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is the best class I have taken at Yale. I looked forward to class all week. I can't imagine next semester without it. Be prepared to put hours and hours and hours into this class - more than you have put into any other class - but it will all be worth it.Anne is the most committed, thoughtful, caring, available teacher you will ever have. She puts as much of herself into the class as her students.",
    "Absolutely take this course, even if nonfiction is not your primary genre. Allot a good chunk of your semester to this class and you certainly won't regret it. It's a commitment but one to which it is well worth committing.",
    "You've probably heard the hype about this course or about Anne Fadiman\u0085 don't believe any of the hype because the real thing is infinitely better. This semester course is one of the few that can singlehandedly validate spending forty grand for a year of Yale. If you have the golden opportunity to claw your way into this seminar, TAKE IT IN A HEARTBEAT AND WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT, AND DO IT RIGHT NOW!!! I only wish I had been an English major and applied for the creative writing concentration\u0085",
    "English 469 was an exemplary course in nonfiction writing (and reading). In addition to studying selections from the work of excellent nonfiction writers, 469ers write four pieces over the course of the semester:1. A \"place\" piece based on reportage of a place on campus;2. A \"home\" piece, memoir-ish in nature;3. An \"object\" piece that describes some object from their \"home culture\"; and4. A \"Yellow Pages\" article-- a long profile of someone found through the Greater New Haven Yellow Pages (to be written in the context of her or his profession).Just as important as these four writing assignments are the long critiques 469ers write about their peers' work. Every other week, the class is divided into pairs; partners email each other thoughtful critiques, with micro- and macroscopic edits, of the previous week's assignment. These critiques are writing assignments in themselves; for the first three pieces, students have as much time (one week) to write critiques as they do to write their own pieces.The first three pieces equip 469ers to render places, people, and scenes in a memorable and meaningful way. The longer fourth piece, which requires a good deal of research and reportage, is a culminating project that draws on the skills exercised by the first three assignments.English 469 was the most thoughtfully structured course I have taken at Yale. My classmates were talented and lovely people. The readings were fantastic. The assignments were difficult and exhilarating. Class was always a joy. Anne Fadiman is the very best. Take the class.",
    "Hard. The class will take up all your time, and you will still wish that you had even more time to commit to it. But the experience is worth every minute."
