    "Instructor: Eleanor Catherine Stokes \u00a0I would have liked to hear more from Kellie and her research areas. Her insights were always interesting in class, but she didn't speak up very often. I would have also appreciated more direction from her or Karen in the beginning of class on S&A style and expectations. I also think it would have been a time saver if Kellie had downloaded and shared all the course readings for everyone, as is typically done in other classes, and if she printed and turned in the S&As for us each week.",
    "Instructor: Eleanor Catherine Stokes \u00a0Kellie was great, super responsive and was a constructive contributor to class discussions as well!",
    "Instructor: Eleanor Catherine Stokes \u00a0Kellie was well organized, very accessible, made valuable contributions to the course, and was very respectful to students' perspectives.",
    "Instructor: Eleanor Catherine Stokes \u00a0Kellie provided great insight in our class. When she facilitated our class discussion, I think that she ran class well but could benefit from continuing to practice leading seminar discussions.",
    "Instructor: Eleanor Catherine Stokes \u00a0She was helpful, knowledgeable and easily assessible for answering questions over e-mail. More office hours would have been great, especially during the beginning of the course when we were just learning how to do the weekly written assignments.",
    "Instructor: Eleanor Catherine Stokes \u00a0Kellie seemed solid, but the class structure didn't allow us to really take advantage of her as a resource. It would be great to have her more involved somehow in the future.",
    "Instructor: Eleanor Catherine Stokes \u00a0Kellie was very responsive and made herself very available to answer questions. She did a great job explaining concepts and grading."

    "This is one of the very special courses offered at FES. The workload is huge - as much as twice what it is in some easier courses. but it is worth every minute that a student puts in. The material is crucial to an understanding of GHG mitigation. Karen Seto is an amazing instructor, and she pours herself totally into the course. Class is conducted as a seminar, and the discussion is always fascinating, and superbly moderated.",
    "During the initial review of this course earlier in the semester, Karen agreed to cut down the number of readings. I think this was a good move and would suggest limiting the number of readings from the get-go the next time the course is offered- five, dense scientific research papers is more than enough, especially when many of them are quite long.",
    "This course is the best course I took this semester. It was also the most difficult. I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to work hard and learn a lot.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at F&ES. In addition to being unique in terms of content\/focus, there is no other course that provides similar skills building in the area of analytical reading and writing. The writing skills I gained from this class have drastically improved my ability to write persuasively, and I feel much more confident in applying to jobs, grants, and other contexts in which concise, persuasive writing is necessary. In addition, I truly feel an expert on a such for the first time since coming to graduate school. I will be teaching a short course this summer, and I look forward to using the classroom techniques that Karen uses to engage in active discussions. I was surprised every week at how fast three hours passed! I hope that F&ES takes the knowledge of how passionate students are about this subject to increase the number of courses in this area.",
    "This was the best course I have taken at F&ES.",
    "13 - Professor Seto is both very well informed on the subject matter and a great educator. Despite the class sessions being long, she varied the activities and kept us highly engaged.",
    "One of the best courses to take at FES. Karen is an exceptional teacher who cares about students leaving with mastery of the material and the skills necessary to communicate the subject to a wider audience."

    "Karen is the best aspect of this course. She's engaged, insightful, prepared, and passionate about her work. She did an exceptional job of encouraging real dialogue in class and I think I learned a ton. It's a shame it's not offered more often or open to more students. I wish she taught other courses.",
    "The quality of the discussion in the classroom and the instruction from Karen Seto.",
    "Prof. Seto's deep, deep expertise in the subject was absolutely invaluable. I also learned a lot from my fellow classmates, I think Prof. Seto did a great job assembling a diverse set of perspectives in the class.",
    "Gained a great level of knowledge of the context of urban areas in climate change and the current discussions around that topic. Vastly improved my writing and assessment skills due to the homework assignments.",
    "Karen's teaching and the full class discussions with a small class size.",
    "The structure of the course and of the assignments were very conducive to learning. The small group breakout sessions were really helpful for going over concepts and learning about how other students perceived the course concepts. It was also a valuable team building exercise and help strengthen our ability to synthesize group perspectives under a tight deadline.",
    "The class discussions were immensely valuable to my understanding of course material, and the students brought unique and interesting perspectives to the class.",
    "Classtime. Discussion was engaging, well structured, and useful. Listening to\/learning from Karen Seto was excellent and a highlight of my time at Yale.",
    "Reading list and class discussions\/exercises.",
    "We practiced taking scientific knowledge and translating it into actionable policy steps for climate change mitigation in urban areas. We learned both to read, synthesize and write clearly. These are highly transferrable skills.",
    "We have covered climate change and cities from many different angles and improved our abilities of synthesizing and presenting technical information.",
    "Karen's teaching style kept students engaged by mixing up the format of instruction frequently. Very well organized grounding in the material with good breath and depth. I would say that both Karen's instruction and the rigorous grounding in the material were top aspects."

   "comments": [
    "To be honest, none. This was the best course I have ever taken.",
    "The readings were too heavy in the beginning. I could have used more feedback on my S&A's- I thought they would be totally marked up, but they were actually more often returned to me with a couple underlined phrases and a grade. I needed more instruction on how to improve, and it would have been nice to get them back sooner. I also disliked that they had to be printed and turned in by hand every week.",
    "The quantity of reading at the beginning was a little too much, but Prof. Seto responded to feedback partway through the course and tapered it slightly. I came in expecting to read a lot for sure, but in the beginning getting through ten articles while also learning how to synthesize them well was a touch too much.",
    "I would've liked to get to reading\/discussing the policy solutions earlier than we did.",
    "The instructor and TA could provide specific comments and suggestions on assignments. Some of the later classes seemed a little redundant. There could be a stronger emphasis on the social consequences of some of the policies discussed, with perhaps a class session on specific case studies. Overall the course worked extremely well.",
    "Although I think there was a heavy workload for this class, it was necessary to convey the course material and improve our analytical skills.",
    "I think this course needs to be structured so that it can be offered in future semesters. Karen says that she will not offer the course in the future because of the time suck of grading our assignments. However, her comments on our assignments were not lengthy or really meaningful and I think two good TAs would be able to do the same, which would demand less time of Karen. It seems to me that Karen is looking at the course as \"all or nothing\" when I would rather there be something in the middle so that future students get the honor of learning from her. If she doesn't offer the course in the future, she should not be advertised as a professor at F&ES, because she is a big reason why I and others come here.",
    "More diverse perspectives need to be incorporated into the readings and discussions.",
    "More support in the earlier part of the course would have been helpful as we learned what was expected of us in the writing assignments. For example, a workshop where we gave peer feedback on each other's first drafts would have been helpful in the second week of class.",
    "While we were warned that the course would be reading and writing intensive, would it be possible to design it so that students could learn as much without having this class take over their lives?"
