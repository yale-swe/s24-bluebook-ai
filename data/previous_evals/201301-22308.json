   "comments": [
    "I would totally recommend this! A play a week can be tough if you have a lot of other reading intensive course, but there is a little bit of leeway. As long as you read the plays before the exams (which are non-cumulative) then you're basically fine. 3 papers, but only 5 pages each. One of them you have to hand in a rough draft and then edit it after getting comments back, which was actually super helpful. Also, Prof. Manley is awesome. He can be super funny and he makes lectures entertaining.",
    "Must-take survey course of Shakespeare's comedies and romances.",
    "You read a lot of plays and hear two interesting lectures about each play. You enjoy listening to Manley. You do the work (3 short papers, a midterm and a final) happily, because the plays are so interesting and the assignments give you so much leeway. What's not to like?",
    "Amazing, fun, great way to read lots of Shakespeare's works!",
    "great survey of the comedies and romances. Lecture isn't entirely necessary but informative when you go and makes studying for exams less stressful. If you don't feel like you will read a play a week most weeks, don't take it. The workload is very manageable if you stay decently caught up (don't skip more than 1 or 2 plays pre and post midterm) but if you are prepping for midterm or final and realized you didn't read 3 or 4 plays you're going to be pretty miserable.",
    "If you don't know much about Shakespeare's comedies and romances but love the things by him that you've read, this is a great class.",
    "Shakespeare Comedies and Romances is a great way to explore those plays from Shakespeare. It's a play a week, which is a manageable reading load. The comedies and romances are fun reads, and section will help explore certain themes within them. I found the lectures to be alright. They were informative, but Professor Manley had an interesting way of lecturing in that it seemed as if he were reading aloud a well-written essay rather than lecturing. Which is fine, just a different lecturing style. He had great slides to go along with it that provided visuals or snippets from movies. Overall, I felt like I learned a lot, and I would opt to take the course again.",
    "This Shakespeare course is definitely less \"fun\" than Kastan's course, but you still learn a lot and get to do a great reading list! A must take for English majors in my opinion.",
    "Excellent and fine for non-english majors",
    "An interesting course! Go to lecture, although people may tell you you can skip- Manley puts so much thought into them. This course made me appreciate the complexities of the comedies and romances in a way I hadn't before.A play a week, chronologically. 3 papers plus 1 revision, and 2 hour exams (quote IDs).",
    "Take this course if you need to fulfill a pre-1800 requirement for the English major, or if you're interested in Shakespeare. I personally either hated or loved the plays we read, and you will come to a deeper appreciation for the subject material by writing about it over the course of the semester.",
    "Professor Manley either writes his lectures completely out before class or is the greatest public speaker since Cicero. Listening to his lectures is like reading an essay, the ideas flow so well. Great lecturer, pretty easy WR credit (3 papers of 5 pages each). The midterm and final might seem ostensibly hard (he can pick literally any quote from any play and you have to identify them), but he picks either well-known quotes or ones that clue you in in some way to which character from which play says them. You read a play per week.",
    "Definitely recommend! Incredible class without too much work--just enough to keep you engaged!",
    "YES I would recommend English 200. You get to read some of Shakespeare's best plays, listen to wonderful lectures twice a week, and talk about these plays with your peers. It's the best.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you like classes that are structured so that no single assignment is worth too much of the overall grade, but there still wasn't work every week! I thought it was great. The lectures and selection of plays were a little boring though.",
    "If you are interested at all in Shakespeare, than take this course! It is a great survey of Shakespeare and really, if you are an English major, it is the best way to get the pre-1800 requirement!",
    "English 200 is a great class to take for a writing credit even as a non-english major, but only if you are willing to put in the time and really read the plays. All of these plays are masterworks, and Prof. Manley's lectures, although a bit dry at times, are really rewarding readings that enrich your understanding of Shakespeare. The three fairly short papers are pretty manageable and if you've kept up with your reading, the quote exams will be fine as well.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a solid introduction to the world of Shakespeare; as an English major, that's a must. Also, TAKE ERIC WEISKOTT AS YOUR TA IF YOU CAN.",
    "As a STEM major, English classes tend to intimidate me. ENGL 200 was a nice break for me. I thought that it was accessible and fun. I would recommend it, even if you're not an English major.",
    "a good overview as the title says",
    "Great lecture, great plays. The midterm and final are a bit tough (8 out of 12 passage IDs + analyze the passage) but definitely doable if you study the lecture slides since most of the quotes are there. 3 papers, one revision. Solid amount of work. I thought it was worth it; the readings were good and having read very little Shakespeare before, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "Take it if you want to read a lot Shakespeare and want to hear some interesting takes on many of his less well known works.",
    "Sure! This is a great class if you need a writing credit, or just want to know more about Shakespeare.",
    "It's not the worst way to get a Pre-1800 credit for the major.",
    "Yes take it for the readings!",
    "I would recommend it, though I wish I had taken it before I took tragedies and histories...only because the tragedies\/histories semester felt more fulfilling and though this was a great class it felt like a let down by comparison.",
    "Take it!",
    "English 200 covers Shakespeare's comedies and romances. All English and history majors should consider taking it. Other students will also benefit from the writing and critical reading requirements. Be warned that you read at least a play per week.",
    "This was a great class. The reading lulled in the middle, but began and ended with phenomenal plays. I loved section, and lecture was usually good.",
    "I would recommend this class as a pre1800 credit for an English major or to someone who simply loves Shakespeare, but that being said, the one play a week workload is heavy (especially in preparing for the two exams and in addition to 3 papers), so if Shakespeare is not something youwould find enjoyable on a daily basis I would maybe suggest a different class. I did enjoy both Professor Manley's lectures and sections though!",
    "If you are a senior English major take this cr\/d and never go to class. Full of non English major randos who drag the quality down. Manleys lectures are mediocre and rambling and try to be bigger than they can be. Not a patch on Kastan",
    "Take this class! It was one of my favorite courses of the semester, taught by a warm and engaging lecturer who makes you fall in love with the texts (in my opinion, far superior to Kastan's entertaining but sort-of empty calorie fare, not to mention his bizarre in-class power-plays, but that's another story for another time). You'll get some close readings, some historical approaches, some discussion of genre, some feminism, a couple of really great lectures on cross-dressing. You'll also get a very reasonable amount of work:a play a week, an act a day, really manageable; three papers spaced throughout the semester, five pages each; two easy quote ID exams. It's easy to add on as a fourth or fifth class, but you'll do the reading as if it's your first. And it seemed accessible to non-English majors while being enjoyable to those in the major.",
    "If you're looking for a good introductory English lecture, Shakespeare is a great class to take. The reading is not too intense, but there's a lot to glean from it -- and, since theclass is usually such a diverse mix of English and non-English majors, the discussion sections always have something to offer. (And if you are an English major, this is a great way to get a pre-1800 out of the way!) (Plus, Shakespeare, who's kind of important as far as the canon goes...)",
    "You read a play a week and then you go to lecture and Manley makes you understand why they are gloriously good, if you didn't understand that before. You'll leave with a much-improved ability to understand and discuss Shakespeare.",
    "Comedies and Romances is a comprehensive survey of Shakespeare's more comedic works. The readings are great but can be difficult if you've had no prior experience reading Shakespeare. The lectures assume that you know some amount of poetic technique, so make sure that you've glossed over basic poetic devices or that you've found a TF (like Daniel Jump) whowill explain those devices to you when they come up in section. This course will give you new respect for Shakespeare's comedies (which are sometimes seen as less important or challenging than his tragedies) and for the English language. You'll need a dictionary next to you when you're writing your papers, but I think that this is a good class to take, particularly for English majors.",
    "It's a really good course. Manley is a great lecturer.",
    "It is a good standard survey course.",
    "This is a great overview course. You read one play a week, and I loved it a lot, but you move quickly. It's a bad course if you don't read the plays (duh) but I kept up and loved it.",
    "Recommended for English majors seeking a very easy pre-1800 credit.",
    "Not the best pre-1800 req.",
    "Yes- I would definitely recommend this class if you are remotely interested in Shakespeare. You must do the reading to actually get something valuable from this class.",
    "This is a fun survey class for anyone interested in Shakespeare. You get to read a lot of well-known plays as well as some more obscure ones, and spending a week on each lets you get a bit deeper into them than many survey courses allow. You can write your papers on just about anything you find interesting, and for exams you basically just need to understand the plot, characters, and major themes. You do have to put a fair amount of effort into papers and things, but the class is structured in a way that it's not a big deal if you get a little behind on reading, which is nice. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get a bit more experience with Shakespeare."
