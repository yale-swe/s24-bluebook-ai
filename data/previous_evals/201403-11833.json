   "comments": [
    "Interesting topics, but slow going if you have a background in evolutionary biology\/primatology at all. Very focused towards people who have never studied this stuff, or at least not since high school. While I learned new things, I also re-heard a lot of things I already knew. There isn't a ton of work (a couple of taxonomy quizzes, short essays, 1 term paper). Overall, pretty fun, but very much a review if you have background in these areas.",
    "A fantastic course that gives students an extensive look into the world of primatology. Well taught and incredibly interesting. I would highly recomend",
    "This was a good, introductory-level course. I thought it was enjoyable, and as someone unfamiliar with anthropology, I found it quite accessible. I do think that many of the lectures could have gone into more detail; it seemed that often we stayed at a fairly surface-level. There was not very much work for this course.",
    "ANTH 182 is a good class if you are interested in primates or learning about ecological and evolutionary anthropology\/biology on a very fundamental level. The professor is very supportive and very passionate about the material. It is a relatively easy class and the independent research and term paper is very rewarding as It allows you to delve into a specific topic that you are passionate about. While lecture could sometimes be dry or repetitive, and the readings were a little dense, the class overall is a very good introductory anthropology class.",
    "It is a very good beginning class if one is interested in primatology. I will definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Professor Fernandez-Duque is great - he really cares about teaching, he's passionate about his subject, and he starts every class with a 5 minute meditation. It was a good intro to primatology, both for general info on primates and on study methods in the field. There wasn't too much work (although start on the term paper early, as he encourages you to do). I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Don't take this class if you have already taken some EEB or primate biology classes. The review of basic evolutionary bio that gets repetitive.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students (and have actually done so).",
    "The professor is really chill, and we got to meditate for the first five minutes of class every day. That was great. The workload is also pretty light. But on the flipside, grading could be a little ridiculous. Each spelling\/grammar mistake you make corresponds to a one point drop in your overall grade for the course, so those can add up quickly if you don't proofread obsessively.",
    "I do not think I would recommend this course unless you are very interested in the content of the course.",
    "You should take ANTH 182 only if you are really interested in primates and you have not taken and intro biology\/anthropology class before.",
    "Thorough and fun introduction to primate ecology. Talks about primate taxonomy, primate social behaviours (mating, distribution, child-rearing, etc.), and current research methods. The teacher is fantastic. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Would recommend to freshmen and sophomores - good help on writing college papers. For upperclassmen it was a little bit basic and too structured for writing."
