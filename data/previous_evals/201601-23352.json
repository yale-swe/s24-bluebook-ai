    "Professor Kotchen is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and guided the discussions so that they were focused and meaningful. The small class size and ability to have structured class discussion was very conducive to gaining an in depth understanding of the subject matter. Being able to meet with the instructor and the Teaching Fellow before our weekly presentations was very helpful and I feel that I was able to enhance my presentation skills.",
    "The course format is unique. The papers and topics were very interesting\/relevant for environmental management.",
    "I loved the course's structure and students' responsibility.",
    "The seminar was very free flowing and forced people to think critically and creatively about contemporary issues.",
    "When students were actively engaged and we had meaningful conversations",
    "The format of the class worked really well. I enjoyed the discussion aspect and the opportunity to interact with the presenters and other students.",
    "The readings were great.",
    "I like the style of the course -- student presentations, reading responses, then 3 hours for discussion facilitated by Professor Kotchen. Having the time to really dig into some hard questions."

   "comments": [
    "I think there maybe could have been more variation in presentations ad assignments.",
    "I would have liked for Professor Kotchen to structure more time for lecturing as part of this class. Since the class was entirely student presentation based, some presentations were more or less engaging and it was sometimes hard to sit through a full 3 hours of presentations each week. One suggestion would be for the discussions of each paper to be shorter and then Professor Kotchen could spend 30 minutes at the end of each class tying the concepts together or explaining the technical aspects of a paper.",
    "I would appreciate two or three 15-minute lectures related to economists' methodology in general. This could include statistical tests, experimental design, and other topics in research methodology. Separately, I feel like \"Green Markets\" is a catchy title but doesn't have a meaning beyond Kotchen's 2006 paper. \"Private Provision of Public Goods\" and \"Voluntary and Information Based Approaches to Environmental Management\" are more specific but not exactly inspiring. How about Consumer and Corporate Environmental Behavior or something like that?",
    "Would be better if it met twice a week for shorter periods of time.",
    "I would have liked to move beyond the articles more and apply the concepts more to real-life situations or how we can use this information to guide our decisions as environmental managers. Wish there had been something other than non-scientific peer reviewed articles for reading.",
    "Really wish there had been more context and instruction from the professor."
