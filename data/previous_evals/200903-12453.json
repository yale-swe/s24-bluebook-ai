    "Good class to read the classics of IR and to view some other classics of political philosophy from an IR perspective. A lot of the reading is rather dry, however, so watch out if you don't like to read political theory. The beginning readings are pretty classic and so it's interesting to see them (namely Hobbes and Machiavelli) from an IR perspective. The middle readings get a bit tedious (Schelling, von Clausewitz, Schumpeter), but the stuff you read at the end is much more modern and very accessible, especially the professor's own work. I would recommend coming into the class with some background knowledge of modern IR history - it would have been extremely helpful taking this class alongside Gaddis' Cold War class or something. The discussions weren't always as structured or lively as I would've hoped, but you do get to talk about whatever you found interesting from the readings, and Russett is very nice, so shop it and see.",
    "Do it! It may seem rough at the beginning, but the class warms on you a lot, it's fun, and not too much work. If you have any interest at all, shop it!",
    "Yes, if they are interested in studying early political theory in depth.",
    "If you are okay with doing good readings but sitting through bad discussions, I'd recommend it. If you don't like reading the rely mostly on discussion for note taking, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Ultimately to succeed on exams, you MUST do the readings at some point. But if you do do the readings, this course is not going to try to trick you. Overall though, I can't recommend this course truly. The plus is that this is a seminar so you get to know some students pretty well.",
    "I would recommend it if you are really interested in the texts. There is a lot of reading involved, and if you don't actually do it - and sparknotes doesn't really cut it here - then you'll hate the class, and will have to sit for two hours with nothing to say. So if lots of reading and dense political theory aren't your thing, you'll probably find this tough. The small class setting is great though, you can always get into the discussion.",
    "I am glad I took this course. I think the best part of the class was getting to know the other people in the seminar. The readings were great as well. I was already familiar with IR but I learned a lot in this class. It's sort of beginner to intermediate level reading.Prof. Russett is kind of ridiculously prolific. SSCI rates him as the second most cited IR scholar of the twentieth century. So if you're into that sort of thing, dude omg you should totally take this course.Heis very dry. At first I wasn't sure whether he was really pretentious or just reserved. As it turns out, he is the type of professor that you really want to have dinner with... a very warm fellow who is not afraid to laugh when someone says something funny or ridiculously politically incorrect during seminar. He has probably worked for the CIA. And above all else, he is a master at leaning back in his chair. He never fell over. Not even once.So anyways. Although knowledgeable, it shows that Russett has spent far more time thinking than teaching seminars. Although he always has insights, his ability to help the students reach those conclusions on their own by inciting great discussions is sorely lacking. The tests were sometimes reasonable (which theorist would you like to have a beer with?), other times long and tedious."
