   "comments": [
    "Yes. I believe this class will be very helpful for the students who're interested in sensory systems and the studies related to computational neuroscience.Also, the discussion based class can help us to strength our divergent thinking, analytic skills and communication skills.",
    "This course felt a lot like a journal club with a lot of material. It would be GREAT preparation for the style of qualifying exams in the INP. The success of the course depends on not only the instructors input, but also on the students preparedness each week, so don't take it if you aren't wiling to devote time to careful reading. Otherwise there is always the risk of the presenters talking at you for a long time or the discussion floundering. The best weeks were when we were all excited about the topic.",
    "This class was a fun opportunity to read about very classic papers on neuroethology. I would also say it is a unique opportunity to think about biological systems in terms of how they may have developed to solve different problems. I would totally recommend this class to a fellow student."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, it did.This course helped me understand the areas that I wasn't familiar with before. The information that I obtained from this class is inspiring and potentially very valuable for my future research and studies.",
    "This course was a very cool look at how neural systems solve a very diverse set of problems, often by converging mechanisms. In the process, we discovered that a lot of the foundations of the work we are engaged in came from discoveries in other animal systems that were not necessarily investigated to inform human neurobiology, but turn out to have been monumentally useful advances. This definitely broadened my knowledge of the history of neuroscience. This course improved my ability to read and comment on original work outside of my immediate area of interest.",
    "I took this class because I thought the topic was really interesting. My research has absolutely zero to do with the topics covered in the class. But, I think taking this class has given me a new way to think about neuroscience. We typically do not think about things in terms of \"how different systems solve different problems\" when it comes to things like Pavlovian conditioning. However, perhaps there is reason to ask how different systems are able to associate stimuli with rewards. Actually, yeah, it probably is important to ask these things..."
