    "I recommend it to anyone, even if your major is completely unrelated.",
    "Much as it pains me to say this, having spent the last semester in this course, take Kapustin's. Even if you're set on taking Classics this semester to get it out of the way, if you don't get into Kapustin's, consider waiting for his fall section. The syllabus is better organized and Kapustin's just a ton of fun as a seminar leader. Because of these factors, Kapustin's also draws a lot of the students who make for good in-class discussions.It's not that Donahue's is bad -- the range of readings means you get exposure, albeit limited exposure, to a lot of topics that don't often make their way into EPE seminars (e.g. feminism and anarchy), and the last four weeks on capitalism were excellent. But he talks a lot, not so much to add new angles on a question as to restate what's already been said, but with different wording.(Also, if you've done DS, be warned that the first eight weeks are pretty much like a fast-forward replay of DS H\/P)",
    "I'd recommend this class if you are relatively new to the department, as I was. I can't speak for EP&E majors, but I think it's a requirement for them anyway. In any case, it was a great fifth class, not too much work and enjoyable.",
    "It is a great seminar, the amount of readings is good, and get a basic understanding of ethics and politics.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class with Professor Donahue. I was overwhelmed by the academic terminology at first, but he takes care to diagram it on the chalkboard at the beginning of every session. I just wish there'd been more time reserved for genuine discussion, as opposed to us hazarding thought-provoking questions from the professor. Everything considered, I'd definitely recommend this section since Prof. Donahue is very approachable, has this dry sense of humor, and knows just how to connect the disciplines. I really liked, for example, how he brought anarchism into the syllabus. Really a great and mind-opening experience!"
