   "comments": [
    "It was a lot of works like Moby Dick and Song of Myself that I had never read before, and I loved that.",
    "I developed my critical reading and thinking in this course. I also improved my writing through various writing activities and essays. I also was introduced to some of the critical works of American literature and had the opportunity to discuss them individually and in conjunction to each other.",
    "I learned how to be a better essay writer and how to appreciate literary sources. I feel incredibly grateful for the opportunity to gain these skills.",
    "This course taught me a great deal on American literature and its historical background. Through this course, I had the amazing opportunity to discover great American texts alongside a really amazing class and professor. I believe that, through the various writing assignments of this course, I was able to work on and improve my focus and organization in writing. Although the course involved a great deal of reading (especially when it comes to Moby-Dick), the selection of texts was very conducive towards interesting and insightful discussions. I learned a great deal from my classmates throughout the course, and I really appreciated the level of complexity and depth of our discussions.",
    "An appreciation for American literature, an understanding of a diverse range of works",
    "In this course, I confronted a vast swath of styles and topics from American Literature. I developed skills in analysis and interpretation of text, having tackled the behemoth Moby Dick, the concise yet cryptic writings of John Ashbery and everything in between. Most importantly, this course introduced me to poetry in a way that felt accessible and intuitive. The ability to interpret poetry has always eluded me. However, after taking this course I feel comfortable with poetry and even plan on taking a poetry course this coming semester!",
    "I tend to think that, in general, this question is a bit of a better fit for natural science or social science courses than for humanities classes, because even though I very much liked my English 127 experience, I'm not sure that I developed any new skills during the course. I guess I would say that, overall, I probably got a bit better at close reading and a bit better at writing analytical essays. The knowledge I gleaned was also relatively straightforward: I learned a fair amount about each of the books we read during this class. Perhaps this is a mind-numbingly banal answer, but it's the truth. As for insights, I would say that is where Professor Goldsby demonstrated the greatest strengths. It would be hard for me to pinpoint or classify the revamped understanding of narrative and its interplay with language that I gleaned from our class discussions, but as all good English teachers do, Professor Goldsby pushed her students (or at least me) to reconsider, over and over again, how authors create certain experiences for their readers, and I certainly benefited from this exercise over the course of my time in English 127."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Discussion was generally really great, and Goldsby is really great as well. The readings were good (though we spent way too long on House of Mirth, which really isn't that great of a book in my opinion). I didn't necessarily feel like my writing improved very much though, with really only two essays and then some smaller stuff that we weren't encouraged to spend a super long time on.",
    "This course had an incredible reading list, and I would have liked to have spent a little more time on each author we read. I also would have been interested to see some drama in this class as we mainly focused on prose and poetry. Overall I would change very little about this course; it is very well organized and taught.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Goldsby leads a great class discussion and we read some really wonderful works. Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "Its strength lies in its selection of texts. I believe that each one of the texts offered me a glimpse into American literature through a completely unique lens. Also, as this course is generally seminar-based, the discussions thrived on the connections between texts and the historical context of these texts. One weakness may be the pacing of the course. During the middle of the semester, we needed to read a lot of Moby-Dick in a short period of time, while near the end, the workload eased out due to shorter texts.",
    "Strengths: fantastic reading list",
    "Everything about this course is strong. The books, the assignments, and the professor are all fantastic. This is a near perfect class and I had a great time taking it this semester!",
    "Frankly, there aren't really any structural problems with this course; either a student enjoys the books that she reads and her professor's style, and thus enjoys English 127, or she does not. There's not that much more to it. Personally, I would have chosen different books than some of the ones we read in my section of the course, but I cannot extrapolate from my personal taste to a grand criticism of the class. As for Professor Goldsby, she was mostly great, and, furthermore, I'm pretty sure that this is not the question in which we're meant to evaluate our professors. If you (whoever you are) are interested in my suggestions for some reading list alterations for the particular version of English 127 that I took, here are some: - PLEASE keep \"Bloodchild.\" It's great. - Feel free to not read the entire John Ashbery book, but definitely keep the title poem. - Ditch the one-living-author rule. It's dumb. Include some Toni Morrisson, or Philip Roth, or Junot Daz, or somebody else who is still alive. - Please include \"The Great Gatsby.\" I'm not sure what its current reputation is in the academy, but to many people it remains the quintessential American novel, and its themes dovetail pretty well with those of \"The House of Mirth\" and \"Their Eyes Were Watching G-d.\" - Include a little less Whitman, and a little more Dickinson. It's good for the soul."

    "Take it with Goldsby! She is just so cool and when she speaks about anything--literature, movies, cities--she elevates it to a whole new level. Love that woman.",
    "I'd recommend it. Great course on american lit with great discussions. The course with Goldsby is really a course on African American\/Queer lit, which means you focus on readings that are famous but that you might not have gotten in other courses in high school.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The syllabus is challenging and very interesting. The class discussions were insightful, and I feel liked I learned a lot from both my professor and my classmates.",
    "Yes. If you want to read some amazing novels, short stories, essays, and poetry and talk about them with peers and a passionate, dedicated professor, then take this course! I recommend meeting with Prof. Goldsby during office hours as she is committed to helping students improve as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Professor Goldsby. You will learn a great deal of information from sources you would not expect. Professor Goldsby kept discussions interesting and fluid. I really enjoyed our seminar discussions, as they definitely improved my ability to make points and back them up with textual evidence. In addition, there was a solid research component to this course (such as the Walt Whitman and Dickinson Archives), which I really appreciated. These assignments offered us great context into the authors' texts and stories.",
    "Yes! Professor Goldsby is wonderful, kind, attentive and a great facilitator of discussion. This class had superb enrichment perks like going to the Beineke and going to an excursion at the MET in New York City.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It serves as a great introduction to the many forms of American Literature. Jacqueline Goldsby is a fantastic professor who helps her students navigate the readings with ease. There is little else to say besides that everyone should take this class.",
    "Don't take this course if you just need a writing or HU credit and want something that seems banal and easy. If you take the class, be prepared to speak in class a lot, and to spend a lot of time listening to other people. Maybe that's just what an English seminar, is, but Professor Goldsby sometimes pushes her students to find new insights during class without explaining exactly what she's looking for, which simply results in a lot of gobbledygook from the students. Nonetheless, the books are mostly pretty good; Professor Goldsby is warm, passionate, and very knowledgeable about the subject matter; and you will probably learn something valuable about writing and reading from taking this course. So yes, overall, I would recommend this class."
