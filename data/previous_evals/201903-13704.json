   "comments": [
    "The strength of this class is that I can now reference a wide range of mechanisms and their uses. Although the mechanisms themselves were interesting, they were not always presented in an engaging way. Once we started working on the assignments, much of class time was spent reviewing each other's work. I don't think that this was the best use of class time. We received grades and comments on everything we had worked on throughout the semester during the last week of classes. I think it would be beneficial if formal grades and comments were instead given after each assignment."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah definitely. Course was super chill. Basically we would just sit there and Prof. Dollar would click through a powerpoint with a bunch of mechanism GIFs in it. Assignments were pretty easy for the most part, though the final project was fairly involved. All the homework was super fun though, cause it was basically just building cool mechanisms. Didn't receive any feedback until the last day of classes tho, which was sorta annoying.",
    "Unlike most other engineering classes, you are not held accountable for the material presented in class. Instead, the intention is that you gain exposure to the mechanisms that we discuss. As a result, there is virtually no weekly work associated with this course. That being said, be prepared to work hard on all three assignments. The final is an opportunity to do your own mini independent robotics research project. If that content and rhythm sound interesting to you, then you should take the class.",
    "Yes. Project experience and literature study are useful."
