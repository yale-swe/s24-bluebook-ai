   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend DS Philosophy for the individual who wants to begin to understand the basic philosophical works of the West - pay particular attention to Plato, Aristotle and Augustine!",
    "DS Philosophy is a great introductory course to college philosophy. Learning the foundation of western philosophy will prove to give you great help, both in school work and in life, after you finish.",
    "DS Philosophy is another course I enjoyed. The philosophy lectures are perhaps the most helpful, as they always break down the important arguments of each text to make them very understandable. Section also helps to do this, though it helps to get dynamic and interesting professor, as I found out by sitting in on Della Rocca's section one day. Professor Kaplan isn't bad though, just that discussion can get a little boring sometimes, although I really enjoyed his dry sense of humor very much. He's still very helpful at breaking down arguments during section and answering questions and giving the context of each argument and their significance. His paper feedback was a little lackluster.",
    "I think the course is great for anyone who has no prior experience with philosophy. It gives you a good survey of major philosophers and helps you learn to read critically.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Directed Studies. The course as a whole is amazing! For philosophy the reading is somewhat harder than in the other classes but there is less of it so it balances out. Without DS I would never have read this volume of philosophy, and I certainly would not have gotten this much out of it, and I am so glad that I did!",
    "If you are a competitive, practiced debater with an aptitude for philosophy and argumentation, you might enjoy this section. If you prefer concerted, collaboration conversation about a text, however, you would probably fare better elsewhere. Section dynamic here is one more of domination than collaboration, where less insistent voices are easily buried. That said, one can still learn here, as much as anyone can learn at 9:00 AM on a Monday or Wednesday. Professor Kaplan, while perhaps a little too light-handed on the direction of discussion, is an understanding professor and a sympathetic reader of papers.",
    "Probably the least satisfying of the three DS courses. Material was interesting enough, but it seemed like most of the class was just focused on internalizing and understanding the texts, with little time for independent thought. But that may just be the nature of an intro philosophy class.",
    "I had never studied philosophy before taking DS, and it proved to be a rewarding experience. Part of the fun in DS is that you read books you might never pick up otherwise. In addition, you get to study things that are on your list of books you ought to read. Don't let the volume of reading or number of papers put you off DS, if you have any desire to do it, at least apply and try it for shopping period. Particularly useful was the extensive coverage of Plato and Aristotle (about 1 month each).",
    "DS Philosophy is a great compilation of Western philosophers. Throughout the semester you assess each's particular argument, and as finals role around, you go through intensive comparisons and contrasts among the ideologies which brings everything together. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "This course takes you through the early Western Philosophers from Plato up to Aquinas. The course moves quickly sometimes covering a philosopher a week and includes three papers, but the work pays off because it gives you a really good understanding of the beginnings of the Western Philosophical tradition. What is unique about this course and what distinguishes it from intro philosophy courses is that you learn the philosophy through small class discussion that are then supplemented by once a week lectures. I recommend this course to anyone interested in studying Western thought in any discipline, even if you have no intention of going on to study more of Western philosophy. I went into the course as someone primarily interested in the literature portion of Directed Studies but emerged with an interest in philosophy as well.",
    "ds philosophy is naturally difficult. kaplan is a tough grader but accepts improvement. class is sometimes dry.",
    "I would summarize DS Philosophy as a great introductory philosophy course. I would recommend it to anyone interested in getting a solid foundational knowledge of earlier philosophers.",
    "A crash course in the history of Western Philosophy from Plato to Aquinas. I would absolutely recommend the class for any major, because it provides such a solid grounding in both political and ontological thinking throughout history. Be ready to handle a lot of reading, but you'll get a lot out of the class."
