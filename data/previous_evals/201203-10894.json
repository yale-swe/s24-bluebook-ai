    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the material.",
    "\"Early Modern Spain\" is a perfect introduction for graduate students looking to gain a well-rounded understanding of the Iberian peninsula in the period between the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the eighteenth century. I would absolutely recommend it to any graduate student interested in European or Latin American topics.",
    "Survey of readings on a wide variety of Early Modern topics from politics to religion to art. Some discussion of New World, though mostly peninsular. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Early Modern or Spanish history.",
    "I would summarize HIST 565 as very much a seminar-style discussion of medieval spain. I thought it was very helpful to have students presenting every week and encouraged collaboration, as well interaction between students during the class itself. At times it felt as if everyone was simply getting together to discuss an historical issue, rather than meeting for class.",
    "Yes! Take it if you want to learn more about the Atlantic system or Europe as a whole! A great course with a superb professor!",
    "I would recommend (and have recommended) this course to fellow students. It offers a great opportunity to familiarize oneself with a range of questions and issues about early modern Spain, and the course structure encourages depth and breadth of study.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "I work on medieval history, but this course offered a wonderful opportunity to deepen my knowledge of early modern history and to think about continuities and changes from the medieval period.",
    "We engaged with a variety of approaches to writing and thinking about history across a diverse array of topics. This was very helpful for reflecting upon my own approach to the writing of history as well as how I might teach my own course focusing on Counter-Reformation Spain or Early Modern Europe more generally. The final research project for this class enabled me to engage with materials that do not directly relate to my own area of research, but nevertheless allowed me to think and work with sources that are not dissimilar in scope and content. As such, it was very helpful for my research.",
    "I had close to basic knowledge of the subject and I thought that after taking it Professor Eire definitely deepened my knowledge of the coursework substantially!",
    "I knew very little about Early Modern Spain, so this was helpful in rounding out my knowledge."
