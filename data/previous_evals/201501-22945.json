    "ART 324 is an oil painting class that focuses on the techniques of painters. I liked how this class was different from usual art classes because it approached painting not from the narrative concept, but from the support and technique of the painting. I definitely believe understanding and consciously choosing the type of support and media that a painter uses makes her a better artist. The class if for four hours on a Friday, though. I do wish we spent more time painting though; perhaps splitting the course into two 2-hour classes each week would allow students to learn about techniques and then paint. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to use oil paints!",
    "I would recommend it for people who are into art and willing to work. It's not the worlds hardest class, but it definitely took time and I put in quite a bit of work. Of course, you will also get a lot back from the work you do. Also, people should be aware that it is mostly oil paint, not acrylic.",
    "This is my favorite non major related class I have taken at Yale (and probably 2nd favorite overall). This class is a really fun mix of studio time, museum time, and what Mark calls \"cooking\" demos where you learn about things like how paint is made and how to stretch a canvas. The class does involve less painting than a typical painting class as there is a focus on historical techniques as well. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who has ever wanted to paint or learn about painting techniques, or if you just want to try something different. Mark, the instructor is also great.",
    "this course, as it says on its syllabus, is not taught by an artist. it is an art class in that it provides art materials for one to explore. it is not, however, an art class in it's content or approach. this course taught me the history and techniques of oil paint, but did not dive deep into my application of it. If you approach this class with that understanding, then you will enjoy it immensely. you will get an experience that no other art or art history class could provide. you learn about preservation and painting history through a unique syllabus of studio visits, gallery visits, and painting exercises. If you are an artist, you might at times get frustrated by the approach that the instructor takes when discussing art, and you might not get the artistic feedback of other art classes, but you will learn history and technique. mark is great, and if you know what you're signing up for, then you'll enjoy your fridays.",
    "If you are interested in painting, this is definitely a core course for you. You will learn the stuff you may never expect before, an interesting course!",
    "This was a chance to really learn about the foundation of painting, which is great for anyone interesting in painting and the actual techniques that painters use to create paint, manipulate paint, stretch and prime canvas to create their art. Mark is a great professor to work with, having 4 hours of studio time is great (although, keep in mind, you're going to miss some events because it's on Friday). But I think missing events is worth it for the class. Expect to spent a lot of time out of class completing work (as most art classes) and to learn independence as a student. Ask Mark questions and don't be afraid to ask for help!",
    "I recommend this class."
