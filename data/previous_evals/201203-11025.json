    "A relatively easy and interesting class to learn about a major part of the cell that is rarely discussed in other biochemical\/biophys classes.",
    "Yes this is highly recommended, in order to gain a great insight into membranes and membrane proteins.",
    "It was a relatively laid back class, but I learned a lot and it made you think. I would definitely recommend it to another person.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, even if they did not feel they had a strong background in the subject of biological membranes. Don and Thomas did an excellent job presenting both the breadth and depth of material in the field with a good focus on both the theoretical and practical implications, making a complex subject accessible and engaging.",
    "I would tell them that it is a great class for a great class for anyone interested in membranes, or whose research deals with membranes and that it was taught by two great professors. I would absolutely recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "I would reccomend this class. I learned a ton about membranes.",
    "Very easy, quite informative. Only take it if you're genuinely interested in the material.",
    "I'd say that this course integrates different kind of fields. Even if it is true that the main focus in biological membranes you end up discovering that membranes are pretty much involved somehow in many biological processes. Despite their background or future research field, I'd say that everyone can learn useful things from this course."

   "comments": [
    "I knew nothing about membranes before this class. So it deepened my perspective on them immensely. It didn't really affect my thesis work.",
    "I learned a lot concerning membranes that I did not know. Especially if I study membrane proteins in the future, the material I learned will be critical.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about a topic I was not previously familiar with. I don't know how much it will be relevant to my thesis research but I and now more prepared to approach research questions in this area.",
    "As I have not yet chosen my lab I am unsure how this class will contribute to my research. However, if I do not joining a membranes lab, I plan on joining a lab where I will do some work with membranes and thus, this class will be very helpful.",
    "Membranes aren't a focus of my research but they are so important to all of biology that learning about them is still important."
