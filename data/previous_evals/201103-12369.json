    "yes. this was a very interesting class. although some days material seems very dense, it gives you a lot to think about in terms of creating work and art theory in general. the workload is light, but if you do the readings carefully the class can be really eye opening because jeffrey is so knowledgeable.",
    "You probably won't take this class if you aren't an art major, and you basically have to take it if you are an art major. BUT, whatever you are, Junior Seminar is an awesome way to become a more incisive thinker about art!",
    "I would highly recommend it to art majors, and even non-art majors who want to understand why art is important on a deeper level.",
    "If you are an artist, take this class!",
    "Structure of class: read art theory outside of class, then unpack those theories in class.",
    "The Junior Art Seminar is a really great way to get an informed and academic understanding of some of the key concepts in art theory and philosophy (mostly from the end of the 19th century to today; Buchloh, Greenberg, Burger, Adorno, and many others). Jeffrey is very well-read and can explain things that seem very complicated at first in a way that makes it easier to understand. The class takes place only on Fridays, which was sometimes difficult at the end of a long week. But despite the length of the class at this time the conversations almost always held my interest. If you're an Art Major you don't have much of a choice about taking this, but if you weren't, I still think it'd be a great class to take.",
    "Having never taken an art theory course before, I can honestly say I was baffled by the readings we had to do in this class. If you're someone like me, someone who knows zero about art theory or art history or contemporary artists, you will find keeping up with this class very difficult. But if you're considering taking the class, it's probably cause you've got to. So the good news is: all your art major friends are in it, the professor is seriously funny and endearing and will help you if you so ask, and it only meets once a week. So I'd take it again.",
    "yes. it is highly enlightening of the thinking behind the contemporary art world. expect lots of dull reading and the teacher to explain it to you during class. be ready to participate in weekly round table discussions. it would hurt to be shy.",
    "If you considering this course, you probably have to take to as an Art or Computing and the Arts major. If you aren't one of those majors, and you like throwing around phrases like \"epistemological consequences\", this class might be for you!"
