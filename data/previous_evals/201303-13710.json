   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I care a great deal about the topic of social determinants of health, but was somewhat disappointed with the course. I did very much enjoy the guest speakers who came in to talk about their areas of expertise, but I felt that the course was somewhat disjointed. I think it would have been better if there was a stronger structure to the course. I did like the debates because they required you to think critically about current topics.",
    "The assignments were busy work and didn't really teach much about the social and behavioral context of health. There could be much more creative ways to teach students how to analyze what is reported in the media -- i.e. make it a discussion in section rather than a 5 page paper. Also the final literature review didn't add anything to my knowledge or understanding. By having it be related to a topic of our personal health improvement project, i ended up writing about a topic i wasn't interested in. Finally, while i think the personal health improvement project was a good idea it should have been assessed over the whole semester rather than a 25 day period. If the final project had been an evaluation of the personal health improvement project i think it would have been more interesting and informative.",
    "The strengths are the topic choices. Because they differ so much week to week, it seemed that everyone had a week that they particularly enjoyed, if they didn't enjoy every week.",
    "very good components outside the lecture to complement the material; the debates and each writing assignment prompted a different way to evaluate, learn the material",
    "I think the weakness was the final paper. I felt that the paper should be closer to around 10 pages. Since it was around 15 pages I had to add a lot of filler that took away from the caliber of my writing. I enjoy SBS... not a big fan of writing long papers.",
    "Strengths: Marney was engaging and adapted to the needs and wants of the class.Weaknesses: Sometimes the topics were so broad that we didn't actually cover substantial or in-depth material. Focusing on a few aspects on a topic and going in depth on these issues would feel more useful than just touching on an array of aspects.",
    "As an overview course, I feel some of the topics were too narrowly focused at the expense of breadth.I think many of the arguments made throughout the course were very one-sided and did not encompass the full range of public health solutions to social and behavioral problems.I found it inappropriate, and at times, insulting, when disparaging comments, examples, and videos against certain political affiliations inside the classroom were used as part of the lesson plan.",
    "I felt that overall the course was very informative and almost every lecture was interesting. I definitely learned a lot from the class topics.However, I also feel it is necessary to formally complain against the final assignment for the course. Although I liked the personal improvement project assignment as a way to learn about ourselves and the overall process of behavior change, the final literature review was extraordinarily ill-conceived.Although I feel that the intention of the paper was good, it ended up being a very confusing assignment in which our final goal was murky. Instead of being a research paper or a literature review, the paper assignment took on a form of an awkward mix of the two, leaving students with a very unclear image of what to actually research.In addition, by forcing the students to pick a topic that fit with their personal improvement projects, the breadth of possible topics was severely limited. I know that personally, I had absolutely no passion for the topic of my paper which probably limited my interest in doing research and writing. Perhaps it would be better if students could pick from a wide variety of topics.Although it is a little presumptive to say this, at the end of the day, the final paper is almost guaranteed to be about stress management, increasing sleep schedules, increasing exercise, or improving nutrition since those are the topics that students would overwhelmingly choose for their personal improvement projects.I greatly enjoyed the class overall. However, I felt that the final paper taught me nothing, and actually made me less interested in my topic.Moving forward, a better assignment would be a research paper evaluating a specific (or a set) of behavior modification interventions in which students had the ability to choose from any topic that related to the course. If a literature review is still desired, then it should be solely a literature review, again that would give students the choice of topic.",
    "Good overview of topics, sometimes a little disorganised",
    "I didnt think the course assignments were very helpful in learning the material, especially the lit review. But I enjoyed going to lecture, and Marney is a good instructor",
    "Fantastic course. Very interesting material. Great guest speakers.The readings were not always helpful and there wasn't a lot of incentive to read them for class. We could have used more instruction for the final paper. Somewhat redundant for someone with a psychology\/social science background.",
    "Final paper could have been 10 pages - 15 was excessive.",
    "The strength of the course is that it gives a wide overview of different topics. At the same time it prevents from going more in detail in any of these topics which could represent a weakness.",
    "strengths- Teaches about an area I usually do not get to learn about in my field.weaknesses- The debate format did not help me to understand material. Discussion seemed irrelevant.",
    "I like the instructor's presentations. They were definitely engaging. I also liked the fact that she would bring different experts to present and discuss an array of public health issues. This course exposed me to different arenas of social and behavioral science. I do, however, feel the lectures should be less than 2 hours.",
    "The final paper seemed to not be useful. I did not find the assignment to be useful for further understanding social and behavioral health.",
    "I felt that this course was more appropriate for undergrad freshmen not MPH students. I know this is an introductory class to SBS and there are a lot of topics in SBS, but it was way too basic. The best part of this course were the discussion sections where we had the opportunity to discuss these topics. The debates turned out to be a good learning experience (way better than any of the papers). The media analysis and self improvement project again both made me feel like I was doing undergrad intro to psychology work, not Yale grad level work. The course wasn't difficult, just a lot of busy work.",
    "Great lectures, but the class topic is so broad that we only got to the surface level of many topics. However, the final paper seemed out of the scope of the class. The length minimum was quite long compared to what we had done during the rest of the course and I didn't feel super prepared to write the paper. Many people seemed to struggle with it.",
    "Strengths: I really liked the diversity of topics that were covered in the class. GREAT speakers and great papers assigned. And I liked the assignments, especially the Media Analysis. The Facebook page was awesome!! I loved being able to read cool links and articles related to things we discussed in class. A great use of social media\/the changing landscape of the American classroom.Weaknesses: I really love how self-disclosing the professor is, but sometimes it's a bit TMI",
    "This course was very basic, overly broad, and I didn't get much out of it. Lectures felt like a rambling tour of what the professor was interested in, and her opinions on those topics, rather than a rigorous treatment of a topic. The assignments felt like high school level.",
    "This course was fun and interesting. I didn't learn a whole lot of new material, but the course did expand upon topics that I have always been interested in learning more about. Some of the guest speakers were really good- I especially enjoyed the lectures about obesity among school aged children and breastfeeding.",
    "The course is great. Sometimes the Facebook portion gets a little excessive (announcements made first on Facebook group, and she asks us to \"like\" things or respond to them). The Facebook group is nice, it helps us learn about what our peers thinks and feel strongly about.Great course over all, and she really try to make it meaningful.",
    "Not a great foundation to SBS and was pretty random as far as topics addressed. The guest lecturers were interesting, but there wasn't any structure to the class so it was difficult to connect the information we learned each week. Readings weren't really necessary for discussion and assignments seemed to be more tedious than educational.",
    "I really enjoyed sitting in on these class lectures, but I feel as if I didn't take away as much of a background on social and and behavioral health as I wanted to. Sections were great, but I wish there were more lectures to cover more topics.",
    "Great! No need for blog quizzes, though, we are all adults.",
    "Some of the topics we covered in lecture were very interesting. I particularly liked the guest speakers. However, discussion section was not helpful.",
    "I think the class was interesting, but the assignments were not always clear. I was also very frustrated the the final paper was due during the last week of classes. Since it was the final for the class it only seems fair that it be due during finals week. I felt that I could not do my best work or put in enough time because the paper was rather long and due during regular classes, when other classes still had regular assignments as well.",
    "I thought that the work required for this class really augmented the material covered in lecture. I appreciated that assignments were not busy work. I also found section to be a really useful component of this course. I got a lot out of interacting with my fellow students in a small-group setting, and I liked that the debates that forced us to research concepts in more detail. I think that the biggest weakness of the course was that every concept covered was so broad that we never really got details or insight, but I think it would be hard to correct this given the survey nature of the course.",
    "-too many guest lectures (although all interesting topics, found it disjointed and sometimes felt more like attending a series of seminars rather than core course)--e.g. i liked both violence lectures but didn't think we needed two, especially when each other topic got one-good powerpoints\/lectures by Marney-debates could be reformulated to be structured discussions by the 4-5 students assigned to that topic, rather than following the rigid debate format-personal health improvement project was fun-could use more information\/time on specific behavior change principles-liked to facebook group-media assessment felt sophomoric",
    "I enjoyed the variety of topics covered and guest speakers in the class, but sometimes wish fewer topics could be covered at a deeper level since having a different topic per class allowed us to only skim the surface of each issue.",
    "It was a very interesting survey of some of the ways that social and behavior aspects of life can affect health. I enjoyed the number of diversity of the guest speakers, and found Prof. White's lectures to be interesting and entertaining. My biggest complaint is, perhaps ironically, about gender differences: this course appeared to focus primarily on women. I understand that women have been an overlook component of public health, but this is not a women's health class. A more equitable division of time, and a fair comparison between the two genders would strengthen this course.",
    "I enjoyed the guest speakers; they brought a specificity and real world relevance to the classroom. The facebook group was also a novel idea, and I think it brought us together more as a class. I didn't find the debates to add that much value; I would have rather had a discussion about the topic\/articles for a given week than go through the formality of a debate. I found myself less engaged when observing the debate. It wasn't my favorite way to engage with the material.",
    "Strengths:Many guest lectures--I LOVED THIS:-gave us the opportunity to meet\/network with many amazing researchers. It enabled some of us to meet and get research opportunities-- we got exposed to so many interesting, different research topicsClass material:-this class was a good overview of general social and behavioral issues.--we touched on many intriguing research topics in the SBS field-- we had a 10 minutes class break after the first half of class--the FB group is a great idea, I really enjoyed (and still enjoy) all the amazing articles!Weaknesses:--we did not really delve\/ go deep into any topic...this class focused on breadth, not depth--the final review paper was honestly one of the most annoying and painful papers I have ever written. The most annoying thing was that the topic for the final review paper had to be connected to our personal improvement project. I do not understand why these topics are connected! This made the research experience more painful, limited, and unappealing. I had no interest in the review project I did because I had no interest in researching my personal improvement topic. Different topics work for different papers, this is very obvious. Marney should of really emphasized the fact that these topics will be connected while presenting the personal improvement project. Also, a review project is the kind of project we should of been working on the whole semester. It was kind of crazy that we got such a huge research project in the last month of class. In the future please allow students to change their project topic so they can thoroughly enjoy and learn from the literature review project.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. It taught me to think about social science in a new way. I have more of an appreciation now.",
    "I liked the topics covered in this course, and I think it gives a good introduction into many different mental and behavioral health considerations. However, at times the course seemed too basic: there was not enough analysis on how these issues impact society. Issues were often discussed at a surface level (i.e. eating disorders are very harmful to society and affect a certain proportion of the population) without highlighting what is being done to improve these efforts. I would have loved to see more efficacy analysis of various interventions, the philosophy\/thought process behind designing interventions for the issues discussed in class, and different ways to adequately handle mental health issues. If that requires cutting down the number of topics covered, I would not mind covering less ground if more depth could be achieved.Additionally, we spoke heavily at the beginning of the semester about how popular media can distort research articles and how caution must be used when evaluating such sources. Yet many lectures featured popular media and news articles to substantiate points made in class about the impact of public health problems. (Ex. CNN articles on models\/eating disorders). Additionally, the conclusions of some lectures focused on the results of 1 or 2 studies (violence in video games lecture comes to mind in particular, with the toy gun and bobo doll studies being the focal point) to make a sweeping conclusion. I would have loved to see a more frank discussion about observational studies, and how to assess their conclusions. I felt at times as if the course was selecting studies to fit an overarching ideology, rather than approaching each subject as a nuanced issue involving many different factors. For example, when we discussed the public health intervention to implement healthy food choices in public schools in Connecticut (guest lecturer), questions about alternate interventions, such as P.E. class programs, were seemingly brushed off. I was disappointed in the lack of exploration done in some of these discussions\/lectures. The class's focus seemed to only be \"raising awareness\" without following through with the consequences of interventions. As public health students, I felt as if most of the class was already well aware of the issues, and may have benefited more from analysis.",
    "This was a great class, the lectures and guest lecturers were great!",
    "Strengths: breadth of topics covered (there was something to appeal to everyone, I left with a good understanding of this field and what it comprises), section discussions were lively, debates were GREATWeakness: breadth of topics covered (some topics were skimmed so lightly we might as well not have covered them at all and focused more on other things)",
    "I had high hopes for the course when we were able to choose a discussion group based on a topic that interested us (relevant to social and behavioral health). However we did not spend any time focused on our particular topic of interest.I thought MUCH more time should have been spent discussion social determinants of health. I felt as though we spent about three classes discussing body image and maybe a quarter of a class talking about socioeconomic and racial disparities.I thought the debates were not well conceived. While they were about public health issues generally (like violence in video games or electronic cigarettes), they framed the questions poorly. For instance, the violence video game debate was framed as \"you either support regulation or you are against regulation.\" However, this is a not a public health debate - it is a political debate. A public health debate is how do we spend resources in a way that would minimize violence. The way they framed the debate sets one side up to use a whole bunch of research (which Marney provides) on the empirical connections between violence and video games. The other side is relegated to either the arguments of \"free speech\" or \"I reject that empirical evidence.\"",
    "I really enjoyed Marney's class. I think the lectures were interesting, and I liked that Marney lined up a good cast of guest lecturers (especially the gentleman from Scotland). I did not enjoy the debates very much, although it was interesting to delve deeper into certain topics in section. The personal health improvement project was a fun challenge for me.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the content of this course and feel it is an integral part of the MPH curriculum. Lectures were great, readings were interesting, debates were fun, and the personal health improvement project and media analysis were informative and worthwhile assignments. That said, I found the final paper to be the most invaluable and worthless assignment I've completed since coming to Yale. Performing a literature review for no larger purpose seems like a complete waste of time. I did not learn anything through the process. I would suggest reevaluating the final assignment and its purpose for future iterations of this course.",
    "Learn a lot of creative ideas about public health. Improve the ability to think critically. Improve oral english ability.",
    "Really enjoyed this class and the topics we covered were thought-provoking",
    "I don't think this course contributed whatsoever to my intellectual growth. This introductory lecture-based course is a requirement for those outside of SBS, even to those with a background in the social sciences- which makes little sense. We only have 2 years to spend at YSPH, and the required courses often detract from the overall educational experience one would expect to gain from Yale University.Dr. White was a wonderful instructor, and the TA's were similarly wonderful, it's just that the course materials and subject matter were all not novel for me- yet I was still required to enroll.",
    "This course is a very strong introduction to health behaviors, with wonderful and engaging guest speakers. Even if this is not a requirement, I strongly recommend it.",
    "As a survey course, I was often frustrated with the lack of in-depth discussion on each topic. I feel that a survey course should give a solid foundation of the theory with which to approach case studies, whereas I felt this course gave little to no theory and was primarily based on showing as many case studies as possible.",
    "Strength- Thursday discussion session and guest lecturesWeakness- lengthy class on tuesday",
    "This class provided an overview of many social and behavioral topics of interest. We had great discussions and lectures by Marney and guest professors.",
    "I thought that the breadth of topics covered was wonderful, and I enjoyed almost all of the topics picked for lectures. However, the course did take on sort of an overview of haphazard topics, without a clear narrative flow. It's not clear to me that this could be changed, but the area of the course that did flow with the PIP and essays was actually very interesting and well done. I enjoyed the guest lecture format, but I guess I was hoping for more of a directional sign post that would tie all fo the disparate topics together.",
    "Good class; easy material.",
    "The class essentially comprised of an interesting series of lectures but most of them pertained to \"social\" issues as opposed to the behavioral aspect. This class was very heavy on feminist ideas which I found very interesting, however sometimes I came out of the class more pessimistic about female progress than optimistic because of the focus on criticizing the media etc. The class should really be called something else because aside from the few lectures on children's nutrition, it was mostly about women or LBGT.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. You are introduced to a wide array of public health topics, from mental health, to nutrition and to violence, which I thought was really interesting. Most of the talks were presented by guest lecturers in their particular area of expertise, so it was awesome to hear different perspectives and be able to communicate\/network with others we were interested in.Strengths: as mentioned, the variety of very interesting topics and guest lecturersWeaknesses: some of the assignments seemed unnecessary and too time-consuming (i.e. the debates and the public health improvement paper)",
    "Overall I think that the course provides a great overview of relevant topics in the social and behavioral science field. It provides students with an idea of research that is going on in the department. It would have been great if the lectures had gone into more detail and had covered more on each topic. I would suggest that Dr. White to cover less topics but to cover each in more detail, spending more than one lecture on each topic.",
    "Interesting Course! Loved the speakers but the assignments were not at ALL related to the course.",
    "Do not require\/ do not use Facebook page participation- some of us are trying to not use it or would like to get away from it. Also confuses the number of places we need to check for communication, etc. (I try not to check Facebook, and sometimes the professor would post a survey, which I wouldn't find until much later...)",
    "I personally really enjoyed the class. I like how the class was set up where we would here from guest lecturers a couple times. I also enjoyed the wide range of topics",
    "This class was definitely my favorite this semester. I really enjoyed the instructor and class material",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I especially liked all of the guest lecturers, who were all very engaging and interesting.",
    "This course covered a large variety of topics, which I appreciated; I feel like I got a good sense of the breadth of the field. At the same time, sometimes it felt like it lacked cohesion and that there wasn't an overarching plan for the course.",
    "strengths: wide topics covered and by professionals of each fieldweaknesses: although i believe discussion is a critical component of this course; i felt using facebook was not the most appropriate. maybe a blackboard platform would be better in facilitating conversation in the future",
    "i thought the course was a fairly broad based general introduction to social behavioral issues in society. i found the course interesting, and it helped me to gain a different perspective of mainstream articles, which i found enlightening. i also thought the personal health improvement project was unique in its approach; i don't think any other school in the world would have given such a project.",
    "Lectures do not need to be that long. I think that the lectures should be shorter and the TA discussion sections should be longer. You cannot squeeze any type of debate\/discussion into 50 minutes.",
    "I enjoyed this course. It was nice to just be able to discuss the material and input our own experiences and not have the pressure of memorizing facts and figures. It would be nice to ramp up to the final paper, instead of just jumping in. I don't think a whole lecture on the paper writing process was necessary, but maybe small assignments over a few weeks, such as gathering sources or creating an outline, would force students to lessen the burden of writing a long paper during finals period.",
    "This class is interesting and has diverse subjects. There are a lot of different guest speakers. The facebook component and debates are really helpful. However, I felt that the final paper was a bit disorganized.",
    "This course was amazing. The assignments were assessments of very important skills (debating, critical review of articles, etc...), and the content covered was very relevant to all areas of public health. I took this course because it was a requirement, but it was one of my favorite courses of the semester.",
    "The first half of the semester was very strong and lectures were very interesting, but I would have liked to see some topics explored more in depth during the second half of the semester. I would have also liked a little more background on theoretical fundamentals of psychology\/sociology.I really liked the media analysis and personal health improvement project, but would have preferred for the final paper to have not been linked to the personal health improvement project.The debates were quite a lot of work, but I felt like I could have learned more about the debate topics through a regular discussion section or short paper\/essay.The blog quizzes were fun, but it could be difficult to hear the prompt, find paper, etc. Maybe the blog quiz topic could be written on the whiteboard and maybe electronic submissions could be accepted as well?",
    "I really liked the format of the class, one large lecture and one section each week. Topics were interesting, it was also nice having speakers come in to speak about their specialized subjects.",
    "Good course. Can make it more technical for analysis of social and psychological determinants of health.",
    "This course gave a decent overview of different aspects of SBS, but I needed more critical analysis. I didn't like the focus on behavioral interventions, because I don't think that's how real public health change is made: I think there needs to be WAY more focus on, and discussion of the way that structural violence impacts people's choices, and the way that we as public health students might tackle these forms of structural violence, rather than just trying to get people to change their individual behavior. There was some (though not nearly enough, IMO) discussion of structural violence in some of the lectures, but the assignments were all totally focused on individual behavior change. I did really like having the class facebook page, because I liked being able to post things that I found interesting and discuss them with classmates. The debates were an interesting experience, but my main issue with them was that one of the sides was always way more scientifically supported than the other, making it an unfair assignment. It would have been more interesting to debate topics that are genuinely more scientifically controversial, and\/or be able to engage in broader philosophical debates about the intersections of society and health.",
    "The class was too general and lacked detail to be contain an adequate amount of substance. I don't feel like I learned much beyond how to write a literature review which was in fact quite helpful. It was nice to have a class that did not require a lot of outside work but it is questionable the amount of knowledge we were able to gain from it.",
    "Nice overview of many topics, great guest speakers, and the discussions were well run.It would be nice to have more depth for some of the topics, though.",
    "Covers many different topics but is the master of none of them, but that is perhaps due to the nature of the course itself and not the lecturers.",
    "This course offered an incredible amount of very interesting subject matter. I would say the breadth of subject matter was almost overwhelming, though fascinating. I would have loved \"take-home messages\" from each of the lectures, as I thought I \"missed the forest for the trees\" on more than one occasion. That said, I enjoyed the flexibility of assignments in order to cater work to our individual interests, so CDE 505 01 was a useful survey of SBS topics. I look forward to taking more classes in specified subject areas, but I wish I left this course having a firmer grasp of more of the lecture topics.",
    "A very interesting and broad foundation as social behaviors and related\/relevant concepts goEngaging even for un-initiated and\/or unexposed without being overwhelming.PLUS: Discussion sections, though a bit brief, are truly designed to support exchange of ideas and experiences per the relevant subject material.Debates; GREAT in theory... in execution time constraints could be improved upon..."

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0One thing I might suggest is ensuring that the information provided, and the way it is provided, is sensitive to diverse viewpoints...especially political ones. In some cases, only one side of the story was presented and in others one side of the story was dismissed in a disrespectful way; I found this to be frustrating.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was great the first day and got us all excited but didn't lecture very often for the first month and a half and so by having a new lecturer every week the class kinda lots its spark.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0very approachable, knew her subject matter, engaging lecturer",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Enthusiastic. Engaging.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was strong at keeping as participative in discussion and lecture and taking our opinions and structuring the class accordingly.Marney sometimes felt so strongly about certain topics that her personal opinion clouded research or our ability to critically think on a topic. Specifically, when we covered body image, her view was so extreme, that any view outside of hers felt wrong.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0While I think Marney is very passionate about the material, I found some of the lectures to be a little scattered and off topic at times.The slides could have been more organized to elucidate the main points of the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is an excellent teacher and I greatly enjoyed her passion and enthusiasm. Although she only taught some of the classes, those that she did instruct were very informative and made me think in a different way.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very good, and easy to talk to. Like that she is open to changing class according to what her students want to learn",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great professor. Very enthusiastic. Interesting experiences to share relative to the material.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The primary instructor was sensitive to the audience which was good.I would like to mention that it was sometimes hard for me to follow the instructor, because she spoke very fast.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strengths- Clearly very passionate about material.Weaknesses- Sometimes very biased in topics which are not as clear cut as described in class. Evidence used in class was not always well documented.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney cares a lot about this course and the material. She is great at making herself available to students and addresses their concerns promptly. Her teaching could be improved by more in depth analysis of fewer topics - currently, she makes broad statements about topics that seem unsupported, or like an opinion, because they are not justified with analysis.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White was a great instructor and she definitely improved as the semester progressed. In the beginning, I felt that there were times when she was too focused on whether the students were paying attention. This was slightly stressful, but otherwise, she was great. She's very approachable and willing to help her students and I really appreciated that. I also really enjoyed her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White is a very engaging lecturer!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is pretty good. A little too focused on some extra sections such as the Facebook elements. It is a little weird that we were rewarded with candy at the beginning of class, because much of the material was about the negative consequence of that. But over all it was very clear that she cared a great deal to make it a good experience for everyone, and wanted us to take away meaningful lessons that we could use down the line.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Instructor enjoyed teaching but tried to cover too much during each lecture. If there was more research based material as opposed to anecdotal and pop culture material, it would've been more beneficial.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was so sweet, friendly, funny, approachable, down to earth, and intelligent. It was always fun to sit in class and listen to her enjoyable anecdotes and unique teaching style. She presented us with many interesting topics and she did a great job of picking the most important themes.The only weakness would be that she did not plan the final research project well.I love Marney, she's my favorite professor this semester!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was fun and engaging. It was a very entertaining class, and I learned a lot about current social issues,",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Accommodating, allowed the course to follow the interests of the students, very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was a fascinating lecturer and it is apparent that she has lots of passion for the subject, as well as lots of personal and professional experience with some of the topics we discussed. I enjoyed her teaching style and her candidness. However, at times the lectures felt imbalanced with emotional appeals and media content rather than public health studies. I understand that in many cases, these topics are sensitive and affect many people personally, but discussions tended to focus on personal anecdotes rather than public health studies, and it is more difficult to learn epidemiological trendswhen the information is filtered through such a lens.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is very sensitive to students needs and clearly very dedicated to teaching. I would have appreciated if her lectures demonstrated the evidence behind her opinions, as at times it felt like she knew why she thought a certain thing but didn't really demonstrate to us why this was true-so it came off as an opinion rather than a fact.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White is committed and tries her best to provide her students the best learning environment by either getting experts in different topics or involving discussions in Facebook",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was a wonderful professor. She cares very much about all of the topics. She had guest lecturers come in which was helpful to hear from experts in their fields about topics.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I thought Marney was great, a well-informed and entertaining lecturer. She's very approachable and eager to engage with students. I wish she had actually lectured more though. She had so much to say and so little opportunity to say it, I would really have liked her to give one, if not two more lectures. Other than that, I was very impressed with Marney.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White was passionate and very responsive. Her enthusiasm for the course was undeniable, and it was projected in the course.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0A little much at times; please don't chew in the microphone; lecture on body and perfection was done in a non-respectful manner- slightly body shaming",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She was truly very knowledgable but sometimes I felt like was not taught in a neutral manner. It was very liberal and almost made me feel bad about having certain opinions.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She's funny, keeps things interesting, and she's truly an expert in her field. Her objective at the beginning of the course was to keep things fun and interesting for her students while we also learn about pertinent and interesting public heath material, and I think she definitely achieved that. She's very open and approachable and understanding of her students' experiences and feelings.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great professor! Very open and responsive. Interested in what her students had to say and engaged.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great instructor- passionate and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I really enjoyed having Marney as a professor. I thought she did a very good job not only providing the material but also making sure we, the class, had a say on what material we would cover. I really appreciated her energy and enthusiasm as some of my other classes were very dry. This was a very nice change of pace.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0she is enthusiastic, passionate about what she is teaching and it comes across to her students. its refreshing to see as a student and encourages us to engage more in the course.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a lively and enthusiastic instructor who genuinely cares about her students. I enjoyed her classes. I appreciate her efforts in bringing in the guest lecturers, and also her setting up of the Facebook page where we could all partake in discussion. Sometimes though I did feel like she sped through the material too quickly. She could definitely cut down on the number of slides and just talk about the material as it was.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I thought Marney was engaging and enthusiastic. I loved her passion for these topics. I liked that she sparked discussion and just wanted students to understand the issue at hand instead of forcing statistics on us. I liked the facebook page, it was always fun to read what other students dug up, and to actually be able to see the videos or articles that are mentioned in class instead of forgetting about them.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is extremely energetic and passionate about her subject. She brings in a lot of real world experiences.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. While was dynamic and engaging, and you can see her passion for the content when she lectures.

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Good. Choice of guest lecturers was very good!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I really liked Marney, and she is definitely way above average compared to most professors in YSPH (which is unfortunately not saying much). I think she really cared about making this course as interesting as possible for us and providing us with a wide range of ways to engage. I also appreciated that she invited other professors to provide guest lectures. However, I would have appreciated more in-depth analysis of a lot of the topics covered, as well as more dedication to teaching about the structural violence that shapes people's behaviors and experiences of health. This would have included talking explicitly about racism, sexism, classism, capitalism, and imperialism as structures that have and continue to affect health and wellness, as well as talking explicitly about ways that we should attack these structures directly instead of just trying to change the behavior of people affected by these structures.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was fun and engaging but it seemed she often let her personal opinion of the subject matter guide the course of the discussion. Her lectures lacked detail and she seemed to just skim the surface of some really interesting topics.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Good, although we had few lectures by the instructor due to many guest speakers.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Did a great job of choosing many different areas for us to study, but I think I enjoyed the guest lectures the most. That may just be due to the topics chosen though.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was an entertaining lecturer and did a good job of keeping students engaged. I enjoyed her asides and applications of lecture topics. I would have benefited from an organized list of concepts and definitions or perhaps more formulaic lecture structure.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Clearly knowledgeable. Very animated, passionate, driven, encouraging approachable\/open with regard to gaps in her knowledge (the few \"blanks\" that she has compared to the wealth of material she has been exposed to and\/or is interested in...)Could improve upon time management when it comes to delivery of material; something she nobly admits, being so eager to share"

    "This course is focused on different social issues related to health. The course meets for a lecture on Tuesdays (sometimes a guest lecture) and then there is a discussion meeting on Thursdays for which you prepare reactions to a set of readings. Assignments include participation in two debates on topics in the news as well as a few papers about a personal and public health intervention. The course covers important topics, but can be seen as somewhat disjointed especially because there are so many guest lecturers.",
    "The material could be really interesting and informative and really help you learn about the social and behavioral contexts of health. However, because the course was so much busy work it became more of a hassle than informative.",
    "I would recommend it. You're learning a little bit about a lot of topics. From this knowledge, you can expand your knowledge, and maybe even your interests.",
    "Hello fellow student. You have no choice. You are taking SBS. Fellow student: Shurg.",
    "I would recommend it to students who enjoy Psychology and Public Health. I do and had a lot of interest in the topics we learned about.",

Much information from this course would not be relevant to the situation in other countries, that is why not everything was interesting and useful for me from the practical side.",
    "There are benefits in taking this course as it will expose you to a different field of material. However, manyof the ideas taught in lecture are one-sided. I would encourage students to try and see different sides of an argument.",
    "I like the course. It did made me realize how important the social and behavioral side of public health is and how it impacts people's lives. Definitely a good core class.",
    "Required class",
    "Great class, great topics, great professor, only negative is the final paper.",
    "Yes because it gives a lot of perspective and you will get to hear some very inspiring and interesting speakers.",
    "I would not recommend this class, but it's required for almost everyone and I hear it's better than the other SBS option, so.",
    "I enjoyed this course and would recommend it. The workload was fair- heavy at some points, but very light at others. The debates were fun and the assignments were interesting.",
    "The instructor is very caring, class is interactive, and the TAs are clearly carefully selected. Definitely a great course to take even if it is not required.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend this course because it didn't adequately introduce SBS topics the way I was hoping. There was a large workload that didn't really help reinforce the course objectives and I don't think should be part of the class.",
    "The class brings together so much material, but be prepared for a huge final paper and tongs of reading every week.",
    "The lecture part of the course is often very interesting. Many of the topics covered were useful for anyone in the field of public health, and the guest speakers were great. However, discussionsections were not very helpful for learning, and some of the writing assignments were tedious and useless.",
    "I would say that everyone should take this course. I really truly believe that the concepts covered in this course are incredibly important to public health and an understanding of inequality in health. This was definitely my favorite course of the semester.",
    "-would recommend it, especially given the breadth of topics covered-good to have practice writing the final paper-offers a nice complement to other core courses",
    "This course makes weekly forays into some of the social and behavioral factors that influence public health. Lectures, guest speakers, small-group discussions, student debates, and written assignments expose pupils to a range of topics.",
    "I would definitely push them to take the class. It is an opportunity to meet an amazing teacher (Marney), meet professors from different fields, become exposed to many intriguing research topics, and the work is not too intensive. I would warn the student about the difficulty of the final project.",
    "The class is a great was to get the social science credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are interested in women's health, mental health, or lgbt health, as a way to get acquainted with these topics and have a chance to discuss with like-minded individuals.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to others.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Reasons stated above",
    "CDE 505 was a good class to take as a first-year public health student. I thought it was a good overview of a lot of topics of interest for public health students, and it helped get us thinking across a lot of different areas of public health.",
    "The WHY behind health disparities and how we come to conceptalize health. Very interesting on a personal and population level - and Marney is great!",
    "I will recommend this course. It's a foundation of learning public health.",
    "This course is an introduction to health behaviors and social determinants of health. Highly recommended.",
    "This isn't a course where you will get in-depth information, just snippets of many topics. Pretty typical of a required survey course.",
    "Recommend it but needs commitment from your side if you want to learn",
    "Great class, definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this course. I thought the class provided some very valuable perspectives and covered the basics of a wide variety of relevant topics in public health. I certainly learned a lot that I will take away with me, and in general I felt that the essays and debate topics were a nice complement to purely informational lectures. I feel the learning in the class has a very mature treatment of it's students, aimed at teaching you how to write high quality research papers and learning to think about the issues in social and behavioral public health.",
    "Really easy.",
    "I would recommend the course based on the student's areas of interest. I chose this course because I felt I was lacking knowledge in some of the subject areas but I regret that course really forced a lot of ideology on me.",
    "Again, it's a core requirement, and unfortunately I can't compare the course to the other SBS alternative. But I would definitely recommend this course if you want to learn about a lot of really interesting topics in public health and be introduced to several guest lecturers in a variety of subjects.",
    "Take the class! Had a great time and learned a lot. Just felt the assignments were a bit busywork and I wish it related more to the class.",
    "It's required...and I actually learned quite a bit, and enjoyed a lot of it. :)",
    "An overview of different health issues. We talked about women's health, violence etc. You do not go too much into actual social and behavioral changes. I would definitely recommend this class since it is a core and I think it would be much better then some of the other core classes. I am very glad I took it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The instructor was excellent, as well as all of the TA's. The lecturers were all very interesting, and were good topics for discussion.",
    "This course covers the social determinants of health in a wide variety of contexts. The lectures cover the main social issues affecting health in the US, and are taught by many different professors within the SBS division. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "yes, recommend.",
    "Time consuming. Some interesting discussion but the course material is super basic.",
    "A good discussion based class, straightforward assignments, and what I thought was interesting material. I recommend this class.",
    "This class exposes its students to a wide range of social and behavioral topics. It is definitely worthwhile taking, especially if you have never had a class like this before.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students at YSPH. This course provides a really important perspective on public health problems, and it is very well taught.",
    "Great introductory course with interesting and fun lectures. Weekly amount of work for the course is less than for most other courses at YSPH, but the various projects throughout the semester take up quite a bit of time.Would definitely recommend.",
    "Course on various topics related to social and behavioral aspects of healthcare. There is one large lecture and one section a week, a good format for this subject. I would recommended it.",
    "Would recommend it.",
    "This is a core course, and it's definitely a better option than the other SBS core (psychosocial and behavioral epidemiology, which I took for a few weeks and dropped because it was so unbelievably terrible), but if you're looking to actually engage with how social issues affect health with more than a kiddie-pool level of depth, don't get your hopes up. Welcome to YSPH. Marney does try really hard though, and is open to suggestions, so maybe it'll be better next year? Idk.",
    "The course was satisfactory but I would not recommend it to another student, especially for someone who has taken any psychology course in the past because they would just be disappointed in the class.",
    "An interesting overview of many facets of public health.",
    "This is a great course that describes several not-so-often discussed topics in public health. It will allow you to determine some of your public health interests and then you can become more specific regarding your course and career choices in the future. Recommendation: N\/A, req'd course",
    "This course offered a very broad of survey of topics of interest in the SBS discipline. It is a great way to learn about many of the principle topics of research. I would say that this course is not overly mentally taxing, and it is a nice way to jumpstart one's course load at YSPH.",
    "One generally cannot expect to enjoy (or at least be optimistic about) Public Health edification, especially with such sobering subject material. But somehow between learning about the profound health challenges we face as a (global) populace and learning about the limitations of well-intended interventions, one can genuinely appreciate and connect with the material, potentially walking away less cynical and more hopeful about our pursuit of understanding and achieving better health."
