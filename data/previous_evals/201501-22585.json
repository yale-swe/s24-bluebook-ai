   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for another student because it did give a lot of good background on China.",
    "Solid course on modern Chinese history and politics. Decent lectures. Sections are kind of pointless since they're just multi-week simulations, but they're doable. Fairly easy final.",
    "This is a great look at the root causes of Chinese foreign policy decisions and a great class overall. The workload is very manageable and I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "It's an easy-ish course that will leave you feeling like a diplomat at the end of it. The two short policy-memos and a reflection piece are doable, and the reading is basically optional. The final was a piece of cake.",
    "Lectures are about Chinese history and modern political issues, sections focus on modern Chinese territorial sovereignty hotspots. Was a nice class.",
    "Take this class. Why not? It's pretty chill. I think that everything is graded rather fairly and Professor Weiss is a joy to listen to. Her delivery about China issues\/history\/foreign policy is fascinating. I've taken a few China lectures about China and by far I liked hers the most.",
    "Good",
    "This is a great class to take to learn about China's politics and foreign relations. The workload was very reasonable, just three short papers (3 pages, 4 pages, and 3 pages) and one final exam.",
    "It js very interesting if you have not taking a lot of Chinese history.",
    "It is a great overview of Chinese history and politics, and if you are interested in understanding why China makes the decisions it does today, take it!",
    "A fairly interesting overview of Chinese history since the 19th century and contemporary issues in Chinese domestic\/foreign politics. I had taken Cold War the semester before, and actually a lot of the information on China overlapped. Professor Weiss is really smart, but her lectures were pretty dry. Your grade is basically composed of two 3-page simulation memos, a 4-page response paper, a final exam. The class is kind of weird because you spend pretty much all of the sections on the simulations, and most of your grade is based on the simulations, but they're only tangentially related to the lectures. For the final exams, she gives you all the possible ID's and essay prompts, so it's pretty easy to prepare for. She assigns A LOT of readings, but I don't think anyone really did them, and it's not necessary to do them to do well in the class. The main reason why I enjoyed the class was because I really liked my section and my TF -- if Eric TFs for the class again, try to get him. Overall, I'm not sure if I would recommend it. I think there are more interesting classes on China that you can take.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a generic overview of China's political system. It is not very tedious, 1 midterm paper, 2 memos, and 1 final. Good 5th class and get Robert as your TF. He is the best!",
    "I would not recommend one take this class. If you can avoid taking it, do so. You'd be better off reading some long-form journalism or a book or two about China than taking this class. It was a boring, un-compelling course that will give a scattered baseline level of information about China's history\/ foreign policy from the 19th century to the present.",
    "A course on modern china. I would definitely recommend as it is important to understand China in today's world.",
    "A polital science course on Chinese foreign relations.",
    "Requires very independent study--take if you know little to nothing about Chinese modern history and politics. Good course overall, but a pretty general survey",
    "This class is a good overview of China's history regarding foreign and domestic politics. A pretty interesting course especially if you have no prior knowledge of China. A lot of time in section is spent on disputes in the east and South China Seas, regarding interesting current events. I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes. If you want a low key, enjoyable way to learn about China which combines modern Chinese history with current day politics. Very light workload, straightforward final, 3 short papers.",
    "I would recommend it. China is somewhat of a sexy topic right now and you do get a historical overview. The grading isn't that bad and you do learn quite a bit of material. Even if you aren't a history\/east asian studies major, I would recommend it if it interests you.",
    "Take it if you have a passing interest in China as a rising world hegemon, but it is a survey course rather than a course with a specific area of focus. I find it most helpful in teaching me how to write effective policy memos for very intricate multilateral issues.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in learning about China in a global context or a political science\/East Asian studies student who wants to apply issues in China to other countries. I would not recommend this course to a student who is looking for active discussion and debate on China's world in the international realm.",
    "Good course.",
    "For me, this class was a really nice way to review surface-level Chinese history and get a basic feel for current events in China; it's not challenging, but not super duper informative either. If you want a fairly straightforward class and are taking 5 credits, this would be a good one to consider.",
    "A nice summary of China's history and its role on the global political scene. Definitely, definitely take it - China is such an interesting country with such a tumultuous past that being able to discuss its growth in an academic context is an opportunity to be treasured. If you get a good section, this class can be one of the most informative classes you take at yale.",
    "Survey course of Chinese political and foreign policy stance. Like I said before, it was built on the premise that to understand China's present political and foreign policy stance, you need to understand its recent history (past ~150 years), which I think is very true. I would recommend this class to non-East Asian studies majors with no background on China. I thought it was a great introductory class for that. They would have gotten the key points in understanding China's present from its past and the foundation for creating a productive diplomatic discussion with China. For someone with China background, especially China history background, the material got a little bit redundant at times, but I still enjoyed the class and the review."
