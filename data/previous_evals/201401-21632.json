   "comments": [
    "This course was very thought-provoking. It provided a new framework to understand political orders in the Middle East and North Africa that I hadn't considered before. I enjoyed interacting with the readings and found many of the classes to be quite interesting, but I sometimes wished their was more discussion and less lecture (this might have been a product of the class make-up). The intellectual arc of the class, however, ended up being very satisfying. Professor Wrytzen did a great job of making himself available to students who wanted help\/further discussion outside of class. Take it!",
    "Great class for a wholistic understanding of the issues of the Middle East and North Africa.",
    "Yes -- good survey course.",
    "A pretty overarching view on America's relations with the Middle East. Nothing spectacular, but good if you need the credit.",
    "Yes, but make sure you have a talkative group. You'll want that to get the benefit of all the readings, which are quite worthwhile.",
    "A seminar that explores the evolution of political order in the Middle East and North Africa from with an emphasis on imperialism, insurgency, and counterinsurgency. The earlier part of the course is focused on providing a historical foundation for the current political situation in these regions. To this end we first discussed the theories and ideas of several theorists including Ibn Khaldun and James Scott. I really cannot stand theoretical discussions, but much to my glee, Prof. Wyrtzen did a great job of making sure the discussion remained grounded rather than free-floating and hypothetical. Next, we discussed the variety of modes of imperialism, tools of colonial control, and methods of resistance. To this end, we did a case study of French imperialism and looked at Syria and Lebanon and British imperialism and looked at Iraq, Palestine, and Transjordan. The final part of the course was devoted to counterinsurgency (COIN), which we spent a while discussing. I don\u2019t mean that as a criticism, in fact I am quite happy we did, but it didn\u2019t appear this way on the syllabus. The midterm is hard since you have to cram a lot of material into one paper, but the final paper is not bad at all and can be fun if you enjoy your topic. If the grader changes, which I am sure it will, then the midterm will not be hard. This course is meant for grad students and juniors and seniors\u2014so if you are a freshman or sophomore beware\u2014you will be thrown into a class with a lot of grad students and upperclassmen who enjoy talking a lot and who may or may not respond positively or care about what you have to say. However, Prof. Wyrtzen is fantastic so once you get over your intiail trepidation its great. Prof Wyrtzen is a fantastic person and professor\u2014he is super cool and SO smart. Do not be afraid to ask questions since he will thoroughly explain them and does not mind slowing down if need be.",
    "This is a pretty interesting seminar. Professor Wyrtzen is really nice and approachable, but he isn't going to be a totally life-changing professor. If you're interested in the Middle East, it's a good class, but it's not a must-take.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course. If you are even slightly interested in political or historical sociology or Middle East, take it. You will learn very interesting insights that help you to get a fresh perspectives of even current issues of Middle East.",
    "I would say that the class is very good for people looking to study a variety of social science disciplines, especially sociology and global affairs, but also history and political science. I would caution students, however, that the workload is very steep. Also, I was often intimidated by the knowledge of the graduate students taking the class, but I still felt like it was easy to contribute to discussion, and I would make sure that students considering the class knew that. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the Middle East or global politics in general."
