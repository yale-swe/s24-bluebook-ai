Additionally, the class has a practical focus on developing student's research skills through individual term projects on related topics."

    "This course was relevant to everyone in the class despite differing dissertation focuses.",
    "This class helped me to understand the ocean system better, which will greatly benefit my research. It has also introduced me to a geochemical perspective. The literature we reviewed was mostly new to me and broadened my understanding of paleontology in general. Also, the term project helped me understand the research process a little better, especially as it relates to small, concise projects."
