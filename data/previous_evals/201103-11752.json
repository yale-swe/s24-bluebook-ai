   "comments": [
    "You should expect to dedicate a good portion of your time to learning French, as there is homework every day, compositions every week, and tests every week. The class also tries to give you a good and solid foundation, so it goes quite fast. On the other hand, if you're willing to put in time and some effort, you will see a great improvement in your language skills. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "It's a really difficult language and a difficult course. Don't assume that it will be easy because it's L1 or because you already speak another romance language.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It was really fun and I really feel like I've gained a really good knowledge of French.",
    "Fast-paced immersion into the French language, time-consuming, a lot of work but so much fun (if you want to learn French)!",
    "If you are looking to learn French then this is where you want to be, but if you are just looking for ways to fulfill the language requirement, there are easier classes out there.",
    "French 110 is a difficult course, but you learn a lot quickly. The work is manageable, but be warned that there are tests EVERY Monday afternoon, which can be quite tedious at times. If a student is willing to put in the work, French 110 is a very rewarding course in the best language department at Yale."
