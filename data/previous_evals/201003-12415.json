   "comments": [
    "Great course, you will make HUGE strides in learning Spanish. It was my busiest class but was well worth it. Be aware though that you should review basic vocab and verbs before walking into class.",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to Spanish and lots of fun. I feel so, so much better about my speaking and writing ability after the course! The course load is manageable, but you will need to work every night.",
    "Spanish 120 is a wonderful class: I always used to look forward to it in the morning! The material is very well taught, in such a way that makes it even fun to learn. It is very important to keep up with the pace of the class and do the homework and all the other assignment on time, in order to acquire good grammar and vocabulary skills. The small size of the class makes it even more enjoyable, developing more personal student to student and student to teacher interactions.",
    "I thought this course was a good review of material learned in high school, although more challenging and much more focused on speaking and listening. I would definitely recommend this course, for those who have had Spanish experience in high school or for those who are just taking their second semester - this course is very valuable for learning effective communication, not just how to read and write.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because it was very interesting and it furthered my knowledge of Spanish."
