    "Schwartz is a great lecturer and obviously really knows his stuff. That being said, I found the course a little bit inaccessible for those with absolutely no Spanish language background given that, especially for section, one had to remember a lot of names, and when people rushed through the names, it was quite hard to understand what they were saying. I recognize that this sounds quite nitpicky; however, to me, it made a substantial difference. 2 papers and 2 exams. The papers are each pretty short: 5-6 and 8-10 pages respectively. The exams are the types of things you would expect. Reading load is a bit above average for a history lecture, but nothing out of the ordinary (100ish pages per week).",
    "Don't be misled-- this course is about South America and Central America from 1492-1820. It does not take you up to the present. That said, it's a great course! I learned a lot about something I knew very little about before! There's quite a bit of reading but it's doable. There's one 5 page paper and one 10 page research paper, weekly reading responses, a midterm and a final.",
    "good class! a lot of reading and papers and exams, but interesting material",
    "If you're interested in Latin American history, definitely take this class. Professor Schwartz is fantastic and absolutely adorable! But be warned, this class is a lot of work. There's a ton of reading with reading responses (about 200 dense pages per week), a midterm, final, and two papers. I wasn't able to keep up with the intense workload and ended up ditching a lot of the reading. This made the class stressful and meant I couldn't get nearly as much out of it. So make sure you have time for this class if you're going to take it. Still recommend though!",
    "Latin America: the survey.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking for a preindustrial credit. Preindustrial history isn't my favorite, but I actually really enjoyed this course and felt like I learned a lot from it. Prof Schwartz is a great (very thorough) lecturer, and you really walk away from the class knowing a ton about indigenous, Spanish, and Portuguese culture at the time. Also, if you're interested in Latin America, this course is a great overview of the forces that led to the eventual independence of Latin American regions, and I would definitely recommend taking it before moving onto more modern Latin American history.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in the time period and looking for a good variety of class readings, a fair work load, and very doable midterm and finals. The professor is awesome and with just two papers, two midterms, and class participation as the main ways to get your grade, is a great addition to any class schedule.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a great history class and the workload is pretty manageable.",
    "It was a good class, especially for anyone interested in the subject. It can be a lot of work and the TFs are pretty intense.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone with an interest in Latin America. Having a general knowledge of the colonial period is essential. You should understand that the course focuses on Spanish America more than Brazil. Be prepared for long readings and a substantial amount of writing.",
    "This course is a pretty standard history lecture. There are lectures twice a week and section once a week, a midterm and a final exam, and two papers (one is 4-6 pages and the other 8-10). The material is really interesting, and if you do the work and attend lecture it's pretty easy. Depending on your TF, the course is always a good way to work on your writing. I'd recommend it.",
    "Great survey course. The books are really interesting as well, and complement the lectures in a fruitful way. Take it!",
    "FUCK this class",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "A good place to learn more about Latin America and its history. accessible even to non history or Latin American studies majors.",
    "If you are at all interested in History, Latin America, or honestly even if you're just looking for a great lecture course, you should take this class. Between Professor Schwartz and the awesome TA's in the department, you can't lose. Weekly blog posts are enough to keep you on top of your readings, without sucking up your time. The reading is a lot, but you can skim. Testing is fair; essays take some work, but that is to be expected. Overall, this class is a gem.",
    "This class offers a nice balance of broad themes and \"big questions\" (on the one hand) and detailed stories and anecdotes (on the other). A must if you're interested in modern Latin American history -- it helps put more recent periods into context. Professor Schwartz clearly loves teaching this class -- he's a lively lecturer and peppers class with interesting stories and subtle jokes that you'll only get if you're paying attention. I wish I had gone to office hours and taken the opportunity to engage with him more.",
    "This class is one of the few good \"rest of the world\" courses in the history department. Take it for sure.",
    "Colonial Latin America is a great course for anyone looking to learn more about the region. Prof. Schwartz is a fantastic professor, and just hearing his lectures is reason enough to take the class. The course covers a lot of ground in just one semester, roughly 300 years of history for an entire continent. At the same time, the readings are very well chosen and the material presented clearly, so it all comes together very nicely. There is quite a bit of reading for the course, in addition to the two essays. If you are really interested in the topic the workload should not be a problem and it will be totally worthwhile. This is a great class.",
    "Tough but good, interesting and straightforward. Schwartz is a wonderful lecturer!",
    "A rigorous and interesting history course, especially for the pre-industrial period. You will learn a lot about the role of race in the foundation of latin america as it interplays with large-scale history. The role of gender is briefly touched on, though only anecdotally. It is a good way to get a pre-industrial requirement out of the way, and it got me excited to study modern latin american history. Lectures can be long and often anecdotal and confusing; to be ready for the exams, you'll have to study the book a lot and do the large amount of reading.",
    "Survey courses aren't for everyone but if you're interested in the topic and want to get a solid overview then definitely take it.",
    "Yes! Absolutely. The class is great, you'll a lot about political, cultural, economic and social beginnings of Latin America that can really be reflected in modern day. Very fun and interesting to listen to, Professor Schwartz is really a great lecturer and the TF's are all very well versed in Latin America. You won't go wrong taking this class."
