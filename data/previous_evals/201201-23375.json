The second half the course about policy became a bit repetitious.(Question 9) I wish we could do more in the forest with prescribed burn and seeing the effect of fire on the landscape. Even if conditions were not perfect for burning, it would be good to go out and see old burns and the impacts fire had on the vegetation."

    "great group of people with strong interest in the subject matter, good discussion.",
    "Going on the field trip at the end. I also enjoyed looking up my own articles and the seminar style class discussions we held.",
    "The best things about the course was its communal atmosphere. The class was small and individual students developed a good rapport. Ann was instrumental in setting this tone, and it certainly contributed to my learning. The field trip was also great, though it would have been better if the burn hadn't been rained out by a freak hailstorm.",

   "comments": [
    "the format of the class could be improved through some simple measures:-split up the lecture classes more evenly throughout the year. the student led discussions lost momentum when we had to be in charge of too many classes without a break. towards the end of the class, we ended up talking about the same thing because we didn't have any new influx of information via lecture-assign a textbook (or just a few chapters from a textbook on v2 in pdf form) for the science part of the class and expect students to get up to snuff on the basics of fire science on their own so you can devote more time in class to other aspects of fire (social, political, privatization, etc)-definitely incorporate guest lectures evenly throughout the course too (whether via skype\/gotomeeting, bringing someone in, or having yale faculty and students come talk to us).",
    "As mentioned above, more going out into the field and seeing the effect of fire on the landscape.",
    "There was little that needed particular improvement; I'm grasping here. Perhaps some of the discussions could have been more focused\/had a little more structure. I sometimes felt we were just wandering around without much thought to where we were going.",
    "There wasn't enough course material to last the whole semester. Class needed more structure and more material."
