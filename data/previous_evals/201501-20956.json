   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class for students with a weak background in biology. However, if the student has a strong background in biology I think the class may not have much to offer, since much of the time in the class is spent catching the physics and engineering students up on basic biology.",
    "This course is great for becoming a better reader of journal articles.",
    "This course is modeled after MB&B Methods and Logic for those in the department. It is in many ways a more relaxed version of that course and it will expose you to ideas that are outside of your usual comfort zone. I would recommend it if you are looking to work on communication between disciplines especially.",
    "Read papers and get asked questions on them. I would recommend it overall because I think it makes you read the literature more critically.",
    "-Seminar course that covers a lot of papers in different topics in Biophysics, with different professors. Gives people exposure to various topics in biophysics, and the many techniques used. -Times are designed so that the students can understand the papers by themselves first, before having a more in depth talk with the professors -Let physics and biology people to complementary work together -allows us to knows a lot of professor well also -for our particular course\/year, there was way too many people, making it much harder to have meaningful contributions to the talk. -I'd recommend the course to other students, as it brings one much closer to the research field",
    "I would say it is ok but not really useful to learn cross-topics. there is no background and things like that. not over all well organized.",
    "It's very hard if you're not a Biology student, but you learn a lot from the other students. A good way to learn how to read journal articles effectively.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I would do so because I think that it is an effective way to meet and talk to students in other scientific disciplines. I would also argue that it is always helpful to learn how to read papers by learning from ones' peers and instructors, and the format of this course is wonderful. However, I would caution students that it is difficult to really get a lot of use out of the course because some students are hopelessly under-prepared to deal with the biological question being asked. In fact, I found that the physics was easier to grasp and the hard question was always: why do we care about this biological feature? Many students weren't motivated to figure out the biological details, and the lack of collective motivation tends to decrease the value that can be gained from the class."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me improve my ability to critically read and to interpret biology articles.",
    "It helps you read papers more critically which is good.",
    "Knows the recent important researches going on.",
    "Did not really increase my knowledge, but helped to expose me to new topics.",
    "It taught me a lot about how biology research is done, giving me a solid foundation if I decide to continue research in that area.",
    "I think that, in terms of usefulness for my discipline and my dissertation, other courses were much more effective at delivering relevant knowledge. Oftentimes, the struggle I experienced when reading papers wasn't on understanding the physics or the biology but instead on details of what the experimenters did, why they did it, and how they performed some assay. These nitty gritty details aren't what remain imprinted on my memory. Instead, I appreciated reading interesting papers and meeting other graduate students and faculty. I hope that these relationships will lead to collaborations or advice that will, in turn, concretely contribute to my own research."
