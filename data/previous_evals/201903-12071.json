    "I learned about the canon of classical sociological theory, as well as various subfields. More than anything, Professor Wyrtzen gave us tools to think critically about what makes a canon and how sociological theory gets established as central to the field.",
    "I gained a theoretical literacy in many works that form the sociological canon.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths and weaknesses of the course are similar. The course's syllabus is extremely well put together and expansive, Jonathan included a great variety of readings that are typically excluded from sociological theory and treated the course as a survey, which was useful in acquiring a lot of surface knowledge at once. However, I thought there was simply too much reading, even in light of this being a graduate-level course. It made it hard to understand any single theorist well because each week we were racing against the clock just to finish.",
    "Jonathan led rich and nuanced discussions in his class. He combined a good amount of lecturing with our overall discussions. He offered useful critical views on each reading without being too pushy about his opinion. He is thoughtful and engaging and did an excellent job selecting source materials, which was certainly a difficult task for an intro to sociological theory course. The assignments were very manageable and I liked writing a memo and offering a presentation to the class about a given theorist and listening to the presentations of others. Jonathan was also flexible about changing the requirements of our final two papers so as to help us pursue our individual research interests. Jonathan is adept at facilitating discussions and I looked forward to coming to class. The only weakness I will identify is that the reading assignments were far too unrealistic. Some weeks required 500+ pages of reading. I know it was important to take in a lot of information, but it was often impossible to thoroughly read through each assignment. I got the sense that Jonathan himself could not read each assignment in their entirety. Even cutting one day's readings to 3 versus 5 would be immensely helpful for when he reformulates the syllabus, if he does.",
    "Strengths I loved how Prof. Wyrtzen structured the course to focus on issues of race and gender throughout our work on the canonical thinkers. Overall, the small class size allowed us to dive into the theorists head-on, and Prof. Wyrtzen framed class discussions so well, particularly in the questions he raised about the work at hand. Weaknesses I wish we more clearly outlined the key theories of each theorist in class before moving on to questions and concerns about their work. Sometimes we got lost in the weeds on a particular micro-issue, without having a larger grasp on the larger theory. Also (perhaps this is because of my non-sociology background, so forgive me if so) I wish we talked a bit more about how to operationalize the theories, perhaps even looking at a contemporary sociological papers that use these theories to ground their research."

    "Yes! Jonathan is a wonderful professor to learn from, he is extremely knowledgable and very enthusiastic about the value of theory, as well as critical.",
    "Yes- please see strengths listed in #3",
    "Absolutely! I wish I had a better foundations in social theorists like Durkheim and, particularly, more contemporary sociological theorists before entering the class because I often felt like I had to synthesize a lot of new material in a short time span. But thus is the nature of such a class! I still feel like I have a much stronger grounding in the work of seminal social theorists."
