    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in this time period of history!",
    "I would recommend it, but with the caution that you will focus on a narrow time period. Some might think the course becomes repetitive, but I felt like I emerged with a pretty solid understanding of this moment in British history.",
    "I think this course is way too specific to carry an entire seminar.",
    "BUGIII (as it is affectionately called) is a great class! Professor Semmel is great, and chose the readings very carefully so almost all of them were excellent.It wasn't too much work, and don't let the many papers scare you; they are fun and engaging and interesting and flexible. Be prepared to use lots of primary sources.Also, if nothing else, take it to read Dror Wahrman's Making of the Modern Self--an incredible and inspiring book that changed the way I think about not just British history, but the study of history as a whole.I'd definitely recommend this class to someone interested in brit. history. It gives you a great sense of the milieu of British politics and society under the critical reign of George III."
