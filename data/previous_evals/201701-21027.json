   "comments": [
    "I gained a great overview of current and past psychological theories.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of basic psychological concepts like the brain, language, learning and social interactions. Even though I had taken psychology in high school, we covered the topics more clearly and used more anecdotes like particular experiments.",
    "Basic and shallow introduction to psychology.",
    "I feel like I am able to better analyze the world around me and be more introspective.",
    "Learned more about psychology!",
    "I learned a broad range of psychological concepts from sleep to development, consciousness to the history of psychology, anatomy to psychodynamic theory. It is quite hard to capture it all. I also learned how to read a popular psychology book and write a detailed analysis\/book review of such a work. And I also learned effective study techniques for exams that require much memorization.",
    "I developed several new areas of knowledge about basic psychology, and was very interested to get all this new knowledge. I developed a wide variety of areas of insight here, all of which will be very useful I\"m sure.",
    "I learned a lot about why people act the way that they do and the motivations behind those actions. I learned about different things that can go wrong in the brain and the results of those injuries.",
    "This was a good overview of several areas of psychology. I got a good understanding of psych experimentation and methods and approaches.",
    "This is a fairly comprehensive overview of the field of psychology and its many different subfields; in this course I learned the major overarching theories behind each subfield as well as specific phenomena related to each of those theories. I also leave this course with a greater understanding of the role of statistics in not just psychological research, but other areas of scientific research as well. I took AP Psychology in high school so I was hesitant about this course, assuming that it would likely be a \"repeat\" of the AP class. But even while much of the material overlapped, in PSYC 110 I learned many things that I would have missed out on had I skipped this intro course.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of psychology that will be very useful and a good foundation for other psychology courses.",
    "Preliminary knowledge in the field of psychology; basic idea of research methods in psychological sciences; some knowledge about psychopathology",
    "I learned an in depth overview of the various fields within psychology.",
    "I learned a lot on the subject of psychology, and the course was taught in a way where I can retain a lot of the information for more than just exams. It was an interesting course overall.",
    "Broad knowledge of psychological concepts and ideas",
    "Interesting class. Harsh curve.",
    "This class gave a good introductory to human lives and how we function and operate.",
    "Although I learned facts through rote memorization, I did not learn any skills. Sometimes, the information was interesting for insightful thought; the experimental methods were the most rewarding.",
    "I better understand the fundamentals of how we think and why we behave the way that we do.",
    "In depth information about empathy, how to perform an analytical analysis of a book, human evolutionary psychology, childhood development and more.",
    "Better learning about and understanding psychology and its different branches.",
    "I learned many things about psychology in this course, ranging from memory and learning to emotion and group psychology. Every topic was extremely interesting and relevant to everyday life.",
    "I loved this course! I feel like I have so much of a better understanding of various psychological concepts, and I also feel like my desire to study psychology has only increased since I started taking this course.",
    "This course is a very thorough introduction into psychology, especially if one reads the textbook carefully. The topics are fascinating and include the brain, perception, language, learning, memory, sleep, personality, emotion, development, psychological disorders, etc. You will learn a lot about how and why we think and behave the ways that we do.",
    "Basic understanding of broad topics in psychology.",
    "Learned broadly about different fields of study within psychology as well as basic psychology principles and theories.",
    "This course gives a very fast (and excessively superficial), overview of the areas of studies in psychology. It also starts instilling an experimental way of thought, i.e. one based on building experiments to detect\/demonstrate hypotheses.",
    "Just general psychology! The class was taught really well. The reading responses helped a lot with my understanding of the material. Prof. Dunham was great!",
    "Great intro class, really interesting and engaging.",
    "Intro Psych allows you to have a quick skim of all the relevant topics in the psychological sciences. I found the course to be very enriching since it allowed me to better understand how the human mind works and, in some cases, why we do what we do.",
    "Basic concepts in developmental, cognitive, social, behavioral, abnormal and some clinical psychology. It was a good introduction to the field of psychology and many of the experimental methods, techniques and reasoning.",
    "The course was a very helpful introduction to what psychology is and what the different fields of psychology are; it helped me build connections between different aspects of the mind and really ingrained into me the basic foundations and themes current psychology is built around.",
    "basic understanding of introductory psychology topics",
    "How to learn a semester's worth of psychology in two days.",
    "I practiced my ability to read and then incorporate the material from the reading with past material in the class.",
    "A basic understanding of basic psychological concepts like emotions, learning, memory, etc.",
    "This class taught me a lot about relationships with people and how we work as a species that I would otherwise never have thought about. I took AP psych and I still learned a lot in this class, although I kind of wish I knew that you could skip intro psych if you had gotten a 5 on the AP test. The lectures were really interesting but I don't think this class really challenged my way of thinking, it was just very easygoing.",
    "Intro Psych is an amazing course covering a broad scope of concepts in modern psychology. I took it my senior year and I can't believe I almost graduated without taking it... Definitely recommend this class if you're looking for something super interesting, and it's a dream to Cr\/D\/F. Go to all the lectures and listen\/take notes, do as much work as you want, engage with the course. It's worth it.",
    "a great overall sense and knowledge of psychology",
    "I developed a comprehensive knowledge of the basic principles and theories guiding psychological research today.",
    "This course gave me a basic understanding of a lot of things I experience\/do\/witness everyday. It gave me the foundations to continue the study of psychology.",
    "I learned about the basics of the different Psychological fields.",
    "In this course, I gained a broader understanding of the basic concepts which inform modern psychological science. I also learned some key connections between psychology and other life sciences.",
    "Covered a glorified version of AP Psych and read a semi-interesting outside reading book. Given that I'd taken AP Psych already, can't say I learned much...",
    "Nothing",
    "I learned an introductory set of material about interesting things -- it was not very deep knowledge of course but it was an intro course.",
    "Overall, Psych 110 provided exposure to a wide array of topics such as cognitive, developmental, abnormal, clinical, social psychology. I also developed skills in statistical psych in terms of understanding how to analyze data from an experiment and also how to develop an observational study versus an experiment.",
    "This class provided a wide scope of information across many different areas of psychology. I developed the ability to think critically about these ideas and concepts and how they play a role in the real world.",
    "This course taught me a lot about the basic tenets of the field of psychology. It also provided a lot of analytical skills and inspiration for further study in psychology.",
    "I learned basic Psychology theories and information.",
    "I've never taken anything psychology related in my life before so everything I did in this course was new",
    "A great introduction to the field of psychology, I learned a lot about its foundations, core ideas and experiments!",
    "I learned about the fundamental principles of the field of psychology.",
    "A foundation in a lot of the major branches of psychology",
    "This course was a general overview of topics within the realm of psychology.",
    "I learned about Psychology through lectures, textbook readings, and primary source documents.",
    "I learned so much about the way in which minds function and the ways in which people interact with one another.",
    "I learned a lot about psychology and the different disciplines of psychology and how they apply to real life.",
    "I learned a lot about human psychology (and some animal psychology!) and I felt it was really interesting",
    "I learned about the basics of psychology",
    "Introduction to basic fields of clinical, developmental, social, abnormal, experimental, and personality psychology. Great broad overview survey course.",
    "Fantastic class as far as material goes. I feel like I learned so much! Fascinating and broad overview",
    "Learned the foundations of psychology",
    "Through this course, I gained general foundational knowledge in psychology, as well as more interest in developmental psychology.",
    "I learned a lot taking this class. Overall I enjoyed it. I think that it is a good survey course that gives you information on many aspects of psychology.",
    "Overall basics of psychology",
    "For me, I had not previously taken a psychology course prior to this, so this course allowed me to gain a better understanding of the field overall and ways to think about psychology. It was very much a typical introductory survey course.",
    "I learned basic introduction to the five domains of psychology, and how they are all linked in some way.",
    "I learned a lot of interesting and important information regarding various facets psychology.",
    "Pretty basic intro course, felt like all the BS of AP Psych all over again, but this time surrounded by neurotic Yalies rather than immature high schoolers. It was a fine time, but the grading scales was pretty confusing and not very clear - especially as far as the papers were concerned. For classes that aren't writing credits, there should not be so much criticism on the assignments, especially since we aren't given a chance to write another one. We don't learn our final exam grades, and who knows what this curve is - so your grade may ultimately be determined by forces unbeknownst to you. - III",
    "I learned how various components and functions of the brain are studied, some of the history of psychology (ways paradigms have changed over time), how to design effective studies, and the main ideas of most branches of psychology.",
    "I learned about how people think of things, how our unconscious interacts with and affects our conscious (and vice versa), and lots of other cool things (actually cool stuff I just don't want to write)",
    "I learned a lot about human behavior and why we act the way we do. Also I got an overview of the brain and what parts of it are responsible for certain processes.",
    "Through the reading responses and the book review, I was able to take the course content a step further by finding scientific articles and studies that related to the course. Also, by finding these articles, I was able to study what I was interested in. For example, when we were studying developmental psychology, I was able to study how technology affected childhood development and learning.",
    "I learned specific knowledge about structures and processes of the human brain, as well as methods of analyzing results of scientific studies. I imagine the insight into psychology that I gained from this course will be interesting and useful to me as I meet and work with others.",
    "Psych 110 provided a great overview of the field of psychology, from infant cognition to sensation and perception to the psychology behind attraction. It was really interesting to gain a glimpse into the many different branches of psychology. Additionally, the course encouraged us to design psychological experiments, both in weekly reading responses and in a ten page book review submitted toward the end of the course, which was a valuable skill.",
    "Some random facts about the brain. Basically just tested ability to memorize keywords and definitions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Wish the exams were less focused on material covered in lecture.",
    "I think the book review grading needs to be improved. The TF's grading seemed to differ a lot and some grades were based on disagreement with the student's opinion instead of content or argument.",
    "A weakness of this course is that exams focus so much on very minor details that it doesn't seem like my knowledge of the broad concepts are being tested at all. As such, I performed much better on the exams when I simply memorized the information instead of understanding the information, per se.",
    "I did think the final was substantially harder than either of the two midterms even though I studied the most for the final. Overall I liked the format of having reading responses and two midterms. And thought the layout of the tests was done well. The final exam had a lot of strange details I thought weren't covered much in the class and the slides sometimes could have had more explanation to help when trying to review from the lectures.",
    "The strength of this course is how much material it covers but the weakness is that it doesn't cover anything in much depth. He also is not clear how much to focus on the textbook and how much on his lecture slides. Finally, the workload is just way more than it needs to be. The book review takes some time and reading, if you choose to do it, is time consuming.",
    "Strengths are Professor Dunham's lecturing - he's quick, but keeps it interesting and seems excited about the subject. Weaknesses are that I wish we got more feedback on the tests and got them back. It would've been nice to know why I got the grades I did before the final without having to jump through hoops and setting up a time with my TA.",
    "Strength is that it is interesting material, weakness is that it is a huge lecture and easy to become uninvolved with the material.",
    "I think this is a strong course for anyone who wants a broad sense of the field of psychology. This course lacks in terms of depth of information, but I do not think this is necessarily a bad thing. Take this course early on so that you can determine which specific field in psychology you want to learn more about and then take a more detailed course in that field.",
    "This is a generally good overview course, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning a little bit about psychology. I don't have any suggestions on how it can be improved.",
    "I think some weaknesses are that the questions on tests are very detail specific and not at all generalized or concept related. They test the ability to memorize notes, not on knowledge. Also if you miss little details in lecture due to the speed at which professor Dunham talks you are very likely to not understand a concept and get it wrong on the test.",
    "It's not very interactive or engaging. Without section, it's hard to really dive into the material.",
    "The major strength of this course is Professor Dunham himself; I have never had such an engaging lecturer who, each and every week, made it so exciting to come to class. I also think that the limited flexibility in some assignments (such as choosing your book for the book report, being allowed to forego one of the reading assignments) helped make the course more student-driven and enjoyable. I think the only weakness of this course is that the exams seemed inconsistent in their levels of difficulty; while the first midterm seemed quite easy, the second midterm was significantly harder, and the final exam (in my opinion) fell in between the two midterms in terms of difficulty. I would've expected the final to be harder than both the midterms, so I think perhaps something could be changed with the exams to make them follow student expectations more precisely.",
    "Strengths- Class is very interesting and engaging. Weaknesses- A lot of information, some of it is difficult so there is a lot of studying.",
    "As a rising sophomore who plans to major in psyc, I find this course further convincing me that psychology is worth studying. With only 20 or so lectures, the course cover a wide range of topics from brain, emotion and personality, psychopathology, research methods, learning and memory, intelligence etc.",
    "Lecture slides are online but they are mostly pictures, which forces students to go to class and pay attention. However as a spring sport athlete who had to miss class many days or leave early every class due to practice or games, it was very difficult to be able to take all the notes and understand the concepts even when I received notes from others. If there was a link to video of the lectures it would have been more helpful since every lecture was videotaped.",
    "Lectures were engaging, reading responses were good ways to make sure we stayed on top of our reading, tests were very fair.",
    "The tests are beyond difficult and you have to know a lot of information from lectures and readings.",
    "Overall the course is run very well. Organized and sticks to the schedule with prompt communication. A lot of the material was somewhat challenging, but it seemed like a pretty fair course. I was not a fan of the grading of the book review, which was unfairly low without explanation. Besides this, everything was interesting and reasonable.",
    "Interesting material and presentation; however, the lecture follows the textbook almost exactly.",
    "It was a good intro course, but felt very much like an AP or high school class (with focus on terms, memorization, and multiple choice questions). I think that if the textbook readings were supplemented with more primary source literature and other articles, it would have combined breadth with a bit more depth.",
    "Strength: interesting material Weakness: too many studies to complete and harsh curve",
    "The course does not have much facilitated opportunity for learning outside of lecture itself.",
    "Strengths include the guest speaker lectures and the teaching of experimental methods that led to theories\/conclusions. Weaknesses include a focus on the exams on rote memorization of terms.",
    "I thought this course was awesome. I especially loved the study pool hours, because you got first-hand experience participating in the kinds of studies you read about. I'm uncertain of how it could be improved. Sections are always helpful, but we didn't read a great deal of controversial\/discussable material or need to go over how to do problems, so I don't think this class really needs sections.",
    "Great course, very informative, relevant material. Well taught.",
    "It is a very interesting topic and I know it's impossible with how many people were in the class, but I wish there was section.",
    "Strengths: professor was great, lectures were interesting Weaknesses: weekly reading responses were not very helpful in my understanding of the course material, lecture did not correspond to readings, lecture topics were sometimes disjointed",
    "This course was very well structured. The lecture material was very interesting, readings were interesting, grading was fair, and exams were fair. Teaching fellows seemed to be very responsible, available for questions, and willing to help.",
    "I love this course. I thought the material was so well organized and conveyed in a very approachable but well-paced manner. I really can't think of many weaknesses of the course. One of my favorites that I've taken at Yale.",
    "Strengths of this course were that the lectures were very engaging and easy to follow and the textbook provided great background for each topic. The lectures were engaging particularly because of Professor Dunham, who was great. The TFs were helpful as well.",
    "Effective at communicating material, especially through reading response section. Didn't feel that Book Review was that clearly communicated, but book was great to read. Study pool was cool to experience but I felt that it was easy to see through the studies, since we were learning about them in class, which might not be good for the researchers?",
    "Content\/lectures were very fun! TA staff was essentially useless in my opinion.",
    "This course is ridiculous. First, the material that it attempts to cover is way too broad, therefore there isn't a lot of knowledge that is received, but only interesting facts that one may mention in casual conversation. it is, indeed, just a simple collection of poorly connected facts, and does not even try to establish an overarching framework (like a course in any other stem or social science discipline would).",
    "The reading responses help a lot with comprehension, even though they can feel like a lot. I liked that the deadline was before class rather than the night before. For an intro course, it's not too superficial, so if you are really interested in a certain topic you can delve deeper into it. The book review towards the end of the semester was pretty difficult; it's expected that you either apply the knowledge from the book towards research or to argue against an entire book that was written by a psychology professional. You're not given a rubric or guidelines on how to really structure or organize your argument for the book review, simply vague details on splitting it up into two parts, and you just have to start writing and hope for the best. It felt more like a test to see if I had read the book. That being said, this entire class was amazing, and Prof. Dunham is one of the best lecturers I've ever had at this school!!",
    "Very study based which I liked, grading for the papers wasn't really transparent though, and some of the questions on the exam were surprisingly specific (like recalling a study based off the initials of a patient, which didn't seem to really test psychology knowledge)",
    "Exams were unnecessarily difficult and occasionally asked questions about material not covered in lecture or the book. They were never returned and little feedback was received",
    "It is a very well taught course, however, some aspects of the grading (mandatory psychological experiments) are some weaknesses of it.",
    "The course was pretty well organized, and given the time constraints we were only able to have a brief overview of many of the topics. The TFs were also very helpful overall. I don't think there was enough feedback to help facilitate learning, since the TFs took a very long time to grade all assignments given the student:TF ratio.",
    "The pedagogy of the course design was brilliant. It was great for me to study real-world applications of the material we were learning through TED talks and articles, and the reading responses helped me to formulate original thoughts on the concepts. (Also, it was great not having a test during finals week.)",
    "The curve was super stressful. Does not help with learning. Also the grading on the paper was ambiguous and there were no clear guidelines.",
    "While lectures were engaging and informative, Professor Dunham's \"no text\/ actual information\" on any slides really impeded learning at times; no matter how attentive one is it's rather difficult to never miss a word in over 20 lectures. Also, the workload of the class was at times too much, with the the last few Thursdays having a book report, midterm and final within only a month.",
    "The reading responses were helpful in keeping me up to date with the assigned homework. The class was very engaging and low-stress. It was easy to get lost in the crowd in such a large lecture, so many more student-focused group work would be helpful. I enjoyed the book review and this class maximized in-class learning and minimized out of class stress. The lectures were interesting and although they were long, I had no trouble following along and paying attention. The slides were used as a tool to aid the lecture instead of putting all the words on the slides.",
    "I found the reading responses tedious, but overall the course is well structured.",
    "The course had too much of a work load for the material covered. The curve ruins you, because you can be curved down. If you miss the lectures then you're screwed because you can't learn any of the material from just looking at the lecture slides--in fact the slides are not even given in slide format, they are essentially screenshots of what was on there. This makes it particularly difficult to review the material even if you were in class--you cannot reference any audio or videos that were linked to the slides, nor can you see any animation for demos done in class. The exams don't follow the book, but you have to read it anyways due to the weekly reading assignments.",
    "Very engaging lectures. The exams were extremely picky and each TA graded very differently",
    "Add information and content to lecture slides to facilitate learning the material. One major weakness of the course is the lack of content in the lecture slides. The topics brought up in lecture are very interesting.",
    "This class was very organized and had very clear expectations for the most part. I wished the course was more clear about the expectations for the book review though, or at least that we had received comments on the book reviews, and that we had been able to see specifically which questions we got wrong on our midterms.",
    "I felt as though the grading on the reading responses were unnecessarily harsh.",
    "Strengths: Excellently organized Not too overwhelming Covers many topics Weaknesses: In some areas, there was simply not time to go into depth I sometimes ran into difficulty using canvas, as certain info was hard to find on the site (example: outside study resources, research opportunities)",
    "I thought that the pacing of this class was ideal for an introductory-level course. My favorite part of the course was definitely the book report. I loved having the opportunity to connect concepts that I read about to real-world situations. In fact, once I started looking for examples in my own life, I found them everywhere.",
    "Professor should treat us like adults and let us take notes on a laptop in class. If it hurts our performance, surely that's something for which we should be able to take responsibility. Besides, way better professors already do so. His slides are useless, perhaps on purpose, though I'm not sure how that aids learning. Turning in reading responses on textbook readings is insane. We're in college at Yale, give us some actual psych papers, etc. to respond to, not the same textbook I used in high school.",
    "It is interesting material and there was not too much work. It could be improved by having the lectures more interactive and homework that was really edifying in our understanding of the material -- the reading responses were not very helpful. We could also have had more guide in how to study for the tests.",
    "Very interesting and engaging lecture! The reading responses though aren't the best way to engage with the material however. The textbook is basic and not very interesting.",
    "The lectures were fantastic! Although I took AP Psych and knew some of the material from previous courses, the material was presented in a refreshing, captivating, and clear format.",
    "I have only one comment on this front: one of the TAs, Alexander Noyes, did an unacceptable job of reviewing and grading my book review. His point deductions appeared almost arbitrary, and his few (4!) comments were all insubstantial, incoherent, patently false, or did not interact with my main arguments at all. For the time and effort I applied to this essay, I was extremely disappointed to see such little effort put into grading. A friend of mine in the class, who also had Alexander grade their essay, remarked on Alexander's poor interaction with their content as well. If he did not have time to thoroughly engage with the material students were presenting, perhaps more TAs should be utilized to grade these weighty assignments.",
    "I thought the structure of this class was excellent. In addition to lecture we also had to complete psych studies. This was a great way for us to really engage in psychology application in the real world. One weakness of the class was the difficulty of the exams.",
    "I thought the course was very strong overall. I personally think the reading responses were awesome and wish they were counted as a larger part of the grade, as I put a lot of thought and effort into them and found them very enjoyable.",
    "a way to watch lecture when you're absent for a legitimate reason would be nice.",
    "The tests were really hard and the lectures were really long. I wish there were more opportunities to show what you know outside of just the tests. I also wish we got back exams quicker before the next test!",
    "The lecturer was great, and the design of the course was good.",
    "Strengths are that it truly is very interesting, but the main weakness in my mind was that it was just so much memorization. Didn't require us to problem solve a whole lot",
    "This course is very interesting and very low workload. There is a weekly reading response, two exams, and a final exam. There is also a book report and you have to do lab participation hours. I was originally annoyed because I do research in a lab on campus, but it was actually painless and kinda cool.",
    "I think psychology is a very good lecture class, there is a pretty clear organization to the course, and the lectures are structured in a way to manage the fact that there are so many students in the course. I think the only thing that would have helped with overall engagement was some sort of section system to dive deeper into the material.",
    "I liked the lack of tech. e",
    "I thought that the disconnect between the material in the lectures and the material in the textbook was very confusing. It was hard to know what to study (whether to focus on course material or reading material) because sometimes they did not fit together. I really enjoyed writing all of the reading responses, and loved the book report assignment.",
    "I think the course material was well paced, and Professor Dunham was a great instructor. The workload was pretty high for an intro class, though. Sometimes I felt like the weeks where the textbook material overlapped pretty heavily with lectures, I would have preferred to read some of the papers discussed in lecture than do a long textbook reading assignment and have to write about it in the weekly reading response.",
    "This course was successful in the way it made its content fun in a lecture setting, but the way the material was tested was often frustrating because it relied way too much on memorization of very specific details. Even when I thought I understood the material very well, I'd get below average grades because I missed very niche, not even that applicable information and it was tested as multiple choice. We also never got it exams back, so I never knew what I actually needed to improve, and except for the final, there was very little professor involvement in our learning outside of lecture.",
    "It is taught very well and I think the readings were extremely helpful because they provided another look at information given in the lectures.",
    "I really enjoyed everything about this course and so not have any suggestions for change.",
    "The strength of this course is the scope it covers. I like how it covers such a wide range of material. The weakness is that the amount of readings seems unrealistic.",
    "The course covered a lot of information, but I felt it was very fact\/memorization-based. I felt that the material was a little less engaging at times because of this.",
    "The lectures where great and very helpful. The descriptive and interesting examples were easy to remember. The readings on the other hand were extremely dense and hard to grasp at times, due to the assignment of large chapel era per class meeting.",
    "Textbook and the lectures don't overlap",
    "Strengths: interesting material, fair tests, reasonable amount of weekly reading, engaging lectures Weaknesses: since this is a survey course, we rarely went in-depth about any of the topics we studied beyond 1-2 lectures. This class was an overall very good survey course.",
    "Strength is engaging lectures and interesting content. Weakness is that the exams are very very tricky.",
    "The lectures were very interesting because the course matieral is fun to learn. Occasionally, the textbook would not correspond to the lectures, which was frustrating",
    "Strengths: really comprehensive and adequate overview of what the field of psychology has to offer, very standard, good lecture class for freshmen I would think because the structure is very straight forward and constant, my teaching assistant was very good and responsive and so friendly and kind in answering questions about the exam or the course, etc. Weaknesses: I don't like how we can't keep our exams even though I understand that they reuse old test questions; TFs were also pretty hands off for the most part of the course, you only saw him\/her if you made the conscious effort to see him\/her, very independent course (which isn't always a bad thing disclaimer) but I understand because it's a large class",
    "A strength of this course is that the lecturer is very lively and engaging, and the course covers a great breadth of topics. A weakness of the course is that because there is so much material to cover, often there is not much depth covered in lectures. However, through the weekly reading responses, the course staff allow students to dig further into the topics of interest to them.",
    "I think that the TF's were helpful. The lectures were interesting. However, when it comes to the book report I think a more concrete rubric would be helpful seeing as it seems as though the grading was more subjective.",
    "Interesting material but grading was unfair",
    "The strength of the course was that it covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time. Generally speaking, every lecture discussed another field within psychology. With weaknesses, I think it was sometimes too fast-paced in that we pretty much just breached the surface for the topics we covered, which made it really difficult to follow along sometimes and to take the time to ask questions. It was really hard to get help because we were moving along so quickly that the once-a-week office hours for each TF would not be enough to really try to understand the material. I also think that greater clarity in how the grading works at the beginning of the course would have been helpful--or just greater clarity in the organization of the class. It was somewhat frustrating that an explanation of who our TFs were came maybe a quarter of the way in the semester and that the grade curving was explained right before the final exam.",
    "The content is very interesting, but could be delivered in a more engaging way, especially since the class is a long lecture period.",
    "The lecture material is interesting. Readings from the textbook are easy to read and are helpful, but they frequently cover much more material than is assessed on exams. One way to improve is to cut down on the reading activity and streamline them to have only the most pertinent ones. When you ask students to study what is supposedly an empirical science, you're grading should be empirical as well. Also, the emphasis on establishing a curve on the course overall is disconcerting when the specific grades for each exam are determined by so few answers and each one is graded purely from a key that is sometimes fraught with error and vague answers. The course should be changed to either be more empirical and quantitative in how it tests you, or to be more personalized, i.e. making the multiple choice on the exams more clear in what they are asking or establishing clearer standards for essay sections. This assessment method seems to have arbitrarily disadvantaged students that may have worked the hardest and had learned the most about the material.",
    "I thought this course did a good job of introducing students to a wide range of psychological projects. I do wish there were room for student discussion. For instance, Professor Dunham might have--during lecture--asked a question to the class and asked for volunteers to offer an answer\/response. That way, the class could be more interactive. This class also had a substantial amount of assignments, especially for an introductory class. Perhaps the number of study credits could be decreased? Also, some of the information on the exams seemed random and unnecessarily challenging and obscure.",
    "Pretty basic intro course, felt like all the BS of AP Psych all over again, but this time surrounded by neurotic Yalies rather than immature high schoolers. It was a fine time, but the grading scales was pretty confusing and not very clear - especially as far as the papers were concerned. For classes that aren't writing credits, there should not be so much criticism on the assignments, especially since we aren't given a chance to write another one. We don't learn our final exam grades, and who knows what this curve is - so your grade may ultimately be determined by forces unbeknownst to you. - III",
    "Strengths: well organized, clear lectures, lots of material covered. Weaknesses: assignments that don't really test an understanding of psychology and the material (eg mandatory participation in studies, reading responses)",
    "Strengths are that it was very engaging, interesting topics and cool lectures. Also the work level was good, no busy work. Weaknesses are that there was not that much chance for interactive learning, just lectures (but they're good ones)",
    "The lectures were engaging but the book review I didn't think was graded fairly enough.",
    "Strength: Inviting the guest lecturers in to the classroom was a good way to break away from the typical set up of the class. Weakness: As a student who went to class, it was sometimes difficult when I wanted to review from the class slides because there were hardly any notes posted on them. I understand why this is done for students who don't attend lecture, but I would have liked to have had more information on the slides.",
    "The course is comprehensive and includes exciting examples of psychological phenomena that help maintain students' interest. I felt that the book review project was a very important aspect of the course, as it forced us to think about and contrast scientific and popular interpretations of psychological studies - an important theme throughout the course. At times, I felt some of the questions on tests were focused too narrowly on specific details rather than key concepts, but overall, I think the assessments and grading in this course were fair.",
    "One strength of the course is that it provided a broad overview of many branches of psychology, going in depth enough in each to be interesting, but not enough to be too technical or difficult to understand for students in an introductory class. I liked being able to focus on a different aspect of psychology each lecture. I also liked the format of the reading responses in that teaching fellows didn't simply want a regurgitation of the reading, but rather a critical response, including posing questions and designing experiments. One weakness is the sheer size of the class, in that if prevents the professor from being able to answer questions during class.",
    "More emphasis on critical thinking and asking questions, less on route memorization. Putting more information into the slides would also be helpful.",
    "The lectures were pretty interesting and because there was a lack of descriptive text on ever slide, you were forced to come to class and pay attention. It wasn't all too difficult, but because there were no official section meeting times, it was hard to interact with your TF unless you made an appointment; particularly, it would've been more helpful if we were able to have better ease of access to our midterm exams so we can see where we needed to improve for the final."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fair but interesting class that covers a lot of information and is overall cool to learn about.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this as a fun elective to learn something you don't have experience with. If you know that you like psychology, then take it but there are so many more intellectually fulfilling classes at Yale and this just felt like a lot of work for very little reward. Mindless memorization and little thought.",
    "Yes! But would only recommend it if you have the time to devote towards it. It's not a crazy workload but you'll definitely get more out of the class if you put more into it.",
    "I would recommend this class strictly because most upper level of psychology classes require that you take Intro Psych. In general, I don't think this course is very engaging but it's interesting at times and you really do have to talk it before being allowed to take other classes.",
    "I would recommend this course. As far as introductory psychology courses go, I think this is pretty standard, but I think every college student should have to take psychology before graduating. It's not too intellectually challenging, but psychology is common knowledge and something graduating college students should feel comfortable speaking about.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student; it is interesting and challenging but not too bad--it stays engaging the whole term. Definitely a good one.",
    "Yes. It was interesting and lectures were engaging.",
    "Intro to Psych is a great course for any student who wishes to gain a fairly comprehensive background in psychology. Even if you've already taken an intro psych class in high school (i.e. AP Psych), you will still learn many great things in this course. The lecturer, Professor Dunham, is incredibly engaging and makes an entire lecture hall of students want to become psychologists every Tuesday and Thursday. Take it! Everyone should understand how humans act and think, and Intro to Psych is the best way to figure others (and yourself) out.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in psychology or even not interested.",
    "Yes, and this is perhaps one of the best intro classes at Yale. Whether you are a cog sci\/psyc major, this class is very much worth taking.",
    "It is definitely an interesting class but they do cover a lot of information in a short amount of time. Lots of fun videos and experiments that help understand concepts. NOT a gut",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Psychology is incredibly interesting and applicable in everyday life. Whether you have previous experience with the subject, or this would be your first time taking the course, I highly recommend you take the leap and learn about a lot of the concepts that guide our everyday choices and behaviors.",
    "Yes I would. Fun general course while also providing a challenge to the students. Learned a lot from the course.",
    "Yes, good intro to psych class.",
    "No, the curve is harsh, Dunham curves down. And the 5 psych studies seems unnecessary.",
    "If you do not need to take intro I would recommend taking a course that is focused on one field of psychology.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who need an easier 5th class. The material is largely just rote memorization with very little application of concepts aside from a few experimental techniques. Some learned info was cool, but as is usually the nature of intro psych, it is not very intellectually stimulating due to the breadth rather than depth of the course. For the MCAT or something, you could definitely just memorize all this on your own without a course.",
    "Yes, super fascinating material presented in an interesting way. Not that much work and an overall great introductory course.",
    "Yes. This course has a lot of relevant information that applies to a lot of circumstances in life.",
    "Yes if you're interested in the topic of psychology, it's an interesting and worthwhile course to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. No matter what you are studying, it is always good to know the basics of human psychology, and almost all material has applications in everyday life.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I found the material exciting and really expanded my understanding of psychology, so much so that i thought about what we talked about in class often when I was outside of it.",
    "If you are interested in learning more about how and why we think, feel, and behave the ways we do, definitely take this course. I would recommend this course to another student because the topics are fascinating and it is very rewarding to grasp the material and realize how it provides insight into everyday life. The professor was great and from what I have heard, the course's other professors are as well.",
    "A great course with Yarrow Dunham! Do the reading, go to lecture, and it's easy to learn a lot of interesting material!",
    "Yes, because for a psychology class, this was an interesting class and the lectures were very enjoyable.",
    "Take it only if you need to take it. And even if you need to take it, try to substitute it with something else, it really is an uninteresting class and you won't take a lot from it.",
    "Yes! For both psych majors and non-psych majors. Psych majors don't really have a choice, but for non-psych majors who may be interested in a psychology, this is a great course to take! It's really fun and it's super interesting. The exams are challenging, but not impossible, and they're not trying to throw curveballs at you: Everything's either from lecture or from the book. Take it with Prof. Dunham, sometimes he shows us funny videos!",
    "Yeah, fun course, teaches some good stuff to know",
    "Still yes! Very well organized and interesting",
    "This is a pretty good course, but it is a very shallow dive into psychology given the breadth of material covered. I would still recommend taking it as an introductory course.",
    "Would absolutely recommend. It's an excellent course with a wonderful teaching staff. You'll leave every class in awe of how our brains and minds work and adapt and make us who we are.",
    "No, this class is not helpful at all. The TAs are very bad and the curve is terrible. Never take this stupid class! Never!",
    "Don't take this class. The curve is bad and not conducive towards learning. The material is nothing that you wouldn't already know intuitively.",
    "This class is good, but beware the workload. It's not hard in the conventional sense: the material is engaging and rather easy to grasp. The workload' however is a lot, with reading responses, midterms, a 15 page book report, a research requirement and a final, do no consider this class your easy 5th class; as doing well requires a lot of work. That being said, Professor Yarrow is a very engaging lecturer who did a great job keeping lectures entertaining; 1hour15 flew by!",
    "Would recommend if you're interested in psychology and are diligent with reading",
    "Probably not. It is a lot of work for an introductory course.",
    "Yes because it offers a lot of useful material for both those who are premed, psychology, or just interested in subjects pertaining to human and animal psychology.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "This class is great to balance out some more challenging classes. The exams and the homework is really, really fair. If you attend class and put in a baseline level of work, you will succeed.",
    "Intro Psych is an amazing course covering a broad scope of concepts in modern psychology. I took it my senior year and I can't believe I almost graduated without taking it... Definitely recommend this class if you're looking for something super interesting, and it's a dream to Cr\/D\/F. Go to all the lectures and listen\/take notes, do as much work as you want, engage with the course. It's worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a fun SO credit; the workload may be more than comparable courses but the material is interesting",
    "No. Many people I know took it for the pre-med requirement. If that is the case, I would recommend waiting until fall semester. The workload of this class was much higher as compared to that of students who took this course with other professors. The grading also seemed quite skewed.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Very interesting",
    "Absolutely. Even if you don't think you'll pursue a major in psychology, the concepts learned in intro psych are still incredibly useful in everyday life and will help you learn more about yourself and the people that you interact with every day.",
    "yes",
    "Yes! Dunham is clear and articulate, and always happy to speak with students. I also think that a basic understanding of psych can be informative for many areas of study, and to miss the opportunity to learn the basics from the best is a true setback.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in the field of psychology, especially because it is a prerequisite for many higher-level classes. However, I think this class would be incredibly valuable even for a student who did not plan to take other psychology classes later on in their Yale career.",
    "If you've taken AP Psych, I'd avoid this. There's very little that wasn't covered there. No laptop policy is just infantilizing. You have to submit weekly reading responses to textbook readings, which is a bit nuts (though in reality everyone just churns out nonsense for them anyway), and the Prof's slides are useless. On the other hand, it's not actually a hard class.",
    "It was an alright course that is a requirement for the psych major and good for a broad but shallow overview, so if that is what someone is looking for, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes. Yarrow is a great lecturer. You will be interested and engaged with the material.",
    "Yes! This course material is just interesting to know for daily living and social interactions with others! Professor Dunham is a great lecturer and I learned a lot from him. My TAs was great in terms of providing feedback on the reading responses. The workload is not a lot: just a reading response a week, 2 midterms, and a final, along with a book report. This is a must-take course, no matter what you are majoring in!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think it is a great introduction to psychology and provides a good sense of the many different areas that are a part of psychology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because I think it's very useful knowledge to have, taught in a thoughtful and engaging way.",
    "yes! very interesting and the grade is clearly outlined and they want you to do well and learn. prof Dunham is great",
    "If that student is a good tester and interested in psychology then yes.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Yes, I feel as though all students should have a background in intro psych. It's very interesting and things you have probably been wondering about your whole life but didn't know actually had a name and had been studied before!",
    "Yes! Everyone should have knowledge of psychology.",
    "If you haven't taken AP psychology like me, definitely recommend intro to psyc as a good starting point!",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student very interested in pursuing Psychology as a course of study.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course if you have any interest in psychology it seems like a good foundation for any other psych classes you may want to take. It is quite a lot of work though for an intro class (2 midterms, a book review, readings due basically every class + weekly reading responses, and a final), so I wouldn't take it anticipating an easy workload. Professor Dunham is an engaging lecturer, though, and easy to approach for help, as are the TAs.",
    "This course is eh. Professor Dunham is a pretty good lecturer, but the course is so large that it falls into the trap of being impersonal and letting students slip through the cracks. Reading responses were little more than busy work--the TFs only really look at the first few before they just grade them hastily with little to no feedback. Speaking of, feedback was a pretty big weakness of this course--rarely was there any, so it was hard to improve your test-taking skills. The exams were never that hard, but it was near impossible to know all of the specific details, so many people would feel prepared and then not do very well.",
    "Absolutely, yes. This course is a great way to be introduced to psychology at Yale and the people who are involved in it.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. I really loved it and thought all of the material was extremely interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I believe that the information learned is really interesting and applicable to life. I think you are missing out on invaluable information that everyone should know if you don't take this course.",
    "Yes. I enjoyed the course a lot.",
    "I would recommend it only if you have no prior psychology knowledge",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in psychology. It is a great intro class with a reasonable workload and interesting material. Also, it is a prerequisite for most higher level psychology courses so it is helpful to take if a student is interested at all in the psychology major. Curve is relatively harsh, though, and cumulative final is difficult and covers a lot of information.",
    "I'm biased because I love psychology, but everyone should take this class! If you don't want to work hard in it, just credit d it. Trust me the content is worth it!! Studying isn't even painful, it's enjoyable",
    "I would recommend this solid intro psych class",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to study or even just explore and experience psychology. It's a very interesting field and a very broad one as well but it is well-taught and the professor gives a good comprehensive overview. Tests are okay, some tricky questions, final is before finals week so it can be convenient. The readings for class are really interesting and good to review before class",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants a general introduction to the fundamental topics in psychology.",
    "Yes, I think that this course is one that everyone should take because it helps you to understand important things about yourself, others and the way we interact as humans.",
    "If they improve their grading system, yes",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, but I would advise other students to go in with the mentality that this is very much a fast-paced survey course. You will be able to leave the course with far more knowledge of various topics in psychology and various experiments than you knew to begin with, but you will not be able to explore or understand topics in greater depth.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students somewhat interested in psychology. However, only if you're willing to put in some work into attending the lectures. Attending class is critical to doing well because the tests draw directly from lectures, and are very specific.",
    "Yes, if you want a thorough overview of psychology in the areas that we engage with on a daily basis, take this course!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Great course for everyone to take!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Pretty basic intro course, felt like all the BS of AP Psych all over again, but this time surrounded by neurotic Yalies rather than immature high schoolers. It was a fine time, but the grading scales was pretty confusing and not very clear - especially as far as the papers were concerned. For classes that aren't writing credits, there should not be so much criticism on the assignments, especially since we aren't given a chance to write another one. We don't learn our final exam grades, and who knows what this curve is - so your grade may ultimately be determined by forces unbeknownst to you. - III",
    "I think this course does a good job at giving an introduction to the main branches of psychology, as well as some of its history and the design of studies. I recommend this course to students who want a broad introduction to psychology, or who want to see whether psychology might interest them.",
    "Yes. It was enjoyable and yet useful, I don't feel like it was a waste of a class even though it's not related to my major at all",
    "Yes this a great intro course especially for people looking to find their interests.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides an interesting insight into how the human mind works.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think students with varied interests will find this course interesting and useful as a survey of a prominent field in today's society. Further, this course could encourage students to further explore specific sub-fields of psychology that fascinate them.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially if he\/she was interested in psychology or considering it as a potential major. It contained some fascinating information and I genuinely looked forward to lecture each week. Even for a student not interested in psychology or even science, I think this course does a great job of relating the material to the real world in a way which everyone can appreciate.",
    "No",
    "Not particularly. I don't feel that I learned much about the human psyche.",
    "The course is lecture format with reading responses every week, a single book review paper, and a few midterms in between. Overall, it's an interesting course that presents a broad overview of psychology and the many sectors within it. It was pretty easy to keep up with the material, but the slides don't have extensive, descriptive text so you have to show up to class and pay attention if you want to understand some of the specific details not explicitly mentioned in the textbook (seems to be a trend in PSYC courses). The class isn't too difficult and you don't have to put as much work into it compared to other STEM classes."
