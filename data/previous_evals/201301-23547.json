    "As an opportunity to apply the policy sciences framework to a specific case study, I found this course incredibly valuable and transformative. Also, there are no questions here asking for a review of the TF, Lily Sweikert, but I would like to take the time to express how fundamentally important she was to the course. She kept everything running smoothly and helped keep everyone organized during the field trip. She put in many, many more hours of work than she was compensated for, and our class benefitted immensely from her presence.",
    "Question 1: readings were entirely written by the professor or students of the professor. I think this was very biased and the readings were focused primarily on the policy sciences or interdisciplinarity\/integration. Very few of the readings were focused on the actual course topic of large-scale conservation. In the future, I would like to have more variety of authors that actually address large-scale conservation issues, or alternatively, the course should be advertised for what it is - a course about policy sciences.Question 2: out of class assignments varied from being very helpful to unhelpful and time consuming. The appraisal paper and the presentation were most helpful, while assignments like short reflection papers were not useful. Unsure if the professor actually read any of the work handed in since we did not receive feedback outside of in class time",
    "The field trips were the highlights of this course",

Of all the courses I've taken at this school, the insights gained through working with her have been some of the most valuable.",

While there is definitely something to be said for treating students as equals and as all adults, student life is incredibly hectic and busy, and if there is no hard deadline or if we know we won't be held accountable to the readings, then they become not the top priority. I think increasing accountability to readings and discussions would help the content of the course.Also, the vast amount of literature was by Susan Clark herself, which meant that we didn't see other perspectives or a critique of the recommended process. What are the limitations and pitfalls of this approach?",
