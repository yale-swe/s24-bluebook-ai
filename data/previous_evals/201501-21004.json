   "comments": [
    "A LOT of reading but a valuable introduction to Dickens and Eliot, Professor Markovits is intimidating at first but incredibly kind and helpful if you go and talk to her.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, because it is an excellent survey of two very important authors that everyone should get to know. I think that for most students there are too many pages assigned every week to be able to read the novels thoroughly, which can be frustrating if you don't realize that might be a problem with the course going into it. Prof. Markovits is sometimes overly broad in her questions, and sometimes class discussion lulls or is not especially productive. Her comments on your writing are very pointed and helpful, and going to office hours is always very interesting and helpful.",
    "Fun and engaging reading list with fascinating discussions.",
    "It's great; take it. Be prepared for the reading!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It has been a treat - more pleasure than work! I am truly surprised at the depth and detail of our discussions in class, since I did not expect that would be possible given the volume of material we were covering each week."

    "I have a new appreciation for the \"medievalisms\" of Victorian novels.",
    "It was immensely helpful in consolidating my knowledge about these two Victorian writers. It definitely got me thinking more scrupulously about a number of issues swirling around the books we discussed, and what I learned will continue to reverberate through my studies.",
    "This course has given me a far deeper of knowledge of two major novelists and has given me a broader view of the period and the novel as a genre. Although this course does not directly relate to my chosen areas of research, it has significantly improved my knowledge of a period I had otherwise neglected (and won't neglect again!)."
