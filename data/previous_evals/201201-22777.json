   "comments": [
    "Fascinating material, and minimal workload. If you have any interest in history at all, I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes, yes! It's so valuable to look at modern history from a non-Western point of view, which from this course you learn dominates the narrative of world history more than you might think. Plus, Snyder's lectures are engaging and fast-paced -- you won't be bored. Also the workload isn't too constantly demanding, but you learn a lot.",
    "Amazing. Truly amazing. The best history course that I have taken at Yale, or ever, by far. And I have loved my history courses here! You will develop an intellectual crush on Timothy Snyder on Day 1. Guaranteed. Also, if you're willing to do most of the reading (which can be dense), then this seems totally doable non-Credit\/D. If you're just there to listen to Snyder speak (and, sometimes, joke) about Eastern Europe and its sad modern history and what it means for them and everyone else, Credit\/D also works. Best class ever!",
    "YES YES YES. The history of eastern europe is very rich and complex, and sadly many times ignored in the study of european history. TAKE IT!!",
    "This is an excelent class and definitely a must-take for someone interested in history. It completely changes the vision on Eastern Europe.",
    "I would take Eastern European History as a nice complement to my other courses. For me it was the only non-science course in my schedule. It was great in this role as not being overly demanding but at the same time engaging and giving me a different type of work to do. The material learnt is very interesting and made me think about the history of communism.",
    "Awesome class, you learn so much. Also, Snyder is an amazing lecturer, he has all of these funny little jokes or anecdotes that he throws in. TAKE ITTT",
    "This is a pretty standard history class, and Snyder is a great lecturer. The readings are incredibly long, so I would recommend skimming them if you do take the class. If you're not interested in Eastern European history or don't care to remember a bunch of Polish, Croatian, etc. names, don't take it. But if you want a very comprehensive look at WWI, WWII, and post-war life in Eastern Europe, definitely take it. There is no one I'd rather have lecturing me than Snyder.",
    "be prepared to write as fast as you can and make sure you get an outline, tim snyder is great",
    "TAKE IT. If you're AT ALL interested in the history of Eastern Europe (and even if you're not) it's a fantastic course. I hate history and I loved it. Don't miss a chance to listen to Timothy Snyder lecture, and don't be turned off by his no-laptops-no-phones policy. He will change your world.",
    "Yes.History Major?Definitely take it.Not History Major?Take it anyway. Maybe credit D to make it easier?",
    "History 264 was an incredible course. People sustained intense clapping for a long time at the end of the last class.Snyder's perspective on Eastern European History is extremely enlightening, and different from the different accounts one usually has of WW2 for example.Snyder's lecture style is fast, but easy to follow as he gives out sheets with the structure of each class session.The best.",
    "MUST TAKE! Should be required for all history majors. Feel like I never understood European or World history before this course. Tim Snyder is one of the best lecturers at yale. The world load isn't too hard. Be careful for the 2nd map test though. Learn random treaties not just the big three. OVERALL TAKE IT or you will regret it! Read the entirety of Bloodlands. It is amazing!",
    "Great class in general. Glad I took it, even though it was Cr\/D. I honestly wished the classes ended at 3:45 and not 3:20 so that Snyder wouldn't have to rush so much to fit all his material in. The class moves fast.",
    "Professor Snyder is a total fucking badass. I doubt they'll actually include this review, but if they do, you must take the course. And if Eastern Europe isn't your favorite topic, it will be by the end of the semester. Also, you don't really have to do the reading. I wish I had done more, but my grades were always very high, and I didn't read a page after week 3.",
    "Definitely take this class! Whether you're interested in the rise and fall of communism or just the World Wars, it's fascinating and Professor Snyder is an incredible lecturer.",
    "This is a pretty good course. The lecture is interesting and Snyder does a good job. It's a lot of info and reading and the speed of the course is pretty quick. I would recommend it, but I think the work load is fairly sizable. However, there aren't that many examinations, just two map quizzes, a mid-term and a final.",
    "Great class, a must take. Most courses gloss over eastern european history, so this a great opportunity to learn a lot about a different vantage point.",
    "Take this class. Just do it. It's so good. And so interesting. And Snyder is excellent.",
    "This is a phenomenal class. The lectures are storytelling time and while there's a ton of material to get through, it's super interesting and the evaluations are fair. Beware there's tons of reading and section is extremely unhelpful. But overall this is one of the best classes I'vetaken at Yale and I absolutely loved it. Snyder is the best....such a great lecturer and hilarious in an understated way.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I am serious. Yes, there is a lot of (fascinating!) reading, and yes your hand will cramp trying to keep up with Professor Snyder's lecturing pace, but the class is SO AMAZING you will not care. The whole of WLH 119 was filled every single lecture.For GLBL Security people - this class fulfills a security credit, and is actually fun! Definitely check it out.",
    "Yes, this is a great lecture. Snyder is awesome. The lectures are nonstop but very interesting.",
    "Great course. Interesting professor and topic. Cool to learn about eastern Europe when that's something you don't learn much about In high school. Snyder rocks.",
    "Best class at Yale for me so far. Amazing lectures! absolutely wonderful! Everyone, everyone MUST take this course! Especially if you have any interest in the time period and history in general. Snyder is totally amazing.",
    "Definitely take this course. Prof. Snyder's lectures are absolutely brilliant. This is a rare gem of a history lecture. The workload is definitely manageable (map quizzes, midterm, final), and while the reading load is heavy, you do not need to read all of it thoroughly to understand what is going on in class.",
    "This course is really fantastic and most definitely worth taking. I knew very little about the subject and left the course feeling like I had a very good sense of it, and really enjoyed learning the material. I took this course credit d and I think that was a good choice. Although there is not a ton of work and the grading is very fair, I felt like I could not do a lot of reading, still do well enough on tests and quizzes, and feel like the course was still extremely valuable to my overall education.",
    "Definitely, take it for sure. The course material is incredibly interesting and the lectures are some of the best I've had at Yale. It's definitely not a gut, but it won't kill you either. Overall absolutely worth the effort.",
    "Take this class. Professor Snyder is one of the best professors I have ever had, and you get to learn about an area of the world that you probably know little to nothing about.",
    "This is not the course to take if you want a basic outline of the events in Eastern Europe in 1914. It will be more enjoyable if you have some background information before you take the course. Professor Snyder is extremely knowledgeable about details, personal stories etc. (you can find this in his book Bloodlands) and if you have basic background information, this level of knowledge will be very enriching. If, however, you've never taken a history course before at Yale, you may find it a little frustrating.",
    "For sure, it's amazing. The best history class I've taken at Yale, hands down.",
    "Definitely take this course! It's a fast-moving, thoroughly engaging survey of one of the most interesting (and essential) regions in the 20th Century. I especially recommend it to those interested in political philosophy and intellectual history, since, as Prof. Snyder presents it, ideas defined Eastern Europe Since 1914 to an usually great extent. Prof. Snyder is a wonderful, highly organized lecturer, and it's obvious why he has such a stellar recommendation, both at Yale and in the world.",
    "wow, this is an absolutely remarkable course. Tim Snyder is the premier historian in his field and also a magnificent lecturer. I've never attended lectures with such clear theses, arguments, and trajectories. You also shouldn't sell Eastern Europe short (in other words, one does not take EE since 1914 despite the subject matter because the professor is so good). EE in the 20th century is the testing ground for two grand ideological experiments, and the locus of perhaps the worst things that humanity has ever done.Two criticisms:1) Snyder is not approachable, in part because he's so intimidating and in part because he's constantly jetting off to important conferences. That's okay - his mind is probably better spent advancing the discipline of history than dealing with us.2) This course does not offer competing historical interpretations. There is Snyder's interpretation - and the congruent interpretations of the reading's he assigns - and the course asks you to learn this line. No deviations! But, in all seriousness, you won't be asked to engage in historical argument - to negotiate competing schools of thought - but to learn the period as Snyder understands it very, very well.",
    "This was my favorite class at yale so far, mostly because of Snyder's lecturing. Take it!! The exams aren't too difficult, but Snyder is hilariously witty and his lectures are incredible, and there is a huge collection of interesting readings.",
    "FANTASTIC COURSE. This class tackles a tremendous amount of material in a very methodical and entertaining way.Professor Snyder is the perfect lecturer. During shopping period I listend to his first lecture and knew immediately I'd love the class. At the end of each lecture without fail I turned to my friends and said, \"That was a really good one.\"I knew nothing about Eastern Europe before this class, and it provided an excellent post 1914 overview.",
    "YES. Take it.",
    "Great class, so interesting!!",
    "TAKE IT. It will change the way you look at the history of the 20th century.",
    "Each lecture was gripping in a way I'd never felt at Yale, in all my four years there. I would've liked more cohesion and carry-through among the lectures, but I understand that's not possible with the course embracing so many national histories over the 20th century. It was fascinating to learn how various ideologies were tested out in the region, often disastrously. I'd definitely recommend, just make sure to study for the map quizzes (especially the IDs!!).",
    "Any student who is interested in history or world happenings",
    "History 264 is an extremely interesting class, you will come away learning about some of the most important historical events in the 20th century.",
    "Yes-- take it! Amazing course",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody - history majors and science majors. Don't take it credit D. You'll regret it.",
    "HIST 264 gives an overview of Eastern European history from 1914 until the present. It is organized both topically and chronologically and covers major themes of Eastern European history during the period, including: the decline of empires and rise of nation states; WWI, WWII and the interwar years; the Holocaust and political purgings; the rise and fall of Communism in Eastern Europe; and contemporary challenges of integration with Europe.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Great course. Gives a comprehensive history of the area. Snyder is a great lecturer and really knows what he is talking about. His book is amazing",
    "This class is a great history lecture.",
    "Yes, if you like history you will like this course.",
    "This is a great class. The course work won't kill you, but if you have time and do all the readings you will be enormously gratified. Snyder, of course, is a legend.",
    "If you need a European History credit, this is the class to take.",
    "Yes. Doesn't go into as much depth as other history courses, but if you don't know much about eastern Europe in this period, you should take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "OMG TAKE IT!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is extremely interesting, and Professor Snyder is a great lecturer.",
    "An excellent survey class of Eastern Europe from 1914 on. Timothy Synder is one of the very best lecturers at Yale - organized, insightful, clear, and charming. The reading is good and substantial, and the class generally attracts an engaged group of students for section.",
    "HIST 264 is a beautifully constructed and delivered series of lectures on the history of Eastern Europe in the last century. Snyder leads the class through a series of historical case studies, mostly chronologically ordered, exploring each country's reactions to each new historical context. Be warned that there is a lot of reading, which you will not feel that you have to do, but you will only get as much out of the class as you put into it. The other main drawback is the lack of a paper--evaluation is only through two quizzes, the midterm, and the final--and the material is interesting enough that you will find several things you would want to write a paper about, but you don't get the opportunity to delve deeper into anything."
