   "comments": [
    "This course gives a pretty comprehensive review of the literature on using PET imaging to investigate substance abuse, with a strong emphasis on nicotine dependence research. You'll leave with a firm understanding of the fundamentals of PET imaging and analysis methods, as well as the implicit assumptions of the method. You will also read 3 or 4 fMRI papers. I would recommend the course because I learned a lot about PET and the instructors were great. The really enjoyed a lot of the assignments in the class, such as the design-a-thons (though I wish these had been done differently with more time to prepare in advance). I especially enjoyed the final project for the class.",
    "Summary: Read papers and write summaries. Class was supposed to be discussion based but ends up being a lecture with questions at the end and sometimes an activity. I would recommend this class. I was unfortunate to have one personality in the class that made it unenjoyable but I would recommend it for others.",
    "Yes! Highly recommended.",
    "A great class if you are wanting to know more about the field of imaging. No previous knowledge really necessary due to the great professors teaching it - all of whom have extensive knowledge and can fill in the gaps wherever is needed. A nice complement to an existing course load.",
    "Imaging Drugs in the Brain is an engaging high level course that explores the depth and breadth of the Physics and Neurobiology of various neuroimaging methods employed in studying the effects of drugs on the brain. The class also sharpens students skills in extracting, summarizing and communicating the most salient parts of research papers. I will recommend the course to students looking to use neuroimaging in their research. It provides the much needed foundation for such students.",
    "A discussion based seminar course which reviews fundamental papers in the field of brain imagining, as well as current research being done at Yale. I would definitely recommend this class to students who are interested in going into or are currently in the brain imaging field. To those who are not, this class still can be very informative and entertaining"

   "comments": [
    "I am a graduate student in a neuroimaging (fMRI) lab. My background, however, has been primarily in basic science research working in animal models, so I am very new to the field of human neuroimaging. I took this course to gain a better understanding of neuroimaging methodology, experimental design, and advantages and limitations of different techniques. I now have a much better understanding of PET methods, but I do wish that the class had spent more time focusing on fMRI, especially principles of fMRI analysis methods.",
    "Good exposure to the field. Direct application to my research.",
    "The interaction of drugs with neurotransmitter systems is the basis of virtually all CNS medications and understanding the underlying concepts is essential to studying old and emerging phamarcologic interventions to neurological disorders. NSCI 523 01 exposed me to the depth and breadth of how to use modern imaging techniques to study this phenomenon. Not only did it help me grasp the neurobiology of common CNS disorders with their associated neurotransmitter systems, it also gave me an appreciation of the physical concepts employed by imaging techniques to study these systems. Although my present research is unrelated to this course, it is sure a valuable knowledge that will remain useful for me as a neuroscientist."
