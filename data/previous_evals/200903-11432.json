    "This was one of the more work-intensive writing classes I've taken at Yale. The smart practice of forcing students to print out their classmates' stories makes the reading process more focussed and intense. The exercises were not entirely useful; I felt the presence of a pedagogy of anxiety, in which the constant worry of these classes (\"can one teach writing? can one teach writing?\") results in \"exercises\" that try to teach a particular piece of \"craft.\" Bah. Humbug. That's not to say I didn't enjoy or learn from the exercises, or that research wasn't a cool topic upon which to meditate--just that I'm suspicious of \"exercises,\" end felt that there was an element of the lab notebook phenomenon (at least they'll have something to show for their ninth grade biology class).The class dynamic was very good though, which I attribute directly to the instructor's strategies for structuring it and making us conscious of how we spoke. Overall a great class--you'll get out what you put into your drafts.Emily Barton't lovely--very personable, friendly, and human. Very diligent. A bit neurotic about small things (margin justifications, say), but a careful reader of student work, who cares a lot, and is great just to talk to during office hours. I hope that as she ages, she'll have more confidence to talk more about her experience and general thoughts, as other writer teachers I've had here do--I think there is a kind of authority she still seems to be negotiating, and her compromise with it seems to be heavily weighted towards structure, objectivity, and space for student voices, which is very good in its warmth and openness, but deprives us of more of the really spot-on observations she has about fiction is general and life and all.",
    "The class is primarily a forum within which students can benefit from one another's comments on stories in progress. The overall quality of the class depends highly on the balance of students within it. A strength is the proper amount of diversity in class exercises -- sometimes writing in class, short activities, group discussions about assigned readings, and student workshops.",
    "I assume that if you are applying for this course, you are interested in fiction writing, and so if you get in, you should definitely take it, because it will teach you a lot about fiction writing. Emily Barton is a great teacher.",
    "Fantastic course. Definitely the more you put in, the more you get out of it. If you work hard on your pieces and do a little of the reading recommended to you by professor Barton, I guarantee your writing will improve.",
    "As anyone choosing whether to take this class would have applied with the intention of getting in, my recommendation seems like a moot point; however, I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is looking to write in a supportive, cheerful, but still challenging atmosphere. Professor Barton is wonderful!",
    "Intermediate Fiction is a great writing class. I haven't taken another writing workshop, so I can't really compare. But Emily Barton is a good instructor--moves the class discussion along and helpful comments on papers. The class requires workshopping two stories and completing several short weekly writing assignments about incorporating research into writing.",
    "Prof. Barton is excellent - a great combination of basic and advanced principles of fiction.",
    "Yes. Definitely take this class, both to have a workshop experience and to work with Professor Barton."
