    "Easy half credit...meets every other week and the labs require almost zero work outside of class time. There are two field trips, both of which are fun, and a Fall Break trip to go on if you want. The only bad thing is that they surprise you at the end with a 10-page final paper, and you are given absolutely no direction on it. All you are told is it should be \"something to do with geology\"....",
    "Sure, take it if you need an easy lab. Every other week meetings, an okay intro to field geology, and more drawing of topo maps than you will ever do again in your life. Lab reports are easy, final paper is unstructured and annoying, but doable. Danny and Dave love what they do, and you can learn a lot from them if you take the time to pay attention.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the lab because it gives you exposure to geology in the field and the basic techniques! Both professors are very enjoyable and knowledgeable.",
    "Good opportunity to apply what you learn in lecture",
    "This lab is easy, fun and can definitely be taken without the class, especially if you have some geology background. I would highly recommend going on the October break field trip--you'll probably learn more about rocks during the trip than during the rest of the class.",
    "Yes. It's a low-commitment class, though I wish it were higher, since it would afford more time to build some of the technical skills of geology - cartography, surveying, mineral identification, etc. Don't take this course if you don't plan to do the roadtrip - it's really the highlight of the class. On the whole, it was the classes I looked forward to most this semester.",
    "Easy half-credit class. There is very little work, it meets once every two weeks. The field trip over fall break is fun.",
    "Fantastic lab for anyone interested in geology. The field trips are a blast, and the learning is very hands-on and engaging."
