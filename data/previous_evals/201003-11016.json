    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "An overview course on various diseases ranging from autoimmune to infectious. Don't expect to go very in depth into individual diseases. But you can expect to hear very interesting lectures on each. Be prepared to hear about inflammation... a lot.",
    "I would summarize it as a semi-detailed overview of mostly common diseases and their underlying molecular causes and potential treatments. I would recommend this class to another student because I learned a lot without having to cram\/memorize facts. Almost every lecture kept my attention and I looked forward to going to class.",
    "Pathology 690 provided the biological basis for how different pathogens cause disease. The classs also provides one with the opporutnity to propose experiments to further elucidate our understanding of how diseases work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to another student. It is very cool to learn about all of the diseases. Very insightful.",
    "Broad survey of many different diseases.Would recommend this course as it was very interesting and had a reasonable amount of work.",
    "Yes. Great overview of relevant diseases and work being done to address new therapeutics.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course for others. It was really interesting to learn lots of important disease and its molecular mechanisms.",
    "I would recommend Path690 to a fellow student, and describe the course as a weekly module and discussion based course in which you explore a new disease each week and the molecular mechanisms underlying that disease.",
    "Yes. Provided wide range of information related to different diseases.",
    "I would definitely ( and have )recommend this course to fellow graduate students.",
    "I would say, \"If you are interested in the intersection between bench science and medicine, this is the class for you. I really liked this introduction to pathology how we studied a disease first and then the science behind it, instead of the reverse.\""

   "comments": [
    "I have not yet started research in this area but we did talk a lot about mouse models and manipulating genetics in different model systems that has helped me understand papers I've read since starting the course and will help me understand things in the future.",
    "The course helped me understand the basis of how pathogens cause disease. It provided me with an appreciation of the scientific process in finding out how diseases impact the immune system.",
    "The lectures made me want to learn more about each individual topic lectured. I think it has really allowed me to see connections between various diseases.Thanks for a great course!",
    "Didn't deepen my specific knowledge for my area of research, but broadened my horizons and gave me stuff to potentially work on or think about.",
    "Helped me remember why I got into research in the first place.",
    "This course did not directly contribute to my dissertation\/research, but I knew this before I signed up for the course. However, I feel that the discussions and exams contributed to my ability to write\/ research topics outside of my area of research and be more comfortable in a discussion scenario.",
    "Helpful for deciding future research."
