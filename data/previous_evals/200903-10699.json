    "It is a great course if you are interested in orientalism, nationalism and historiography. I will definitely recommend the course both to my classmates and to the coming students to my program.",
    "HSAR 579 is a fantastic introduction to issues of contemporary global architecture, and I would definitely recommend it because it covers material rarely discussed in other settings.",
    "Yes, it is a great course to investigate and understand a different cultural region outside of the western framework. I think that the content of the class provides an opportunity to study a different branch of modernism in which analysis and approach can either enlighten an existing focus of research, or provide the means towards a new topic of investigation."
