    "A very good course. Specifically, I've learned a lot about tough Polish grammar and proper mechanics this semester. Very useful semester. If you've gotten this far in your studies, make sure to continue on.",
    "Perhaps only worth taking if you plan to use it. But a great class atmosphere but an equally challenging language.",
    "Polish is a good intermediate language class. The workload is very manageable and there is a greater emphasis on class participation rather than busy work."
