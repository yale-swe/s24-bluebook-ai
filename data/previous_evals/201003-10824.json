    "570 covers the basic tools of quantum mechanics. For me, the class was also an introduction in proofs of theories which I gained a lot from. The class was a good fit for me in that way. Again, the speed of the class was quite a downside. But this class and the compliment of knowledge from Mol Rad has given me quite a basis of understanding in the field of physical chemistry."
