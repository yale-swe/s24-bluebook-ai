    "This was a difficult class using a variety of subjects to explain transport phenomena. It would be useful to require organic chemistry or even physical chemistry or thermodynamics as a prerequisite. This is the type of material that you need to go over several times before you truly understand it.",
    "The theory and application of thermodynamics and chemical partitioning processes for a range of different types of chemical compounds in different media and conditions.I would highly recommend it, but only to someone who wants to work really hard!",
    "The topics are very applicable to my research and to the area of environmental engineering. It's important to be able to determine the fate and transport of organic contaminants in the environment. Yes, I would suggest it to my fellow classmates, though more as a good fundamentals course."

   "comments": [
    "The course presented a lot of important ideas about environmental transport that will be useful for me as an engineer.",
    "I have a much, much better understanding of chemical processes in environmental engineering, and can now predict the physical properties and transport behavior (including solublity and sorption in various media) of compounds based on knowledge of their molecular structure and other physical properties. This is extremely useful for understanding my research. It was also helpful in understanding environmental engineering problems commonly addressed in the real world (for example, groundwater contamination with NAPL)."
