    "If you are a philosophy major, you absolutely MUST take a class with Della Rocca before graduating. If you aren't, then I would still highly recommend it. He is an amazing teacher and will really help you develop your own thoughts and work. This particular class onPersistence, Action and Relations, is absolutely worth taking if offered again. Whatever class you are taking, try to get Della Rocca to share his own views with you; they are compelling and pretty crazy and disturbing!",
