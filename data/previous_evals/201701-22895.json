    "Some students got a lot of feedback and others didn't get much. It was hard to know if that was because they were doing well or it was the end of the class or weren't do well at all. Aside from the professor, there isn't enough expertise in the room to get well rounded feedback. I think it is helpful to hear how others receive your work, but in terms of working through methods issues, we mostly only get the perspective of the instructor. There isn't qualitative expertise, even though a lot of students are doing qualitative work, so this just gets glossed over. This is really our only opportunity to workshop our ideas and get honest constructive feedback in the PhD program, so I think this course is really important and could be restructured to be more helpful. It would be great if several professors came to each meeting--they could rotate. It only meets 4 times a semester, so this seems like a small ask but would provide needed perspective and discourse, rather than having just the one 'authority\/expert' in the room."
