    "Yes",
    "Neo-baroque at its full extent. I would recommend it because it makes the student question an think in depth.",
    "The course was mainly focused on the most important novel written by Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Lezama Lima: Paradiso. This author is included in the literary trend known as Neobarroco, and consequently we analysed this trend and its relationships with the Baroque period (Spanish, through Luis de G\u00c3\u00b3ngora; and Latin American, through Sor Juana In\u00c3\u00a9s de la Cruz).I would strongly recommend this course to students interested in Modern Latin American literature, because it is center on one of its key figures.",
    "An excellent immersion, with many a great insight, in Latin American literature, taught by a legend in the field."

    "Helped me to learn how to think better and know a lot more about Latin American (especially Cuban) literature.",
    "Thanks to this course I have deepened my knowledge of the Modern Cuban literature, specifically of Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Lezama Lima, a key figure of Modern literature written in Spanish.I have not decided the main topic of my research yet, so it was not crucial for it. But the course showed me potential lines of study."
