    "Amazing. Dean Flick is one of the best profs at Yale, and you have immense freedom to get what you want out of this course and the text. Definitely take it, youll grow. Weekly forum participation, a presentation, and two papers. Attend class, because Dean Flick says brilliant things.",
    "Take it and engage with the class. Dean Flick is incredible and such a nice person.",
    "Great class, easy but very interesting and you learn a lot if you do the readings",
    "A fantastic class that at once forces the students to think outside the boundaries of their own philosophical upbringings while simultaneously fostering an extremely relaxing and convivial environment.",
    "The course introduces you to the epic of the Mahabharata in a relaxed and infromative way",
    "You should take this class. Even if you aren't a SAST major or you aren't Hindu. Professor Flick is an amazing professor.",
    "I would recommend the Mahabharata to a fellow student. There is a decent amount of reading but the course overall is laid back. The workload consists of only 2 papers and a short presentation."
