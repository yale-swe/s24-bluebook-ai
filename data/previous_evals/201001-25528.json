    "I would recommend this class to other students because it is so very useful for the departmental Ph.D. requirements. I feel that I have a much greater understanding of 18th century music theory and aesthetic after taking this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, and I would be sure to mention that what you take from the class relates directly to how much work you put into it. This was an excellent class, and the more reading you do, the more helpful class time is.",
    "Really good material to know, and mostly good experience generally. Sometimes the class sessions got to feel kind of long.",
    "Recommended because of the indispensible curriculum material.",
    "Good atmosphere in the classroom.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, if for no other reason than the fact that it exposes students to the basic literature.",
    "The course seemed to be most helpful for music theorists with respect to preparing for comprehensive exams, but it provided a good grounding in the music-theoretical thought of the period."

   "comments": [
    "Because this course has to synthetically fill a 200-year period between two other courses and connect with both the previous course and the following course (both of which I have taken), it is in a difficult but important position. Professor Holzer did a great job of literally picking up where the previous course in the sequence left off and dropping us off where the next course will begin in a way that managed to carry the themes from the first course of the sequence all the way into the third course of the sequence. This kind of synthesis was vital for my development as a scholar, particularly as I prepare for my comprehensive exams in the history of theory.",
    "Provided useful disciplinary knowledge.",
    "Essential material for theorists."
