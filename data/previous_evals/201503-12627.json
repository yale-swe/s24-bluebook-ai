    "Highly recommend!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but be sure you already have an incredible proficiency in Portuguese or are willing to make it through the massive learning curve. This course was taught more like an L5 Portuguese class than an L3 Portuguese class. Rather than learning more grammar and vocabulary and colloquial Portuguese, we discussed social and political issues whilst speaking Portuguese. Fabi is a phenomenal professor, though, so even if you struggle, you will be in good hands. Ask her questions, go to her office hours, take her assignments seriously; you will see tremendous improvement in your Portuguese!",
    "It's basically the same as 11020 only with slightly more reading. Which is to say: you will speak, read, and write in Portuguese. Not a whole lot else to say.",
    "Harder than Portuguese 120. Fabi is really amazing.",
    "A continuation of L1 and L2. You learn there are exceptions to all the rules and gain a better grasp on what you learned in L1 and L2. There's music and videos and other aids to help you learn in a fun way. Fabi really cares about her students' success and goes out of her way to assist students and teach them in the way that works for them. You'll never feel more supported. I will say that the homework is a bit more than I expected from a language class. At first it was all the homework for the week given on Friday and due the next Monday, which was weekend ruining. Then it was just random homework whenever. I have friends taking L5 classes who said they received less homework than I did this semester but perhaps that is because there's just so much learning to do in L3. Just don't discount the amount of possible work. Through presentations and skits and everything it was definitely worth the 1.5 credits.",
    "Great class, not difficult, fun and engaging",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes. Fun language and have only had good experience with teachers.",
    "Nice review of L1\/L2 with some new vocabulary and grammar concepts, plus lots of speaking practice. Would definitely recommend!"
