    "A fantastic course \u0096 probably my favorite in 3 years at Yale \u0096, you should absolutely take it. Professor Smith is a great lecturer, and you will truly learn a lot about your surroundings, and gain a keen understanding of the processes shaping our planet as we know it. This is a great addition to the prereqs for EVST, and would be a good class to take as a Sc credit if necessary \u0096 none of the math is that hard, and it's such engaging material. Tests can be pretty hard if you don't prepare enough. Reading is concentrated in thefirst 2\/3 of the course (at one point you literally have 250 pages of the textbook to read in one week), and will really help you fully grasp the concepts explored in lecture. I love the textbook, which is a first for me. Take this course, and if you don't love it after 4 weeks, then drop it. Odds are you'll stay.",
    "Take this course, especially if you are interested in weather and how basic weather processes work.",
    "I would recommend this course as it is very informative and an interesting subject matter.",
    "It's required for EVST majors, so most don't really have a choice.",
    "Great introductory course. Some math but mostly just regurgitating formulas and plugging in numbers. You need to do the text book reading as well.",
    "Learn some fascinating and very relevant stuff. Cool to be able to explain what's going on around you in the atmosphere, the oceans etc. I would recommend it to non-EVST people as well. The math is very manageable but definitely go to all the lectures. Ron Smith is great. I'd definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class if it is an interesting subject to you but it is certainly not an easy class. I would make sure you are willing to go to every lecture and put in the effort before committing to this class.",
    "This class is FANTASTIC. I feel like I learned everything I want to know about the global climate, climate change, ocean currents, atmospheric circulation, why the sky is blue.... The class is an amazing look at the world we live in and is very manageable if you keep up with the lectures and the reading. The weekly problem sets are not too bad, and very doable from what we discuss in lecture. You'll come out of the class with a much better perspective of the natural processes going on around you all the time. Plus Professor Smith is GREAT.",
    "You should take this class. It answers so many questions about the world that you didn't know you even had. If you've taken geology classes before I hear this class was pretty basic, but for someone without a lot of experience in sciences it was pretty eye opening. Professor Smith is a great teacher - very calm and collected - and classes went at a nice pace. He also posted all of his slides which made reviewing easier. I'd definitely take the class if you are at all interested in how the earth works.",
    "This class is relatively easy, and very interesting. A great class for someone who doesn't mind walking up to the Peabody three times a week and is interested in meteorology and climate topics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested at all in the atmospheric sciences. It's a basics overview of the entire field and uses the right mix of qualitative and quantitative reasoning.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the environment at all it is a good course to take.",
    "This class is really hard. There are three midterms, problem sets every due every Friday and the material is demanding. However, we learn about REALLY interestingthings tat change how you interact with the world every day. We learned about how clouds and fog form, ocean currents, why the sky is blue, hurricanes, frontal storms, how to read a weather map, etc. I would 100% recommend this course; I think it's my favorite class I've taken here yet. However, be aware that this class is demanding, tests are hard and there is a LOT of material to know for the final.",
    "Depends - if you're genuinely interested in how the atmosphere works, I think you would really enjoy this class. However, if you're taking this class because it's a pre-req for EVST or because you think it's a gut, it really isn't. The class is quite a bit of work and the material is cumulative. You should have a very logic-driven mind to succeed in this class.",
    "It's a good class, not super exciting but once you realize how applicable what you learn is to your everyday life, it becomes pretty cool. The work load isn't bad, problem sets every 1.5 months and 3 exams (with review sessions always)",
    "A great survey course on the basics of the environment. Enjoyed taking this course simply because it explains some of the most important and immediate things that affect us daily: energy technology, anthropogenic global warming, and the weather.A good amount of this course is math, but nothing too much more complicated than high school physics and chemistry. The application of these formulae, however, is much more involved.Not a gut but not impossibly hard. The exams are challenging. Problem sets take a good deal of time.You*do* have to take the lab, and it's a great experience--the field trip alone is worth it.",
    "Yes. Practical stuff. Not too hard. Not a whole lot of work (weekly p-sets, bi-weekly lab reports, 3 mid-terms, 1 final). Take it credit\/D if you want a lower stress environment to learn practical science and don't want to use it for distributional requirements or major. P.S. this is not a gut.",
    "In this course, like in other courses, there's a trade-off. The material is actually more than not very interesting and practical. Why is the sky blue? How do clouds form and precipitate? What were the causes behind the Ice Age? What is the science behind El Nine? How productive are solar, wind, and hydroelectric electricity generation systems? You'll get to understand the answers to these and more.Here are the down sides: fairly math-heavy course material (it is a QR); exams are difficult, although most everyone finds them at least challenging; mandatory lab which can be fun or not depending on the TAIt's a better than average course but I can't say I loved it. I do appreciate the knowledge I gained, however.",
    "The course has tons of great information that all seems to fit together by the end, really interesting if you're interested in how weather and climate work and how climate change works. That being said, tests are really hard, problem sets are reasonable but interesting, and your grade will be pretty mysterious\/probably not as high as you would like, even if you put a ton of work into the class. But I think it's one of those classes where the grade doesn't really matter because it's a great educational experience, so take it!",
    "Definitely take this course! It's a fantastic introduction to either geology and geophysics or environmental studies for anyone who likes the natural sciences, and it's great for both science and non-science majors. There's both quantitative and qualitative material, and you come away from the class with a greater appreciation of the environment around you. It's made me interested in further study of oceanography and the atmosphere, so it was definitely influential for me. The weekly problem sets aren't too bad, and the midterms are challenging but doable.",
    "I took it as a requisite for the EVST major so I was always surprised when non-EVST majors took it for fun. However, in the end I found it quite enjoyable for the understanding of very real weather phenomenon that it gave us. If you need to take it, I recommend NOT waiting until senior year.",
    "Yes - great course. Good introduction to the physical systems of the planet. It really helps you understand the basic processes that you encounter all the time -- storms, clouds, ocean currents, etc. After this class, I found myself looking at the world in a whole new way because I understood simple things, like why the sky is blue and clouds are white, how clouds are formed, why the wind blows the way it does, etc.And, Professor Smith is great and gives very clear lectures.",
    "Take of you have to or really love meteorology. This is not a gut science.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. Global warming is one of the most significant issues of our time, and a background in atmospheric science is extremely enriching and important for anyone as a human being. This course is somewhat challenging, but very fair, and Professor Smith's lectures make everything very easy to grasp. Above all, the material is extremely interesting and enjoyable. It's fascinating to know how our weatherand climate systems work.",
    "This is a great science class. Don't think from the first problem set that it's easy, though. It covers a great deal of material, though Professor Smith tries to tie it all together with some basic physical concepts. It would probably be easier if you had taken physics. But it's worth the work - RonSmith's enthusiasm is contagious, plus I can now explain phenomena I see every day! Makes a lot of sense as an EVST requirement.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in the environment and how it works. I got so much out of the material because it is really pertinent to everyday life and also SO interesting. If you are not a science major, I would not consider this a gut science credit - there is a ton of information to learn and the tests are by no means easy - however, I would consider it an interesting science credit that you can get a lot out of without working super hard. Studying for the tests is the main workload - just because there really is a lot of information. Problem sets not every week and they take 3 hours at the most, some only take about an hour. Also, Ron Smith is awesome and super knowledgeable about the material. He also gives review sessions himself for every test which are very helpful.",
    "Quantitative way of analyzing environmental problems, very useful but a difficult class. I would recommend the class.",
    "The course was interesting, although more math-based than I would have liked. I took this course for my major, but ended up learning a lot about meteorological occurrences everyone should know since we're exposed to them on a daily basis. The major downside is that the tests Professor Smith created were not reflective of the material we learned.",
    "There are 2 reasons one would take class: (1) you are genuinely interested in the subject, or (2) you need to take the class for the EVST major. I fall entirely into the second camp, so for me, the class was incredibly boring (it IS a class on what is generally agreed to be the most mundane of all subjects-- the weather, after all). I learned some cool things, but I would not saw it was worth the mind crushing boredom and the induced sleepiness at 925 three times a week. Still, some people loved it. MOSTLY, it's just absurd that this class is for EVST majors as only the last 2 or so weeks have any info relevant to environmental conservation of any sort."
