    "I would recommend this class to students that are interested in teaching in any capacity. I feel more confident in my teaching abilities having taken it and understand some of the requirements for a career in teaching.I would summarize it as a class geared towards older grad students and post docs interested in teaching. There are two projects, but the instructors provide significant in class time to work on them, which reduces the impact on research. It covers a lot of teaching techniques and tools and also gives students a chance to practice their teaching in front of a friendly audience. It also provides opportunities for curriculum development for actual use, which is exciting."

    "My advisor was luke-warm on me taking this class, so I guess it might have negatively impacted my research\/dissertation. Once he realized it wasn't a huge time commitment he seemed okay with it so it worked out. I think in general, Yale could to a better job of educating professors on how to mentor their students. In my experience and from talking to other students it seems that most professors automatically assume that every student wants to stay on the tenure track, but then openly admit that funding and openings are lacking and highly competitive. It seems to be that it would be better for everyone if PIs were more encouraging of students looking to leave academia. Anyway, this is obviously outside the scope of the class but I think it affects the number of students who are able to take it since their PIs don't think it contributes to their ability to land tenure-track positions.I don't feel that this class really revolutionized my teaching approach, but I definitely came away with some new ideas and tools to implement in the classroom and some good career advice. Like, I said above, it was also nice to meet others with similar interests, which is hard to do when you're in lab all the time."
