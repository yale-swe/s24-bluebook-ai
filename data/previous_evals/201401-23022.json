    "A very good course that provides in-depth knowledge of a broad variety of biotechnology fields. It was somewhat disorganized, but material is very important and is from current literature.",
    "Yes if the student wish to go into industry in Biotech. It's a very good course for getting a general idea about Biotech industry with some science horizon also.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. The reason I say this is because it seemed far too strongly marketed to an undergraduate audience, with a heavy emphasis on the specific details of examples (and thus memorization) and not nearly enough emphasis on concepts. Furthermore the concepts that were taught were too basic, and didn't go into the level of detail on how they functioned and how they were developed that I would expect for a graduate level course."

   "comments": [
    "It provided me knowledge about current research and topics that are being studied.",
    "This course is more of widen than deepen and may not be so useful for my dissertation but I like it.",
    "It made me more aware of a few technique and issues that I hadn't been aware of before. However, I'm not entirely sure that for the most part I can foresee myself using many of these techniques in my own research in the future. Other than that, I feel it contributed little."
