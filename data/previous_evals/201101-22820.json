    "Yes- fascinating course.",
    "Easy class. Read the books and bring them to class. 3 papers (5 pgs each).",
    "I would definitely recommend English 295 to another student. It is a lot of reading, but it is definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend the class. Be sure to understand that it is a lecture not so much a seminar and that there is a good deal of class reading. This semester the class was very small, which I think was unfortunate. The syllabus is great and varied and the readings are all very much manageable. The papers are very manageable as well.",
    "This class is a survey of African American literature, including fiction, poetry, and drama, from the early 20th century, with attention paid to the social, historic, and artistic contexts in which they were produced. If you are an English major, the majority of these writers will not be found on the syllabi of any other course, and so I would recommend the class for that reason alone - the reading list is amazing! You also learn a lot about music and art, and more generally about broader themes and ideas in the field of African American studies. Professor Stepto is extremely sweet and helpful and knows an unbelievable amount about the subject. My one word of caution is that the class sometimes felt more like a lecture than a seminar, and while I honestly didn't mind that because I loved hearing Professor Stepto's ideas, the class dynamic was not very strong. Very few people ever spoke or shared ideas, which was too bad given the quality of what we were reading.",
    "I would, especially if they have never studied the material. It is very interesting and important to know.",
    "It's great. It's a seminar, but there is not much discussion. It is just based on Professor Stepto's lectures, but they're great, so it's worth it."
