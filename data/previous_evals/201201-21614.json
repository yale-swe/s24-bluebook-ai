   "comments": [
    "Overall a good class- the math starts out really easy, then picks up rapidly with the black hole unit and levels off during the expanding universe. Course follows the books really closely (GET THE BOOKS!)",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It provides a good introduction to a couple of interesting and relevant topics in astrophysics. While there's still some handwaving (i.e., you're not doing GR with tensors), it's a much more quantitative approach to these topics than more introductory physics classes. You should definitely be comfortable with calculus, and at least basically so with differential equations (taking it concurrently is fine). The unites do get progressively more math-y, but also more interesting.",
    "This course was a great survey of some particularly interesting topics in astrophysics. As a non-science major, I also want to stress that it's completely accessible so long as you're comfortable with math as the language of physics. If you're hoping for depth, this may not be the ideal course for you; the class structure necessitates spending just a few weeks on each of the three units, which can feel insufficient. All told, however, this class gets my full endorsement.",
    "Good course if you're looking for a relatively more relaxing elective for the physics major. Not all the material is easy, but most of it seems to have been graded leniently. Don't expect to be an expert on astrophysics or general relativity after this course--you barely skim the surface of a lot of the complicated concepts--but at least you get some background, and it's fairly interesting stuff. Material does get exponentially harder over the course of the semester, though.",
    "Definitely would recommend this class if you're at all interested in astrophysics. I mean, look at the description: exoplanets (aliens! cool!), black holes (very cool!), expanding universe (weird and cool!). I promise the most math you'll need for this course is basic calculus, and you absolutely need no other background in anything else except perhaps the MOST BASIC of physics knowledge (F=ma). It's a ton of fun, you'll actually ENJOY going to lecture, and the problem sets are pretty simple too.",
    "Take what I say with a grain of salt, as most other students seemed to like the course.I could not stand this course. I felt like I was back in high school, where I was expected to regurgitate very superficial facts without having any real understanding. I thought Professor Nagai was awful; he has absolutely no sense of whether the students are following or not, and he didn't particularly seem to care. You will not learn in depth about any of the 3 topics, but I suppose it's a good exposure to the basics. It's a survey course, and nothing more.",
    "Some overlap with other physics\/astro courses but solid all around",
    "I would highly recommend taking Physics 343 over any of the other astro classes (the 210, 220 especially).I took Astro 220 and although it's a fine survey class, the depth of material covered is really poor, and this class investigates Exoplanets, Black Holes and Cosmology in great depth which is much more rewarding than a survey where you learn lots of stuff at a cursory level. The math required is only basic calculus, but that doesn't mean it's easy - problem sets are often very challenging and can involve some pretty tough integrals, but they are also very illuminating of the topics.The presentation was also a great requirement because it forced you to really master an area that interested you, and not having a final is definitely appreciated.",
    "Less work than a main-sequence physics class, but get progressively more challenging mathematically and conceptually as the class goes on. A worthwhile class for anyone interested in the subject matter, and an especially good fit as a 5th class for a physics major.",
    "ASTR 343 is an EXCELLENT course. It looks at expolanets, black holes, and cosmology--the three most interesting and exciting fields in astronomy today. If you have any interest in astronomy and you have a decent to good background in physics and math, you should definitely take this course!!! ASTR 343 is one of the few intermediate level courses that the astronomy department offers, so it's great for math\/physics-type people who are interested in astronomy but would be bored by the intro courses (i.e. astr 120 or 220), which move at a much much slower pace and don't go into as much detail). Workload was not too bad either--6 p-sets, 1 presentation (with a partner), 3 exams (one per topic), ***no final exam***. P-sets and exams for this class were quite difficult, but definitely manageable, especially if you went to problem session. The math does get pretty tricky though--the first exam on exoplanets is not representative of the level of math used in the rest of the course. Nevertheless, if you're okay at math and have taken AP Physics or an intro physics course here, you should be fine. Also, Prof. Nagai was one of the nicest, most helpful professors I could ever ask for. He is extremely approachable and always willing to meet with you if you're having trouble with the p-set or concepts in class. I hear that the other professor who teaches this course is also great, so you can't go wrong. Again, awesome course!!",
    "A good physics course to take, especially if you want an introduction to astrophysics.",
    "Take the class. It's not easy but not hard if you spend a little bit of time. Think 4 hours a week plus a couple nights before the midterm. It's super fun though and everyone had a really good time. The professor is great and hopefully you still have Ben Elder as the TA.",
    "Yes. PHYS 343 was a good intro to astrophysics for those who have no background in the field. Daisuke is an amazing professor, very young and energetic, and brings out very well the dynamic and exciting nature of the field. As we were taking the class, important discoveries were being made every day. We were actually learning about cutting-edge science that no one yet fully understood. Warning: the first third of the course is deceptively easy, but the difficulty increases exponentially from then on. The last two thirds were confusing and often frustrating because we couldn't figure out what exactly the professor wanted us to know. The problem sets were somewhat vaguely worded. TA office hours saved me every week. But before every exam, the pieces fell in place. The midterms were very generously graded.",
    "If you're interested in learning a bit about general relativity-- this is an OK course. I personally cannot endorse much of the unit on cosmology-- the field bumps into and does not address too many metaphysical questions, in my opinion. I thought the course showed me a number of interesting astrophysical phenomena. But if you'reinterested in really learning astrophysics beyond what a few scientific american articles and a handful of formulas has to offer, take an astrophysics course.",
    "Most of the physics is explained as you go along, and if you're taking any of the higher level classes concurrently with this class, it shouldn't be too difficult. The homework per week is a few hours.",
    "Don't bother. Really just don't.",
    "If you're looking for an easy yet very interesting fifth or sixth class, this is the one for you. Lectures are engaging if perhaps slow moving, the problem sets don't take much more than an hour a week (maybe a bit longer during the cosmology unit when the notation and concepts are less straightforward), the exams are very quick and simple, there's no final exam, the presentation is very laid back, and the general atmosphere of the class is fun and casual. Really as low stressof a class as you could possibly imagine. Prof. Nagai is also awesome and the material is really cool, so if you're considering this class, there's really no reason not to... how you say... make like a black hole and get sucked in.",
    "The title summarizes it all. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes, if you want to take something interesting.",
    "This course was really interesting and a good introduction to quantitative astrophysics. Prof Nagai is really cool and you'll walk away understanding black holes and exoplanets and cosmology a lot better. To give you an idea of the difficulty level, I am a computer science major who just took AP Physics C in high school and I did just fine.",
    "A fun class, but it is not nearly as much of a gut as it might seem at first glance. Expect a fair bit of math.",
    "Don't take it if you're looking for something that will challenge you to think more deeply or be very mathematically rigorous. It's a bit more of a memorize-stuff-elective course. Maybe more for bio majors than physics majors.",
    "Phys 343 is a wonderful course, broken into three sequential, but distinct, topics (hence the tripartite course name). First: Daisuke is a wonderful teacher, both brilliant and communicable, and intent on engaging with students. Second: I feel the structure of the course to be a great virtue for several reasons, but chiefly, the focusing allows you to delve deeply into each given topic, and the partitioning alleviates any potential senseof drag as the semester moves forward and you begin a new topic. I felt a great sense of progression through the course, and found a level of depth that was satisfying yet not overwhelming or tedious. I HIGHLY recommend Physics 343, and I HIGHLY recommend Daisuke Nagai. In fact, even if you don't or can't take this course, if you are at all interested in any related topic, just go see Daisuke and ask to chat for a while."
