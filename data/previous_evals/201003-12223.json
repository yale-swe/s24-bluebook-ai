   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking this if you need to learn or review basic technique otherwise it is not really necessary.",
    "Pretty good, for a lab. Definitely should be worth more than 0.5 credit. There were only a few labs that took the whole time, most took about 2.5-3 hours. The time flew in most, as well, which was quite nice. Granted that probably depends on your TA but still. Lab reports were not too bad, I only remember maybe 3 or 4 being real headaches.",
    "GOod intro bio lab. Lots of lab reports though.",
    "It can be an interesting course, but is probably not the best biology laboratory to take.",
    "The best lab class I've taken. It was actually concerned with the students understanding the basic concepts behind each experiment. The experiments were all really interesting and fun. The lab reports were very long sometimes though.",
    "I thought this was a great lab. The lab reports are long, but the actual labs are fun. I would recommend taking it, because it's a lab that introduces you to different parts of Bio.",
    "In-lab sessions are long (3-4 hours, mostly). The lab reports are fairly graded but tedious--it is to your benefit (and your TA's) to learn to write quick, concise reports. Recommend it if you are interested in the material, otherwise you will be frustrated at the time it consumes.",
    "The course was very interactive and I looked forward to lab every week. However, the requirements for the lab report were sort of arbitrary and it felt like guess and check.Your level of enjoyment depends on your teaching fellow.",
    "It's basic bio lab. I thought it was going to be a drag going in but it was actually pretty cool. You get to work with organisms and processes that you'll hear a lot about in lecture or if you read about biology on your own time.That being said, it's a lot of work for a 0.5 credit course. There were 10 lab reports (mine averaged about 12 pages) on top of the lab itself once a week. Some of the labs were really long and dragged on late into the afternoon. It'd be great if the labs were shortened a bit in the future. Often they included some extra exercise that seemed pointless. For instance, a fair amount of time spent in the PCR lab was spent counting multi-colored beans.All in all, it's not bad. Chances are you're required to take it because you're pre-med or because it's required for your major. It would be great if the labs were shorter but as is, it's not terrible. Just start your lab write ups early.Also, Shannon is the best TA by far.",
    "This lab course is good to take in conjunction with MCDB 12o because it enhances understanding of concepts learned in that course. I recommend that you shop for TAs before enrolling though.",
    "MCDB 121L is a biology laboratory course that loosely follows the MCDB 120 course. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, mainly because you get to work with most of the important animal models that you constantly hear about in the course: C. elegans, Drosophila, frogs, sea urchins, starfish, T. thermophila, etc. (I probably spelled one of those wrong). If you like biology, take this lab.",
    "Terrible. Horribly run - the teacher doesn't even understand the material enough to make functioning lab manuals. Once you take a chem lab (like 116L) you will enjoy 1) how exciting this lab is, but 2) how terribly run it is, too.",
    "Overall, not too difficult of a lab course; at the same time nothing special. Take it if you need a lab.",
    "It is a lot of work, and the lab reports take upwards of 5 hours, sometimes up to 10 I would say. It teaches some valuable bio lab techniques though, albeit in a long and drawn out way.",
    "interesting labs, but the writeups are just long and obnoxious",
    "MCDB121 is the intro bio lab course for MCDB. The experiments demonstrate basic biological concepts. The lab reports are ridiculous and require a ton of detail. 6-8 single-spaced pages every week, expect to spend approx 5-10 hours on each one. Overall, a good course, but if you can get away with it, don't take it. Take a higher level bio lab instead.",
    "I imagine most people in the lab were pre-med or for the bio\/EVST major, so it's not like you really have a choice. But it was a fun lab, and if you get a good section and a good TA, it will be a very fun course.",
    "Not a hard lab, but very very time consuming. Take it with a friend\/ make a friend or you will die of boredom.",
    "Only take this if you're pre-med or need it for your major. It's a lot of time commitment and even though the labs are fairly interested, is not worth the 4 hours a week plus lab report.",
    "Currently, this class has waaaaay too much writing for a 1\/2 credit course. Seriously, you will probably spend more time on this 1\/2 credit lab than you will spend on your full credit major classes. A pretty \"easy A\", but incredible amounts of repetitive boring work.",
    "If you have a choice and have had experience with biology in the past, you probably shouldn't take it. The topic might be a bit too trivial and the lab reports too tedious. If you're new at this, not a bad intro.",
    "The stuff we get to do is really cool. The lab itself can be fun although the writeups will take years off your life. Take it for the experience and remind yourself that it's only half a credit.",
    "Weekly lab reports are long and pretty annoying but if you have a good TA it's not extremely painful.",
    "It's a basic lab with a lot of lab writing involved. This was the first lab I had taken at Yale and I found it very manageable.",
    "I think that if you have the option of taking a different bio lab, take it. The labs are about 12 pages long each week. YOu do little work in the lab but outside (while you craft your lab report) you do too much work! It's not worth it!",
    "take it but be prepared to spend at leat 10 hour on the reports-to get a good grade",
    "It's way more work than it should be - you'll be assigned a lab report and quiz nearly every week, in addition to the class time. Labs usually don't run all 4 hours though - 2-3 hours is more common. Labs are basic, reasonably interesting, and pretty well designed. Ryan Chong is a TERRIFIC TF.",
    "Take it if and only if you need an intro bio lab. Be prepared to write lots of long lab reports. Don't spend too much time on them because they don't matter. Follow the rubric, answer the required questions, and recycle your templates so you don't forget anything.",
    "MCDB 121L is the most work-intensive lab I've ever taken, and that includes gen chem, orgo, and physics labs. There's a report due almost every week, and they generally took me about 10 hours to do. The labs were pretty interesting, but the reports made the class painful.",
    "An easy way to fulfill bio lab requirement (for pre-med).",
    "This is a good bio lab to take if you need one. The reports are sometimes irritating, but you could do a lot worse. You're probably taking this because you have to anyway, so you're just checking to see how bad it is. It's not bad. Some of the labs are even kind of fun.",
    "This lab, I think, depends on your TA, since they will be leading the class and grading your reports.The class itself is frustratingly all over the place, sometimes even within a single lab period (counting beans and doing PCR reactions?). But some of the activities are interesting. Yale certainly spends money buying materials (bacteria, etc.) for this lab.",
    "I would definitely take the class if it was required, but that being said, it can be a fun experience so if you find yourself interested in Biology, perhaps thinking about a Biology major, try out the lab and see how much fun you have.",
    "it's a lot of work for a 1\/2 credit, but if you need it, take it.",
    "Please don't make the horrifying mistake of taking this class unless you absolutely have to. If you can in any way place out of this course, don't take it. I was able to place out of intro bio, but I was lazy and stupid and thought that instead of taking an advanced bio lab I would take this one. It was a huge mistake because this lab, while easy, assigned an enormous amount of insanely stupid and repetitive work every single week. I took directed studies and I spent more time writing these reports than I did for all three classes of DS in freshmen year, yet my writing didn't at all improve from writing these--because they were so long and so vapid in content, I didn't care about what I was writing as long as I vomited up all the information that I had to include.Seriously, don't do it. It's like self mutilation. I've worked in hospitals changing old patients' diapers and that was more fun than this class.This course is more work than: Directed Studies. GenChem. Orgo. Physics. Biochem. PhysChem.And more useless than: Orgo study groups. 5th grade math. Fantasy Football. Exfoliating your elbows and knees...",
    "I would say take the course (especially if they make it a full-credit course). Right now it is a lot of work for just a half-credit, but if they promote it to full-credit, I would definitely say take it. The lab periods can get a little long sometimes, but the reports aren't bad at all, and it is a great way to supplement MCDB 120. The knowledge gained in lab definitely helps solidify your understanding of material from the lecture course.",
    "Take it if you need it as a requirement or for premed. It's a pretty easy lab.",
    "terrible class. that's pretty much it. it was like going to hell when i went to each lab. so bad.",
    "Do not take it if you have no prior lab experience at Yale. It is not an introductory course. The lab reports are also very time consuming. But if you need it for premed requirements, take it. The experiments are at least pretty cool.",
    "Intro bio lab. A fair number of experiments have overlap with those done in Genetics lab, but you do get to do some reasonably interesting things. Lab reports are pretty much weekly, which gets a little tedious.",
    "It's a good lab course and does teach you how to write a lab report.",
    "It's not so bad.",
    "I do not recommend this lab. Unfortunately, many have to take it for major and medical school requirements.",
    "I would only recommend Molecular, Cellular and Dev Biol 121 to another student only if they were require to take the lab or if they were very interested in labs. Otherwise, the lab is just too much work.",
    "This lab was sometimes interesting but it usually felt like the professor was trying to keep us busy with rather elementary, tedious exercises. This lab is a step down from chemistry lab, because you usually stay late, the lab reports are too loquacious, and the class does not impart any new lab skills.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you do not have much previous lab experience and want to conduct some cool experiments while learning basic bio lab techniques.",
    "This lab takes waaaaaay too much time for what it's worth. Take another one or be prepared to spend your nights before lab watching the sun rise as you write your introduction and meddle through your bad data. It's not that it's difficult, it's just so tedious and you hardly learn anything for the time invested. I would not recommend.",
    "MCDB 121L was really helpful. You learn a lot of relevant lab techniques that would be useful in a real college laboratory, and the labs are pretty interesting. Sometime the lab hours can get a little long though, and the reports take forever.",
    "It all depends on the TA you get. Each TA does their own thing, and you could end up with either a relaxed atmosphere, or an extremely tight one. he lab reports are long, so start them ahead of time.",
    "I would recommend this for pre-med students.",
    "The labs tend to be on the long side at the beginning of the term but they eventually become shorter. The lab reports can be tedious and time consuming.",
    "MCDB121L is a course that you should only take if you have LITERALLY next to no experience in lab sciences and want to have the easiest possible transition into real science, or if you are enslaved by the bonds of premed requirements. I made the mistake of taking it after working in a research facility at Yale for over a year, and it was painful to spend 3 hours and write 10-page reports on skills and knowledge that anyone can pick up in 10 minutes working in a real lab. What made it worse was that very few of the experiments actually worked out as they were supposed to, and so the majority of the effort of writing the lab reports was coming up with enough BS to fill up the required arbitrary sections. All in all, I'd only recommend this course to people who are, for whatever possible reason, looking for a gut lab science course.",
    "This is a good lab. First off, it is the easiest lab I've ever taken. None of the labs have extremely difficult content, and the write ups are pretty short (~8-10 pages). Take it only if you need it, but don't worry if you have to.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in Biology, this lab is great. I found it better than the lecture, although the lab reports were very very long. Be prepared fro that. It is very good for pre-meds looking to fulfill a requirement.",
    "This class has a lot of problems. I don't think it is particularly well executed, but for a pre-med or bio major, I don't know if there are many alternatives.",
    "This class is demanding, but will reward you if you put the time in. This has been the most demanding lab course I have taken (I took ochem lab, and physics lab). There is no question that the professor, Dr. Moreno, really cares about the students and puts a lot of effort into the course to show for it.",
    "I would recommend it to any pre-med student. The lab write-ups are long, but the labs themselves, for the most part, are enjoyable.",
    "The weekly lab reports take a long time to write up. Often the labs don't work which makes it even more frustrating",
    "Good course - a LOT of work to get a good grade, though. Lab reports took anywhere from 5 - 10 hours. There was some connection to lecture, although not as emphasized as in orgo, for instance.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a fun class that anyone interested in science should experience!",
    "It's an intro lab course where you get to do some interesting experiments, such as dealing with model organisms like Drosophila and C. elegans that you hear mentioned in lecture. I didn't take the lecture and lab in the same semester, though, so I don't know how well the material aligns. This lab is already normally longer than most labs, so just be ready for that, although time will seem to pass pretty quickly for some experiments. There are online pre-lab quizzes, but those aren't too bad since you just do them online without a time limit before you come in so you can refer to the write-up and notes and such. Full lab reports right off the bat, but you just have to do them, and they're not too bad, depending on the TA you have grading them. The final exam also just feels like a regular lab, so you don't have to freak about it. Overall, a perhaps long but decent lab."
