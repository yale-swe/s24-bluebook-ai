    "Very manageable and interesting course. Professor Armstrong is accessible and earnest. Lorenzo Magnolfi is the best TA ever - you will be extremely lucky to have him, if he is teaching next year as well. Take it - it will reaffirm your decision to do economics.",
    "It's probability theory with lots of proofs that both the textbook (which is excellent!) and professor Armstrong explain, and then it transitions into statistics theory, which is basically just probability theory applied to large numbers of random variables. If you want a really good understanding of the theory behind statistics, take this class. If you like math, take this class. If you have to take this because you're gonna be an econ math major but you're deciding between this and the other lame econometrics course for just econ majors, aka this is the make or break point of your econ\/math aspirations, take this class because it's much more mathematical and interesting (which is why you're doing math\/econ anyway, right?) Also, you get to write up a cheat sheet for the exams with anything you want on it. You can fit a lot on two sides of paper. Start making that cheat sheet early on.",
    ". The material is so boring that it's inconceivable that anyone can make it interesting. So it's perhaps not fair to blame Armstrong too much for this class. He does try somewhat, I think... That said, I did not really turn up for class, because everything can be learnt from the textbook. The midterm was astonishingly easy. The final was still quite easy, though slightly trickier than the midterm. You just need to know how to use the correct formulas, and plonk in the numbers into the relevant places. That's why it's statistics, not pure math. Simple.",
    "I would recommend this course if you like approaching the concepts--probability and statistics--more abstractly and less concretely. Lectures are pretty dry and a lot can be learned through the textbook, but the professor's really accessible if you need help.",
    "take it only if you need it",
    "If you are a Math and Econ major, I guess it sucks for you and you have to take this class. I felt that this class was too theoretical, I doubt I know much about Statistics. The book is not bad, lectures are completely skippable. Grading is quite lenient though, curve should not be bad even though this class was super easy. Take it if you have to or you want an easy class where you wont learn much. Otherwise, find another class!",
    "I must say that it's not for everyone. For those Econ& Maths major, it is a pre-req so there isn't much you can do about it. But for others, you should consider shopping ECON 131 first before deciding which one you prefer. Having said that, from what I heard, ECON 131 isn't much different from ECOn 135 anyway.",
    "Professor Armstrong is pretty good, even if he stutters a bit in lecture. He delivers a lot of material with solid explanations at a reasonable speed. The class gives you some solid economic tools, and it's not too killer of a workload. I'd recommend it.",
    "a decent intro. all the material you need to cover. I liked that it was 241 and 242 in one class",
    "Obvious take this course if you are an Econ\/Math major and need it for the major or are thinking about grad school. Its a probability and statistics course with calculus.",
    "Nothing could nearly be as worse. The disutility from getting your laundry pooped on five times is never tantamount to that from sitting through five minutes of Armstrong's lecture. Armstrong just rambled on proof-based statistics that did not help the exams nor statistical understanding. Lacks of both intuitive explanation motivating statistical analyses and course organization prevented understanding the objective of the class. Armstrong did not seem confident while teaching, characterized by circuitous explanations, stutter and frequent irregular body movements, and that just shuts it off. And when you thought you could consult the textbook because the professor was simply terrible, you're wrong because the textbook authors are nearly as bad as Armstrong. They failed to emphasize which formulae were important and they could oftentimes be derived in example problems, which to me and others did not seem like a coherent presentation of ideas. The only reason Armstrong chose the textbook was that he perhaps found the textbook similar to his periphrastic train of thought. The only savior was probably the TA, Lorenzo, who condensed Armstrong's half a semester of rambling into solid one hour review session before the midterm, and he did it again for the final. I don't usually have strong opinions on things, but the fact that I am very opinionated about this class reveals its atrocity. I'm not an Econ and Math major and taking this class is probably my worst regret in college, but really, too bad if you're Econ and Math.",
    "Only take it if you're taking Economics and Math or you really really like Statistics.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have not taken many statistics courses and you are interested in economics. If that is not the case, the material is fairly dull and the class is average at best.",
    "I started this course with no background in probability or statistics. I now have a pretty solid theoretical foundation and am excited to learn more. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comfortable with math and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re patient, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to use this course to build from the ground up. It does require some concerted effort (i.e. attending section, making sure to understand all the concepts before they start pilling up too quickly). I would recommend this class to anyone interested in a serious introduction to probability and statistics. Note that the class takes a frequentist\u00e2\u0080\u0094not Bayesian\u00e2\u0080\u0094approach to statistics.",
    "Necessary and sometimes painful but you learn a lot at the end.",
    "You take it if you have to and I don't see why you would otherwise. This course is poorly taught although interesting. Do well on the first midterm.",
    "I would recommend this class. The problem sets are pretty straightforward, the tests are fair, and the class gives you a good understand of probability and statistics.",
    "An excellent and straightforward introduction to probability and statistics. Math through single and multivariable calculus (e.g. be comfortable with double integrals) is required (so no linear algebra). If you did AP Statistics, or especially IB HL math with the statistics option, much of what you see will be familiar, but a lot of it will be new. The textbook is good, so don't worry if lectures aren't always clear. You really won't be tested on the proofs.",
    "Do yourself a favor and do not take this class. Prof. Armstrong is the worst professor I've had at Yale so far. He mumbles and pauses, acting as if he perpetually lacks the words to explain even the simplest concepts. The book isn't much better. It crams too many words on a page, moving from example problems to general discussion without telling you, so you never know exactly what you're reading. All in all, a terrible experience, and one you should avoid if humanly possible.",
    "Good overview of prob and stats, useful info."
