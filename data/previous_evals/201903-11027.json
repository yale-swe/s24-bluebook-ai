    "how to analyze French literature",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for the evolution of French literature and its different movements and eras.",
    "I gained a wide scope of the progression of French literature through the centuries.",
    "My knowledge of french literature and philosophy.",
    "I improved my close reading skills and analysis skills in French. I also learned to speak more confidently in French, and feel that I have really improved.",
    "I gained a better ability to read French literature and analyze it in a sophisticated way. I learned more about French history and culture through the lens of the works and authors we were reading.",
    "The ability to assess and analyze French literature effectively, as well as further development of oral skills, i.e. conversational skills."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus is great. I enjoyed all of the readings.",
    "I liked that we were given questions to consider while reading so that we could gather our thoughts beforehand, that being said though we were supposed to focus on certain themes and ideas it did not limit the conversation in any way and students always brought in new perspectives connected to contemporary issues.",
    "strengths: pretty easy, low workload, teacher goes over the readings in class weaknesses: boring at times due to the length of the class",
    "Its strength is also its weakness, the course takes you through centuries of French literature which allows for a wide appreciation for French literature, but this means that not much time can be devoted to a very in-depth of all texts.",
    "Good seminar format, perhaps more could be done in terms of feedback for student performance.",
    "Strengths: diverse reading materials, interesting essay prompts, keeping students engaged Weaknesses: wish we had more time to read modern works, more historical knowledge of writers would be useful.",
    "The strengths were the amazing works and authors chosen, as well as interesting class discussion. One weakness is perhaps that little to no feedback was provided throughout the semester, especially in the first half.",
    "The readings were a bit dense at times, and it felt like some of the books were not touched upon nearly as much as some of the others. Otherwise, Professor Sanjabi course did a very good job at leading discussions and providing background knowledge for many of the works."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It serves as a great introduction to French literature.",
    "Absolutely. If you are proficient or fluent in French this class is no more rigorous than a standard English course. Most of the workload comes from readings so if your schedule allows for heavy reading this class will not be too draining. But you must read or the class will not be engaging, as discussion of the readings takes up the entire class time, aside from a brief lecture on historical context and the author's background.",
    "This is a great class to take if you want to get the certificate of proficiency, it is a lot easier than I imagined a French literature course would be. Sanjabi is hilarious",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about French literature but does not know where to start.",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting course with a range of stimulating texts, with insightful analyses to be made.",
    "Yes! Take this course if you want a good introduction to French literature. Mme. Sanjabi is amazing!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to students interested in French literature and conversation. A deep understanding of French language is required, however.",
    "Yes, I would! If you want to become a better reader of French and deepen your knowledge of the classic French writers and works, then this is the perfect class for you.",
    "Yes, as it is a good way to further your knowledge of french literature."
