   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This class was my favorite class at Yale since it goes so far beyond the classroom and traditional learning. It exposes one to a very different way of thinking which both incorporates and expands aspects of one's current mode of thought. I had no previous exposure to East Asian philosophy, but this class definitely has opened a door for me that I plan to deeply explore.",
    "I thoroughly recommend this course to any student who is open to a new academic experience and is willing to maintain an open mind and put in the requisite hours. This was probably the most refreshing and most enjoyable academic experiences I have had thus far in my career.There is a substantial amount of reading, and this course required the most hours per week of all my classes (for reading and weekly reading responses). That being said, there was no point in the semester at which I felt stressed by the work I was doing for this class, and enjoyed doing the work for this class more than anywork for another class. Professor Quintman is great and I feel that he is truly dedicated to the material and to the class.",
    "Do not take if you are a bad person.",
    "Absolutely. Even though you should take this class with a good degree of analytic rigor and skepticism, the actual teachings are incredibly compelling, and you'll find yourself having a hard time not buying into it completely. Take this class if you want to learn how to be happy in life.",
    "I was initially hesitant after being accepted because I read the reviews from last year saying that it's better if you have a background in Buddhism before taking this course. While the students that did definitely were able to contribute more to discussions in the beginning, I did not feel not having knowledge of Buddhism before this course hindered me. You have to work hard\/more efficiently, but it's a nice class.",
    "I thought it was a great class and would definitely recommend it. Even if you don't have a background in Buddhism, Professor Quintman and the secondary readings will teach you the basics. Some of the concepts can be tough to grasp, but ultimately, it's a lot of fun to think about.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "This class was wonderful. There was a good deal of reading, but the books were diverse and interesting. Prof Quintman is ridiculously knowledgeable and full of interesting stories. He even taught us the proper meditation techniques. We also had a symposium where meditation scholars came and we went to a temple to meditate.If you have any interest in Buddhism, meditation, or different views on mindfulness, take this class.",
    "A terrific seminar. Professor Quintman is engaging, very knowledgeable, and goes out of his way to provide the class cool opportunities - we did a \"meditation and cognitive science\" workshop with interesting guest speakers and stayed overnight at a Tibetan monastery. A great overview of Buddhism from multiple perspectives.",
    "SAST 459 was an excellent overview of Buddhist traditions of meditation from an academic perspective. Professor Quintman was extremely knowledgeable and very approachable. The material was absolutely fascinating and really changed my outlook on life and consciousness. The reading was a tad much at times, but overall, was well worth it. If you have any interest in Eastern thought or are just curious about expanding your own insights on human fulfillment and happiness, take this course.",
    "This class allowed me to think about the Big Questions that really matter: life, love, happiness, desire, etc. Our seminar was filled with bright, questioning people, and classtime was a balance between tidbits of life and relevant parts of the readings, which is the best combination. The professor's passion is infectious and even though he never brags, he knows and has been through so much. Also a great trip to a Tibetan monastery!",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially for those who are new to eastern philosophy and religion."
