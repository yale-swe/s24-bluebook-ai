    "I learned how to use code in MatLab and how to electronically model different biological processes.",
    "This has been the best lab I've taken at Yale so far. In most of our BME-related classes, we just sit and listen to Profs talk. But this was the first class that I've taken that's allowed me to do hands-on things. For example, all the labs involve us doing the experiments on ourselves (i.e. measuring lung volume or heart rate.) So not only do you learn more about the human body, you also get to know a little bit more about your own numbers lol",
    "how to measure physiological conditions with experiments on ourselves, in systems including the respiratory, neuromuscular, and cardiac systems.",
    "This class taught me how to take biosignals and process them to better understand physiological phenomenon.",
    "Better understanding of typical medical measurement instruments such as an EKG.",
    "Coding and other basic information that pertains to biomedical engineering.",
    "I learned more about acquiring and processing biological signals.",
    "I learned a lot about the way the body\/commonly used biomedical devices work. It was awesome.",
    "Learned some Matlab and mad data analysis. Also some cool stuff relating to data that can be obtained from different physiological processes.",
    "Physiological systems lab information.",
    "I loved this course!!!! Learned so much!!!!",
    "I learned exactly how the material from my physiology class related to real life tests and diseases.",
    "The course was extremely informative in systems biology and clinical applications of concepts learned in class.",
    "I learned how to successfully use laboratory equipment to record useful biological signals and process them into understandable information. This was what was expected from the class, and it was what the students got. The experiments were interesting and engaging."

   "comments": [
    "Hands down the best lab I have ever taken at Yale. The course is so engaging, very well facilitated to student learning, and the actual workload of a 0.5 credit class. I would recommend this to absolutely anyone who needs a lab course!",
    "The labs meet every other week which is really nice because it gives us ample time to write the reports. Again, the labs themselves are also incredibly interesting because we do the experiments on ourselves! By far the best lab course I've taken at Yale so far. No improvements! Prof Fan is amazing",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the fact that 2 weeks are given per lab, and one of which is essentially free as a result of being able to complete the entire lab in the first week.",
    "Rong Fan is gem- such a kind human being with a very laid back approach to the class that is so refreshing. The labs are also super fun! Definitely the lab course I have enjoyed the most at Yale. The reports tend to be very data processing heavy though, and I did feel like the exam was more difficult than expected given the coursework.",
    "This class was good because it taught us how to apply physiology to measure biosignals and use them to diagnose potential diseases.",
    "This course was well organized and delivered the knowledge it aimed to deliver in an interesting and non-stressful way.",
    "I thought it was a very good course and I learned a lot. This was the first lab that I felt the workload and time commitment deserved half a credit, which I really appreciated. The only thing I would say is that I felt the final was kind of challenging, and I really did not know what to expect because we had not had exams or anything.",
    "I wish the lectures at the beginning of class were a little clearer.",
    "I appreciated the every other week meetings. Data analysis instructions aren't always very clear and can be difficult. A refinement in directions would be nice. It's also hard to figure out what to know for each lab and the reports sometimes take a long time.",
    "Professor Fan is the best!",
    "So so great",
    "The strengths are that the labs are very interesting and applicable to course material. However, because the lab sizes are pretty big, everyone is doing a different lab each class so the labs are pretty much entirely self taught. It would be nice if everyone could be doing the same thing and see a lecture at the beginning of each lab session.",
    "The course was very informative and inclusive due to its accessible material and lab report format. Additionally, the TAs and professors were wonderful help.",
    "The only weakness I found with this course was that there were few experiments and they could have been made slightly more nuanced to be even more interesting. However, everything else about the course was great and should be kept the same. The instructors were very helpful and actually seemed interested in what they were teaching. Work was not excessive, and there were good opportunities for learning."

    "Take this class!!! Best bio lab you'll ever be in.",
    "If you're a BME major, you have to take this lab. BUT the good news is that it's both well taught and well designed. If you're not a BME major and need a lab course, then definitely take this one. I cannot recommend it more",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, especially if you're a pre-med student looking for a bio lab",
    "YES! A very chill lab (only every other week), and experiments that are actually really cool and enjoyable!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they want to apply physiology principles in order to learn more about how biosignals are measured and diagnoses are made.",
    "Yes if they are interested at all in biomedical engineering--I feel that the stuff we covered in this lab definitely will transfer to the real world.",
    "This lab is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. Please, if you are premed, take this lab -- you won't regret it!",
    "Absolutely! The material of this class is sooo interesting and it's a very reasonable workload for a half-credit lab (for once). It's really low effort high reward. I came out learning so much but never felt overwhelmed by the class workload. Most of the labs take only 2 hours which is great.",
    "Yea, it's pretty interesting application of physiological concepts that is hands on. A good use of time that gives you some comfort with using matlab.",
    "It's a good premed lab.",
    "YES YES YES YES",
    "Absolutely Professor Fan is wonderful and made the course really fun to take.",
    "For sure! A pretty easy bio lab that is also very interesting and quite fun.",
    "This lab is fun. Genuinely. I recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload was appropriate, the staff helpful, and the laboratory applications interesting and engaging.",
    "Definitely. This is a very reasonable, fun, and engaging lab course. Especially if you are a biomedical engineering major (for which this is required), the course is great and a breath of fresh air."
