   "comments": [
    "Yes, It is a very basic introductory class to QM\/MM methods and its applications to simulations.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is informative in ways that self-directed research can't be, and so is very worthwhile. The sheer amount of software and different algorithms in this field is overwhelming and contrary to most chemists' first assessment, a course is absolutely necessary. This course does a great job surveying that landscape and the important players in the field, as well as the core literature. I would summarize the course as both a survey of the field and a practical course for actually using some of the software to generate results, with a mid-level difficulty for chemistry students"

   "comments": [
    "It is very important because this class gave me basic information about simulations that and use of software that I will be using later in my career.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of both theoretical and computational chemistry by giving me the basic theoretical background and an outline of how the major algorithms work, as well as the typical ways they are used in industry. In addition, I was exposed to a substantial body of literature that will be useful for further research. My research is very reliant on specialized computational methods of this nature and the course is very relevant."
