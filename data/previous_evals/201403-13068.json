    "Absolutely recommend this class. A lot of work but worth it if you want to do finance at any point in the future. If you don't have prior investment banking experience, please think thrice before taking it - you will suffer immensely.",
    "Yes, definitely. Great professor and engaging material in a fun format but be prepared it requires quite a bit of work!",
    "This class is best class offered at Yale. It is taught by probably the smartest professor there is, and yet he is humble and the focus of the class is his desire to drive you toward a conclusion, to get you to think in ways you never have before. I entered the class and felt like an idiot who had no chance to keep pace with the people around me, and yet, each class was a new learning adventure. This class is challenging. let me repeat, this class will keep you up some nights, you will have more work for this class than you will for your next two hardest classes, but it is so worth it. Of course, you can get by only doing the bare minimum, but the beautiful thing about this class is that the more work you put in, the more you get out. There is always more to learn, and Professor Schmertzler is happy to teach you. The long and the short, do the work, all of it, and come to class prepared. You will be wrong, but you wont make the same mistake twice. You will love the professor.",
    "Most challenging but most rewarding class I have taken",
    "Only if you plan to go into finance as a job full-time and have previous experience in finance\/with financial modeling.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale, without a question, and a great change of pace from the usual dry Yale seminars. Schmertzler is a fantastic guy who really cares about teaching and has incredible experiences to draw from. Each week's case taught a different, important lesson that I hopefully won't forget for the forseeable future. The class had a reputation for being work-intensive, but it's not anything more than a medium-hard pset-oriented class, and it gets easier as time goes on and you figure things out. There's a lot of group work, which is rewarding when your group actually commits and otherwise often a total waste of time. Schmertzler also seemed pretty lax about actually collecting assignments, though i wonder if that's only because so many students didn't turn anything in for a while.",
    "Definitely take it. It's the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take this class if you are willing to put in the hours for it.",
    "Really great course, with a superb professor and talented classmates. I thought that the class was a bit disorganized at times and it was sometimes unclear as to what material to focus on and memorize. However, the content of the class was exciting and offers material that you really cannot find in any other Yale course. This class combines theoretical knowledge with real world applications and is immensely useful going forward for anyone entering the financial world. I learned a lot in this course and definitely recommend it - it is not a class you want to miss out on. Professor Schmertzler is wonderful and extremely knowledgeable. His unparalleled wealth of real world experience gives the entire class meaningful context to the topics he teaches. Although he is, by all regards, an expert in PE, he is also really patient in teaching basic concepts and helping students build a solid foundation.",
    "If you are interested in the financial field, especially private equity and investment banking, you have to take this course. Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "Be prepared to work and you will learn more than you have at any point in your life.",
    "This should be considered the quintessential yale course"
