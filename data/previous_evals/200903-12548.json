   "comments": [
    "Yes. This class could be for anyone interested in American institutional and societal development from its founding to the turn of the century. Very nuanced approach to understanding american state and party development. Stressed the ideational development of the United States and those ideological roots, in contrast to most economic historians. Very engaging and thought provoking. I have a much better conception of state institutions and their founding now. Very relevant to the current and likely future transformations in state administrative capacities - though this is not the entire focus of the course, only the last 1\/4 perhaps - I found this last quarter the most interestinghowever. The readings were really enjoyable.",
    "I most definitely recommend this course but the last 20 page paper is a killer, esp. because it is 80% of the grade. But from things I have learned in this seminar is quite deep and something definitely worth discussing about in the future.",
    "GREAT SEMINAR. Interesting but short readings. But the final paper is worth 80% of your grade, which means that the weekly work isn't much, but there's a ton at the end."
