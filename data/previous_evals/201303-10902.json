    "I took this class because I'd read reviews saying it was amazing and had heard from friends that it was one of their favorites. Take this with a grain of salt. Although there's not a ton of actual work, the course felt a little disorganized. Don't get me wrong, I think it's important for everyone to learn about the material that we cover, I just had a hard time engaging in lecture and never did the reading (typically, over 100 pages of reading were assigned for every class which seemed unreasonable given the nature of the course). This class definitely changed the way I think about race, ethnicity, and America's history, it just wasn't as good I hoped it would be.",
    "I got so much out of this class. Take it!",
    "Great class that will open your mind up and help you gain a new perspective. It always upsets me how much of history is erased in schools and textbooks. What you learn in this class, you will not find in your US or World History textbook from high school or maybe even college.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others looking to have a better understanding of racial constructs and the history behind them. I would recommend trying to make the most of the readings each week because concepts build and move away from the past so it's good to keep linking and connecting concepts.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a class about topics that we live with every day, but it allows you to think and discuss them in a detailed way.",
    "Professor Camacho was fantastic. She inspired her students, taught the course passionately, and integrated pertinent readings and assignments for each lecture. I only wish she had updated her PowerPoints with more images and formal lecture slides, as it was easy to zone out and get lost in her speech each class.Pros:- Lesson plan caters to the student, has a reasonable workload for the student.- TAs are invested in each section.- Great breadth of history covered, with a variety of course readings.- TAs and Professor open to student feedback.Cons:- Handouts and powerpoints are not updated, do not reflect all the points covered in lectures.- CBL assignments were late, many students missed out on opportunity due to lack of clarity in assignment directions.- You have to go to every lecture or you will get lost. Participation is randomly graded (sometimes therewas a sign-in sheet, sometimes there wasn't). Develop a good relationship with your TA so that they will know you're there when they see you, even if you didn't get to find the sign-in sheet.- Professor Camacho often responded late to emails or not at all (talk to your TA first).",
    "I highly recommend this course because everyone should take a course from the sage Prof. Camacho. She crafts great lectures and helps students of all stripes grapple with important issues. If you're looking for an alternate reading of US history, not too much work, and thought-provoking lectures, then this class is for you.",
    "Reading reviews, I know it is difficult to understand why everyone raves about it, but once you are in the class you will understand why the reviews are so positive. IF you have the opportunity to take this class, I would say take it! It is a great class.",
    "A different course, but I would wholeheartedly recommend it. Prof. Camacho's lecture style might be off-putting at first because she essentially tells a story every class, but you learn to enjoy and understand her way of presenting material. CBL project, global playlist, guest lectures, film screenings, and museum visits add to the fun quirks of this class. Lots of weekly reading that you should do if you want section to be interesting. Midterm\/Final are essentially 2 3-5 page essays each that you are given time to write on your own.",
    "Broad overview of many minority populations, social movements, and subjugated peoples starting from colonial times to the present. If you're looking to study a particular group (e.g. indigenous peoples of North America) more in-depth, this will be too vague for you, but otherwise, it's a great introduction to the major (and Camacho is fantastic). The work is minimal--take-home midterm and final, plus one 5-pager that can be replaced by a service project--so it's a good fifth class and pretty interesting in its own right. Attendance is taken at every class meeting, so be prepared to show up regularly.",
    "Yes! Definitely recommended for all students that want a deeper understanding of the roots of racism. A very timely topic.",
    "It's a good course, though it felt a little disorganized at times. I realize that some of that is purposeful and meant to show us unexpected connections between things separated by history and geography, but I sometimes felt that we jumped around so much that I never really understood fully some of the basic concepts we were working with. I did like that it incorporated literature and art along with historical and theoretical texts, and most of the readings are great. I guess I would have appreciated just a little more general introduction to concepts before we began zooming in on case studies.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The work is certainly not overwhelming, and you will for sure see yourself grow through the work of this course. The themes addressed in this course should be mandatory for all college students to discuss and learn about, regardless of your major or interests. This class opens your eyes to the struggles of the voiceless, and can definitely put your life into perspective.",
    "One of the best courses taken at Yale so far. Does a great job of informing students about history and modern day struggles concerning Ethnicity, Race and Migration. The readings are great and informative, the lectures are full of knowledge and passion, and the discussions are great jumping off points for greater discussions to be had in Yale. I highly recommend this course to any Yale student. It combats stereotypes and informs students of an encompassing narrative that is left out of American history textbooks. The workload is manageable, there is a lot of reading but you don't really notice because the material is so thought-provoking. The global playlist project at the end is a great applicable project for students to use their knowledge learned in the course thus far; and it's fun!",
    "A must take! ER&M 200 is a great class that covers many interesting topics. Prof Camacho is the best and very inspirational. This is not a passive class, but asks students to think about history in new and different ways. I would highly recommend it to everyone, no matter their major!On a side note, you also have a chance to do a community project. Although not mandatory, there is an option to participate in a community based learning project. This includes working with the Yale Refugee Project, New Haven Reads, JUNTA, and a number of other organizations in New Haven. It is a great way to give back and forces students participating to think about volunteering in a new way.",
    "ER&M is an interesting course, but it was very challenging for someone who has never taken humanities at Yale. The breadth and depth of the material made the midterm and final exam extremely difficult for someone who is accustomed to writing for social science courses. If you are interested in the subject, I would certainly recommend the course. However, do not expect the course to be easy.",
    "If you are genuinely interested in learning about this topic, this class will be interesting. Otherwise, do not take it. Professor Camacho is INCREDIBLY insightful and knowledgable. Sadly, she is a very boring instructor. She can have her moments when she really captivates the class but for the most part you have to try you best to stay awake.",
    "I think anyone interested in history and culture would benefit from ERM 200. It exposes you to a wide range of perspectives. It inspired me to delve deeper into a few of the topics we discussed.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are looking for the language and tools to more precisely define, identify, and speak about ethnicity race and migration--ie structural violence, legacies of oppression, constructed cultural norms.As would be expected for an intro class, the themes are broad and it occasionally felt like we were 'all over the place.' However, they are well situated in the syllabus with important readings and personal narratives (and films, poetry, and music) that make it accessible.Lectures themselves can be difficult to follow (and, I hate to admit it, occasionally somnolent), though packed with really important information and Prof. Camacho is absolutely incredible. An important class.",
    "This is a corrective American history course. You will listen intently to the voices not showcased in the dominant historical narrative of most mass produced textbooks. The material can be frustrating and heavy but its exploration is valuable and empowering. The first half of the course is largely American-focused, and the second half more international.",
    "ER&M 200 01 is a great introduction to a breadth of race issues. It isn't very specific in any area, but it does cover a lot of issues and events worldwide. There's a lot of reading but most of it is definitely worth doing and is super interesting. I would recommend it just because a lot of the race topics we discussed should be known just for the sake of being a well informed person.",
    "This is an excellent intro course. The material is very interesting and not difficult, workload is light, great professor and TAs. Also, it can count as a humanities or social science credit, which is nice for science majors like myself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is so important to know this information, regardless of your major, because of its pressing relevance to the present and our own lives.",
    "Take it! One of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale!",
    "I would recommend it to a freshman or a sophomore but it might become tiring and repetitive for an upperclassman. Two weekly 75 minute lectures that deal with broad themes and some specific case studies. Great reading list that combines historical, theoretical and sociological texts along with films and poetry. Takehome midterm, short paper, and takehome final - not too hard to do well in if you put in effort!",
    "Definitely recommend this class!",
    "A fantastic course everyone should take. This broad survey of topics related to Ethnicity, Race, and Migration covers an astonishing amount of material--we discussed everything from slavery in the United States to genocide of native peoples in the Americas to the Rwandan genocide and contemporary women laborers--but it all fits together very well, and is an extremely worthwhile class. Camacho is one of the three best lecturers I've had at Yale; I never felt bored or disengaged from her lectures. They're very moving, too: I saw multiple people crying during them at different moments. She is also unusually approachable and specifically chooses readings that are both very interesting and available online, which is fantastic. The workload is never overwhelming (100-200 pages a week, a weekly reading response, a take-home midterm, a 5-page paper, and a take-home final), and section was a very positive experience. If I had taken this class earlier in my Yale career, I would seriously have considered doubling in ERM. The readings and lectures really changed my perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Camacho is great, as are the section instructors she chooses. The reading, although heavy at times, was very interesting and thought-provoking. Professor Camacho's lectures, section meetings, and the readings all helped to transform the way I think about the past, present, and future.",
    "Super broad course that will introduce you to race. It's useful, but if you're not entering the major and you already have decent informal knowledge, maybe skip it? Also they take attendance at lecture and section, but really, I didn't find that showing up to class was that big a deal.",
    "You have readings each week and section each week. It helps greatly to be prepared for both the lecture and the section because then you are not lost and can contribute to the discussion. I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the issues of race, migration, gender, identity, power, and class. Students will learn about past events and can deconstruct them to understand the forces that caused and resulted from such events to analyze the world we live in today.",
    "Definitely a course EVERYONE should take at Yale. You will learn SO much that was never covered in your regular history courses in high school. Professor Camacho does a fantastic job at introducing Yale students to the field of ethnic studies with this course, and you will definitely be moved and changed by everything you learn\/discuss. This class can change your perspective on politics, history, and the world in general. Definitely a must-take!",
    "ERM 200 delivers fascinating and important about exactly what it promises, ethnicity race and migration, from the 1600s up to a couple decades ago. Though I loved the content, I found the delivery uninspiring. Lectures were lukewarm and hard to stay engaged with. As a whole, the class was good experience (I took it credit-D). The readings are great if you do them, you have excellent guest lecturers, and the workload is easily manageable. You get to do a CBL at a New Haven organization if you choose which is cool. It's not mind-blowing, but is a good class to take.",
    "Definitely recommend. It is so eye-opening, in that you realize that the majority of what you've been taught in history classes in the past does not encompass the full story of different ethnic and racial groups' experiences in America (and across the world). Prof Camacho is awesome, as are the guest lectures, and if you get Tisha as your TA--you're set! The only thing is that there is a lot of reading, but it is usually possible to skim the longest readings for the main points and supplement it with what you learn in lecture to be ready for exams (which are all essays). However, I would recommend actually reading if you have the time, because all of the readings are amazing as well!"
