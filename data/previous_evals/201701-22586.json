    "This course was an incredible opportunity to think about subjects thematically. I developed an appreciation for trade networks in the year of 1000 that I did not have before. I also especially enjoyed discovering patterns--how gold and ivory was valued in different regions, for example. This class excelled most at introducing individual objects and specific subjects of research, as in the first project looking at objects the Gallery.",

    "Class was extremely poorly organized, it had unclear assignments and was disjointed as a whole",
    "Very interesting and engaging class assignment. Professors go beyond the extra mile to make sure you learn as much as you can - they really care for the students.",
    "Strengths: Mexico! The final project, doing a museum case on a theme, was excellent! I also liked that the work was distributed throughout the semester with various projects. I think the handouts and presentations were a useful means of refining broad subjects to the essential. I learned about so many excellent resources and greatly improved my research skills. Weaknesses: Some weeks had topics that were ripe for discussion, but I felt we never got to the heart of the issue as the presentations consumed the entire class period. I also felt I needed a bit more thorough of a background in the broader world history than we got in the first three weeks. Ultimately, I wanted to come away from the course with more specific information.",
    "course lacked a theoretical foundation that would have enriched much of the semester's discussion I liked the idea of thinking comparatively about world cultures around year 1000.",
    "The course was ambitious, covering quite a lot. If there are weaknesses, they stem from the time constraints on the course more than anything. It would have been nice, for example, to spend some time on Africa or India. But for the amount of time afforded us, it was a surprisingly comprehensive experience that gave everyone at least a little of their main interest. This was further improved by the field trip to Mexico, which provided considerable depth to the course."

    "Take it! This was the BEST class I took in my time at Yale. What other chance are you going to have at Yale to take a wonderful comparative history seminar taught by 3 outstanding professors who really care for their students, and listen to many fascinating fascinating gems of history? The assignments are engaging and creative - you will have fun doing them, but you will learn a lot in the process. You'll never think of pre-modern history the same way again after this course!",
    "Absolutely, if the material interests them."
