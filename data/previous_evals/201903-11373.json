   "comments": [
    "Learned how to read papers critically, be cold called, give a short lecture on a signaling pathway, write a grant! This class was amazing and I learned so much from critiquing papers and writing the final NIH grant.",
    "Gained experience into proper and robust experimental design, what makes a good and bad paper, and finally how to write a grant proposal.",
    "You learned to really dissect a scientific research paper. It is also the place where you learn to get out of your comfort zone in terms of communicating scientific ideas. Every week or two, the professor would assign action items which are \"mini\" topics that you will have to teach the class prior to reading the paper. We also have to give an entire 20-minute presentation on a scientific topic. All and all, I think I had become a better communicator. Lastly, the final grant proposal teaches you to \"think like a scientist\" and to come up with research that you are interested in drawing from what we learned in class. It is a class where you have to be independent and the professor will not explicitly tell you what to do step-by-step. However, I know that Professor Crews is always so willing to schedule appointments with you if you need it and I wished I had taken advantage of that more. So, although it was a challenging class, it really prepares you for what you will need to do as a Ph.D. candidate in Biology, so definitely take it if you want to get a taste of what graduate school is like. 100% recommend.",
    "How to read a paper and write grants",
    "This class taught critical thinking about biological research methods. We focused on reading papers both good and bad: walking through the figures and methodology of each and discussing the merits and faults of every paper. We learned a ton of cell biology, discussing a new signaling pathway each week, however the focus on the course was more broadly on how to perform and think about research than on the specific factual details about each pathway.",
    "Cell & molecular biology research methodologies.",
    "I gained a much stronger understanding of signal transduction, but more importantly I think my ability to read a scientific paper and write\/talk about science improved a lot.",
    "The biggest and most valuable skill I learned in this class was how to read, analyze, and communicate scientific literature. In the beginning of the course, we focused on how the methods and materials used determine the outcomes you can draw in an experiment. By the end of the course, I felt comfortable with any scientific paper no matter how scary looking. I now understand that each paper has a point and that the figures build off each other to make that point and tell the story. In class, we really tore apart some of the figures in the papers we read, which introduced a healthy scientific skepticism. Professor Crews also gave us a lot of insight into the biotechnology industry. The final paper in the course is a massive independent grant proposal that is similar to something PIs would write themselves. This was extremely challenging but also rewarding. Overall, I grew tremendously in my ability to read and communicate scientific literature, and in my understanding of the core signaling pathways in cellular biology.",
    "Learned a lot about different intracellular signaling pathways. Each week we discussed the mechanism of a pathway, sometimes the history of its discovery, and went over several papers providing insight into its importance in the functions of life."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The student presentations on the pathway to be covered for next week were usually dry and not very memorable. Prof Crews uses a deck of cards from which he draws a card and that person has to explain the next figure in the paper we are reading in detail. I enjoyed this and it made sure everyone always did the readings and was ready to participate.",
    "Strengths: the professor, the students, and the level of engagement. It is definitely a pro that the professor actively tries to engage his students during class discussions with the use of index cards and the assignment of \"action items.\" It really facilitates and promotes an active learning environment. The only weakness is the stress of not knowing how you are doing in the class in terms of your level of engagement and your presentation skills as they were a bulk of your grades.",
    "Strengths were the prof and the skills we learned. I think it would be nice to have a better idea how we were doing in the class throughout",
    "The course requires a lot of participation and preparation. I had relatively little background in cell biology before the class, and needed to work pretty hard to understand the first few papers. Fortunately, Professor Crews provides a lot of support in terms of supplementary readings which are really helpful for understanding and contextualizing the specific papers. The small class size is wonderful. It makes participation easy, and Professor Crews uses a random cold-call system using flash cards with each person's name on them to facilitate equal and universal class participation. This may seem daunting to some at first, but I cannot emphasise how helpful this was in ensuring that everyone had a voice in the class and in forcing everyone to arrive prepared each day. The final grant proposal is challenging, but surprisingly doable. I really enjoyed it as a final product that I felt demonstrated how much I had learned over the course of the semester. I kept reading myself sentences and passages from it during reading week and feeling pleased thinking back to the start of the semester when I would not have understood any of it. The challenge of the final paper is getting started early. I think that it is relatively unstructured compared to term papers in other classes where often a draft of the paper is due before the final version, in order to ensure that everyone gets feedback.",
    "Strengths: You will come away from this class with a much better understanding of how to read\/analyze research papers. Weaknesses: (little to no complaints) => Perhaps a little more structured guidance about how to best write the final grant proposal?",
    "This is a great class. It offers great preparation for scientific careers, the assignments are interesting, and the workload is high but manageable. I think the biggest weakness is lack of constructive feedback on assignments -- there was none whatsoever. I think one thing I wished I could have gotten out of the class was a better understanding of a paper's broader structure. We delved deep into each figure, and got an understanding of specific experiments and how to present them. At the same time, we didn't ask questions like \"Was this the best experiment to perform here?\" \"How could they have organized this paper better?\" \"Does the paper logically flow from one idea to the next?\" We touched on this a little bit in the summary at the end of class, but I think we could have considered these sorts of questions in a more structured way. Additionally, this is very specific, but the grant review session was overwhelming. I could not read 11 grants (150+ pages of scientific writing) carefully in preparation for one session. I think a scenario in which we only had to read 5-6 carefully would be better. I also would have liked to discuss each grant in more detail -- not just have the reviewers talk.",
    "Strengths of the course include the name card policy (a stack of index cards with everyones names on them) that are shuffled and flipped over by Professor Crews to explain a certain figure from the papers we were assigned. This ensured everyone read the papers and participated equally in class, which was a good idea to have normalized since participation is heavily weighted. We started class off with action items, in which 4-5 students would have to share a quick blurb about a question Professor Crews asked them to prepare. This was a great way to start the discussion. Every week one student had to present the signaling pathway for the following week. I enjoyed giving and listening to these presentations, since it added something new to class. The small class size (11 students) was a great change of pace from the giant stem lectures and fostered great discussions. The main weakness of this course was that I found it very stressful in class, partially because of the name card policy. I also found that the grant writing, a huge undertaking, could have had more guidance.",
    "The week-to-week work level was not too much, and the majority of the work comes around the midterm and final assignments. These take a lot of time and care, and if you do not have much experience creating an experimental plan using cell culture techniques, you are probably at a disadvantage. However, this does not mean that it's impossible, it just requires extra work. One improvement would be if we could have access to a collection of the action items Professor Crews assigns for discussion during each class period."
