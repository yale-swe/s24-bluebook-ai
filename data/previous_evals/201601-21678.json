   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 120 to another student. It's a really cool alternative to other English courses where you read novels and analyze them. Because the essays are shorter and we read so many, the class never gets boring. It was also really great to write so many different types of essays.",
    "If you like writing or think you might like writing I would recommend this course. It is interesting and improves your writing skills through exploring other talented essayists.",
    "Great class, would recommend Shifra. Be prepared to write a lot, but not so much that it is unmanageable. Would recommend.",
    "Take ENGL 120! If you want to learn more about essay writing and about yourself, this class is for you. I loved all of the readings (and there definitely weren't too many). Grading was fair, and the amount of essays we had to write was not too burdensome (only 5). Be prepared not to get a perfect A --- and learn to be ok with it!",
    "Yes! Even as someone in the STEM field, I found English 120 to be the exact \"college\" writing course I was looking for. The english department really pushes you to be the best writer you can be. They care about your improvement more than where you start\/finish. Shifra is a fantastic professor, and you can tell she really cares about you as an individual. Liberating to say the least.",
    "Engl 120 is learning how to write a few different essay types seen in publications such as the New Yorker. It's so much more than the essays you had to write for college admissions, and actually a much more rewarding and enjoyable genre than that process made it. You get to break away from traditional essays and frankly, do something less dreadful and repetitive for a change. For each essay, prompts were very lose so you could write about anything, with little research required! If you are into sciences, it is a great writing credit because you just write about yourself and don't have to do heavy reading or lit analysis. I would absolutely recommend 120 to everyone.",
    "I would struggle to recommend the course. I think students would do well to read these essays in their spare time and take another course while at college.",
    "Gotta take it. Whether you are just trying to get a writing credit or if you're planning to write as a career, ENGL 120 serves all writers' needs and is really about personal growth in writing for craft. You'll improve and gain new methods of writing. And it's just fun.",
    "I would say it is a difficult course that pushes you but is extremely enjoyable and fulfilling."
