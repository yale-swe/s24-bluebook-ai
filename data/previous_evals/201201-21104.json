    "This is a great class for anyone who wants to know about modern Chinese history. It covers a wide range of topics. I would recommend it.",
    "HIST 877 is demanding in terms of reading workload [2 books + weekly reading response]so be prepared to commit yourself to intense weekly assignments. It is a great course for people who typically are disciplined and do their readings religiously, and who learn alot more from readings than they do classes. However, if you are looking for discussion-based learning, I do not recommend this class. One can probably learn more from the readings than they can from the discussion itself, which has a tendency to go all over the place. Also, students are supposed to choose two books out of a list, which means that most of the time students choose different books and hence are not able to participate effectively and fully in discussions. There are instances where a particular student does a presentation on Book X and the majority of the class have not read that. In this context, it becomes incredibly difficult to have a meaningful and useful discussion.",
    "Yes - absolutely. It offers a wonderful array of thoughts and issues for people from history and other disciplines, and in terms of critical evaluaton of secondary works, offers crucial methodological training for anyone,",
    "I would definitely recommend History 877 01 to other graduate students. Because the course doesn't require a knowledge of Chinese, it can be very useful to a wide variety of history students. The work load may at times seem heavy, but it is also one of the courses that makes a student feel very privileged to be at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "I have known a lot more about modern Chinese history from this class. I have got a lot of inspirations from the topics covered by this class.",
    "Quite apart from the actual knowledge gained, 877 will prove a valuable foundation for oral preparation, and recent discussion in chinesenhostory more broadly. Take the manchester conference last week - my whole responses and thoughts and coffee break discussions were hugely enriched by the 877 experience and acquired confidence.",
    "This course allowed me to branch out of my field slightly, but was a very integral part of helping me grow as a historian."
