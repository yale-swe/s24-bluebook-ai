    "colonialism was a great course!! a huge subject that I was only beginning to get a grasp on by the end of the semester. prof cattelino did a great job creating a syllabus that approached the topic from a huge variety of angles. very large amount of reading assigned though\u2014I think class discussion would have benefitted greatly by focusing on smaller sections of reading to ensure that everyone was on the same page. only two 5 page papers that counted for a large portion of the grade, which made them fairly difficult to write."
