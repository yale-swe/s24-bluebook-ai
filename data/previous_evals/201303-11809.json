    "Introductory art class, no previous experience required, weekly assignments. I would recommend this class to a student wanting to learn the basics of art. The classwork isn't particularly stimulating in a creative sense, but for a beginner it is just right.",
    "Visual Thinking is a great class whether you are an art major are not. If you aren't, you don't need to be a good drawer or painter to take this class. It is not about learning technical skill but rather learning about bigger concepts in art and pushing you to try new things and explore new media. If you are an art major, you will become a better artist and will get pushed in your art and made to think about how to move your art forward. If you are an art major, Anahita will let you incorporate your medium and your interests into the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Is a general overview about things to consider in art, such as form, composition, and color. The class is formatted so that it is open to all levels, but I would recommend taking this early on if you are an art major.",
    "you do al sorts of projects in this class, work with different materials and mediums. its sort of a \"figure out what you like to do\" class.",
    "Lots of in class group assignments which can be fun, but in-class crits could drag on. most of work was over the weekend.",
    "Take this class if you've already taken other art courses at Yale and are pretty certain that you want to be an art major.",
    "An elementary art class. Get it out of the way early so you can use the foundation in other courses. If you are taking this later in your studies, it will feel like a big step backwards in courses, even though you will probably still learn something. Also, you will need to bring a lot of your experience to the exercises.",
    "Art 111 is a very interesting art class, in that it doesn't focus on one medium or one theme. Essentially, the class is about experimenting in many different ways, and learning to understand how visual choices impact the viewer's understanding of your work. We focused primarily on composition and color, and had assignments that emphasized different mediums--charcoal, watercolor, cardboard sculpture, etc. We typically had weekly assignments, and classes were split between crits (I'd say around 60% of the time) and in-class group work (40% of the time).In terms of students, the class was very diverse. There were students from different years, with different art experience, and from different majors. Because of this, everyone's work was always very unique, which is something that the course encourages.As our professor told us, the point of the class isn't to come away with finished work--rather, it is supposed to provide an environment for experimentation. This makes the class a unique opportunity."
