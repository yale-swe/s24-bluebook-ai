   "comments": [
    "I learned how to carry out several procedures to determine quantitative and qualitative information regarding substances used. The course helped students become more comfortable in a lab environment and ensured that individuals understood the background and purpose of all experiments carried out.",
    "This course was way more work than half a credit and the teacher continued to make it harder than needed to be, including the grading of the lab reports and making the Friday Lab quizzes more difficult than the ones earlier in the week. It was really frustrating to also see him grading on accuracy in a freshmen level general chemistry lab, something that is almost unheard of. I think he was also disliked by many because he called students out for unrelated reasons; grading wise, he would take off points when the work didn't deter from getting the right answer or doing the work correctly, in class, he called students just because he didn't like them (no other reason).",
    "Honestly, I often felt as if I wasn't gaining much from the class. It didn't often feel related to CHEM 167 and felt like a lot of pointless and outdated lab techniques.",
    "That a course can be made unnecessarily stressful and difficult at the instructor's whim.",
    "Became faster at processes such as solution measuring and thermometer reading",
    "Almost none",
    "Not much? How to cope with stress and tedious tasks?",
    "I learned some important chemistry laboratory techniques, especially spectrophotometry, and learned how to make important chemistry calculations. This class is very helpful when paired with General Chemistry 2 ( CHEM 163) because it not only reviews material learned in the other course but allows you to make important connections between the theoretical (on-paper) part of chemistry and the practical (hands-on) part of chemistry.",
    "My practical lab skills were strengthened throughout this course, particularly in performing titrations and using spectrophotometry to analyze the concentration of an ion\/compound in a solution. Also, I became more familiar with other lab techniques, such as qualitative analysis.",
    "I do not feel like I learned a lot from this course. We did not discuss concepts during course hours, and it was expected that students learn the material by themselves outside of the course.",
    "I learned the importance of accuracy and patience in lab work",
    "How to perform titrations, the relationship between chemical species and concentration using beer's law, how to analyze chemical species qualitatively and quantitatively.",
    "This course teaches you how to write a formal lab report and maintain a lab notebook. Fundamental lab techniques are also taught.",
    "I learned how to do titrations better.",
    "laboratory skills and understanding of chemical processes",
    "This course is meant to teach you the technical skills and scientific thought process required to conduct experiments. However, the class doesn't always explain very well the scientific principles or why we do what we do, and so in the end it just seems like an exercise in completing lab reports that are arbitrarily graded.",
    "Despite what people say, class is actually interesting -- you get to see the applications of what you learn in class.",
    "I learned how to use excel, do things in the lab, and write structured lab reports.",
    "This course is pretty self-explanatory and helped me develop and practice basic laboratory skills necessary for future classes.",
    "You learn the basic mechanics of stuff you might need to do in a lab.",
    "Most of the stuff done in lab is learned in Lab I but applied in a different way.",
    "I learned how to deal with very strict grading, conduct titrations, and keep a neat lab notebook.",
    "We learned lab skills and applied concepts learned in lecture",
    "General lab techniques and. concepts that would aid in further study of chemistry.",
    "I believe this class taught me to persevere in the face of bad grades. I also learnt some valuable skills in titration.",
    "General laboratory skills, titrations, etc.",
    "I learned basic chemistry laboratory techniques, how to write lab reports, and how to be extremely meticulous, disciplined, and how to pay attention to detail.",
    "This class is aimed at teaching students practical laboratory skills.",
    "This course helped apply the theory of chemistry lecture into practical uses. Lots of laboratory techniques were explained and practiced in this course.",
    "Not much. How to stand on my feet for three hours straight, copy down procedures into my lab notebook, and how to do titrations, a completely outdated skill.",
    "I think this class succeeded in endowing me with little to no extra knowledge concerning chemistry or lab procedures in general. Almost every session involved looking at another permutation of titration, which isn't extremely relevant in the current chemical world. I think the insights that I drew from this class was that it was an overall unenjoyable experience",
    "I strengthened my skills in the chemistry lab, including titration, acid-base reactions, electrochemistry, etc. Hands-on experiments helped me develop a better understanding of the underlying concepts in chemistry.",
    "How to do basic laboratory procedures.",
    "basic chemistry laboratory concepts",
    "I learned a little bit more about chemistry lab procedures.",
    "Basic lab skils",
    "I learned basic laboratory skills, but did not feel like any of the assignments really furthered my understanding of any information",
    "Chem 136L builds on the skills we learned in the previous chemistry course - titrations, spectrophotometry, etc. while taking advantage of the chemistry learned in general chemistry II.",
    "Some of the basic lab skills from last semester were reinforced, and some new skills such as vacuum filtration\/crystallization and creating electrochemical cells were introduced. The lab reports were held to more stringent standards that called for a high level of attention to detail. I found that this semester even more than last, I learned a good portion of the General Chemistry material by doing lab experiments that related.",
    "This class was a continuation of Chem134L, so I learned comparatively few new skills that weren't already introduced from last semester: lab safety, titrations, spectrophotometry, basic calculations, etc. I learned a few new and interesting skills, such as how to use a pH meter and how to purify an inorganic compound. I also thought the class gave me a very rigorous round of practice in how to write thorough lab reports and keep an organized lab notebook. The class also forced me to learn how to be better prepared for lab work and how to strategize and work quickly.",
    "Honestly, this class turned me off from wanting to do more rigorous science classes. It felt like a lot of the expectations were unjustified, and it felt like that the class was intentionally restricting people from pursuing science with a method that works for them. For instance, Dr. G was really critical of how lab sheets were written, and there was a very rigid format that must be followed. While I understand the need to teach students to follow good lab etiquette, it seems unnecessary to punish students for doing what they're supposed to and NOT in the way Dr. G wants it. The only insight I feel like I gained from this course is that we unfortunately have to deal with expectations of our professors regardless of how unreasonable we think they are or how unhelpful they are to our learning.",
    "This chem lab teaches some necessary skills - titrations, spectrometry, vacuum filtration, qualitative tests, etc.",
    "This course provided laboratory skills that will be important for future laboratory courses and for research endeavors. It also reinforced and strengthened both laboratory skills learned in CHEM 134L and my chemistry lecture course.",
    "Gained comfort with basic laboratory skills and calculations.",
    "I learned and improved at skills that are useful in the the laboratory. I think I also got better at managing my time and organizing myself before each lab.",
    "More knowledge on how to do basic Gen Chem lab.",
    "I learned more laboratory skills and procedures in this course. I also learned how to better write lab reports.",
    "I gained some basic lab knowledge.",
    "Continuation of lab skills from semester one",
    "I learned lab skills that I will take with me in other courses and in lab research.",
    "A few assorted skills we didn't learn first semester, but mostly a continuation of first semester chem lab with more time pressure and more things to do within the four hour period.",
    "I developed the skill of putting in hours and hours of work to do things that could far more easily done by existing and more practical technology.",
    "I learned how to conduct chemistry experiments on my own with more confidence.",
    "I learned some lab protocols related to chemistry and some chemistry concepts.",
    "Titration skills, spectrophotometry skills, kinetics\/thermodynamics\/acids and bases knowledge.",
    "CHEM 136L provided lots of opportunities to practice basic lab skills (titrations, photospectrometry, etc.), as well as writing lab reports.",
    "I became more comfortable in the lab and learned many important techniques that will be useful in the future.",
    "Absolutely nothing. This is the worst course offered at Yale. The course is set up to make you suffer and to punish you for doing hard work. The level of expectations for this course are far beyond anything reasonable or fathomable, and the instructor goes out of his way to make students suffer.",
    "basic lab skills",
    "I developed a practical understanding of general chemistry techniques in the lab and of important reactions \/ chemical principles.",
    "This course did not really contribute to my gaining practical knowledge in any way that facilitated growth or learning. Instead, it made trivial tasks unnecessarily difficult and penalized students for small details according to the professor's liking. In general, it discouraged students from wanting to develop laboratory skills or engage in laboratory sciences.",
    "How to perform various tasks in a chemistry lab.",
    "I learned how to pull late nights writing long, useless lab reports that no one taught me how to do. I learned how to use Excel. I learned how to get 14\/20 on a datasheet only because of \"neatness\".",
    "I gained experience in the laboratory and with using basic equipment and materials.",
    "Honestly I don't think that this class taught me that much especially given that I was taking general chemistry during it. I felt like this class was essentially here are some formulas, memorize these or you will fail. Yes, I'm sure there was something gained by physically touching and observing the reactions, but overall I was disappointed by this class.",
    "I learned more lab skills and how to write better lab reports. I learned the concepts from CHEM 165 more thoroughly due to the fact that the labs coincide with what is learned in class.",
    "Further enhancing and supplementing skills and topics learned in General Chemistry 165, more laboratory techniques and new equipment and tests, basically a general extension of Chemistry Lab 136.",
    "I learned a lot of techniques that will be useful as I continue to do chemistry in the lab.",
    "Basic lab skills",
    "nothing",
    "I gained a good general knowledge of laboratory porcedures.",
    "I learned how to carry out several fundamental chemistry lab activities including titrations, synthesis, and spectrometry.",
    "We barely developed any skills in this course besides massing things using an analytical balance and developing a proficiency in titrations. Overall, we just learned to do monotonous tasks in a peculiar and highly specific manner to avoid losing points over ridiculous details. Basically, I learned how to best deal with the ridiculous and peculiar requests of the professor.",
    "Nothing",
    "This class made me be painstakingly neat and careful with my work. I learned how to write a thorough lab report and how to be timely with my work. This class was an extraordinary amount of work and stress for a half credit. I did not gain much knowledge in this course because the quizzes all tested my previous knowledge and they were extremely hard to prepare for (you just have to be good at chemistry). The lab reports were tedious and could take up to 10 hours. The reports themselves were useful as a learning tool but the experiments were often tedious and, most disheartening, completely irrelevant for any future field.",
    "how to",
    "The second semester of chem lab helps you learn a lot of the concepts you learn in second semester gen chem with kinteics\/equilibrium experiments.",
    "How to titrate meticulously and how to create many many graphs on excel. Also how to manage my time with very lengthy lab reports.",
    "I gained basic lab skills from this class however there was a lot of repetition and unnecessary procedures that made learning tedious.",
    "We developed lab techniques such as titrations, use of spectrophotometry, etc.",
    "I learned how to carry out basic lab techniques.",
    "Nothing really. I learned how to follow directions better.",
    "Chem Lab actually helped me understand the concepts and material gone over in Gen Chem 165. We went over basically the same thing but got to practice it so it could be better comprehended. A lot of times during Chem 165 exams I would come across a question and think, \"Oh I know this we learned it in lab\".",
    "I learned some chemistry lab skills.",
    "I learned a lot about chemistry lab techniques like acid-base titrations, mass spectrometry, etc.",
    "Literally nothing.",
    "None. This class is pure pain and suffering with no reward. Everything we did was covered in more detail and with better teaching in AP chemistry or regular general chemistry.",
    "I learned how to titrate and weigh things.",
    "I learned foundation of general chemistry",
    "The skills taught were very useful for future lab courses. In addition, the knowledge of chemistry paired very well and reinforced the general chemistry course.",
    "Not much in terms of knowledge or insight are picked up, but certain repetitive skills and ways of thinking are reinforced, I suppose.",
    "I learned various important laboratory techniques. I also learned how to reason about analytical questions. Moreover, I learned about the importance of scheduling my time effectively in order to complete lab reports efficiently and without rushing.",
    "I learned more basic laboratory skills as well as how to complete computations to find various data.",
    "I learned how to execute certain skills in the laboratory.",
    "Lab practice",
    "I have developed crucial lab skills such as pipetting, titrating, knowing how to perform spectrometry. This class has also reenforced key chemistry ideas and concepts I learned in Chem 165. I have also learned how to write formal lab reports.",
    "I learned very little in this course. The course is designed so that each lab makes the student use a new piece of equipment, but no lab really makes the students think.",
    "How to use lab instruments such as burets, pipettes, spectrophotometers, and LoggerPro. I gained skills in titrating, taking the absorption spectra of different species, and other specific types of procedures. We also learned general lab safety precautions and ground rules.",
    "I learned more advanced laboratory and organizational skills.",
    "I learned basic laboratory skills in 136L, in continuation to the ones I learned in 134L.",
    "I HAVE LEARNED NOTHING IN EITHER SEMESTER OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY LAB, SAVE HOW TO DO MEANINGLESS, MONOTONOUS TASKS WITH UNNECESSARY AMOUNTS OF RIDICULOUS, PARANOID CAUTION AND FEAR TO AVOID GETTING POINTS TAKEN OFF FROM THE TERRIBLE HUMAN BEING NAMED DR. G. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A MORE UNWELCOMING CLASS IN WHICH SO MUCH STRESS AND FEAR ARE INSTILLED IN STUDENTS FOR ALMOST NO REASON AT ALL.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lab was tedious and people were generally dissatisfied, but I do not think it would be changed in anyway to make it more enjoyable. It is a basic lab class that has certain fundamental concepts it must teach; although it may not have been the most exciting stuff, it successfully taught the concepts it had to. Grading was a little ambiguous sometimes and differed depending on TAs, so more universal grading might be more desirable since the class is on a curve. In Bio101 for example, a single TA would grade the quiz each week to keep it consistent.",
    "I think the course is strong, but the instructor made it much less enjoyable. I would have liked more practice for the lab quizzes, I think it was unfair for us to be expected to know everything he wanted us to know for that part.",
    "Weakness: Ganapathi is a grouchy instructor who, in my humble opinion, has done the Chemistry Department better days ages ago. A new lab instructor would provide a new life to WHAT SHOULD be an engaging and interesting first look into the world of chemistry. I considered being a chemistry major but Ganapathi really does not serve the Chemistry department ANY favors as being the first face seen. He is rude, cranky and has a rather un-uniform way of grading. The course itself is fine, Dr. G has to go.",
    "The class was a lot of work and commitment for half a credit, and it often didn't feel worthwhile. That said, I worked well with my lab group and TF, so there was a spirit of camaraderie throughout the semester.",
    "While the lab experiments themselves do relate well to the regular CHEM 165 course, the way that the course is run is completely unacceptable. Students should not be docked vast amounts of points simply for formatting errors, so that their grades depend more on formatting rather than on substantial learning. The class itself is extremely stressful in a very unnecessary manner due to the way the instructor runs it. It is to the point that I (and many other classmates) live in fear of lab day. I would dedicate nearly as much time to this course as all of my other courses despite it only being half a credit. And yet, despite all this preparation, hard work, and hours dedicated to lab, it is very possible that I will not get credit. The course also does not properly facilitate student learning as students are far more worried on getting good lab report grades and passing rather than learning the content. The level of difficulty of this spring lab course was a very large jump from that of the fall lab course. Again, the stress and difficulty associated with this course is completely unnecessary and changes with Dr. G's whims. Furthermore, this course has negatively affected both my physical and mental healthI cannot emphasize that this course is by far the worst course that I have taken at Yale, and it has made me rethink whether I should even be coming to Yale and whether I should rethink my career choice (and yet, I am doing very well in all of my other STEM and non-STEM courses). I think that this really says something about how the class is set up, and how the course is run, that is, extremely poorly.",
    "The course focuses too much on formatting and strict adherence to Dr. G's guidelines rather than on teaching lab technique.",
    "Experiments were generally interesting\/engaging. See my comments below about the instructor for weaknesses of the course.",
    "Dr. G and his entire system need to be changed. He marks you down on tiny things that are not necessary for actual labs and does not care about the actual final result.",
    "I believe this course has both strengths and weaknesses. It definitely teaches you the basics of chemistry in a practical setting and that is important. However, I believe the class is too repetitive and could be organized better. Some of the experiments were too long for the length of the lab, and often had to be left incomplete midway. The professor was aware of this, so students were not penalized if they were unable to finish a lab, nonetheless I don't see why someone would make a lab that is impossible to complete within the given time. In this aspect, it seems as if there was poor coordination and planning. Additionally, I felt like every lab week dealt with the same three chemical complexes and laboratory techniques. There was little variation. Every other lab was about oxalate or spectrophotometry. It was mundane and tedious.",
    "It's difficult to complete the lab reports without a whole lot of group work.",
    "I was not fond of the change in the level of difficulty of this course between first semester and this semester. The topics being taught were of the same caliber (in terms of difficulty), but the grading became much harsher and the information was taught and quizzed in a much more confusing way. I, as well as many other students, feel that this class was much more difficult than it needed to be for the same difficulty of subject matter. The course was strong however in familiarizing students with laboratory techniques. In this sense, I feel very prepared to take organic chemistry and its lab next year.",
    "Honestly, I feel students would really benefit from in-class instruction. It is not possible for students to learn all of the material on their own. The course would be better if instructors were more approachable, accessible, and willing to help students.",
    "The major weakness was Dr. G. He was an unfair teacher.",
    "The TAs grade differently, leading some groups to have an unfair advantage over others.",
    "The experiments were interesting. The material we were expected to know for quizzes and exams were beyond the scope of in class instruction. It was extremely difficult to do well on quizzes, even with adequate preparation because there was no practice or given expectations for what material the quizzes would cover. We were given pre lab lectures immediately before the quizzes which did not allow students enough time to conceptualize the material for quizzes. Also, success in the class varies widely based upon the assigned TA. Grading on behalf of Dr.G and the TA's were sporadic and widely variable.",
    "Strengths: This class is often graded harshly, so it forces you to come to lab and prepare. Moreover, it makes you form good habits when writing a lab report. Weaknesses: The time of the class is very inconvenient being 1-5pm without any alternative. The class sometimes feels like it is subjectively graded whereas which TA grades your lab report will dictate your grade in the class. The prelab quizzes often feel like they have minimal relevance to practical lab experience or the lab at hand. Lab reports often feel excessive or are graded unreasonably strictly. Labs sometimes feel repetitive, albeit while reinforcing fundamental techniques such as titration. Labs often feel procedural and strict in the sense that little freedom is given in performing independent lab explorations or reports, which are critical in practical lab applications.",
    "We go over a lot of good material for basic laboratory skills and relevant chemistry experiments. That part is good. Overall, the class is too challenging. To be completely honest, THIS CLASS IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. 1. Quizzes are obscure in content, because the questions are really complicated involving the math the student might not know how to do, or the question might have to be solved in a certain way that student would not be able to figure out in the allotted time. The students may know the topic or concept well, but they will fail the quiz because they have never seen the type of questions before, since THOSE QUESTIONS ARE OBSCURE. The quizzes should be eliminated. They put an undue amount of pressure on students to study for a class that is worth only 0.5 credits, which brings me too my next point. 2. I did the same, if not more work, for this class as 1.5 credit classes. IF I AM GOING TO WORK THIS LONG AND HARD FOR A CLASS, I DESERVE AT LEAST 1 CREDIT AND NOT A HALF CREDIT. 3. THE AMOUNT OF WORK IN THIS CLASS WAS DETRIMENTAL TO MY HEALTH AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. IT WAS OVERWHELMING FOR A CLASS THAT IS ONLY A HALF CREDIT. I am not saying this because I did badly in the class. I actually did well. I'm saying that this class IS LEGITAMETLY EXCESSIVE. IT TEARS PEOPLE DOWN. Students have other things going on in their life. I took 5.5 credit this semester. I'm sure other people did too. Students have activities and friends, and financial problems, and familial obligations, and social pressure, and academic stress. This class doesn't help any of that. This class makes you question your self-worth, because you try to meet these standards that are entirely too strict for someone in the beginner stages of laboratory science. It deters people who might otherwise be interested in chemistry from pursuing their interests in this topic. If we are going to be working this hard, WE DESERVE 1.0 CREDITS. Other introductory lab courses do not have this amount of work. Even more advanced ones do not have this amount of work. So we deserve 1.0 credits although lab courses typically only get 0.5. 4. The workload is UNREASONABLE. We write 10+ pages of lab reports every week on top of all other class work and on top of studying for an UNNECESSARY QUIZ. Sometimes it was less than 10 pages, but usually not. At least though, the lab reports are understandable. I personally think they could be shortened, but the content of those labs is relevant and interesting. 5. Grading on datasheets is too nitpicky. Students will literally get marked off for something and the only explanation will be \"NO!\" What does that even mean? TFs should grade datasheets not Dr. G. I think he is being too ambitious in trying to grade them all himself. In summary, IF YALE AND THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT CARE ABOUT THEIR STUDENTS, THEY SHOULD ELIMINATE THE QUIZZES OR GIVE US 1.0 CREDITS. If they don't and a lot of them only care about their research like I suspect, then someone else will call y'all out. This is absolutely ridiculous. we should not be suffering this way. What are you trying to prove? That students can be worked until their breaking point and still survive? Yes we can do the work, but at what cost? What are gaining from this? We can learn chemistry and lab skills without this damage. We work hard and do everything we are supposed to. We try as much as we can to the best of our abilities. We try to do better. It's time for the people that organize this course to try to do better for us.",
    "The grading does not always correlate with the amount of learning accomplished, i.e. many points are taken off for errors in tedious work",
    "This class doesn't actually allow you to exercise scientific inquiry. Instead, all you do is carry out a series of steps as outlined in a procedure, and all you learn is how to write out procedures according to whatever strange standard is set. There are times when you will be marked down for pointless things, and it seems as though the TA's and professor aren't actually paying any mind to teaching, and are more invested in criticism without offering any form of instruction to improve. It also didn't help that certain sections were given extra credit while others had different quality in teaching and grading. The class never challenged me intellectually; it only taught me how to write up lab reports and procedures. The TA's and professor could at times treat students with a lack of respect, even when unwarranted.",
    "Lab reports were unnecessarily hard",
    "The strengths are that you learn a lot about lab. The weaknesses is that the lab reports are overly tedious and time consuming.",
    "Typical lab class with lab content. Quizzes and lab reports were fair and are to be expected. However, Dr G could be quite unpredictable with his grading, and sometimes took points off of assignments without explanation. Feedback received was not always helpful, nor encouraging",
    "I really did not benefit from the pre-lab quizzes and thought much of the material that we were tested on was irrelevant and far outside the skill set needed to complete the lab. Even in the Gen Chem II class that focused only on the written\/problem aspect of chemistry did not have such convoluted problems on their exams and I don't think it was a fair way to assess what we learned and I don't think were prepared properly.",
    "I think there is too much disparity between the different lab sections because the TA's essentially dictate the student's experience in the lab. The course was strong in its depth and rigor, although I think the preparation time necessary for some quizzes, as well as the time distribution for certain labs, was not well thought out. I think this could be improved by some sort of standardization within the course.",
    "This class is horrendous. The workload is disproportionate to a half credit class, and also built to make students fail. Dr. G is self-indulgent and explicitly says he has certain assignments constructed the way they are so that students will lose points and do worse so he can \"establish the curve\" better. If the only way you can differentiate between students' abilities is building in arbitrary mechanical hoops into lab reports (did you remember to include this one sentence with a minor detail, was your tense right, etc.), then you're doing something wrong.",
    "Very high workload and standards that made the course somewhat unenjoyable. However, we did get to see some very interesting phenomenon within chemistry and spend a lot of time thinking about why they occured.",
    "Strengths: Good labs, comprehensive Weaknesses: None",
    "Strengths: you learn to master various lab skills Weaknesses: time consuming, tedious labs and lab reports, grading is unfair across sections, grading guidelines are not explained in detail leading to seemingly arbitrary point deductions, some labs are redundant or unnecessarily hard",
    "The harshgrading without comprehensive feedback is not conducive to a productive learning environment. It would be helpful if a rubric were provided for each lab report.",
    "The final exam is unfair. Those who take the practical exam are really stressed out, wheres the students who take the written test first are pretty chill. The format should be changed. It's unfair.",
    "Improvements can be made by making sure the TAs always know the procedure incredibly well.",
    "The experiments were often very long and challenging, along with the lab reports.",
    "Dr. Ganapathi makes this course unnecessarily stressful and challenging. His teaching methods (or more like intimidation methods) only serve to deter students from continuing laboratory work.",
    "The strengths of this class are that the experiments that we do are generally very interesting and worth doing. The weaknesses of the course is about the organization of the house by Dr. G. The experiments were extremely overstuffed with things to do, making it nearly impossible to finish everything in time. The quizzes became exceedingly obscure, making it nearly impossible to study for them. Dr. G's expectations for the lab reports and the data sheets were also not explained clearly or graded fairly, making it difficult to do well on either assignment.",
    "This class needs to change from being focused on finding ways for students to lose points, to instead teaching them modern chemical techniques needed in an actual lab. There are useless hours spent on lab reports, that really in no way teach you chemistry.",
    "Strengths: good T.A.s, manageable work load, etc. Weaknesses: experiments and grading can sometimes be unfairly difficult, and not applied uniformly across students in all T.A. sections. The course can be improved if the expectations for students are clarified before each lab begins (in terms of what % accuracy is acceptable, how detailed the reports must be, etc).",
    "Well structured labs. Writing the lab report can be extremely tedious and the grading stringent. The workload is very high if you realize that the course is .5 credits",
    "It is a huge time commitment and most of the labs aren't super interesting.",
    "The course did teach necessary concepts, but caused unnecessary stress with harsh grading.",
    "The course is structured nicely; however, it does not work at lining up with both of the general chemistry courses. Also, many of the labs are quite lengthy, considering the main lessons can be gained in only a fraction of the required procedure.",
    "Strength: Good prelab lecture Weakness: Emphasis on grading versus actual learning",
    "I really did not enjoy this course. The quizzes were unreasonable, as we were expected to have a deep understanding of information presented to us once. The labs taught basic skills of a chemistry lab, but did not further my understanding of chemistry topics. The final exam was half lab and half written. While the lab portion was fair, considering this is a lab class, the written portion was completely unreasonable. The test required us to have very specific knowledge of every quiz and experiment we have done, and we were given no practice exam so we did not know what to expect.",
    "I thought the experiments were well-timed and well-planned, and explained well beforehand to create a better understanding of the material. I think the stress of harsh and arbitrary grading detracted from learning the material - because most students work well and work hard in chemistry lab, yet it's very difficult to receive grades that reflect that level of effort due to huge inconsistencies across TAs, lab sections, and weeks of quizzes\/reports. Getting feedback on incorrect quiz answers would be helpful, and attempting to standardize grading across groups would provide a little bit of assurance (for example, where it's possible to get extra credit and where it is not, as this appeared to be clear in some lab groups and not in others).",
    "Strengths of this course: the class was very well-organized and predictable. Studying for the quizzes and exam were relatively easy because the lab manual and instructor's announcements made it very clear what the scope of the material would be. The pre-lab lecture almost always helped me gain a better understanding of the theoretical work involved. The manual was easy to follow and the experiments themselves, which were full of interesting (and often colorful!) results, made me fall more deeply in love with chemistry. Weaknesses of this course: I sometimes felt that the grading was unnecessarily harsh. Sometimes it was hard to understand why points were deducted from my lab sheets and reports, especially because sometimes I would only learn in retrospect that a particular requirement had been in place (for example, that graphs had to be embedded in lab reports, not uploaded in a separate document). The result was that I was often uncertain whether the amount of effort I put into my work would correlate with how well I would do on the assignment. Also, I did not like the forced-curve grading method of the class. Lab skills are essential for all aspiring chemists and other scientists to develop, and are not difficult with the right attitude and attention to detail, so it makes sense to evaluate each student's ability independently of the others'. But forcing the class average to be a B\/B- no matter how well the students did overall seems punitive for no logical reason. I thought last semester's (Chem134's) method of assigning grades based on absolute performance (90 for an A-, 95 for an A, etc) was a better way of running the class. It would also create a more positive learning environment.",
    "This class is unnecessarily difficult (grading-wise.) For instance, the class has now moved to grading on a curve, which is a little ridiculous for a course thats in general, not very difficult. I think the course either needs to just be upfront of how difficult its going to be instead of assigning work thats relatively easier than other science courses but having a punishing curve.",
    "This course has a few strengths and a lot of flaws. The strengths: it teaches you some good skills and gives you some experience in a chem lab. Alright now that we've got that out of the way let's go on to the weaknesses. Every lab day, we do an experiment from the lab manual. The lab manual outlines basic methods, procedure, concepts, and calculations. However, it is EXTREMELY hard to read and understand. Some of the material in there is just crazy - even my TA had a hard time understanding parts of it. I spent a lot of the time in lab just trying to figure out what the manual was trying to tell me. Secondly, the grading in the course is insane. Dr. G grades the report sheets (the thing you write all procedures and observations on in the lab) every week. Good luck with those. My main source of pain related to the report sheets was getting points off for neatness and organization. Careful, Dr. G isn't afraid to dish out those 10\/20s. If you take this course, be prepared to spend a lot of time and effort on it.",
    "Strengths are that the course teaches important laboratory skills and supplements information learned in chemistry lecture. The main weaknesses stem from grading techniques, especially the new policy this semester regarding grades being adjusted depending on the class average. If students work hard throughout the semester and earn high scores on lab reports\/quizzes\/etc., their finals grades should not be curved downward due to the average. Also, the quizzes sometimes included questions with calculations more difficult than what was covered in the lab manual or pre-lab lectures and the grading of data sheets often seemed rather arbitrary.",
    "The course is very cut-throat, which makes the learning experience worse. The margin of error is very small to get bad marks on quizzes, data sheets, and lab reports. It seems to me that introductory lab courses ought to be pass\/fail, as they often are at other universities.",
    "I think this course focussed too much on small details that could be used to lower grades and not enough on the learning and improvement of the students. More time could be spent teaching students to understand the material conceptually and less time on the neatness of their data sheets.",
    "The fact that the class is curved to hurt you is a bad thing. Some quizzes have material that is impossible to answer if you didn't know how to do the questions prior to the exam. It is also luck of the draw with getting a good TA.",
    "The grading scale was extremely unfair. I earned a 97% in the class and it was curved to a B+.",
    "We gained a good insight to certain basic laboratory skills but I do not think the material was presented in a straightforward and fair manner. The daily quizzes and the format of the quiz questions on the final were not properly representative of expected material. I think this course mad lab a more stressful experience than it needed to be.",
    "This course has all the makings of what could be a great course: competent and clear teacher, very interesting course material, and lots of fun time in the lab but unfortunately it is just the opposite. It is made unnecessarily stressful and anxiety producing by harsh grading and unrealistic expectations especially concerning what can be accomplished in the time given in lab. Everyone I believe works very hard to perform well in this lab but very few will be rewarded for this effort. To those entering, remember that this class is only half a credit and not worth all of your sanity, try and get what you can out of it and make friends with your lab partners because no one else will want you to do well. I do not understand why a class with so little long term consequence or weight needs to be so bad, I hope the professor will regard students criticisms not as whining but as a desire for a better learning experience.",
    "This course is very unfair. Students spend so much time working on prelabs and quizzes and the data sheets are graded differently on each day of the week and the quizzes supposedly get harder as each day progresses",
    "This course is great at familiarizing students to a wide variety of lab techniques, which is especially useful for this entry level course that is the first introduction some students may have to these techniques. That being said, the labs can be long to accommodate all of this. Although I understand that we have a limited amount of time for learning, this could sometimes make it feel rushed to get through all the components and have a good grasp on the techniques.",
    "This course is not run with the best interests of its students in mind. The steep curve encourages competition and an awful lot of week-to-week stress for a course that isn't all that intellectually challenging or engaging. The quizzes, lab reports, and data sheets all focus primarily on minor details and formatting as much as they do chemistry, and the grading is basically arbitrary. The lab reports were unnecessarily time consuming, and too many steps were crammed into each lab, ensuring that not only would students be there for four hours, but they'd also be under time pressure. It all leads to a situation where everyone basically dreads coming to chem lab each week, which is a good sign that the course needs to be seriously revamped.",
    "Overall, the content presented in this class was interesting, but not done in a particularly engaging or compelling way. While the information being passed down was useful, the instructor's methods were largely based havingg stidents learning the whole lecture by themselves before being given a brief and unthorough review before a large quiz. While I understand the merits of self-learning, the lab course was too heavily based on that in my opinion, given the complexity of what we were expected to do.",
    "The strength is I got pretty good at following Dr. G's ridiculous and arbitrary rules to try to avoid points being taken away. The weakness is I feel like I needed to actually know very little chemistry since the whole class was just doing the calculations we were told with no need to understand.",
    "It is graded much to harshly for an intro chem lab where most students perform well and deserve to get As",
    "I think this is a very engaging course and requires a lot of participation.",
    "This course covers several different types of labs, which exposes students to various chemistry concepts and procedures. I also found that the prelab lecture was helpful for understanding the lab we were about to do and the concepts behind it. However, the material is not engaging, the grading can have vast variation between sections, and the course requires a lot of time and effort for a half credit class. Some of the grading methods seem arbitrary, and students would often lose a lot of points for minor errors. We also rarely get feedback quickly enough to improve on the lab report for the week or to improve our datasheets, which meant we could accumulate lost points over repeated mistakes that we didn't know we were making.",
    "One potential weakness is that a lot of one's grade depends on factors like neatness.",
    "The labs tend to be a little repetitive, and on some lab days, there are just too many tasks to get done in the given time limit. Perhaps the prelab lectures could be shortened--virtually every student reads the information in the lab report prior to the lab anyway. Also, while it was a good intention to have students switch partners every week, realistically that didn't really work out. Finally, there seems to be unequal grading of lab reports due to each TF having different standards--perhaps this could be equalized. The new grading policy made everyone very anxious--could we go back to absolute grading? Relative grading helps nobody (it makes students stressed out and it contributes to the notion that this class is a \"root-out\" course).",
    "I liked that many topics covered in lab related back to lessons in general chemistry. However, I thought the lab reports were often unreasonably long. I hope that this lab would spark a love for chemistry, but I know it caused many of my peers to hate it, which is not what a class should do. Even if difficult, the class should still enable the student to appreciate the science.",
    "This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the worst course offered at Yale. The instructor goes out of his way to make your life a living hell and punish you for hard work. The TA's are uninformed and useless, the data sheets are graded harshly and unfairly, the quizzes were artificially hard and unsolvable, the labs were purposely extended by surprise just so student's could not finish them in time, and the grading was generally unfair and harsh. This is likely the only course offered at Yale with a negative curve, meaning that good scores correlate to poorer grades. The average in this course was curved DOWN to a B\/B+\/B-, which is unheard of for a course like this. Lab reports were extremely long (15+ pages every single week) and graded harshly and unfairly.",
    "The course was an exercise in frustration. As before, points were deducted for absurdities. Your brief method overview is \"too long\", never mind that no clear length is ever stated; although you answered the question on the quiz correctly, you said \"the concentration of hypochlorite\" instead of sodium hypochlorite; you failed to mention the Arrhenius equation in the overview, although you talked about it extensively in the procedure. The weakness in the course is the fact that in order to create a grade distribution for a class that is not inherently difficult, no one feels that the grading is fair and that just is punishing to morale. Why try harder when trying harder won't help? Bringing back percentage grade cut offs and giving a clear rubric for data sheets would go a long way toward making this less of a miserable experience. The experiments themselves are fun. The class doesn't have to be horrible. I know this has put a lot of people off premed and off lab work, and that's a shame, because this class has nothing to do with either of those things.",
    "I had a great TA who offered good feedback on my reports and good advice while in lab.",
    "Strengths of the course include a variety of experiments designed to help students develop laboratory skills - operating with state of the art tools and technology - but also understand key chemical principles. It is very well organized - students always know exactly what to expect in a given lab experiment and on the lab day (i.e. first lecture, then quiz, then experiment) The course could be improved by having set TA hours for students to attend with help on their lab reports. A lot of students have the same questions and it would save the TA time to have a session where they can answer these for the benefit of all students. Also receiving solution keys to quizzes would be helpful to review mistakes.",
    "A strength is that the lab reports are easy to follow and very structured. A way it could be improved is to have a standard of grading across all TAs so that it's not out of luck of getting an easy grading TA that you get a good grade.",
    "Strengths are that if you get a good TA the class is bearable. Weaknesseses are that Dr. G's a mean person and the class is just honestly a crunch and you don't learn anything. Dr. G really yelled at someone just for asking to borrow a pencil.",
    "I don't think that this class was set up to have students succeed. I think that questions like ones on the written final exam like what were the x and y axis on one particular graph used in a lab months ago are good examples of how this class is meant to weed people out. I also have never been in a class (despite being in many curved lectures at this school) where the class is curved down. I think that the TA's in general weren't very helpful and I feel like if the TA's don't fully understand how to go about the labs, or understand sigfigs, then the teacher should help out more. I don't think that Dr. G did this. The class was wildly inefficient; prelab lectures that could have easily been completed in 20 minutes would take 45. I think that Dr. G should have been more open to questions from students and to helping students while in the lab. I also don't think that many of the lab reports were well written; many of the end questions were not well worded and it was hard to get to the bottom of what I was supposed to write about. I wish that this class had been a better experience but the teaching and the TA's got in the way and made me dread coming to class each week.",
    "The strengths are that the material goes along with the CHEM 165 class. The weaknesses are that your lab TA determines how well you do in the class and how much you like the class. Some TAs are nicer than others so grading is not always fair. Also, Dr. G does not go over the material very well before the quizzes. You could prepare for the quizzes, but then a random unrelated question could be on the quiz. The labs are too long for the amount of time that is available so lab is very stressful!",
    "Strengths: The experiments were directly related to the CHEM 165 curriculum, which I felt made it easier to understand concepts. The class size was also relatively small, which also made the lab instructor\/TAs easy to approach for help. Weaknesses: Although the weekly experiments helped reinforce the concepts we learned in chemistry lectures, it was by far the most unpleasant experience that I had to go through. Dr. G. made it clear at the start of the semester that, unlike the previous semester in which the grade that a student got in the class was independent of what anyone else got in the class, he would be curving the class average (which was an 88 this year) to a B\/B+. Naturally, like many other students, I focused on making sure that I received a good grade in the class. This came at the expense of many important things, such as finding joy in learning and collaborating with others. This seems like an exaggeration, given that this isn't the only class at Yale that employs curves, but the manner in which Dr. G. and the TAs graded our lab reports\/quizzes made it seem like they were purposely trying to find fault with whatever they could for the sake of establishing a certain grade distribution. They would deduct points for not including certain \"key words\" in the purpose, despite the fact that the general objective of the experiment was explicitly stated. Moments like these really made me feel as if I were fighting a losing battle the entire semester.",
    "The pre-lab quizzes can be very difficult sometimes and that's quite a big factor in determining how well your grade is in the course. They are usually the bane for a lot of people's grades. The professor can be picky on grading lab data sheets. But the professor also seems very open to answering questions, clarifying, giving help, going over material, and does get back to emails in a timely manner.",
    "I think the weekly meeting is awesome; not too frequent, not too seldom.",
    "Awful execution.",
    "everything sucked",
    "A weakness of this course is that it does not prepare you well for many of the assessments that account for your grade in the class, such as class quizzes or the final exam\/practical. Class quizzes often drew upon prior knowledge of chemistry, and the final practical was based solely off of accuracy (which can be thrown off by uncontrollable factors in addition to controllable ones).",
    "The instructor, Dr. G, is unreasonably strict and grades unfairly. He often deducts points for reasons not articulated. Many can attest to this.",
    "This course was not particularly enjoyable for me. The labs were usually too long to fit in the time slot, points were deducted for errors that students did not know were errors, and TA quality and practices varied widely. My TA never once gave out bonus points and was highly unwilling to discuss his grading methodology, while in a makeup section, a different TA quite literally put the answer key for the lab out for her students to examine (and copy). Cheating is rampant, with former students sharing their lab reports and current students dividing up the labs and sending each other completed portions of the report. Some of these issues are inevitable in a course this large and this established at Yale. However, I would have liked to see a less rigid, more nurturing introductory lab environment. It's unreasonable for students to stress over a few missed points on a datasheet or timed practicum, but these few points can make the difference when you're graded in comparison with your peers. I really appreciate Dr. G's patience and commitment to this course, and I marvel at his ability to keep track of everyone. But I would like to see less emphasis on perfection in the lab and more on improving experimental and lab report-writing skills in a lower-stakes atmosphere.",
    "This course was the WORST CLASS I have ever taken not only at Yale but also in my entire life. This class was the single WORST PART OF MY YALE EXPERIENCE so far. If not for this class, which was a huge source of stress and unhappiness, my Yale experience would have been so much better. The entire class is just structured in a way that puts as much stress on the students as possible. The labs are ridiculously long and the data sheets are absolutely pointless. The lab reports have so much overlap with the data sheets that it's almost like doing the same assignment twice over. I can hardly think of any strengths of this course. The only thing that comes to mind was that this course was so stressful, difficult, and painful that it really helped in building my character. It made me have more perseverance and grit. Other than that, this course barely helped me develop any lab skills whatsoever. I felt like my life was wasting away every minute I sat in the lecture room and in lab. Summary: This class is the BIGGEST SOURCE OF STRESS AND BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME that I have ever experienced.",
    "The professor is the greatest weakness of the course. The professor is very unprofessional. His language and treatment towards the students is unbearable and unacceptable. It appears that he has a superiority complex that he takes out on the students. He is very moody. On Monday, he might be very lenient with his grading of the data sheets, and come Friday, it is a different story. He should not let his personal feelings get involved with the grading of the course.",
    "The worst class!",
    "This course could be greatly improved by making the experiments more interesting or relevant. The lab manual was very wordy and it was hard to find the actual steps of the experiment. Students in lab were often irritable and demotivated. The pre-class lecture was helpful, although sometimes it was too long. The purpose and main objectives for each experiment was very clear. The lab data sheets seemed to be graded arbitrarily, one week getting 5 points taken off for abbreviating too much and the next week getting 5 points taken off for writing too much. The grading was ruthless and did not reflect the students' effort.",
    "Too much of this course is focusing on logistics and catering to a certain grading preference, which at times requires writing minute details in lab sheets and reports that would certainly be less important when compared to other schools' chem lab courses. Although I quickly learned the preferences of the graders, it is easy to mess up early on because of incorrect formatting or wording or even grammar, and I think a more lax policy on grading these minute details and focusing more on concepts would be more conducive to learning the concepts in the course.",
    "The weaknesses of this course were that the quizzes suddenly got a lot harder and expected you to remember chemistry equations that we are usually given in chemistry exams. The lab reports were hugely laborious and largely just a waste of time as I did not learn much at all from them. The TAs sometimes made your life easier by being helpful. This course has the workload of a full credit so should be worth it.",
    "The class itself could have been very enjoyable, but Dr. G makes it unnecessarily hellish(?) it isnt even that he cares about the intellectual challenge - he is picky about the weirdest things",
    "There were many weaknesses of this course. The professor focused on unimportant minute details rather than stressing big concepts to the students. The work environment was not friendly, and the professor made students on edge rather than building a positive learning environment. For instance, when a student forgot to wear goggles they were berated and embarrassed in front of the entire class rather than being taken aside and advised one on one.",
    "There is no hope for this class. It is the worst class at Yale. It is a shame that so many freshmen are required to take it.",
    "Weaknesses: This course was extremely poorly structured--it isn't structured to help you learn; instead, it focuses on tiny things. Students are constantly worried about fitting every tiny thing to Dr. G's needs, that the actual learning isn't done properly. It's ridiculous to think that instead of worrying about doing the lab properly and understanding the material, people are more worried about the format of a specific table in the data sheets. The quizzes are difficult in the sense that you aren't given proper material to prepare for them and not enough time to complete them. The entire course has been a race against the clock while trying to get everything the perfect way that Dr. G wants it. The course is half a credit, but with the amount of work you need to do to a get a grade you want, you should treat it as a full credit course. Strengths: You do learn some application of chemistry when writing the lab reports",
    "Strength: The pre-lab lectures were helpful in understanding the week's lab. Weakness: feedback is slow in regards to grading lab reports.",
    "This course was very unfair. The material covered in this class was not very relevant to material covered in lecture and procedures covered in lab were not important for actual lab work as they are almost never carried out in real labs. Lab reports and data sheets were graded way too strictly and unfairly, taking off points for irrelevant errors such as neatness or the location of a table on the page. Material should better reflect that covered in lecture and be more useful for actual lab work done by real scientists. Work should be graded more fairly and less strictly.",
    "There are many weaknesses in the course. First, it seems that Dr. G has a personal vendetta of giving good grades in the course, very unlike Dr. Parr.",
    "The pre-lab quizzes are definitely the hardest part of lab. They are so hard because Dr. G quizzes on very minor details of the laboratory reports like what materials are used in the experiment or how to label the graph for the data, before we have even done the experiment and collected any data. You would basically have to memorize the lab manual or have a photographic memory to get full credit on every quiz. I really don't think it's fair or at all needed to test on how good a student's short term memory is. If we needed to know the material we are using or any other information we could just look at the manual during the experiment. Memorizing that type of detail doesn't actually help anyone learn.",
    "This course contains valuable skills that one should learn, however the way the material is delivered and tested made it extremely difficult to actually practice the skill and learn from the class. The class is absurdly biased and unfairly graded.",
    "The course was great -- it covered a lot of different lab techniques and integrated well the chemistry concepts we learned in class into the experiments we did.",
    "Very tedious class. Professor is very picky.",
    "Strengths: Depending on the TA a student gets, this course can be bearable. Weaknesses: Dr. G - literally the worst person ever.",
    "The course did a great job of teaching the material and making sure that you could not only solve general chemistry problems, but that you understood the concepts behind them.",
    "The strengths are that it encourages student bonding through suffering. The weaknesses are that it is taught by a sadistic man with no respect for his students or TAs, who is fine at teaching but does not even make an effort to teach towards his quizzes and final exam. The only reason anyone did ok on them was because we learned the material outside of this class.",
    "The course USB a lot of work, but the work itself isn't too difficult. However, Dr. G's insistence on pulling down everyone's grades created a competitive atmosphere. Dr. G also graded the lab sheets in an almost ridiculous manner.",
    "Strength is that the content is very understandable. Could be improved with more office hours.",
    "Honestly, the practical exam was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life. I didn't even finish (I kept making HUGE mistakes). It stressed me out! And the exam...was...was that serious? Like actually. I was NOT.",
    "This course gives basic lab training, but the work load was a bit much. It's only worth a half credit and I had to put more time into this one class than any of my other classes.",
    "A strength of the course were that the experiments were more interesting. I think that the course engagement with the professor could be improved. After pre-lab lecture, there is barely interaction with Dr. G",
    "Strengths - experiments were thoroughly explained in pre-lab lecture and in the booklet of procedures. Time in lab was pretty efficiently managed, experiments were good, reasonable amount of time was given for each experiment. In theory, the idea of weekly quizzes is good. Weaknesses - lab reports were excessively long and often just busywork, which made this class an overall negative experience. Grading was largely inconsistent across TA's. Quizzes would often test things that were straight memorization and seemed pointless, rather than judging actual comprehension of the material. The grading methods also promoted a competitive spirit, rather than a cooperative one.",
    "Strengths of this class is that it reenforces concepts from the lecture chemistry class. Weaknesses of this course is how harshly everything is graded as well as the pre-lab quizzes were relatively hard and not all of the concepts tested were taught in the pre-lab lecture.",
    "This course is poorly organized to facilitate student learning. The only resources available to students to learn from this course are the extremely vague lab manuals and Dr. G's office hours, which are understandably in the morning and therefore difficult to attend. The course is poorly organized in terms of structure and student engagement. I received very little or no feedback on my work.",
    "This class could have been much better if the labs were different. It felt as if we did the same thing each week without ever really learning about chemistry techniques for the lab.",
    "The course effectively taught us lab skills necessary for higher level lab sciences and outside lab work. However, the course focused unnecessarily on titrations and could have expanded our knowledge more by using or exposing us to the kinds of technology now used in chemistry labs. Additionally, the lab reports were excessively long and required mainly busy work which did not improve my understanding of the material in any way. I think less repetition, a shorter data section and longer discussion would be more effective and force students to truly understand and articulate the results of the experiments. Other than practice questions that were only given for a few of the pre-lab lectures, the pre-lab quizzes were hard to prepare for and unnecessarily difficult. They did not test our knowledge in laboratory skills, but rather on memorizing formulas, conversions, and types of problem solving.",
    "The instructor should be replaced!",
    "This course is does not always feel like it is designed for long-term learning.",
    "One weakness of this course is that grading varies widely among TA's, which is quite unfair to students in the coursetwo students with different TA's could end up with different grades depending on who their TA was. Another weakness is the new approach to curve the class mean to a B. In my opinion, this made the class much more competitive, especially when most of the students in the class (almost all pre-meds) were already working very hard. If a student words hard to earn a certain grade, they shouldn't be curved down because everyone else was working hard too. I hope this system changes in the future.",
    "The labs themselves were interesting but the lab reports were repetitive, tedious, and points were taken off for miniscule things like the title and tense of the purpose section, which I don't think facilitated student learning. Grading on lab reports were not representative of mastery of the material",
    "THERE WERE NO STRENGTHS IN THIS COURSE. ONLY WEAKNESSES. POOR DOES NOT REFLECT THE DEPTH OF MY FEELINGS AGAINST THIS COURSE. IT ATE UP 10+ HOURS A WEEK AND SO MUCH ENERGY, STRESS, AND SADNESS. THERE WERE NO REWARDS BECAUSE NOTHING MET THE STANDARDS OF DR. G. AND THIS CLASS WAS ONLY WORTH 0.5 CREDITS. THERE WAS NOTHING POSITIVE IN THIS COURSE.",
    "The lab work was very interesting. However, the grading seemed harsh this semester and the focus shifted a little bit away from gaining experience in the lab setting to your ability to perform well on lab quizzes and to perfect details in the report.",
    "I really liked when sample quiz questions were given and wish more had been distributed. Other than that, this course was very organized."

    "Please do NOT take this course unless you absolutely need it for pre-med\/ your major!! Most everyone I know has had an awful experience in this course. Grades are primarily determined by how strictly you adhere to formatting guidelines rather than learning of chemistry lab techniques.",
    "NEVER (the only people taking it are doing so for some requirement). No one would take this just out of interest, if it's being taught that semester by Dr. G.",
    "Do not take this course if you do not have to. Dr. G is awful when it comes to grading and there is nothing he won't do to mark you down. It is a hard class for 05 credit that no one wants to take except for Med school\/ major requirements.",
    "Not unless you have to. It's an irritating course that's an unfortunate right of passage for pre-med and STEM students.",
    "I would never recommend this course to another student or anyone. I would not even recommend this course to a pre-med student or someone who needs to take this as pre-requisite. I believe the course was not well-organized. As I mentioned before, I find it ridiculous that labs were too long to complete within the allotted lab time, especially when considering that lab is 4 hours long. Nonetheless, that is not the biggest issue with the course. The biggest issue is the professor. Professor Ganapathi is unprofessional, ill-tempered, and unsuitable for a position as a professor at Yale. He treats undergraduates and his graduate teaching assistants with little respect. If the course were reorganized slightly, and the professor were changed, then I would recommend the course because there are a lot of important skills and practical chemistry knowledge to be gained from this course.",
    "If you are a pre-med student, I recommend taking this course as a freshman in order to be able to advance to higher level courses more quickly. However, I would not recommend this course to take just for fun or because of interest.",
    "If you have to take this course to fulfill a requirement, I would advise students to take it when Dr. Parr is teaching it.",
    "No, I did not enjoy the course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you need it to fulfill a requirement but not if you wish to do it for the fun of learning\/experimentation.",
    "This course is required for pre-medical students, but I would not recommend this course otherwise. Grades did not reflect student performance in the lab, rather it was based upon unattainable expectations of report format and details not mentioned in the instructions. Regardless of preparation time and outside assistance, Dr.G was impossible to please.",
    "If you are a premed student, yes I would recommend this course because you are required to take it. However, if you are not pre-med or have the chance to place out of the introductory sequences, I would recommend that.",
    "Not at all.",
    "No, take it with Parr in the fall.",
    "If you need it take it, but know that it has serious flaws as it is now.",
    "Yes, but I would also warn the student that he\/she should expect a great deal of \"busy work\"for this course. I really enjoyed the lectures and found the weekly quizzes to be an effective teaching\/learning tool.",
    "If you're considering this class, it's likely a requirement for you. But there is so little to be gained from this class. You don't actually do any learning; all you get from it is an undeserved amount of stress given how little you actually learn. It's a pointless class if you don't need it for a major or track.",
    "Well it's a prereq so",
    "An important class to take if you plan on working in any labs or taking more advanced courses in the future. Lab reports are tedious and time consuming.",
    "I would recommend this course if and because the student is a STEM major and needs it to count towards their requirements.",
    "This class is terrible, but you also have to take it for premed, so you kinda just have to deal. Start the lab reports early because some of them take 8 hours and some of them take 2, and you only find out once you get into it. It takes very little thought, but a massive amount of mechanical execution and time in order to do well. You get very little feedback beyond \"Neatness!\" on your data sheets. Dr. G's terrible, but again, you don't really have a choice.",
    "No, only for a preqreq\/requirement",
    "Personally, I think it's too much work. But in terms of preparing for future chem courses, it gets the job done.",
    "No. Don't this class unless you are required to.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is required for your major\/pre-med. if not, there is no reason to take this course. It is a pre-requisite type course.",
    "Don't take this if you don't need to. It's too much work for half a credit. It may not be worth it. It is recommended if you are pre-med, if not, then better stay off.",
    "This course is necessary for certain majors and career tracks.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless required for the major or as a pre-med requirement.",
    "This class could be an interesting, engaging introduction to practical laboratory skills, but instead it is frustrating, boring, and unnecessarily degrading. This is all because of Dr. Ganapathi. He is outright cold, mean, and rancorous to his students. I watched him on multiple occasions trample over student's feelings. His feedback on assignments is unnecessarily harsh, and doesn't improve the overall learning experience for anyone. This is obviously a very important course for students in many majors. I truly hope that someone other than Dr. Ganapathi can be found to teach it.",
    "If a student is considering taking this course, they likely have to take it, making a recommendation largely meaningless. However, this class is extremely infuriating, mainly because of the structure of the course this semester as determined by Dr. G. The material of the course is actually really interesting, but the complete arbitrariness of grading and the extreme of stress that this course causes makes it a very difficult course to talk about in a good light. Hope that you get a good TA.",
    "No, but lets be real, nobody takes this course because they want to. It is required for many majors and pre-med, so everyone has to take it no matter how poor of a course it is.",
    "I would not. It was the least enjoyable class I've experienced during my time at Yale. It may be worth dropping premed to avoid",
    "Only if it is necessary for a major requirement; otherwise, no.",
    "I would recommend this only because it is a prerequisite. Dr G is a tough instructor and grader and the labs are overall pretty boring.",
    "yes, basic premed requirement.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it was required for their major or pre-professional track. Very little knowledge is actually gained in this course considering the large amount of class time and heavy workload required.",
    "No unless necessary - stressful course where grading is subjective, final was made harder than last year to lower the class mean from a A\/A- down to a B+",
    "Absolutely not. This class is unreasonably difficult, and is in no way set up for students to succeed.",
    "No. Do not take unless you need to.",
    "I would recommend it because it did increase my confidence in lab skills and reinforce general chemistry concepts; however, I would tell other students to be aware of the harsh grading policies and maintain a high attention to detail.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student who had the option not to take it. Although I gained some practice with lab techniques and was exposed to some interesting experiments, I felt overall that the stress and the punitive nature of this class made it less than worthwhile, especially given the amount of work (prelab preparation, exams, 4 hour weekly lab sessions, tedious lab reports) for only 0.5 credits. The grading is strict and based on attention to details that, while important, do not so much add to your knowledge and appreciation of chemistry as stress you out.",
    "Unfortunately, this is a class that basically most STEM majors\/pre-meds need to take. If it werent for that reason, I really would not recommend this course. The pay-off from the amount of work we had to put in was definitely not worth it.",
    "Don't take this course if you're not interested in being a science major.",
    "Only if it is required for your major or for pre-med.",
    "Most students who take this course do so due to needing it as a pre-requisite for their intended major or for other courses they plan to take in the future. I would not recommend it to students who do not need to take it for one of these reasons because it is otherwise not worth the time or stress.",
    "Unfortunately, this course is a premed requirement. It is totally doable, but entirely unpleasant, stressful, and discouraging. If anyone was considering taking this lab for fun, I would strongly urge them not to, unless they want to be miserable.",
    "I would recommend taking this course only if you are required to.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Also check out info on the TA's in your section before you decide.",
    "Only take if for your major\/premed.",
    "No but it is a prerequisite for everything.",
    "Never unless it was required",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they needed it to complete their major or for pre-med requirements. The material could be time consuming, so it is important to have some interest in the material in order to really commit to doing a good job.",
    "Obviously don't take this course unless you have to, but you probably have to anyway if you're a student reading this. It isn't a good experience but just remind yourself it's only a half-credit class and make friends with the other students in your lab, and you'll be able to get through it and take more enjoyable STEM labs in the future.",
    "I most likely wouod not due to the way the class is taught and run by the instructor. Whole the information is interesting, the style in which the professor expects you to know everything before he teaches it isn't particularly conducive for learning.",
    "Never but let's be real you're taking it for pre-Med so you don't have a choice. Otherwise he'll no Dr. G is literally evil and sexist and scary and has literally deterred several people from an interest in chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to gain experience in conducting chemistry lab experiments.",
    "I did not enjoy this class and would not recommend it to students unless they have to take it. While the concepts and labs can be interesting, the course requires a lot of time and energy, and the seemingly arbitrary nature of grading could be frustrating.",
    "It is necessary to complete a lot of requirements but can be frustrating because it feels like part of one's grade is based on factors like neatness.",
    "Only take it if you have to. And if you have to, then may fortune help you. You will most likely stay until 5pm on most days. Quizzes are difficult; datasheets and lab reports are harshly graded (perhaps this is consistent with the standards in the professional scientific community, but regardless, it is way too harsh for a first-year undergrad course). There's not a lot of room for creativity, because you'll just be following sets of written instructions. Good luck.",
    "If the course is not required, I would not recommend the course because the workload is greater than the work for most classes, even though it is only half a credit. It is known to kill your love for chemistry. The labs themselves teach useful techniques, but it was by far the most stressful course I have taken.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class.",
    "If you are thinking about taking this course but do not have to, you should consider seeking mental help because there is something wrong with anyone who would consider taking this course not out of necessity. If you have to take this course for your major, I am telling you right now to take it in the off cycle and avoid Dr. G if at all possible. I know, I know, you thought the first semester of lab wasn't that bad. Listen to me when I am telling you that the second semester of lab is with out a doubt the worst course ever offered at Yale, and you will suffer. Do everything in your power to avoid Dr. G for 136L if you want to stay sane. The labs are extremely long and difficult. Many parts are added \"extra\" when you arrive to the lab, unbeknownst to you until you're actually read to do the experiment. It was not often that I or any of my lab mates actually finished a lab in its entirety. The data sheets were graded arbitrarily, inconsistently, and harshly. It was not uncommon for people to get a 15% (or lower) on a sheet with no reasoning or explanation. Points were taken off for things such as crooked stapling, incorrect title spacing, and tables that \"just weren't good enough.\" With no clear mistakes or reasons, it was obvious that data sheet point reductions were simply a means to discourage students and lower their grades. Often one student would lose points on their sheet for any reason, but no other student who did the same thing would lose points. The pre class quizzes were extremely difficult and on very arbitrary things from the lab that nobody in their right mind would ever memorize. The lab reports were easily at least 15 pages every week, often times more. The TA's this semester graded extremely harshly and many people did poorly on lab reports. The expectations for lab reports were not clearly explained and many times TA's refused to answer questions. In general the TA's were confused about labs and often gave students false information that later became troublesome. The instructor was the worst part. He often came around the lab and yelled at students to intimidate them, or tell them that whatever they were doing was wrong, even thought that's what it said to do in the lab manual. He compared himself to Hitler once in a prelab lecture (not joking) and honestly at this point in the semester I am convinced of the comparison. This course is nothing but suffering and if you didn't listen to me and take it off cycle you will regret it.",
    "You probably need to take this class as your pre-req but if you can, don't try to take it with Dr. G. He is a nice man, but just requires too much for this class. The workload of this class is definitely beyond 0.5 credits as Dr. G always request you to do extra amount of work for your lab report or the lab. Usually you will find yourself unable to finish the lab and have to stay until the last minute. The lab reports and datasheets are just long and tedious. Don't know how other instructors for gen chem lab teach, but I heard orgo lab is better than this. I don't feel like I am learning anything in this class other than \"how to repeatedly do tedious stuff without wanting to kill yourself\"",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you have to",
    "The quizzes are very difficult and almost impossible to study for. Other than the quizzes, the lab reports are doable. The course is a requirement for many, so I suppose I would recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course to any premedical student. Not for students who are not required to take the class to fulfill requirements.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have to take the course for premed requirements. It was a main stress of this semester, since the workload and pace of the class was so demanding.",
    "Only take this course if you need to which, sadly, a lot of us do.",
    "I would only recommend this course if a student needs it for their major.",
    "No. Not unless required due to being a premed or being in a major that required it. It was not a good experience.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students because sometimes the TAs and instructors were hard to work with. This class was definitely the more stressful class that I have taken at Yale. The grading is not fair since each TA grades in their own unique ways. For example, some TAs give lots of extra credit while others refuse to give extra credit. If you are a pre-med you have to take this course, but if you only need a science credit, there are much better courses you can take.",
    "I would never recommend this course to anyone.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend the course if you don't need to take it as a pre-requisite or something; it causes a lot of stress and anxiety (personally) though the TFs can be very helpful and useful when it comes to writing lab reports.",
    "Yes, it is a good taste of chemistry.",
    "Absolutely not unless required for premed. If so, try to take it in the summer with Parr",
    "no",
    "Yes, but not the instructor.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you're required to take it. The grading is frustrating and inconsistent, the feedback is minimal, and it doesn't feel like anyone particularly cares about your success or learning.",
    "NEVER TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. THIS COURSE IS HELL ON EARTH. Even if you're premed and have to take this class, be mentally prepared to get destroyed and come out a different person in the process.",
    "No. This course is necessary for students who want to go to medical school, but I would not recommend this course to anyone as long as Dr. Ganapathi is still the lab professor. The course material is interesting, but the workload, his picky grading, and his personality makes the class horrible.",
    "Not worth it",
    "No. This class was a lot of work and stress for a half credit. The students were always stressed out because of the way the grading worked. Only take this class as a prerequisite.",
    "no",
    "If you are taking second semester gen chem, this lab helps you solidify the concepts! If you are pre-med, you will probably have to take this! Otherwise there are most likely more fun labs out there.",
    "No. Unless you must. This was not an enjoyable experience and huge time commitment.",
    "Dont take it unless you have to. If you have to, take it in the \"off season\" when Dr. G is not teaching.",
    "If you can try and place out of gen chem lab and start with orgo lab.",
    "Not at all.",
    "An okay class that one has to take for pre-med\/ chem\/stem majors. Pay attention to quizzes and lab. They can make or break your grade.",
    "You probably have to take it anyways if you are premed or if you have to take it as a major requirement. Good luck, I hope you get a good TA.",
    "Many students take this course because they have to already, but regardless, this course has taught me lab techniques that may be useful in the future. However, the grading may be very harsh, depending on TA.",
    "No. unfortunately this is a prerequisite for most science majors. This course is unfair and not enjoyable and material is not useful for real lab work or learning chemistry.",
    "Whether I recommend this course or not, the course is mandatory.",
    "I only recommend it for the reason that it is a requirement for premed or the Chemistry major.",
    "Only take this course if you absolutely have to. Dr. G is not a fair grader and actually curves down because too many people got A's last semester which apparently made the course look too easy. If lab is a pre-req for you, good luck and be ready to put in quite a bit of work to do well.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The work and effort that goes in is not recognized fairly, and you don't really learn anything because of it. However, you do have to take this class if you're pre-med.",
    "If you are on the pre-med track, or need the course as a pre-req for another class, I SINCERELY EXTEND MY APOLOGIES. This course is death. I may have said good things about the course, but the instructor is extremely harsh and I can't imagine how I came out of it alive.",
    "Only if it's a requirement.",
    "No. Do not take this course under any circumstances. If you have to take this for a major\/premed honestly switch your major and drop premed . This course will destroy you. Take it if you hate yourself.",
    "No. No one is taking this class unless it is absolutely required for premed or their major. This class is the embodiment of an L. It's not intellectually challenging, so if you're a typical yalie and enjoy intellectual stimulation this is NOT that. It's basically a ton of busywork that gets graded with absolutely unreasonable pickiness. I know more people who have cried over this class (me included) this year than for any other experience, except perhaps the election. The icing on the cake is that now, for the first time in history, the class is being CURVED DOWN. L. Avoid if possible. I'm sorry but before taking this class is the time to reconsider being premed\/taking a postbac.",
    "No",
    "I would avoid taking it with Dr. G if possible.",
    "Yes. Its interesting and you gain a new perspective on the world.",
    "I would recommend the course since it is necessary for many majors and\/or scientific\/medical career paths.",
    "I would recommend this class to students only if it is required by their major or if it is part of their pre-med requirements. I would not take this course by choice.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student who needs it as a prerequisite.",
    "Only if you need it.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless they had to take it.",
    "No",
    "If you need this for a major or pre-med, just take it when you are taking gen chem. If not, don't bother. Dr. G is quite short-tempered and the grading system for the labs is very arbitrary. I didn't learn anything from lab and it was just time consuming.",
    "I would not unless it was absolutely necessary for their major.",
    "No",
    "I found this class challenging in terms of grading and time commitment, more than in content.",
    "This class bolstered the knowledge of chemistry I was getting from my lecture course, but it definitely was more in line with the material of Chem 165 than Chem 167 (which I took). For students in Chem 167, it will take some extra time and preparation before each lab day, especially for the quiz, but it is doable (and necessary for pre-meds in Chem 167). If you're taking Chem 136L, it's probably because you have to for pre-med. Otherwise, I think there are more enjoyable and fruitful science courses that Yale offers that don't have the high workload or the competitive vibe because of the curve.",
    "Take it if it's required",
    "I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. I WOULD NOT INFLICT THE PAIN THIS COURSE CAUSES ON ANYONE."
