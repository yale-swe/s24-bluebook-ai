    "The class helped us develop our senior theses, and introduced us to important works in the architectural canon. Marta is available for 1-1 discussions to narrow down your ideas, and is a helpful resource. It guides you through the process of choosing and finding an advisor. Also, practice in presenting and synthesizing your ideas.",
    "Really the only thing I learned from this class is the date my senior thesis is due in the spring.",
    "How to develop a good project proposal as well as create a specific research project and how to present on your proposal.",
    "This class helped us cultivate research skills, and hone in on a subject for a thesis. It also helped us find resources and create bibliography.",
    "From my individual feedback from the professor, I learned how to organize my ideas and make them more coherent. I learned how to synthesize my research and argue for the importance of my work. From the class more generally, I enjoyed hearing about my peers' ideas and work. Occasionally from a reading or something Professor Caldeira said, I would get a little pearl of wisdom to guide me in my thesis work.",
    "In this course I learned different methods used in conducting and delivering research. However, this was limited. I would rather have received more feedback on my thesis and been better set up for the upcoming semester.",
    "I found that the readings added to the breadth of my understanding of my own project and also gave me space and time in my schedule to think about the work I wanted to do.",
    "The class was aimed at helping us develop our own research questions and goals through discussion and analysis of scholarship on critical theory and design."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths include the time to develop your ideas. Some of the readings were incredibly enriching, and its best to try and find the intersection between these works and your own topic of interest. The prompts\/assignments each week were good too, in that they wrapped up into the end-of-term project. The practice on presenting your ideas was great, and it was really great to hear everyone's ideas. Weaknesses included the clarity of assignments and the fact that it wasn't clear what was due on Mondays. It would have been most helpful to give us a written half-page that tells us exactly what to focus on for the next week's assignment, instead of relying on verbal communication alone (and the quick reminder like half a day before it was due). Secondly, too many students in the class! There was never any time to disucss each others work and learn from each other. Learning from the development of other peoples' projects was always the highlight of our other urban and design classes up to this point so it was disappointing that this fell out for the class (due to class size). Also, there was so much discussion of readings, that we didn't get to go into our projects as much. I would've liked to hear how everyone else's work was developing. I'd recommend somehow breaking the class into two sections or lecturers, in order to delegate enough time, in a fair and enriching way, to each student's development.",
    "Firstly, this course could be improved through basic communication between the professor and TA. While they had answers to my questions, they were often conflicting. It made trying to turn in assignments really frustrating and confusing. Secondly, the structure of the class needs to be rethought. I understand the reasoning behind giving readings every week. But in this case, the readings were prioritized over thesis progress. We talked about the readings thoroughly, and not at all about our thesis work for the week. I didn't really find many of the readings productive beyond filling up class time. Thirdly, we got little to no feedback on anything we turned in. If I didn't have an advisor, I would not have made any progress on my abstract or bibliography. No one even told us how to write a good abstract, even though it seemed like a good time to go over it. I think all of the steps (weekly assignments) made sense and had a direct path to the thesis, but without any feedback I had no idea if what I was doing was productive. Although, I did appreciate the presentations. It was good to present for classmates' feedback and then readjust for a jury's feedback. I finally felt like my thoughts and questions were validated outside of my advisor.",
    "I think taking a semester to write a proposal for a 1 semester thesis is maybe a strange division of time, but I thought the course was very helpful in allowing me to think through my ideas for my independent project. I also was able to do a lot of interesting reading for my project as well as through the course syllabus. I also thought hearing other peers research topics was interesting.",
    "This class did a good job in making sure we kept up with working on our thesis, however, it was very hands off and sometimes unclear about how our assignments should be created.",
    "First and foremost, Marta may need assistance teaching this course now that there are so many students! She did an amazing job trying to give us all equal attention, but I feel like it was a huge demand on her time and resources to advise all of us. If students want more time to workshop their individual work, and more individual feedback, I think the faculty on this course has to expand. Maybe team-teach it so we can split into two groups more to discuss our work? The readings and reading responses often seemed very disparate from the work we were doing on our independent projects. Emphasizing that reading responses should relate to both the readings and your independent project\/thesis might help this issue. There were also lots of readings that we had already done in our time at YSoA. Other students also had great suggestions on how to create assignments that help students keep up with their work on their thesis more. For example, reading an article related to our senior project every week, in addition to the canonical readings.",
    "The strengths of this course were the presentations and sharing our progress on our theses with others. The weakness was the reading material and in-class discussions which did not feel like much help to my thesis and seemed like a poor use of my time. I would have rather spent more time reading relevant material and reaching out to experts. However, I spent most of my time doing readings that were not very helpful and preparing for a discussion on those readings that also was not very helpful. The assignments for my thesis felt like an afterthought. They did not have clear explanations of expectations and often we did not talk about the assignments before they were due. We did not receive much feedback, we had to make 20min meetings to get feedback and those felt short. I would much rather have gotten feedback from my classmates and professor and teaching assistant during class time.",
    "This course was strong in that it is in a seminar form, thus giving more attention to each individual student. However, the huge class size may have made it difficult for the course to progress as smoothly and quickly.",
    "I loved how much time this course provides for our projects, and the general structure and readings. I think more guidance on the content and pacing (specifically the latter!) for our projects would be invaluable in future courses! I probably could have engaged much more heavily with my own research had I gotten more guidance on how and when to do so.",
    "Overall this course was really helpful, especially as our projects took precedent after midterm. My only recommendation would be for the independent projects (and assignments) to gain traction earlier in the term. I found myself spending too much time on the readings and not enough on my own work at the beginning."

    "I don't think you have a choice about taking the class. If you are in the urban or history tracks, you have to take it. As a design student, you also have to take it if you want to work on an independent project.",
    "I mean you have to take this class if you want to do any independent research. So if you want to write a thesis or do an independent project, it's probably worth it to just take the class. But definitely try to get an advisor early because you will be relying on them a lot.",
    "If you want to do an independent project, take this course!",
    "This class is required. But if it were optional, I would not recommend it.",
    "I think this course is a pretty good one for syllabus preparation, but could become truly invaluable with certain tweaks. Specifically, more help on crafting ones own reading list, how to formulate a proper argument, proper citations in research, etc. would really facilitate better and more complete investigations. More in class meetings between students and teachers, or peer reviews of the project itself, would also be invaluable!"
