   "comments": [
    "Broad issues related to biogeochemistry",
    "I learned a more in depth knowledge of field geology and global biogeochem cycles, and the interplay of key concepts surrounding both can inform of us on how the world works. The field trip at the end was vital for developing my skills as a geologist.",
    "In class: writing and developing scientific papers, how to read and interpret literature, introduction to modeling In the field: overview of Proterozoic geology of the Death Valley area, interpretation of sed structures, graduate level mapping and stratigraphy, sampling for geochemical analysis",
    "This class really focusing on different aspects of the carbon cycle through space and time and its connections to other biogeochemical cycles.",
    "I gained familiarity with recent literature on global and deep-time biogeochemistry. Additionally, I developed a better grasp of the basics of the carbon cycle, the biological carbon pump, carbonate production, diagenetic modelling, and many other fundamental concepts in biogeochemistry. More importantly, the class allowed me to lead discussions and practice conveying ideas in front of a chalkboard, which are skills that will be important for my qualifying exams and beyond. Fieldwork in Death Valley helped sharpen my observational skills and refine measurement and note-taking techniques. Even though I had known about them for many years, seeing classic Snowball Earth outcrops for the first time in person allowed me to reconcile the theory with my own observations. Logging Neoproterozoic stratigraphy for the first time gave me a better understanding of the nature of carbonate deposition during this time in Earth history, which will be useful in the future as I expand my field research into new locations and time intervals.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Clearer lecture structure could be helpful, but Noah's insights are fantastic and the class structure allows for flexibility and deep-dives into certain topics.",
    "Strengths: in-depth discussion in lectures on topics at the forefront of our field; historical context of the developments we now know about Weakness: lectures could meander at times",
    "I enjoyed this class and learned a great deal from it. The major improvement I would make would be to delineate mapping groups\/roles a little more clearly since students came from varying skill levels. Would be interesting if more senior students could write parts of the field guide or possibly lead small section if this trip was to be repeated. Overall this was a great course, well-pitched at the graduate level and the field trip was a key part of student exposure to outcrop\/field practices and getting to see geology that was discussed in class and is relevant to many people's research.",
    "I really enjoyed the field portion of this class. Even as a grad student who does a considerable amount of field mapping and stratigraphic logging for my research it was really beneficial to see how both Noah and Lidya work in the field and learn about carbonate sedimentology and trace fossils\/bioturbation.",
    "The papers we discussed had direct relevance to my research interests. The topics covered in class complimented what I was learning in Topics in Geobiology (G&G 721) without being redundant. The discussions were lively and informative. Occasionally they got off to a slow start, which could be remedied by starting off the class with a brief lecture to provide essential background and provide students time to gather their thoughts. The field component of this class was its greatest strength. Ideas covered in discussions were often raised again in the field and helped guide our observations. I was able to collect samples for my own research that I will process and analyze over the coming semester. The stratigraphic logs I produced will be essential for interpreting any geochemical data. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to do fieldwork so soon into my first year here at Yale, as it helped refine my research interests, develop a working relationship with my advisor, and kick-start my first major project.",

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. The class is very important for the complete education of a geologist.",
    "Yes, I think this is a useful course for a second or first year graduate student, particularly those who may be working in the deeper but may have not seen outcrops or exposures and\/or may not being doing a field season until the second summer. I do think it is helpful to have the people on the trip be required to participate in the course to even engagement levels.",
    "Yes, I would recommend both the in-class and field portions of this class, especially because it is really the only grad-level field class offered. The field portion of this class run well with a good combination of instruction and independent projects.",
    "Yes, especially if they are interested in biogeochemistry and want to become more familiar with recent literature. Also if they want to gain field experience."
