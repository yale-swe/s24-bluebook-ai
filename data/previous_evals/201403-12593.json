   "comments": [
    "Solid workload but the difficulty of the exams can sneak up on you. A good science class to take.",
    "Nice science class for non-sciency people.",
    "Take this for a relaxed science credit for non-majors. The material of the course is interesting for the most part (except for the module on reproduction).",
    "Good introduction to bio",
    "It's a good, easy science credit. You should do the readings, but you can get away with skimming them if necessary. Take it for a science credit, but don't expect to leave there feeling enlightened. It is no more intense than a biology class in high school, so if you've taken AP, you will be fine. You do need to study for the tests though, as there are three of them and they can be kind of tricky. The final paper is easy, as you essentially have the whole semester to write it.",
    "An amazing way to get a science credit",
    "TAKE IT especially if you're a non-science person (like me) and want a fair, interesting science credit. Your grade will reflect the work you put into the class. It's not a gut and it's not hard at all. Information is straight forward, not that science-y. It was exactly wha I was looking for my SC credit.",
    "Highly recommended. Despite its reputation, a REALLY really interesting course. I took it purely for the credit and it ended up being one of my favorite classes. ***In the same vein, however, not nearly as gutty as you would expect - there are 3 exams + 1 paper and all of them required a legitimate time commitment. Lots of people did badly. But worth it.",
    "MCDB is a summary course of biology with a spin towards the problems that arise with the biology. I would recommend MCDB 105 to another student because I feel like I have come out of the class with a better understanding of the biology behind some of the most contentious issues our society faces.",
    "Gut science class, but I also enjoyed it. Take it for a reasonable science class.",
    "I would definitely suggest this to class to non science majors who need to take a science class.",
    "Easy science credit but you still have to study. A lot of people think this class is a total gut and then they don't do well because they underestimate it. There is no homework or Psets, which is awesome, so the only thing you have to do is show up to class and take notes, and then study the night before for the tests. And there's an easy 5 page final paper. This class is definitely worth it for someone who doesn't like science or is afraid of the difficult Yale bio and chem classes. It's probably the easiest science credit at Yale.",
    "Take this class if you aren't a science major. Interesting topics and not too hard of tests. You also get to see pictures of naked people which is pretty exciting.",
    "A gut science through and through. This course is great if the idea of discussing trendy scientific topics without most of the science sounds good to you (and if you want a course for which no attention or participation is required during lecture). There are three exams and a paper - each of these has some odd aspects to it, but none should be too challenging. Memorization is minimal and thinking with the scientific method is at best no advantage and at worst a disadvantage. Potentially valuable for non-science majors or STEM majors in departments that offer QRs instead of SCs.",
    "This course completely lacked dignity. The topics are potentially really interesting, and Carlson and Gendron were fine lecturers (Summers was not), but the course overall felt so weak and self-effacing. It was way too aware of being a gut, and catered to that reputation more than any self-respecting Yale course should. What I mean by this is that sometimes the professors would say things like \"and that's all the detail you need to know,\" \"or don't worry about the specifics\" when the specifics are indeed what make the content actually useful, as if they were talking to us like we were dumb or lazy or incapable of understanding \"real\" science. Honestly, it was just sad. I recognize that many people do take this course as an easier way to fulfill their science distributional requirement, but the course really could have been so much more. Carlson was probably the only lecturer who did a really good job of treating us as intelligent beings and having reasonable expectations that we try to learn \"science.\" He was a good lecturer and was not afraid to venture into scientific details in a way that was both respectful of the audience's intelligence while remaining comprehensible to non-scientists, and would provide information that made going to class both necessary and interesting. If you're taking it, I assume it's because you need the science credit, so here's some advice. Go to lectures for Carlson and Gendron, at the very least. They will say things in lecture that may appear on the exams, but Summers will not. The tests were the most basic exams I've ever seen at Yale. They required so little studying, absolutely no grasp of scientific concepts, and only surface-level rote memorization of slides. Literally all you need to do it memorize the powerpoints. I think there was assigned reading in theory, but no one ever touched it and there was no accountability for us doing it. Section is mandatory which is unfortunate. Get a good, engaging TA or else you'll resent it all semester, because sections i largely useless. Overall, the content can be really cool and interesting (particularly Carlson's portion), but it's true to being a gut, which is sad in execution, but if that's what you're looking for and don't mind the lack of backbone, go for it.",
    "I would recommend it if you are humanities major looking for a decent science credit. The work is fairly minimal, but you will have to study a lot for the midterms which can be difficult. The first unit on diseases if much more interesting than the second and third, but overall I would say that I learned a lot.",
    "I would summarize this course as an ideal class for an individual with a very basic level of understanding in science, specifically biology. That being said, however, i would not recommend taking this course if you do not have any background in science, as it is difficult to engage with the material if you don't understand it at the very fundamental level. I enjoyed the section discussions and collaboration, and I found myself always engaged when we discussed themes of ethicality and other issues related to the science, but in units based on science solely, I found the subject matter relatively dull and it was difficult to fully engage. Take this course if you know a little bit about science and want to improve your overall understanding of the issues behind it, but maybe refrain from doing so if you have no background in science whatsoever.",
    "A presentation of science in world issues. Good SC credit if you're not a \"science-y\" person. People call it a \"gut\" but I would stress that it is really important that you study for the exams.",
    "It is an easy way to get a science credit. But you will need to put work in and study as well as writing a research paper at the end .",
    "I would definitely recommend, whether you need a science credit or not! A great class. I took it to get a science credit, but I ended up learning a ton in the class, and it was my favorite class. The sex unit is quite...interesting. You do end up learning a lot about yourself, if you know what I mean. The first two lecturers (Carlson and Gendron) are more charismatic than Summers, but Summers is still a good teacher, even though he tends to go through information faster than the other two. His exam is also easier than the other two.",
    "Great Class. Good topics but be prepared to study.",
    "More work than it needs to be for a gut. The tests are surprisingly hard.",
    "Let's be real, the reason why you are looking at this is because you most likely need a science gut. This class is kind of gutty but it is not an easy A. The exams are all 6 questions (pick 5) and some of the questions were never covered in class. The final paper is probably graded pretty easily but the exams are somewhat difficult. The material itself is interesting at times but, since the powerpoints are online, you don't need to go to class that often. if you need the science credit and can't find anything else, go for it.",
    "Yes. This is a very interesting course, as long as you are willing to be engaged in it.",
    "Definitely.",
    "It can be a trap. If you absolutely need a science, take it, but you better spend a lot of time studying.",
    "Three exams and one 5 page paper - not too much work and a great science course for those who need a SC credit. You have to keep up with the lectures and stay on top of the work - the tests are fair if you make sure you go to class. I wouldn't say it's difficult, but don't expect it to be a straight gut.",
    "NOT WORTH IT. For those of you who like science but are non-science majors, DON'T TAKE IT. You will waste your potential. Not as much of a gut as people say - you need to study hard for the tests. You think it won't be because the lectures are stupid and useless - the only thing I learned in the entire plant section was the chemical formula for photosynthesis, which I have known since I was 12. And then the tests are out of nowhere super hard. The only unit that I felt I learned something in was the 3rd on Reproductive Health. This unit was super informative and really great for people to know, but frankly the lecturer sucks and it was impossible to sit through. I really wouldn't recommend it. Find another class to fulfill your science credit.",
    ". Look, this course brings out more haters than T-Swizzle in a hipster coffee shop. But I'm here to tell you that it was actually a kick-ass class. You really do learn quite a bit of useful science, and as a Poli Sci major, I changed some of my fundamental beliefs about the way the world worked after taking this course. So all I can say is haterz gonna hate hate hate but this class and its profs are gonna shake shake shake it off.",
    "Take this class! Easy science credit\/enjoyable.",
    "A course for non-science majors on more \"real world applications\" of science. Parts of it felt like a flash back to AP Biology, but other parts were pretty new material. Overall it is not difficult, but do not fool yourself into thinking it is a gut----AKA you do have to study quite a lot to do well. However, if you put in as much work as you do for a course in your major, you will do well. Carlson is absolutely marvelous, Gendron is good, and Summers leaves much to be desired. Work load is manageable and the 3 tests + paper grading system is very fair.",
    "MCDB 105 01 was a really interesting class that has inspired be to continue studying bioethics. For that reason, I would recommend it to another student but caution them about the overly specific midterm questions.",
    "Take it. It's a pretty easy class, 3 exams and 1 paper. I really enjoyed the first two portions with Profs. Gendron and Carlson. They're awesome. Last section on sexual reproduction was a little dry and awkward.",
    "Good class for those interested in science with not much background. Covers 3 different topic areas.",
    "A must take for an easy SC credit",
    "It's a fine class.",
    "Many people say this is an easy science class for non-science majors, but while the lectures are straightforward and there are no assignments which is nice, the exams are not easy and the system of giving two different exams for each unit is sort of weird. If you're looking for an easy science class I may recommend it but keep in mind it is very gendered, at times uncomfortable, sort of boring, and not altogether \"easy\".",
    "This was a great class. Easier and pretty fair grading and interesting course material. Definitely recommend. And a great SC credit too!",
    "Never went to class. It was great.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student who is looking for an interesting, engaging yet very manageable science credit.",
    "I personally would not retake this class.",
    "The course is fascinating, yet designed for not science majors so it is not too advanced.",
    "A great course to take if you are interested in learning the basics of different scientific issues, but don't want to learn\/ have difficulty understanding the detailed science.",
    "This is definitely a good course for a science credit. It's information that's worth knowing and, while it's not a gut, it's a very manageable course load. The one drawback is that exams are at night instead of during the class period.",
    "All in all an interesting and engaging class. But by no means is MCBD 105 a gut! Super hard exams, very difficult to study for because of the absurd amount of information they expect you to know for each one. Review sessions were useless and TFs were a small help -- no one (the TFs included) knew what to expect when it came time for exams. My TF even admitted that some of the exams we had were totally unfair and too hard for the scope of this class.",
    "A crash course in biology with discussion sections on current biological issues in the world.",
    "An interesting survey course. Definitely test-intensive. I would recommend it to any non-science majors.",
    "Not the most relaxed science credit. Tons of memorization. All TAs are not created equal.",
    "Take it if you're looking for a light science course. The class is a lot of fun. Just make sure you study for the tests!!",
    "I actually would recommend this course, although it seems like a course people just take to get a science credit (it is). I liked the class -- if you're a non-science person who has had little to no prior exposure to science at the college level, I would recommend this course (in the fall, at least). You'll learn interesting dinner table conversation and gain an appreciation (at a very surface level) for the sciences.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class especially for people not particularly interested in science. It's basically an overview of everything in AP Bio, but I thought it was applicable and the class was engaging.",
    "A decent science credit with surprisingly difficult exams.",
    "i would not recommend this class to others!",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It is very interesting",
    "This was a great course. The material was interesting and the work load was not too demanding. Everyone should take this class!",
    "A science class for a non science major. No weekly work but lots of studying.",
    "Good course. Fun science for non-science people.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Great class, especially for non science majors. Thought it was manageable and interesting. Good to learn about every day issues",
    "A very easy science credit, but you do learn a lot. Go to lecture, section is mandatory, and prepare for the three midterms and you'll be fine. There's no final, but there is a final paper which is incredibly simple. I say take this class if you're not very into science but need the credit.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student looking for a manageable and interesting science course. I would, however, warn that some students entered this class looking for a complete gut and then struggled to do well. You do have to attend class (especially for the first module) and you have to study for the tests. If you do so, the class is very straightforward and easy.",
    "Interesting",
    "Issues Approach to Biology is a broad survey of various scientific topics observed from an ethical standpoint. I would definitely recommend the class to any non-Science people looking to fulfill their Science credit. I learned a lot about a host of topics without having to learn too much technical information.",
    "You're looking at this course probably for the science credit(s) you need. Don't be fooled by the \"issues approach;\" it really is a science course, and you'll have to work, but it will still be one of your easier choices for the Sc.",
    "Good science class for non science majors -- interesting material",
    "Do it if you need the Sc, but no other reason to take it.",
    "This class is great for people who are not great at science but want to learn about key topics and relevant news.",
    "I would absolutely recommend MCDB 105 to a fellow student, especially if that student was a non-science major looking for a fun science credit.",
    "Overall I would definitely recommend taking this course. It is especially directed towards non-science majors and focuses more on issues related to society.",
    "It is a very unique way of looking at the subject of biology, in an understandable way.",
    "Take it. It's a relatively painless way to get a science credit."
