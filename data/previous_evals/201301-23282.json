    "It is an English course, and I am a STEM major. I probably felt the same way about the course as all other STEM majors felt. I took it for the writing credit, but the theme of monsters made the class a little more interesting. We studied medieval monsters and other scholars' analysis of monsters' role in society.The class is comprised of 4 essays and ongoing blogposts. I wasn't exactly enthusiastic about taking an English course, but it was bearable. I guess it all depends on who else is in your class. Their personalities are actually what define the class and your overall enjoyment of it. The class is pretty much 1hr15min of discussion.",
    "An excellent course if your goal is to improve your basic writing skills.",
    "Yes. If you're looking to improve your academic writing this is a great course to take. The research paper was especially a great learning experience.",
    "Don't take it with Hurley",
    "It's a class that teaches the basics of college-level writing that I would recommend to every student who hasn't taken a similar class. Definitely required for an international student and highly recommended for any native speaker."
