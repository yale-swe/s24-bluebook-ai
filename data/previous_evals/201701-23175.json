    "I learned how to analyze readings and use the readings as evidence to answer essay questions.",
    "Great overview of American politics! Class was taught in a very approachable way, and the material was always interesting. The grade breakdown was perfect (2 essays, final, and section participation), and everything was designed to help us do our best. Learned a lot!",
    "This course teaches the basic theories of American politics and applies them to case studies.",
    "This course allowed me to better understand the fundamental workings of the American political system.",
    "It hellped me to better my writing skills, and have a better understanding of politics",
    "I developed a more basic knowledge about American politics and how the different branches of government and office holders within the government interact. It taught me about the many different factors that influence campaigns and the implementation of policy.",
    "Nothing.",
    "I learned about the American Political system, its inner workings and how to formulate opinions based on evidence",
    "I got basic exposure to political science research at the undergraduate level",
    "The best overview of how American Politics work.",
    "How to analyze political thought and movements",
    "I have developed skills in how to analyze the American political system and current events. I have learned how the media affects American elections, and about congress, the Supreme Court, executive orders. But mostly the course explored issues that arise from the American political systems, such as minority voting, collective action and prisoner voter rights.",
    "Basic understanding about structure and issues in American domestic politics",
    "I learned more in detail about how American Politics work, which was useful for me as a non-American student. I also learned how to apply the readings to the course-work. This was the first class that made me use the readings this much.",
    "I learned about the basics in American Politics, the structure of the American government, and theories.",
    "I get a comprehensive background of American politics, and learn methods in social sciences.",
    "I learned the basics of the American political system and how society engages with it."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures were laid out very nicely and very well organized. Some of the readings were kind of boring and not very useful. Given the age of media, perhaps some of the homework could be watching video segments.",
    "Great overview of American politics! Class was taught in a very approachable way, and the material was always interesting. The grade breakdown was perfect (2 essays, final, and section participation), and everything was designed to help us do our best. Learned a lot! All strengths, no weaknesses!",
    "A strength of the course is that it did a great job of providing on overview and introduction of the American political system. One weakness of the course were sections. I feel like I didn't really gain much from them. I think sections could have been more structured perhaps or provided more review of class content.",
    "This class is a great introduction to American politics and goes over a lot of interesting material, but it was sometimes heavy on reading.",
    "This is largely a boring lecture course that gives you the facts and figures. Th biggest strength is that it is a fairly comprehensive look at some of the most significant works in American political science. The course, however, is extremely dry (which is why only 12 people showed up for lecture each class out of the 60 enrolled).",
    "Class was a little dull, but section was amazing. Section was the best part about the class",
    "The course did a good job of covering basic concepts relevant to the topic. However, the material could be dry and section could have been more interactive and drawn from more relevant\/modern day examples of the topics for each week. I feel like there would be a lot of potential with this class to tie in current events to make the topics seem more relevant to the students but this was not done very often throughout the semester.",
    "Professor McCabe is a good person and surely very smart but the most boring lecturer I have ever had. Going to lecture was absolutely useless.",
    "The material assigned is radically different from the nature of what is discussed in class which makes it hard to come away with key takeaways from the material covered over the course of the semester",
    "It is a very well-structured course. Both my TA and the Professor were always prepared.",
    "Don't learn much in lecture--class time could be improved and more useful if it was say, more interactive.",
    "Very clear and organized course, good introduction. Could be more in-depth in some issues.",
    "The content on the course was presented well on powerpoint slides, and it was very helpful to use those slides to understand the readings better. The readings we did for each class were to the point and applicable, and never too long or too short. I think that the way the course content was presented could have been done more interestingly.",
    "Although Professor encouraged students to attend lecture, I think it would help with attendance if she didn't post slides after class. Could post slides before exams."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I found it very helpful and gave a really good basis for understanding the US political system. Especially given the times, I think this class is very important.",
    "Great overview of American politics! Very chill and enjoyable! Class was taught in a very approachable way, and the material was always interesting. The grade breakdown was perfect (2 essays, final, and section participation), and everything was designed to help us do our best. Learned a lot! Absolutely recommend-- must take!!",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would! It was very engaging and interesting. I enjoyed going to lecture.",
    "This is a good course if you want to learn the theories and practices of American politics.",
    "I would recommend this course, but I would warn students that it is 1) not a gut and 2)exceedingly dry.",
    "Absolutley, section was really engaging and I learned a lot",
    "Unless you are a political science major, I would not recommend this course. The information was not very interesting or engaging and it is not a particularly easy class to take for a distributive requirement or just for credit. I also didn't receive much feedback on my papers so I don't feel like I improved much as a writer from this class. I wouldn't recommend this course because I feel like there are many other social science courses offered at Yale that cover more interesting material and provide helpful feedback that will allow you to get more out of the class.",
    "no, I would not recommend anyone to take this class",
    "No I would not because I think that taking a class in politics or in the humanities is best done in a seminar and not a lecture format",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, and I would recommend they take it with John Dearborn as the TA.",
    "No, because the class was dry most of the year. Section was a lot of work and reading, but is what made the class bearbale and allowed me to learn something.",
    "Yes, I would reccomend this course to a Yale student who is interested in the American political system and how it can be improved.",
    "Recommend to those who are not familiar with American politics or political science at all.",
    "I would only recommend this course to people who do not know anything about American politics and is pursuing a Political Science degree. I would not recommend this course to someone who already knows a fair amount about American politics.",
    "I would recommend it to first years who want to pursue Poli-Sci and I would recommend it to upperclassmen who want to take a poli-sci class but are not necessarily in the major.",
    "I would recommend this as a great introductory course to get to know the American government. The information was easy to connect and comprehend. It was very general and a great way to begin to engage politically. The course was great at giving you the information and allowing you to explore that information critically and theoretically in your own interpretation."
