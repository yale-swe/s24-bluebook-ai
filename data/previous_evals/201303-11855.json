    "Really great way to venture out of the usual class type. Extremely fun and would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "A great course in woodworking. Focuses on hands-on craft: most of the class time is devoted to working in the shop on four sculpture projects. You'll also need to spend an average of an hour or two in the shop outside of class, in concentrated lumps over the semester. This is an art class, not a furniture class. There's opportunity to talk about artistic points, but to get the most out of it, you should make sure to think about your projects on your own time too.",
    "The class is really hands-on, which is the only way I learn, and it is really involving which is exciting.",
    "You do a couple of projects, learn a few different ways to bend wood and how to use both the hand tools and larger machinery in the shop. I would recommend it, i think learning about the structure of wood and how to work with it is important.",
    "Would highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in woodworking. Great overall course."
