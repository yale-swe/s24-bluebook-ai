   "comments": [
    "Are you genuinely interested in learning about poverty in U.S. cities? Then take this course. The readings may be a bit dense at times but they are effective. Professor Horan is a particularly just grader and you will benefit from the consistently high standards she holds her students to, both when writing and in class discussions. Seminars can be a bit dull at times, but you will be a more knowledgeable citizen for sitting through them.",
    "PLSC 280 is a seminar about urban poverty that deals with both policy and politics. Professor Horan is a great seminar leader - she is very knowledgeable and eager to students' points of view (but will also call out students when they don't know what they're talking about). The readings offer a good blend of perspectives and approaches, and reading is never too heavy. Overall, a great class!",
    "The class gives you a good idea of some of the big issues and problems in poverty politics (defining poverty, finding the causes of poverty, designing anti-poverty programs and evaluating them). I was one of only 2 or 3 non Polysci majors in the class and it was also the first plscy class I've taken. This was of approaching a social problem was pretty new for me, as were the perspectives of some of the other students (very practically oriented). I found it interesting but definitely a lot of reading, even for a seminar. Take it credit\/D if you can.",
    "Tough course to evaluate. Here's what I'd say: if you're OK with a professor who is deeply passionate but also willing to challenge and at times shoot down students; and if you like sociology as a discipline, take this course. I really like Prof. Horan but was frustrated by the class because, as a PoliSci major, I think I was put off by the sociological approach to poverty. I'd strongly consider Cr\/D\/F, at least until you figure out if you understand Prof. Horan's style, because I really couldn't figure out what she was looking for in the reading responses.",
    "It is a challenge, but take this course! You will not regret it.",
    "A good summary of poverty policy. I learned a lot, and Professor Horan is great about reviewing paper drafts and providing guidance on course work.",
    "This class was a great deal of work- lots of reading, wekly responses and two papers but you get a lot out of it. At times, it can be frustrating because there is no consensous at the end- and the course revolves around the theme that poverty is here to stay. I would definitly recommend the course if you are interested in the subject and Professor Horan is great!",
    "a good course to take if you want to learn more about poverty in the US--helps you think about what poverty actually is, how it should be measured, potential solutions. interesting readings and very good course to take if you want to learn more about urban development and approaches to poverty alleviation. don't expect to leave the class with concrete solutions though, because that is not the purpose.",
    "Yes\u0097this is a great class for people who want to learn a little about life in poor communities and a lot about efforts to end poverty in American cities.",
    "if you're interested in poverty and public policy, you'll like this course.",
    "A very good overview of issues surrounding poverty, poverty alleviation, and urban economic development. If you have any interest at all in the subject, you'll get a LOT out of the readings and discussions, which address fundamental questions like what it means to be poor and what the characteristics of the poor are, as well as practical issues like what kinds of poverty alleviation have been tried in the past. I feel very well-versed in the issue and knowledgeable about urban policy after taking this class. It's very much shaped my views about taxation, work, welfare, and culture, in ways that I know will continue to influence me for many years.",
    "Good course. Too big, which made discussion hard. Long readings.Take it if you're interested in the topic. Professor Horan is a very kind, accessible professor. She has high standards for written work and in-class contributions, but she really likes getting to know committed students, sowork hard and go to her office hours!",
    "It's a good class about urban poverty, if that's something you're interested in. If you're interested in cities in general, Professor Horan's other classes might be the way to go, but if you're interested in policy, as well as a history of social programs in America, this class is for you, as the other ones have a broader focus."
