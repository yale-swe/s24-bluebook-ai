    "Possibly. It's a good pre-industrial but the material can be arcane. Those interested in Chinese history will find parallels.",
    "This course is a survey of Vietnamese history. It covers a huge time period for a history seminar, and the readings span a lot of topics, though it's never really clear how much of the reading is entirely necessary--the more the better, but no expectation to finish it all. The class was small, but discussions were generally good, though at times they would drag on a bit. Professor Kiernan is friendly and helpful, and creates a good atmosphere in seminar.",
    "History 382J deals with the history of Vietnam (and, to a certain extent, the rest of the region, at least when nearby countries were competing with Vietnam for territory or falling under Vietnamese control) up through the early 20th century. I would recommend the course, especially if your only knowledge of Vietnam is the Vietnam War and you want to learn more about the country.",
    "The course is an in-depth survey of Vietnam's history. Unless you have a serious interest in the subject material, I would not recommend this class. It is very thorough and exhaustive, or at least it felt that way. If you are planning on being a Vietnamese historian or even a Chinese specialist, there would be no better course and reading list for understanding traditional Vietnamese history."
