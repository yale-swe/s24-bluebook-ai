   "comments": [
    "Need to have student presentations be less of the class time. Wanted to hear more from Ernie.",
    "If you are into Lat Am stuff, take this class. Course material is fantastic. I've learned more in this seminar than in most of my other Econ seminars combined... that said, it's sometimes quite a bit of work, and there's a regular reading response.",
    "This class will disappoint you, I guarantee. Listening to my classmates drone on for a full 2 hours is not why I chose Yale. There are far better, more stimulating Econ seminars. Take them, not this. Also, the weekly reading responses, midterm, and final 15 page paper are a LOT of work. There is no upside to taking this class. Learn about Latin American econ development on your own.",
    "ECON 467 is a great class that has a moderate amount of work. It makes you think. More history oriented with no math.",
    "Take it. Period.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "This course (though it covers interesting yet niche subject material) has lots and lots of reading, is graded somewhat harshly, and has lots of work (with a midterm! a midterm in a senior Econ seminar!) halfway through. Presentations were on the whole uninspiring, with Professor Zedillo only interrupting with somewhat insightful comments intermittently. Discussion is almost nonexistent, andProfessor Zedillo should really put less emphasis on the presentations in favor of either a professor- or student-guided discussion. Professor Zedillo (and Brian, the TA) were relatively accessible for discussion regarding key course topics and the final paper. I would probably not take this course again.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other economics students. Although it is a good amount of work and sometimes new assignments are thrown into the course plans, it is very worthwhile because of how comprehensive it is.",
    "I consider it a privilege to take part in this class. It is a very challenging course in regards to work load, but as Dr. Zedillo remarks, they are necessary materials if one wants to really understand the region. The Colloquium and the conferences organized by Dr. Zedillo are excellent resources one should take advantage of. This was one of my most rewarding and enlightening courses into economics and politics of Latin America."
