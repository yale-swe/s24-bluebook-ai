    "The assignments for this course consisted of critiquing current literature concerning vaccines. Student are taught how to critically read scientific articles.",
    "This course covered so many different aspects of vaccine development and design. It was very structured and concepts followed a logical progression.",
    "I loved the class and learned so much.",
    "-Sometimes I did not have enough background to understand the molecular mechanisms that we addressed in class. Perhaps a little more background at the beginning of class would have been helpful.",
    "very informative, though i wish i could have taken more advantage of it!",
    "Best class I've had in EPH",
    "Great course with great speakers. Sometimes there was a significant spread in the material presented. Some speakers were physicians that performed solely clinical work while others were researchers that aimed to develop novel vaccine strategies.Weaknesses: all the material posted on the class website was rather disorganized and difficult to navigate."

    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr. McMahon-Pratt is an excellent professor. I learned so much from her and her breadth of knowledge. She also was concerned about patients.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0-she was quite clear in what she expected of students. She did not lecture very often, but when she did she was quite good. I wish she had lectured more in fact.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0diane has always been very encouraging and helpful in helping understand the concepts presented by speakers.",

She was always kind enough to include helpful comments and advice on the papers - in terms of clarifying points from the articles and suggesting improvements for the next paper.",
