   "comments": [
    "Do you want to take German? Then you have to take this class. I liked it a lot, and I recommend it, but it's really about what language you want to take.",
    "Definitely take this course. The workload is never more than an hour a day, and class is actually fun. Although the textbook isn't the best, some of the topics (especially families) are quite interesting to discuss in class, even if it may seem difficult to do so in German. As an assignment, you get to Skype with a German student, and that actually helps immensely with your German.",
    "German 120 with Professor Schenker was a well-structured course, which I feel balanced speaking and writing quite well. The online component, CONNECT, had a few merits, though one should be prepared for it to end up a mild annoyance. The online component (OC) projects were on average very useful and usually quite enjoyable. The projects integrated well with the other coursework, and I think that my German improved immensely through them. Professor Schenker asked a fair bit of her students, but was always fair and pleasant, and extremely well-organized and responsive to questions after class and via email. I would happily recommend German 120.",
    "It's a good reinforcing of the techniques learned in German I. Nice preparation for actual German interactions.",
    "Solid german class. Connect (online homework) was horrible. Class was fun",
    "You cover a lot of grammar building on what you learned in L1. At the end of this class you will feel much more comfortable with the language.",
    "Good intermediate German class. Be prepared to spend a fair bit of time outside of class on online assignments and projects, but not too much in terms of other day-to-day workload.",
    "German 120 is by no means difficult. I made a lot progress and only ever felt stress from this class at the end of the semester. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always found German classes to be fun, especially in this department."
