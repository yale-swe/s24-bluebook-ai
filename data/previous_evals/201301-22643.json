   "comments": [
    "Yes, I'd recommend it, especially if you want to learn the language.",
    "Yes! I took Spanish just to learn it (I already fulfilled my language requirement with French), and I loved the professors I had. I learned so much in this one year, and the professors really want you to succeed, so they are willing to work with you as much as possible. Also, if you really do try your best and turn in all your homework, when you forget once in a while, they don't mind letting you turn it in late. This is good because sometimes you just forget...too much other stuff to do.",
    "This is a good intro-level Spanish course. More work than 110, but not overwhelming. You will learn a lot about Spanish-speaking culture, which is cool.",
    "Level II Spanish deals mostly with grammar.",
    "It is a basic understanding of Spanish and gives a detailed and broad explanation of all Spanish topics.",
    "A difficult class with homework every day, but one that is rewarding once you take it. Professor Reymundi is great - very thoughtful and understandable, and her class never made me feel left behind or overwhelmed. It's tough to keep up with all the assignments but they serve their purpose well, and it's exciting as you begin to realize how much better you have become at speaking and understanding the language in just a semester. Definitely recommended, but be prepared for the workload - it's not an L1 class and it will take time to do.",
    "It's a great class that has a heavier workload than L1. Take it with Reymundi--she's really sweet, encouraging, and helpful."
