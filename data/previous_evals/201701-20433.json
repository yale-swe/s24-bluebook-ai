   "comments": [
    "Through this course I gained great insight into the use of poetry in the reconstruction and contextualization of classical history. Professor Johnston was able to progress line-by-line through the poems we read and bring out the historical significance of each stanza, how it functioned politically and stylistically. To this point, as a student focusing on history, I have always had a certain discomfort with poetry. Thanks to this class, I understand how poetry is an essential competent to history.",
    "Very comprehensive treatment of the Roman imperial history, with particular emphasis on Augustus. Helpful for getting a good grip on using literature and poetry in particular as historical document and so on.",
    "A deeper knowledge of the interactions between poets and emperors, politics and art. I learned a great deal of imperial and artistic history simultaneously.",
    "Learning to identify and discuss subtext and subversive readings of poetry."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The breadth of the course exposed me to Latin poetry with which I was not at all familiar. I thought that the jumps in time periods from Augustan to the later poets was a little jarring, and maybe a little more background work would have helped. Overall, though, I encountered Latin I would never have otherwise studied.",
    "As discussed above, this course did an excellent job at broadening students' historical methodology to include the analysis of poetry. The class not only made us better historians but also superior readers of poetry, understanding the historical nuances of the works. Teaching was excellent, the whole class was engaged, and the reading list was very strong. If I had one suggestion, it would be to read slightly less Claudian.",
    "While Augustus is definitely a central figure in Imperial history (and with quite a bit of reflection in poetry), the course could have covered later emperors in greater detail, e.g. the Flavians and the Severans and the like. It could have also benefited from parallel readings of some histories, like Tacitus or Seutonius. The lectures that framed the poetry in historical space with the help of these authors and\/or used geographic markers like the maps of Rome in conjunction with Ovid's poetry were terrific.",
    "We read some lesser known poets and poetical works, which was a refreshing and exciting thing to do. The historical and literary threads of the course also were weaved together well. We did spend a lot of time on Claudian. He's extremely interesting but also rather difficult and (sometimes) not quite a good enough poet. Maybe we should spend only one week on him next time?",
    "Strengths: Pretty much everything. Incredibly engaging class time. I think it's valuable to read poetry holistically (not in a literary vacuum), because the poets were political creatures by necessity as all men are. Weakness: Sometimes we wouldnt make it far enough in the text in class -- towards the end of the semester we began skipping around, and I think it worked well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the class was very enjoyable. At times perhaps we could have spent a little less time translating and more time discussing, but I felt engaged with all the texts we read. Professor Johnston was very enthusiastic and helpful, especially in putting the texts in their historical contexts, which is always a weak spot for me.",
    "Fascinating discussions and readings. Would absolutely recommend!",
    "I would recommend this course to any Yale college student with strong Latin skills and a desire to read poetry within its historical context. I have often avoided poetry classes because the literature can, at times, seem unmoored from any of its context. This course did an excellent job of placing the literature in context, illuminating the history and the poetry.",
    "High level Latin course; definitely take it with the necessary background in language, but it is very rewarding even without multiple years of Latin or similar amount of language prep.",
    "Yes, it's a fascinating course that gives you some real breadth of knowledge and forces you to think in new ways, which are neither only historical nor only literary, but rather a combination of the two.",
    "Absolutely. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the classics. This course embodies what is great about the classics, an interdisciplinary and holistic field which doesnt separate Literature and History as Yale does."
