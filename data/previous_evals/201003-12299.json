   "comments": [
    "Spanish 266 is a good class if you're looking for a Spanish class with not too much work and no discussion. If you study, you'll get a good grade (and probably would even if you didn't study that much), and Prof. Gonzalez is actually really nice. Four 10-min quizzes on the history of the era (not much about the actual works), a midterm (that was basically a long quiz), and a final take-home exam that consisted of two 3-4 pg easy essay questions.",
    "The class is a good introduction to the material. It does not go into depth very much at all and there is only one time that you read a full literary selection. Otherwise the readings are just bits and pieces from various works, which some people might like and other people might finds annoying because you do not read the full text.",
    "Definitely recommended. Prof. Anibal is great&gives interesting lectures---definitely more of a lecture course than a seminar. Be aware that he focuses just as much on background latin american history as he does on the literature itself. However, the history is fascinating and you are only tested on the literature. Great class! Great professor!",
    "if your LAST and need a lit credit just take it",
    "Really interesting. The 9am is a bit early...you really don't talk a lot so don't expect to use it to improve your speaking. The Prof is really nice though and I feel like I learned a lot for not a heavy reading load. very much a survey course.",
    "The worst part about it is that it is a 9AM course. Other than that, it's a great course. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend Spanish 266 with Professor Anibal Gonzalez to any student of Spanish. If you love the language and would like to gain a better understanding of the history and literature of Latin America, you will read some great works over the semester: the historical chronicles of the conquistadors (Columbus, Las Casas, Bernal Diaz de Castillo), early poets like Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, romantic authors like Heredia and Avellaneda, and finishing with early modernism through Ruben Dario. Whether you're a Spanish major or looking for an L5 credit, the class is very interesting yet extremely manageable. The workload was probably an average of 10 pages of reading per week, with 4 straightforward quizzes during the semester and a midterm. Don't worry if you're not a native speaker; the class is primarily lecture-based, with participation basically through answering objective questions (very little discussion). And Professor Gonzalez is truly wonderful - he is so knowledgeable and extremely nice! I'm definitely planning to take another class with him.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it as a pleasant course with a relatively light workload. Profesor Gonzalez is wonderful. You have reading assignments for each class meeting, which are mostly very short (although a bit longer towards the end), with four quizzes and a midterm exam that are very reasonable. The final consists of two short take-home essay questions. It is a broad survey of Latin American literature, starting from Columbus and nearing more modern times. A good class, and manageable workload. Just be warned that there is virtually no speaking component in class. Other than certain students volunteering rare comments, it is pretty much just an intimate lecture course.",
    "Great class. A neatly encapsulated intro class for Latin American lit--just the right amount of historical background and literary interpretation. The reading can be a bit tough at times, but you don't actually need to look up every word to understand most of it, and Professor Gonzalez is always open to answering questions. (He is also an all-around knowledgeable, kind and humorous professor) My only complaint would be that there was very little actual speaking of Spanish involved. I guess that's just the nature of the course, but I had been hoping to both resurrect my rusty Spanish and knock a Lit major credit off at the same time. Still, I recommend it even though it was at 9 am this semester!",
    "Overall, I would recommend the course. The professor is great, gives interesting and informative lectures, and the workload isn't bad.This course isn't as much about Spanish or literature as it is about Latin American history and culture. The authors we read ranged from Columbus (a letter to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella describing the land he had found), to late 18th-century and early 19th-century poets and political activists. The professor is incredibly knowledgeable and it was fascinating to see how he used each text as a way to approach the culture from which it originated, but if you're looking for a literary analysis course, this is not it.For most of the course the workload was not terribly high--there were just a few pages of reading a night and four quizzes and a midterm spaced out through the course. We also read a short novel, and the final was two 3-4 page papers with specific prompts that were fairly easy to address."
