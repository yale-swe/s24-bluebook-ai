    "I would recommend this class, but only to those students particularly interested in analytic philosophy and with a special interest in the \"conditions of knowledge\" for their own sake.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, but only to those who are seriously interested in philosophy. You will be reading journal articles, and you have to process a lot of complex information in order to provide answers to the more evaluative types of questions on the midterm and final. Note that the first half of the class is focused on analyses of knowledge. Next you study Descartes, skepticism, and a bit on religious epistemology. The class doesn't spend a huge amount of time on epistemic justification.",
    "Phil 270 is a good class. It can get a little dry, but the questions that the different papers bring up are very interesting. The debate between contextualism and strong skepticism can get a little dry, but there's a lot of good stuff.",
    "hhhhh. DeRose gets carried away and waxes philosophical on the things we talk about rather than presenting a systematic picture of what's going on. A more traditional take on the history of Epistemology would have been preferable. Go for all of shopping period but don't be dissuaded; it starts out better than it'll be. The readings are really interesting!! But DeRose wanders.",
    "RECOMMEND. This class was fun, the expectations were clear, and there's a lot of support if you have no background in more modern philosophy (like, if you've only ever written a DS paper, then this is a bit different). A few reading responses, a midterm, a final and a paper. Don't need to study too much before the day before for either the midterm or the final. He gives you questions in advance and you have to prepare a certain quantity and then answer a certain quantity on the test.Readings were mostly fun and interesting, also.",
    "only take it if you need it for the major (m&e course).",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. DeRose is exceptionally clear in his lectures, the material is really interesting and accessible at this level, and the structure of the course was really good: not that much reading, but diverse sorts of coursework (tests, midterm, weekly reading responses). Take it.",
    "Overall a very solid course with a very manageable workload. Recommended even to those interested (like myself) more in social and political philosophy, both for its own sake, and as a tool for improving the clarity of your thinking and your writing.",
    "Epistemology is not an easy subject. It will really get you thinking about what we know and how we know it. Nonetheless, I would absolutely recommend the course - it will expose you to a new way to look at language, assertion and the world.",
    "Epistemology is an entry level philosophy class on the study of knowledge. We cover material from the early stages of the study of knowledge and end with skepticism (my favorite part) and the study of religious knowledge.",
    "Phil 270 is a great course for those who love epistemology\/analytic philosophy.",
    "This course is a cool introduction to a really interesting area of philosophy and is taught by one of the field's biggest heavyweights. The material is especially interesting if you come in with strong intuitions about what knowledge is--your opinions will give you a foothold with which to respond to the authors we read. The course has a very fair and even grading system--midterm, final exam, paper, and reading responses--so there are lots of ways to show you know the material. Professor DeRose is a funny and insightful lecturer, but he is a little circuitous at times so pay attention.",
    "Sincer everyone cares about grades: This course is not terribly hard if you do the readings and come to lecture (and frankly readings are probably more important thought lectures and helpful and frequently humorous). DeRose is a fairly lenient grader compared to some I've had, but you aren't going to get an A of any kind if you just come to lecture and never read.This course is a basic introduction to Epistemology. You will learn: some of the fundamental problems in Epistemology, some of the basic theories and positions regarding these problems, how these positions basically critique each other, and you will get to do some of your own critique and argumentation.The course was not terribly organized, and the lectures were not always easy to follow - definitely crucial to do the reading. Section was instituted after the course started which made it a little weird and disorganized.All that being said, DeRose knows is stuff, is very helpful if you go up an ask questions, is humorous and engaging in lecture (despite sometimes not laying out the material in the most organized or easy-to-follow way for beginners), and Julianne Chung (the TF) was very helpful and thorough if asked questions. Gave great (though often critical) comments on papers.I do wish that the course did a little more more in the way of introducing the material early on in the course and putting the subject matter in context. Why should we care? Sometimes this stuff does seem really out there and not very reflective of how any of us typically think about knowledge, belief, justification, etc. Putting the subject of the course in more context, even just within philosophy might have been helpful and inspiring early on. Again, overall, great course though.",
    "This is an excellent course for those with an interest in contemporary analytic epistemology. The readings are challenging but not overwhelming. The inclusion of Descartes on the syllabus provides at least some historical context, and the attention to contemporary religious epistemology makes for an interesting foray into an underappreciated area.One weakness of the course is its focus strictly almost exclusively on anglo-american writers. Surely French, German, and other philosophers are addressing many of these questions, or are engaging the issues from the perspectives of other philosophical traditions, and I think the course would be strengthened by at least some attention to such works.",
    "My opinion of this class was a roller coaster ride. I started out very engaged, especially since some knowledge of epistemology seemed so essential to other fields of philosophy (particularly ethics). I quickly became frustrated with Prof. DeRose's rambling, casual teaching style. I ended the semester interested in the subject again, and with a slightly different view of Prof. DeRose's teaching style. Go figure. But let me explain: I think Prof. DeRose's teaching style is best suited to an upper level seminar. Even though he emphasized again and again that the course had no prerequisites (although that First-Order Logic would be a good idea, which I have taken), he did not teach the course as if it were introductory, familiarizing us with the challenges and responses of epistemology. Instead, he just sort of threw us in, only taking time to define terms, and frame the topics of the course arbitrarily and spontaneously throughout the semester. Often he would just throw in things we hadn't even remotely discussed yet, like contextualism, at the beginning of the semester! I had to essentially teach myself epistemology from various encyclopedias of philosophy and survey articles that did the introductory work Prof. DeRose did not do. He would often name-drop epistemologists we weren't even reading as if we were familiar with them, which obviouslywe're not since this is the only introductory epistemology course at Yale. Moreover, lectures were outrageously disorganized, and pretty much consisted in \"Prof. DeRose's musings on [reading x]for the day.\" He seemed to anticipate this by handing out notes with most lectures, that were there presumably to help us follow his rambling, but to be frank, his lecture notes were usually utterly useless. They looked like the kind of crap I would write for myself last minute, 30 mins before having to give a presentation. They were just as disorganized and rambling as his lectures, which only compounded the problem. (Section did a lot toward clarifying the topics we went over in lecture though, so I'd highly recommend going to section.) Now that all said, Prof. DeRose was very funny, and did a lot to make epistemology engaging, even if I often had no idea what I was being engaged in or why. This is why I think he'd be an AWESOME professor in an upper-level seminar - he clearly knows his stuff, but doesn't know how to make it accessible in an introductory way. His rambling style is best suited for a seminar, where the emphasis is on discussion, and not lecturing. Also, in an upper-level seminar, you'd be more familiar with the ideas, so it wouldn't matter that he didn't explain things so clearly. So there you go - take an upper-level seminar with Prof. DeRose. Unfortunately, Prof. DeRose is Yale's epistemologist, and he teaches every intro Epistemology class, so if what I've described as DeRose's teaching style doesn't appeal to you, then you're sort of screwed. Some notes about the structure of the class: there was a final paper *AND* a final exam. This is so cruel. Nuff said. Overall, by the end I found the content of the course interesting, but I wished that someone else would've taught it.",
    "This is a great class, and if you're in the major, it really helps you think about a lot of what is done in philosophy in an interesting way. The work-load is very fair -- about an article per week, one in-class midterm and a final exam (both were fair and easy to study for), and one 6-9 page final paper. Prof. DeRose was a good and energetic lecturer, although he has a tendency to digress or be unstructured in his lectures and thus unclear. In the department, there are a lot of classes on the history of philosophy, so taking one that read contemporary research was relieving. Overall, a very enjoyable class that helps you begin to learn a lot about what the current state of epistemology looks like.",
    "Syllabus is a little quirky - so take it if you are interested in a slightly eccentric approach to the topic (and don't necessarily want a super-traditional overview.) Also, make sure you like Derose's style... it is unique. (but fun!!)",
    "Interesting intro epistemology course. I really liked the readings (which were short!) and the lectures. It was refreshing to see so many contemporary philosophers on the syllabus. Prof DeRose is a fun lecturer, but be warned that he does not encourage everyone to talk in the discussion portion of the class, so at least our semester it was dominated by just a few people (everyone else just sat there). The weekly writing assignments make you do the readings and think about them, which is great, but we didn't get comments back on them, so I didn't get any guidance on how to improve and when it came time to write the one graded final paper I wasn't really sure what the TA was looking for. Overall, I learned a lot about epistemology, but I didn't improve my philosophical writing skills at all.",
    "Prof. DeRose is an engaging and funny lecturer. He's a big name in the field of epistemology and even though he shapes the course towards explaining why his theory seems to be the best, he never forces upon you his ideology, always seemingly having a well thought-out answer to any push-back from the students. Course load is not too bad (and this coming from a non-humanities non-paper-writing-loving student) You were given a sample of possible questions for both the midterms and finals, so there were no surprises there. Final paper topic was on a topic of your choice. For someone who thought about this topic when I was young (albeit in a much simplistic way), this course provided a very thorough overview of how different philosophers have rigorously thought out the problems and solutions in this field. Definitely take it if you've ever wondered about how we are able to know what we know.",
    "Epistemology is an introduction to various theories of knowledge proposed by philosophers from Descartes to Nozick. The class focuses on papers and writings by these different thinkers, tackling concepts thematically rather than chronologically. The class combines lectures with Q&A sessions and makes reading material very accessible. It's an excellent overview for anyone interested in this area of Philosophy."
