    "This will be very hard in the beginning if you haven't taken Spanish before. So make sure to reinforce your class learning. If your friends speak Spanish, practice with them. Try to read easy things in Spanish.I had not taken Spanish before, I was somewhat overwhelmed at first, but the feeling sort of disappeared as I was learning the 5th tense... Yes, this class does a lot in one semester.",

    "Span 110 is great for teaching introductory spanish. I would definitely recommend it to a peer that is interested in learning spanish.",
    "I would recommend this class to others. Maripaz Garcia is a great teacher and really nice. However, do not expect this class to be a gut.",
    "It moves very fast. I advise that you have some previous spanish experience before taking this course.",
    "I loved taking this class. The teachers are very helpful. It's everyday, but I enjoyed learning this language."
