   "comments": [
    "Yes, I'd recommend it because it's a terrific survey of the latest and best research on civil wars, armed groups, and political violence. Anyone interested in doing a dissertation on one or more of these topics should not skip this course. It's also a welcome respite from the econometrics-heavy readings that form a great deal of the civil wars literature.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student. The course works as a very useful survey of the state of the discipline on armed groups and the production of violence. At times, it seems sort of scattered thematically, but again, by providing a set of cases at the beginning could bring the course together.",
    "strongly recommended",
    "Incredibly interesting, enjoyable and active class on Armed Groups and violence variation. A worthwhile course for anyone remotely interested in conflict and conflict management."

   "comments": [
    "It is unclear why this course should deepen my knowledge of the discipline\/profession at all. The strength of this course is, in fact, its interdisciplinarity. I learned a great deal about how political scientists can learn from cognate disciplines such as anthropology, history, sociology, and psychology. The course also helped move me closer to defining my dissertation topic.",
    "While this course did not cover a great deal of material for comprehensive exams, it did provide a good opportunity to further my knowledge on a topic that I am considering for my dissertation. It provides an important starting point by immersing me in the literature on the production of violence in civil wars.",
    "the reading list is quite balanced although the african cases receive less detailed attention that the more historic ones (WWII and Vietnam).",
    "I had a decent grasp of the literature in this area, but there were a lot of obvious things I'd missed. It was good to have an expert who knew how to fill in the gaps.",
    "I think this course will contribute a great deal to my dissertation research! Provided a great framework for thinking about violence and conflict in general."
