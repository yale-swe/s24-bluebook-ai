    "a VERY through introduction to Swann's Way, Proust and the Recherche, incl. the historical moment of its genesis, as well as a substantial overview of the secondary literature available on the subject. The latter also provided a platform for analyzing the different approaches and methods of certain schools and styles of literary criticism, which was enormously beneficial to me. In addition, I found all of the assignments (cultural-historical paper, critical argument paper, and annotated bibliography) helpful and meaningful to my own development as an academic.",

    "Great course! See above response. It was rigorous and engaging, well organized, DIVERSE (I very much enjoyed our visit to Beinecke and film night!), flexible (e.g., the dinner meetings and altering the syllabus to accommodate writing in the week before Thanksgiving), etc. The only assignment I struggled with were the canvas posts at the beginning of the semester. It was a time crunch for me to read and submit a response two days in advance of class, and I felt like my own responses were subpar. Yet again to underline the flexibility of Professor Kaplan's approach, we stopped doing these after the first month and it seized to be an issue. All of the other assignments were on point and enormously helpful to me.",
    "I really appreciated the mixture of work on the primary texts and on critical essays, as well as the pedagogical structure of the seminar sessions themselves. I loved the course."

    "Absolutely. I came out of this course feeling that I had learned so much about Swann's Way and its author, but knowing how much there was left to explore -- and wanting to do so! I think this is exactly the effect a course should have."
