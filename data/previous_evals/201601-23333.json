    "To put it into perspective, I took the course as a forestry students with no water background fulfilling the \"water requirement\" for my MF degree because the watersheds course was suddenly not offered anymore. So I went into this course knowing that it wasn't entirely applicable to my situation. That being said I enjoyed the content A LOT, it was in a way like going into a completely different field. Made me appreciate the water issues much more.",
    "This was my favorite course!",
    "My one suggestion would be to try and tone down the pace of the course. It seemed kind of manic sometimes (oh no we only have ten minutes left no time for discussion!). Maybe you could tweak it just a little bit to allow for more discussion and to allow us to go on an intellectual journey together. Class time isn't just about getting through all your powerpoint slides.",

   "comments": [
    "Hard to say, but I think the topics in general, the instructor, the paper and the discussions. There were a few topics that were really exciting like drought and climate change and others that bored me a bit like the law and regulations stuff (then again, law bores me in general). Also I really loved that Shimi let me run with my topic (that was a cross-over of water and forestry) and that I got so much good, constructive feedback on both the presentation and the paper. Feel like I've become a better \"scientist\" though this as well.",
    "I enjoyed how the three hour time frame was broken up. I appreciate the breadth of topics we covered and found great value in learning about the complexity underlying each of these topics.",
    "This course was excellent. I was excited on the first day and that sentiment carried through the rest of the semester. Shimi is one of the best professors I've had so far at FES. He is kind, thoughtful, patient, and of course has an expert knowledge of the water sector. He takes student questions and concerns very seriously, and facilitated discussion professionally and smoothly. I appreciated that he put up a list of discussion questions as fodder for conversation. The book that accompanied this course (Shimi's book) was also exceptional: the writing was clear, the explanations were thorough, and it really helped me to better understand the course material. The additional readings were also great. I also really enjoyed writing my final paper, and appreciated that there was a midterm portion due (really helpful in terms of pacing).",
    "We covered a wide-scope of water issues.",
    "the variety",
    "I thought the readings each week were particularly helpful and well selected. I thought the idea of having discussions was really good but they didn't really accomplish anything due to lack of time. And they didn't really give us opportunity to propose solutions either or assess different solutions based on case study approaches. I also thought the films were pretty important but I'm not sure that we needed to use class time to view them.",
    "The teaching and time the professor put into the course. The range of topics covered within water.",
    "I liked that we sampled all aspects of water resources, from agriculture to technology to scarcity. It was a great way to look at different aspects of the topic while also seeing how they were all interrelated.",
    "Shimon Anisfeld is an immense capacity in this field and a great instructor. He makes his students understand the system (with an all-round approach using many different approaches, which makes the sessions never boring) while providing incentives that help retain this knowledge. Although this course was also in my field of interest, Shimon as a teacher is an asset in and of itself.",
    "Working on the paper was very good practice in trying to propose solutions to complicated water management challenges.",
    "The course covers a wide set of issues in the arena of water resources management: water scarcity, floods, agricultural water use, industrial water use, water-related conflicts, among others. Shimi is an excellent instructor. He is a highly-experienced professional and he is very reachable in case students need further information about an specific topic. He makes the course really enjoyable and he encourages interesting discussion among students.",

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "To be honest, the pre-class quizzes and general time management. Concerning the pre-class quizzes, I think they were just too specific in the questions they asked. I get that Shimi wanted to encourage us to re-read the papers and book that way but a) I often just didn't have time for it and rather take my chances because b) even when I DID re-read everything and prep for a good 2h for the test I would not get a better score in the test. If the supposed incentive does not achieve the result the students hope for, then they will not continue the effort. In fact (and this might be coincidence) for the one lecture I did not attend, barely do any of the readings and not prep (but listened in class to revision) I got the highest score I had in all my tests - now what's that supposed to tell me about the worth of prepping? Ideally in my opinion the quizzes wouldn't ask about specific methods or anything but about main messages of papers (I liked the questions that were like \"The main idea of XXX (2012) was...\"), lectures and his book. Because I do feel people should have a chance to get a good score and I wasn't the only one who continuously sucked at them. Time management: I answered earlier that the discussions were some of the aspects I loved most about the course. But they were exactly what would be cut first when the lecture was too long. Don't cut the best part of the class.",
    "The final paper and final exam need to be spread out more! Completing both during the same week was too much.",
    "I understand why there was a final exam, and the exam to me seemed quite fair. That said, it might have been better to spread out the deadline for the paper (make it earlier?) and the exam date. That felt a bit crunched. I also wish we had had more time for discussion. That got cut in many cases throughout the semester, which was a shame. I also wish we had had a speaker more focused on international issues\/climate issues. Shimi brought Alon Tal to speak last semester, and someone like that would have been great. Or someone working with El Nio forecasting and water management.",
    "The discussion section seemed largely unnecessary. And many of the assignments (watch a movie and write up a response, for example) seemed like unhelpful busy work.",
    "We should make sure to have discussions each week during class.",
    "what is important to know",
    "I'd say striking the right balance between lecture, discussion and guest speakers. I'm also not entirely sure the clicker quizzes are the best way to assess our understanding of the readings. I wonder if there's some way to combine the question and comment submission with a short quiz that students need to take before coming to class that would somehow act as a replacement for the quizzes which I think take up too much class time. These may not be uncertain topics that might be unclear but rather are more general? I don't know what the best way to deal but I do feel that I wish our class time had been spent on clicker quiz time. Finally, I didn't think that the five-page submission for the paper prior to spring break was really the best way to approach a middle point in the research process. I think it might've been more beneficial to create an annotated outline from start to finish outlining the entire paper with particular sources to back up those points... Like an annotated bibliography\/outline. I felt that the five-page requirement limited me and that I really was only reading and assessing research that I thought applied to the first half my paper one really by that time I should've had focused on the entire paper structure, and more carefully understand what I was going. Even though the pros might not of been there the structure may have been more easy to comment upon? And I would've had a better understanding of where and what topics needed more coverage.",
    "Field trips could have been to more interesting places but were still good.",
    "It seemed like 70% of the time we were trying to cram too much material into one class. Although at the end it seemed like we caught up I think we should have focused more on the last unit on floods since it's such a relevant topic. Overall it seemed like we were constantly trying to play catch up and while this helped connect topics from week to week, I think some material needs to be trimmed. Also, the quiz questions were often on very specific details which I found to be a bit unnecessary at times.",
    "I only wish that we had more time to ask questions about the projects of our peers but that can always happen outside of class. Or you could make it a short assignment for everyone to email at least one person a week (or less) with a question they didn't get to ask in class. They could cc you to receive credit.",
    "I would add to the course's content the theme of tools and software available for water resources management, their advantages and challenges. We learned about AQUASTAT, but software such as AQUARIUS, eWater, etc. may also be important tools for WRM. Practice of these tools could be included in the lab sections. Also, it would optimum if it could be possible to include a field trip to the Ogallala Aquifer, Mississippi River's Basin or other water-stressed area during Spring break. Finally, it would be interesting to invite a speaker from California that could explain in greater depth the water rights system and its challenges specially during dry periods.",

Frankly I would have preferred to relay the cancelled discussion sections into the lab.",
    "Yes. I found the discussion prompts (pulled from peoples' reading responses) to be very helpful. I also wish we had a little more time for discussionsit seemed like we had less and less as the term went on.",
    "They were related, though some of the section assignments seemed elementary -- I remember one task was to read through a list of reports and determine the number of reports that took a certain stance vs another. That didn't help me internalize the concept as much as skim through. Those could be eliminated and replaced with something that demands more analytical thinking.",
    "The discussion section seemed unnecessary and poorly structured.",
    "the student presentations could be done in the sessions. some discussion, too, since there was never enough time for it",
    "I thought the discussion section was important and it allowed us to focus in on some other important concepts and clarify more historical perspective. However, I do think that it would've been helpful to have more discussions and examine more solutions-based approaches as part of the course. And discuss specific case studies, rather than making the discussions very broad associated with the entire topic or all of the readings assigned for that particular day.",
    "While I understand why at the beginning of the course we moved into the other room for discussion, it's a bit awkward to move for a brief amount of time since I think it disrupts the flow. I would encourage discussion time to be in the same place as lecture.",

I don't know that it really provided me with skills and tools, it provided the background understanding and expertise necessary to approach the subject matter in further study. And be able to assess data and research associated with this field with a critical eye. Which I think is the most valuable skill that I learned in the course.",

    "This is a really good survey course of water. However, in many ways it feels like a high caliber AP highschool class rather than a graduate school course (e.g. tons of homework of questionable utility and a focus on cramming the material and not on fostering sophisticated discussion). So as long as you're prepared for that--enjoy! You'll learn more about water than you ever thought there was to know.",

    "check the book first. if this is what you need to know, ok. otherwise do something more specific as it will stick with you.",
    "I guess my main advice would be that as long as you stay on top of the work every week and take time to review the material, you will be successful. I would also think more carefully about the paper assignment and what it will entail. This way you pick a topic that really fits into the structure that the instructor is looking for. Some topics while very applicable to this course, are tremendously difficult to write papers on. And you want to make sure that you have the most flexibility within your topic to really answer the questions that the instructor poses as part of the assignment.",

It touches on many different sectors of interest FES-ers are interested in and even though there were people focused on studying water in the class, there were still others who weren't who still seemed to get a lot of it. Shimi is one of the best teachers at FES and he will always address your questions and topics of interest, even if he is not the expert in the field. Many people in their future environmental careers will likely encounter some type of water-related issue and this course will definitely come in handy when trying to understand how water ties into the topic at hand.",
