    "This course is very fun and can be a great way to fulfill a language requirement at Yale. Even if not fulfilling a requirement, Czech offers a great way to explore Slavic culture with a TRUE expert. Dr. von Kunes is excellent.",
    "If your interested in czech language, go for it. it's a hard language though, so be prepared to work.",
    "Definitely take this class.",
    "Excellent class. New, fun, different. Tough to get an A but still worth the effort.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student but only if they are willing to learn Czech and put in the work. It is a difficult language but Prof. von Kunes teaches it well.",
    "A language class that is a lot of fun. The professor is great and will help you out a lot."
