   "comments": [
    "This was my favorite class this semester. The topics were both relevant and incredibly interesting. It is very discussion-based, which can be hard if you have a rather introverted class, but Prof Weir did an excellent job of keeping everyone engaged.",
    "In this course, we learned about various aspects of civil conflict including why conflicts occur, how people join conflicts and potential solutions to conflicts. We spoke with several interesting speakers who provided unique perspectives on various conflicts. We also learned a lot about the specific case of Northern Ireland due to Professor Weir's extensive research on the Troubles.",
    "Civil Conflict pushes students to study political violence from an empirical standpoint. Readings match discussions of insurgent groups and paramilitaries with extensive qualitative and quantitative data. Over time, you amass a considerable degree of knowledge pertaining to both the history and practical study of different types of war. Topics include: Consociational Theory, Ethnic Powersharing, The Arab Spring, Humanitarian Intervention, Radical Extremism, War Zone Reporting, etc. Theaters of Study: Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Iraq, Bosnia, Poland, Somalia, India, etc.",
    "Learned about civil conflict through a variety of case studies, theoretical models, and guest speakers.",
    "Knowledge: The conflict in N Ireland: causes, developments, major figures, major episodes, resolution, situation today Psychology of violence and warfare Determinants of violence Ethnic and sectarian warfare International factors and conflict Collective action problems Women and conflict Territorys effect on conflict and violence Policy solutions to post-conflict solutions Skills: Writing complex papers and arguments Making an empirically based argument Preparing questions for and engaging with speakers"

   "comments": [
    "Could be imporoved by having shorter student presentations. While some were very to the point and summarized the readings efficiently... I think some students did too much and ended up taking more than half the class to present on readings everyone else had done.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was the quality of the discussion. The students in the class were very engaged with the material and it made the course much more valuable.",
    "Professor Weir is a great teacher, but the course could have used more background on Northern Ireland and a couple weeks of introduction to the field before we dove into presentations. Also, different students received vastly different amounts of time to present their work, which made it difficult to curate a presentation. We also received no feedback throughout the entire course on written assignments.",
    "The guest speakers and (intense) class discussions are the best part of this course--you really can't get anything like this in many other classes at Yale. The expectations\/grading are a little unclear, and the presentation assignment ends up being very uneven (some students present for 10 minutes and some present for the entire seminar session).",
    "Instructor: Professor Weir is an absolute delight and a great seminar leader. She lets students steer most of the discussions but in the first half of the semester, she would often intervene and push discussions in certain directions. She makes sure that people actually understand he core arguments of the assigned readings and questions incorrect interpretations She takes a light-hearted and humorous approach to her dealings with students. You can be fairly casual with her and she will always welcome some self-deprecating\/ironic humor. The class vibe was quite welcoming because of this. She gets excited about your paper topics and ideas and is quite supportive about innovative and challenging research projects Course content (seminar): The discussions in seminar were often fascinating but chaotic. Since they were completely steered by students, there were too many questions and ideas to reconcile. Sometimes, a great discussion was derailed by fringe\/stray\/unrelated comments by one person. The professor should redirect discussions when this happens. The worst part was that our discussions would often have no starting points and we would start with general comments The speakers were a bit too many. After spring break, every class was dominated by the speaker. The seminar essentially became a lecture with students asking the speaker a series of disconnected questions and then listening to long answers. The questions became repetitive by the 6th speaker and we werent necessarily getting new perspectives. Often, the speaker would take all the time and we would discuss a single reading and so many people couldnt give full presentations as a result. I think it is smart to intersperse a few classes with lectures but for every class to have a speaker and for almost every speaker to be related to Northern Ireland was extremely boring At some point, this class could have been renamed The Conflict in Northern Ireland. I really appreciated that this was a conflict I had not studied before and learned a lot from the readings but we failed to discuss civil conflict and civil wars in the broad\/empirical\/comparative sense The presentations at the beginning of class were helpful and ensured everyone was on board with the content. However, by the end, everyone was just rushing through them because the speaker needed all the time Course content (readings): Some readings were excellent and I liked that we read 3-4 books over the semester. However, perhaps too many readings on N Ireland in some weeks even if N Ireland is Professor Weirs specialty, the class is called Civil Conflict Classesv2 was a bit disastrous. Some of the readings had not been uploaded and some weekly submission folders were missing too. Course assignments: The course was fairly low on workload, which was great. The presentations were a great discussion leading opportunity. The weekly responses and questions for the speakers felt quite pointless by the end. Except in Unheard Voices, our questions were never really directly used (we had to put down our laptops and couldnt access them anyway) and the responses felt like a regurgitation of a lecture\/series of chronological events with the speaker. The final paper was great it was a great idea to provide the 3 options, especially a pre-assigned topic",
    "This was by far my favorite class this semester. The required readings are inciteful and very pertinent to actual real world scenarios. Don't expect a lot of sophistry or mindless philosophical rhetoric. If you try to espouse ivory tower non-sense you will be humbled (------ this is awesome to watch). There were a lot of guest speakers.These guests represented multiple roles in civil conflict such as: civilians, government officials, paramilitary members, and academics. I cant express the overall quality of this class enough."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in violence or conflict! I thought the scope of the course would be much more specific than it ended up being, and most of the knowledge from the course can be applied to conflict in general. There are different focuses each week which allow you to delve in on topics that interest you. Also, in our class the discussion was excellent and it made coming to class a joy. Professor Weir is extremely knowledgeable on civil conflicts due to her research on the Troubles in Northern Ireland, which allowed for more in-depth understanding of the material and provided practical examples to many of the topics covered.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material and the readings are very interesting, as was the class discussion. Professor Weir brought in guest speakers throughout the year--some were better than others but all gave interesting perspectives on Northern Ireland, which is the conflict that the course mainly focuses on. The class is a little disorganized--a different student runs the discussion every week, which means sometimes we end up listening to a detailed regurgitation of the readings, and sometimes we don't get to discuss everything we were supposed to. Professor Weir usually lets the students talk about whatever they want to, which sometimes meant we got very off topic for long stretches of time. I would've liked if she had done more to direct the conversation and give it structure. You should also know that the grading is totally opaque--you will not get any of your assignments back nor know how much each is worth. Other than that, I really enjoyed the course and the material, and Professor Weir definitely brings a lot o passion and expertise to the subject.",
    "Civil Conflict was easily one of the best courses I've been lucky enough to take at Yale. Professor Weir is brilliant, incredibly charismatic, and she goes out of her way to show interest in the personal ambitions of her students. The course tackles difficult topics terrorism, genocide, etc and forces you to reckon with them on both a personal and analytical level. You'll be introduced to young men and women that have endured considerable trauma in their lifetimes, and you'll have to study quantitative and qualitative research that assesses mass violence in a way that might be unfamiliar. This is not a course for students who have difficulty discussing death and other human tragedies. Sexual assault, substance abuse, mental illness, and (of course) war are spread throughout the syllabus. However, any individual who is interested in global affairs and the \"darker\" facets of human history will thoroughly enjoy this course. Moreover, many of the topics and research models discussed will present new information to students. This is not a class you can glide through simply by reading The Economist. You'll be forced to study the consequences of humanitarian interventions, the subtle differences between terms like 'freedom fighter' and 'terrorist,' and the economic motivations for joining a paramilitary extremist group. I'd recommend this class to any of my friends.",
    "The readings, teaching, and guest speakers in this class are amazing and unparalleled. That said, the expectations are often unclear and no grades were returned.",
    "Yes! I loved this class. The discussions and readings are interesting. Professor Weir is wonderful, knowledgable, and approachable. I really looked forward to going to class.",
