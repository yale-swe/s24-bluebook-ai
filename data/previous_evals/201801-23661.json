   "comments": [
    "I think this class stretched my critical thinking muscles more than many, if any other, Yale classes I took before. At times the material was pretty dense, but Professor Bainbridge and my classmates were not afraid to dig into it and parse through it even if we didn't have all the tools yet. I learned to trust my instinct about what my opinions were\/how I perceived different works and ideas, but I also learned to always be open to changing that opinion in the face of critical discussion. I think I got a bit better at analytical\/academic paper writing, but I actually want to continue that more because now I know how much more I have to improve. I think I also learned how to discuss difficult topics like the intersection of race\/disability\/performance a lot more eloquently and with a deeper understanding. This class made me want to pursue American Studies to higher levels.",
    "The course was a serious crash course for me in some WGSS theory. I think in general I learned how to talk more intelligently about the topics we were discussing in class. At least in general."

   "comments": [
    "I think if we could have met every week instead of having to do make up classes on different days that would have been awesome, because I couldn't make those and the discussions seemed really important. As for strengths, I think the number one is Professor Bainbridge. She's so smart and on top of it but also runs a lighter class setting that's open to humor, but also focuses primarily on good, critical, intellectual discussion. She was always prompt with responses to any questions I had and I cherished the meeting we had at the end of the year and her advice which I will definitely take with me through the rest of my Yale\/academic career.",
    "The course was nice and small, which made for amazing discussion, but it also felt sort of rushed. The in-class projects seemed to have very little actually necessity except for the person presenting, which is fine. I always felt like they wasted time though and could have been more structured so that they fit with what Danielle wanted to discuss that day. I did like the discussion questions though, that part of the presentation was great. The history part and the rexplaining what we read that week part though sometimes seemed random and unguided. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't."

   "comments": [
    "Very few classes look into race, gender, disability, and performance in this way. Danielle was a great instructor, and I learned so much.",
    "Yes! I talked about this course the most with my friends and every time I mentioned a reading\/assignment that we had done, people would ask, \"What course is this? Is it offered next year?\" Needless to say, my friends had a lot of course envy and that's because the class was so good!",
    "I would recommend, but don't get too attached to the syllabus. Unless something changes in the class, we don't actually get to engage with a lot of the stuff on the syllabus, so if you're dead set on something or into something specific but not everything, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Also, this is one of those classes where if the people in it suck it's going to suck. So it's a toss up."
