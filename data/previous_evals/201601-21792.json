    "French history meets literature meets film study. It's an interesting hybrid of a class. The general approach was a cultural\/thematic one, with less emphasis on structural analysis of film and film narrative. Due to this historical emphasis, I think it's important that the time period interest you; the exploration of each individual \"text\" (film) is necessarily less rigorous than would be the case in a purely literary class.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I learned so much about French film and it was overall a very enjoyable course. The workload was not insignificant, however.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT! If you can make it to all of the movie screenings the class is incredibly enjoyable and the professors are fantastic.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is well taught, interesting, and overall an enjoyable experience (as long as they're fine with not going out on Wednesday nights!).",
    "I would definitely recommend taking the class for anyone who loves French. This class imporved my French and was really enjoyable!",
    "Take it. So great."
