   "comments": [
    "Take it. There's not a lot of work, but you still learn a lot. Also, all of the professors are wonderful, especially Shiri. You watch movies, Israeli TV shows, read children's books, etc..",
    "If you've taken L1 and L2 at Yale, you should definitely take L3. It expands a lot more on the grammar that we didn't learn in previous semesters, and you become significantly better at listening comprehension and communication in general. It does only meet two days a week, which is a departure from other L3 language courses; this means that there's a lot more work between each class, and that you have to put in some more time outside of class reviewing concepts so you don't forget them between classes. As a whole, the course is great, and a really worthwhile continuation of the Hebrew program.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, because you learn while having fun!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if Shiri is teaching it. Honestly just figure out what course Shiri is teaching and take that. In all seriousness though, this was a very fun course. Its not hard, but you do learn a good amount. The teaching is very good, although I think overall the Hebrew language department could learn a bit from the teaching style of the Chinese department. You have a fair amount of work each class but its fun and not hard to do--sort of a relaxing break from the other work you have to do.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You will see your language skills improve significantly and have a good time in the process.",
    "Take the class, it's chill and Shiri is super flexible, plus you learn a lot about Israeli culture in general, not just about the language.",
    "Harder than L1 and L2, but not because the workload is greater. It's actually less because L3 only meets twice a week (although it is more per class). The difficulty lies in the gap between students who placed directly into L3 (i.e. those who speak some Hebrew at home but don't know grammar or people who went to Jewish day school) and those who took L1 and L2 at Yale. The latter have to put inmuch more work and not be afraid to ask a lot of questions about vocabulary to keep up. The former probably found things a little slow. It wasn't perfect, but it was a fun class to be in and you get to know people really well from talking to them at Hebrew tables and studying. If you're deciding whether to take Hebrew at Yale at all, definitely consider it! It's one of the friendliest language departments (and one of the few with an L3 class that just meets twice a week, for whatever that's worth to you). Also, Shiri rocks. Take a class with Shiri, even one of her classes offered in English if this one scares you.",
    "Yes! Totally. My Hebrew got a lot better and I very rarely felt like the assignments we were given were pointless. The whole semester is basically spent on the future tense for the biggest verb category (binyan pa'al). A lot of emphasis is on increasing your comfort engaging with and in the language in general, and I thought it did a great job at that. And Shiri is phenomenal. Take it just to get to know Shiri if for no other reason. SHIRI IS THE BOMB."
