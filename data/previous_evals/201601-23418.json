    "This class is beautifully designed and very effective in achieving its learning objectives. There is a good assortment of topics and guest lectures and the assignments are really valuable and well thought out. However, I would advise taking it during the first year. It should be noted that there is significant overlap with occupational medicine; however, the material is taught much better in Dr. Leaderers class. I thoroughly enjoyed the exposure labs PM2.5, NO2, and noise and thought they were excellent learning experiences. I also enjoyed the critiques and thought they were effective learning tools. Overall, the class is great.",
    "I really like the structure of this course. In the first part, Dr. Leaderer introduced us the basic knowledge of exposure assessment, and in the second part, we involved a lot of real issues and had several guest speaker with us to discuss about real cases. I think it is very efficient way for us to practice what we have learned in the class.",
    "I loved this course and Dr. Leaderer is very knowledgeable. We did a lot of work on case studies and evaluation of papers which is very important. I thought the setup was great--learned basics for a few weeks, then reviewed practical cases with guest speakers each week. I wouldn't change the setup.",
    "Prof Leaderer brought other speakers to class. This is great to know different field work. The water pollution speaker is interesting.",
    "While I enjoyed most of the topics in this course, I did not like that over half of the classes were taught by guest lecturers. The assignments for this class were also not spaced out evenly throughout the semester. We had quite a few regular homework assignments due around the same time as our take-home midterm exam, which I felt wasn't fair."

    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer is obviously an expert in his field and has designed a very well-structured course on exposure assessment. His lectures are very clear and effective, and he has chosen a strong set of guest lecturers who are all experts in a variety of fields. He had two lecturers return for a second week to discuss and critique an article in their area of research. This really helped to improve continuity between lectures and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss the articles in class. The one thing about Dr. Leaderer is that he didnt have a great feel for the timing of assignments. We had a list of the assignments in the syllabus, but several had TBD due dates or got moved around a bit. As a result, we had a couple weeks when we had several assignments due for this class in addition to the weekly reading, when it couldve been spaced out more efficiently.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer is really a good instructor of this course. He is patient to our problems and is willing to have a talk with us. He talked about a lot of problems in our society about how to assess exposures and I really learned a lot.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer is awesome. He is engaging and it feels like he really considers his students' interests, abilities, and time.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Prof Leaderer is an excellent instructor and provided fundamental knowledge in exposure assessment."

    "Really great course on exposure assessment. There are a few labs where you get to experience monitoring yourself! Dr. Leaderer is great and I'd highly recommend this course!",
    "Yes, I would like to since I really like what we did during the class and after class. We did some monitor experiments by ourselves, so we got a chance to know the real environmental exposures around us.",
    "I would recommend it--it is a great introduction to critically evaluating papers and studies, the guests are interesting and some were very engaging and interactive, and readings were interesting.",
    "Recommended for student who need an overview different research direction."
