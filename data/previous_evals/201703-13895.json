Class revolves around discussions which keeps student's engaged Weaknesses= class focused more on discussion than improving student writing; could be improved by performing professor-led in class workshops on how to construct a good essay",
    "The course was very engaging and I often looked forward to class discussions. The readings were sometimes difficult to interpret but were often well explained in class by the professor. The professor made his class a welcoming environment and a class that we all seemed to enjoy.",
    "A very comprehensive and all-rounded development of ideas. However, readings can be abstract and lengthy in times.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I think a weakness was a lack of connection between the different works we read but they were all interesting so I didnt mind."
