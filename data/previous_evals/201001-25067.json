   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class with Professor Winkler. He is very engaging and presents the material in an interesting way.",
    "If you have an interest in philosophy, you must take this. There's a lot of material covered (Berkeley, Edwards, Emerson, Thoreau, James, Peirce, Rorty), and not all of it is too exciting all the time, but Professor Winkler is amazing. He's able to engage the whole class in discussion, and make everything enjoyable and interesting. Even if you've never taken philosophy (I hadn't) he makes it easy to understand almost everything. There's not too much work either, and the reading selections are usually good. If you have any interest in the subject, Professor Winkler will definitely make it worth your while.",
    "high rec.",
    "I would recommend any class taught by Ken Winkler. This class also happens to be cool because it's a subject that is very interesting, but that you don't cover in almost any other course. It's somewhat interdisciplinary in reading and subject-matter...but interesting to look at some of these people (like Martin Luther King) from a philosophical perspective. Others, like Jonathan Edwards, are more purely philosophical. It's also nice because it only really draws a group of students that are genuinely interested in the material.",
    "Take it without any doubt, whatsoever. Winkler is special. Not to be missed, if possible.",
    "American Philosophy is a great course; I would highly recommend it to anyone considering taking it. The readings are genuinely interesting, the amount of work is just right, and the nature of the assignments gives students a lot of discretion to write about what they personally find most interesting and ensures that students will take away something meaningful from the ideas they have to approach critically. And I would recommend anything taught by Ken Winkler.",
    "This is a great course if you're willing to do the reading. The reading can be dense (since it's philosophy), and the class periods are a little late in the day\/week, but overall, the lectures are very interesting and Prof. Winkler is extremely smart, engaging, and kind. Overall, I wished I'd worked a little harder in the course (since I would have gotten more out of it), but I'm still glad to have taken it.",
    "Take the class, period. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course, primarily because it is so well-taught.",
    "This was a great class. I had never taken philosophy before, but Prof. Winkler made it easy for me to understand the material and not feel intimidated by it. We read a lot of interesting texts and had great discussions. If you are interested in philosophy but haven't taken a course with Winkler, take this class. He is knowledgeable, passionate, friendly, etc etc. The guy is brilliant, and I'd recommend not missing the chance to study with him.",
    "I would recommend American Philosophy to another philosophy student, or a student with some background in philosophy who wants to explore this subject area. It is a very interesting class and the professor is great. There is a lot of reading to keep up with, but the writing assignments are somewhat fun, especially if you start early on them. The class goes through phases of different ideas, some of which are more interesting than others, but thewhole effect is a great survey of American Philosophical ideas.",
    "American Philosophy is an awesome tour through the ideas of some awesome authors who names rarely make an appearance on philosophy syllabi. The course begins with an in-depth look at the writings of Jonathan Edwards (no, he\u0092s not just a residential college), then passes through some authors usually covered in English classes (Emerson, Thoreau) before landing on the more-or-less modern period of \u0093academic\u0094 philosophy. The readings are numerous but mostly fascinating; Professor Winkler is always fascinating in lecture; and the workload is fairly small but meaningful. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in intellectual history and\/or the United States, and especially to philosophy majors who are in the mood for something a little different.",
    "Take it if you already like philosophy. I took it as an introduction to philosophy to see if the subject might interest me, and I was simply bored with all the material. The whole class for me was tedious focus on rather impractical or just uninteresting questions. Writing the papers was very difficult because of this. I don't mean to be a hater-- I'm sure if I had different eyes the whole class would have been wonderful. The professor is very knowledgeable and enjoyable to listen to. Just make sure you already like this sort of stuff.",
    "This is a great course, especially if you are interested in the material. The syllabus is good and not to heavy of a reading load, although it is easy to fall behind if you don't keep on top of it. Winkler is really good at explaining and is an entertaining man. He's a fair to harsh grader, which means you should expect B+\/A- grades on papers unless you do something really exceptional. The class sometimes got sidetracked by class comments, so maybe a smaller class size would make this a better class (so that we could have actual discussions).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in philosophy--even people who have never taken philosophy before. It canbe a lot of work, but the class is taught in a way that requires students to engage with the ideas (transcendentalism, pragmatism, etc.)in a way that is relevant to our own lives and histories, rather than memorizing the views of others. This is the challenge of the class, but also its greatest strength."
