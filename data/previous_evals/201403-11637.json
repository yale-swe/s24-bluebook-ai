    "Prof Jennings very genuine and knowledgable",
    "Absolutely terrible. A class with a wonderful subject--ethical issues in public health--fell well short of all but the worst expectations. This small class turned into a lecture every session that, more or less, felt stagnant and without clear progress from one class to the next. I found the professor less than engaging, and I was incredibly disappointed with the class.",
    "The readings can be quite long and didactic but I did enjoy them. I would have liked to see the concepts be linked to current events.",
    "There are a lot of great topics to cover and Bruce is an incredibly smart and well-articulated professor. However, I feel like we could have gotten to more case studies rather than focusing on theory so much.",
    "This course gives a good introduction to public health ethics. While we covered a lot of ground through readings and lecture, it might be nice to incorporate a more case-study based model for the lecture periods (maybe split lecture into half case-study and half lecture based on readings). This would promote interaction and direct application of public health ethical issues, as students would be able to discuss how they would handle the problems presented.",
    "The professor was very responsive to student feedback and discussion, and the readings were chosen well. The lectures were sometimes a bit repetitive, though. The though exercises\/practical examples were very interesting (e.g. the two pill problem), I would have liked to see more of them. The assignments are also helpful in applying and better understanding class material. It also would have been nice if the class slides were uploaded online, along with the readings.",
    "The course was very interesting, but its probably an acquired taste. I enjoyed the course, but I understand it may lack mass appeal. The best part of the course is that the content can be applied to a ton of disciplines, so although we focused on health, I appreciate the applicability of the lessons we learned to law, politics, everyday life, etc. . . I loved the incorporation of Dickens into the curriculum. Lectures could have been more lively, and I would have loved some different \"thought experiments\" or hypotheticals that would really allow us to apply some of the concepts we discussed. I believe a little more give and take could benefit the course vis-a-vis relatively uninterrupted lectures. That said, it was nice to feel as if the work done for the course was rewarded."

    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Prof Jennings very genuine and knowledgable",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0His writings and publications are much better than his teaching ability. It is my opinion he should stay in the think-tank arena, and out of pedagogy.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0The instruction was very good. The instructor clearly has a depth of knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0The instructor is knowledgeable, approachable, and very willing to help students. His teaching may be improved by laying out clearer guidelines for the papers in the class.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Bruce is very intelligent, and I can't imagine many people knowing ethics better than him. I believe there has to be a way to make the information more approachable and less esoteric, and I think Bruce did this is numerous ways. More of this would be welcomed and increase the popularity of the course. The course is ripe for facilitating heated discussions, but I thought Bruce did a nice job of mediating and answering questions or addressing concerns in an even-keeled manner. I think an increased essence of interaction would serve the course well."

    "Prof Jennings very genuine and knowledgable",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. STAY FAR, FAR AWAY.",
    "It is an in depth examination of the philosophies of public health but not necessarily their applications to current events.",
    "This is a course that delves into ethical theories applicable in public health practice. If the student is interested in ethical theory I would recommend the course; if they are more interested in the practical aspect\/case studies I would suggest they look elsewhere.",
    "The course is an acquired taste, but one definitely worth taking for those interested in ethical questions. Content is actually more versatile than many courses offered at YSPH, so the educational experience is very useful. Bruce is a very laid back professor. Interactions during lectures were prompted by students instead of the lecturer, but I attribute this to Bruce's mastery of the material and ability to speak at incredible lengths about its intricacies. I believe different types of assignments or class activities would energize the class and accomplish the same course learning objectives in a complementary way to lectures!"
