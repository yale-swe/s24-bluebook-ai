    "It's the Aeneid, and therefore, you do all the classic Aeneid stuff. You take the traditional quiz of memorizing, translating, and scanning the first eleven lines of book one. You read the entire book in translation and translate a portion yourself. Graded assignments outside of quizzes are limited.",
    "This is a brilliant course. You get to read a whole book of the Aeneid, and at the end, you get a feeling of utter fulfillment because you have DONE something significant!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it's the same type of work as the prose class, maybe a little more translating, but sometimes easier than Apuleius. Good introduction to the Aeneid.",
    "Take this course! It is such a pleasure to spend a semester reading the Aeneid with a small group of classmates, along with an instructor whose enthusiasm and breadth of knowledge will enrich your encounter with the poem."
