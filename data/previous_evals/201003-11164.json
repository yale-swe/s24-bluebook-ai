    "I would definitely recommend it. Medical anthropologists in training need exposure to the topics, methods, and debates, and public health students need to be challenged to think more ethnographically, and to create culturally relevant interventions.",
    "Yes - I feel like I learned a lot!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking for a guided exploration of med anthro and global health topics, and also to students in either the public health or anthropology fields looking to better understand how specialists in the 'other field' think and work -- and where potential for collaboration exists.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who was even slightly interested in medical anthropology, public health, or was thinking about using mixed methods in their work. It forces students to think hard about the subjectiveness of definitions of health and disease, the unforeseeable repercussions of global health initiatives, and the importance and challenges of employing mixed methods in research."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely feel more familiar with my field, and like I'm more able to speak about it with a level of familiarity and understanding that I didn't have before the course.",
    "This course helped me clarify my own specific interests in med anthro and global health, and provided a launching pad for my senior undergraduate thesis. Although my topic of research was not a theme that we covered during one of our weeks, a combination of individual meetings with Prof. Palmquist and various readings from the class syllabus provided me the foundation I needed to explore the med anthro and global health ramifications of my chosen topic."
