   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class if you want to work on your vocal or performing skills. If you have a fear of performing\/singing in front of people, or if you just want to improve those skills, this class is extremely helpful, as you sing and work on your music in front of the class almost every week. I've now taken it twice and feel that I've grown so much.",
    "A laid-back, low-stress environment where you can certainly grow as a musician. Taught by a wonderful professor. Definitely recommend.",
    "I took this class as an accompanist with no background in it, and learned so much about being a performer. The classes are more stress relievers than anything, but you must come prepared to sing\/play well when you're expected to.",
    "Take the class if singing is something you love",
    "Professor Lalli's class is amazing. The class consists of one two hour meeting per week in which you listen to great music similar to what you will soon perform, supplemented with weekly coaching sections with either Sarah (The pianist for the course and also a wonderful teacher), Lalli, or both. As the semester progresses, time spent in meetings shifts from listening to recordings to Lalli having small master classes with everyone on whichever piece they are currently working on. Meetings are relaxed, with Professor Lalli alternating between being hilariously eccentric and saying really profound things about music performed either in recordings or by members of the class. In short, for someone who can sing passably, not to be missed.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course if you are serious about singing. This class is demanding- you will memorize and perform at least 6 pieces in concerts throughout the semester- but it is also incredibly rewarding. It is a privilege to have a master class with Professor Lalli every week and free coaching sessions with Sara, the accompanist. This is certainly one of my favorite classes at Yale and I feel I got a lot out of this experience."
