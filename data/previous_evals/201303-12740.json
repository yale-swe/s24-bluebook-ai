    "This is the best class I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken at Yale. Whereas the traditional rational model of most econ classes idealizes markets as perfectly functioning, Prof. Barberis uses human behavior to predict the equilibria of financial markets. This \u00e2\u0080\u009cbehavioral\u00e2\u0080\u009d technique better describes the aggregate and cross sectional financial data than the antiquated rational paradigm, and is much more interesting because it involves interesting aspects of psychology.Behavioral Finance is a subject perfectly sized for a semester of study. What makes Prof. Barberis so strong is his planning of the course, and the constant reminder of how one irrationality fits into an ecosystem of a certain bias, and how that bias affects the market as a whole, and how that bias leads to different irrationalities. On the right side of the board is the course\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roadmap, which shows you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going and how the piece on the board fits into the puzzle of behavioral finance. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done the reading before hand you understand that Barberis is not only adding value by giving you new information, but by explaining it in a way that makes you realize \u00e2\u0080\u0098that is how my mind works too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d layering it in the correct order, and keeping new findings coming at a pace that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t breakneck, but just close enough to breakneck to make you feel in control, but stimulated.One thing that could be improved is the homeworks. I often felt the expectations were unclear, but maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an under-grad. A practice exam(one question better than none\u00e2\u0080\u00a6worse than two), and more electronically available resources would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also been good.",
    "Behavioral finance tries to explain financial phenomena using models that are psychologically more realistic than other financial models. The course presents puzzles in finance and how Behavioral finance offers theories to explain these puzzles.I would recommend the course to any student interested in finance and to any student in economics (even if not interested in finance) because the course presents concrete and important problem of the \"real world\" and it opens one's eyes on the fallacy of efficient market hypothesis and the rational maximizer nature of economicagents. It is very instructive and allows us to see that the models used in non behavioral economics forget too often to justify the extreme assumptions made. For a researcher, it is very important to know that other models, more realistic, exist.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in Finance (and Behavioral Finance).",
    "Yes to those interested in Behavioral Finance.",
    "I would like to recommend to other econ\/finance students because you can understand may models that are better than the traditional ones used in economics.",
    "I excellent, well taught class that introduces students to the field behavioral finance. The material is both engaging and fun. You can make this class as challenging as you want it to be. The papers assigned are some of the best papers in the field and you can spend a lot of time understanding the nuances of the arguments, subtlety in the interpretation of data, and the complexity (and simplicity) of models they present.I would highly recommend taking this course as early as you can. It is a goldmine for research topics and ideas.",
    "It is really good start to get acquainted with behavioral finance field; and the pace of the course is appropriate.",
    "I would strongly recommend it to anyone with a remote interest in finance.",
    "This is an absolutely essential course for every student that wants to conduct research in the area of behavioral finance."

   "comments": [
    "This course made me think much harder about getting a PHD.(I'm undergrad)",
    "The course helped me to realize how narrow most of the models we use in economics are. I do not have a research topic yet but I am interested in working in the area of behavioral economics and the course helped me to understand how to undertake this kind of research.",
    "A ton. I think even people not writing in finance would enjoy this course a lot, but in my case (as someone who plans to write in finance) it filled my head with tons of interesting ideas and a good overview of the situation \"out there,\" i.e. the present state of academic knowledge on the subject, and therefore a good roadmap for where to dive into research.",
    "This course helps students develop a solid background that helps them produce original research ideas."
