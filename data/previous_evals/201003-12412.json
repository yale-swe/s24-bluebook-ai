   "comments": [
    "If you ever thought black holes or extrasolar planets were cool, take this course. The math is very easy (elementary algebra) and the concepts are clearly defined in class. Instructor support is excellent, so it's very hard to have unanswered questions as long as you reach out to Prof. Geha or your TA.",
    "I would not recommend this class, because I did not feel intellectually engaged.",
    "It's ok I guess if you need a QR or science and have no other options.",
    "Let's be clear: this is not a gut, but it's not organic chemistry either. Although the lack of a textbook means that you'll be using Google and Wikipedia as resources fairly often, it also means less reading. Plus, the topics will make for awesome cocktail party conversation -- haven't you always wished that you could talk about black holes and dark matter intelligently? Well, now you can, and get that science credit done to boot. Prof Geha is great.",
    "Astro 160 is a really fun class! Professor Geha is a great lecturer and the problem sets are pretty quick and easy to get through.",
    "TAKE IT! GREAT CLASS! VERY CONCEPTUALLY HEAVY. STILL VERY ENTERTAINING! If you like astronomy, you'll love this. Professor was very nice and helpful and funny and entertaining, approachable. TAs were awesome. Overall VERY FUN class.",
    "Easy science credit and very interesting subject matter. Not too math intensive; all you need is to know algebra well.",
    "Astro 160 is a great opportunity to learn about the frontiers of astronomy, but don't pick it up if you're looking for an easy QR or Sc credit, as you will be disappointed.",
    "Covers stuff of \"science-fiction\" (planets around other stars, black holes, and dark matter) which is pretty cool. Great class for someone who needs a Sc\/QR because it's interesting without being overwhelming. Fair grading too.",
    "Astro 160 is a good way to get to know about the universe if you've wondered about what's out there.Sometimes I wondered how some of the material was ever going to be useful to me, but in the end, even if it isn't very useful, it's still really interesting.",
    "This is a great way to get a science or math credit in a really interesting way. Even when the material is technical, the subject matter is always amazing when you realize you're talking about black holes or dark matter. Professor Geha is a great lecturer: she knows her subject, explains well, and responds to questions. She does move pretty quickly. The TAs were very helpful (esp Joel Leja). You definitely have to go to lecture (otherwise you cannot learn the material), and you have to study, but it was a rewarding class.",
    "An interesting class that should be taken by anyone, just to understand the world in which we live!",
    "Astronomy 160 is a pretty easy QR\/SC class about intriguing topics that would make good cocktail party conversation.I found both the conceptual and quantitative side intellectually stimulating. My main issues were the lack of textbook and the fact that Astrophysics is often inherently unintuitive, so it's very difficult to tell whether you've gotten a problem right. Also, a lot of the science (particle physics) was so above our heads that they didn't even bother trying to explain it to us. I think there are better classes available if you are very interested in the hard science of astrophysics or in more conceptual aspects of cosmology, but if you want a taste of both this isn't a bad choice, especially if you need to fulfill QR or science requirements.",
    "very interesting class with reasonable workload. a good way to fulfill your science credit if you are fine with getting up early. class and section attendances are part of your grade. a piece of paper with anything on it is allowed for all midterms and exam, so there is not too much pressure.",
    "This is a pretty cool science credit. The material is very interesting and the professor\/grad students definitely make an effort to make things accessible\/fun, which is appreciated. At first the class kind of annoyed me - it's a little heavy-handed with lecture\/section attendance for credit, and the early material is a little boring. However, by the time you get to black holes, things get much more interesting, and you're glad that you're required to be there. I would take it for a science credit - it's fun, Prof. Geha definitely grows on you, and it's fascinating to have a grasp on the concepts behind current topics in astronomy without dealing with all the technical stuff.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Easy, very low workload, and so so interesting. Best combination of things you could ask for in a class. Only don't take if you are freaked out by space and how large and old the universe actually is.",
    "This is a great class to take if you don't have too much math or science background but are interested in cosmology.",
    "I think that it is a great course if you are attempting to attain the QR\/SC credit.",
    "I would recommend ASTR 160 because it is a good science credit with a very manageable workload.",
    "If you hate biology, chemistry, physics, and are really desperate that you will fail any science course you choose to take, this is the perfect course for you. While the problem sets might seem extremely difficult at times, the class flows so incredibly well that you will find yourself including astrophysical facts and figures within day-to-day chats with you friends by the time mid-terms arrive. I have acquired a reasonably amount of knowledge on the ongoing research on Black Holes, exoplanets exploration, and the search for dark matter. The no-textbook feature ofthe class, far from making it seem unstructured, makes it a great class for both mind and pocket.",
    "This is a frontiers class that explores 3 developing research areas: life on other planets, black holes, and dark matter. It is very interesting. You also learn a lot of physics (especially how gravity works) and some chemistry (atom particles), and the math is pretty simple. The 3 exams are fair although the curve can be steep.Yes, I would recommend the class to anyone who wants an introduction to astronomy and a fairly easy QR and Sc credit. Do the problem sets and come to lecture and the exams should be easy.",
    "It's a good course. It's interesting, not too hard, and well worth taking. The math should not be difficult for anyone, though there are those who would disagree with me on that.",
    "It's good, seriously easy, but interesting. Don't take it if you want to get deep with astronomy or if you get frustrated by wasting time, but if you're looking for a broad survey that moves slowly, exposes you to some cutting edge and interesting phenomena, and doesn't take a lot of work, take this class.",
    "It's a good class with interesting material, but there is no textbook, so take it if you are sure you will be able to make it to every lecture.",
    "take this class if you want a science credit that requires not a lot of science-y work and weirdly tough grading. will definitely need to invest more time and energy than expected.",
    "I would totally recommend it. Interesting and not too difficult.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in astronomy and astrophysics! It is a well taught and very manageable course. I felt like I learned a lot at the end of the semester, and it all seemed very easy if you followed lectures and did the problem sets.",
    "Take this course if you are curious about wild and fascinating phenomena about the universe. If younot big on numbers but find science cool, this course is great way to satisfy your QR-requirement.",
    "It's a pretty easy class. I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for an easy QR.",
    "This was an alright course - it was all a bit too theoretical\/unclear for my tastes, but Professor Geha is a straightforward lecturer who seemed to care a lot about her students.",
    "Its good, interesting for non-science\/math majors. As interesting as it can be. Worth taking if you need the CR -3 tests and weeks psets that aren't too hard.",
    "We looked at exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter. there was a midterm, optional paper, 9 psets, and a final. class is really fun to attend, and you learn things you sort of knew about or had preconceptions of, but in much greater detail. Geha is amazing. I would recommend it.",
    "Astro160 is a good course for non-science majors. If you take it with friends, it will be minimal work and there are some interesting topics treated. However, at the end you may feel that you didn't learn much of anything. All these fields are in flux, so there is a lot of missing information.",
    "I think this is a great course for anyone who's interested in astro but knows they aren't a science person. It's a good way to earn your QR. A lot of people told me coming into it that it was a total gut. I don't think it's a very difficult course but you do have to work and spend time on the problem sets if you want to do well, especially if you're not really comfortable with math or basic physics. Many of the people I talked to after the fact felt the same way. All in all though I'm happy I took and I would recommend it to someone who's thinking about science more casually at Yale.",
    "Very interesting and great science credit",
    "I would certainly recommend this course because it is an intriguing look into the cosmos and supplies a QR or a Science credit for non-science majors. I am a projected English major, but I have now developed a true interest for astrophysics and hopefully will continue with it. Who wouldn't want to learn about the fabric of spacetime and things we previously could only dream of?",
    "Astro 160 is a great option for non-science majors who are interested in taking a class that will require them to engage with the material without becoming an overbearing presence in their academic lives. The three units are all really interesting, and the class is structured so that weekly problem sets keep you on top of everything that you are learning without being unreasonably long or difficult. Professor Geha is an engaging lecturer, and does a great job of emphasizing the elements of the class that are particularly timely or controversial, which always makes things more interesting.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you have any remote interest in the topic. The material covered is very interesting, and surprisingly easy to understand. Not too much work and the tests are not too hard.",
    "This is a science class on current events in astronomy for non-science majors. Some of the problem sets take a really long time, others not at all. If you want to do well in this class you have to keep up with the material, as the final is comprehensive. Overall it's manageable, and probably one of the most interesting classes you'll take if you're a non-science major looking for a science credit.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT! The workload is next to nothing (one problem set per week, took about 1 - 1.5 hours to do, and no readings for class), the midterms and final were pretty easy, and the information you learn is SO INTERESTING! Prof. Geha is also a fun, engaging lecturer. If you don't think you're a science\/math person but need a science or QR, this is the class for you. SUCH A GREAT COURSE!",
    "I would recommend this as a fairly easy and interesting course for non-science and math majors. My year it was chock-full of former DSrs and I think that is rather fitting.",
    "This course was the perfect way to fulfill a science credit if you don't have too much of a background in science. I had some background in the material before taking it, and didn't find it challenging. Professor Geha is great, the material is engaging, and the Problem Sets are not particularly difficult. If you like space, go for it.",
    "You will like this course, but be prepared for a tight curve and a set of rule and regulations that make people go crazy. The content of the course is fascinating and something that everyone should know about. I took this course because I needed a QR and enjoyed it.",
    "I would say that Astro 160 is an in depth look at three current topics in astrophysics. It's especially good for people who have a limited background in astrophysics, math or science, as everything you need to knowfor the class is taught. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter. The entire semester is devoted to each of these three topics. Fascinating if you're interested in the material, plenty of chances for help. Though the problem sets were all fairly simple and straightforward.",
    "Very easy, psets were really annoying because they asked \"what do you think\" sort of questions that were easy to lost points on if you forgot one of the 18 parts, but overall a pretty interesting class.",
    "Great class for an easy science credit. Fun, interesting, well taught. No complaints whatsoever.",
    "If you're looking for a QR\/SC class that isn't too difficult, but isn't really a gut and has interesting subject matter then this is a class for you. How often can you say you study astrophysics? It's interesting stuff. Lectures are early (and you have to go because they take attendance by collecting questions at the end) but problem sets and tests aren't too tough.",
    "Astronomy 160 is an interesting class, and more importantly, can be understood by students without a background in astronomy or science. I would recommend this class.",
    "Interesting material, nice way to do your science credit BUT Proceed with caution!! Its by no means a cruise, everyone does so well so the curve is horrible.",
    "I was not expecting to enjoy this class but was very pleasantly surprised. The math is not difficult, and Professor Geha is really awesome. She was engaging and obviously deeply passionate about the subject. This is a solid science class that will rekindle a childlike fascination for exoplanets, black holes and dark matter. Definitely take it. You'll learn a lot, and it's a pleasurable way to satisfy a science or QR requirement.",
    "A good intro to astronomy. A fair science credit.",
    "I would recommend the course; it teaches you about some interesting concepts and a lot of information you wanted to know about.",
    "We learn about three major topics: exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter. After each section, we have a test which is very fair. The lectures consist of powerpoint lecturing, pictures, and a few inclass examples. We also go to the planetarium and the Black Hole Exhibit at the Peabody which were refreshing and useful tools.Take this class! It is wonderful!",
    "I could tell from the first class that this was going to be a fascinating subject. And it didn't disappoint. Learning about exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter provided a great introduction to current topics in astronomy--and great conversation topics for anyone. I mean, who isn't interested in this stuff? It's everywhere, from current events to sci-fi movies. I also really enjoyed how the class incorporated many different facets of Yale, something I value in my education: the Peabody Museum, theplanetarium, and even the Beinecke. Professor Geha made lecture great, even at its early start time, and Joel led a great section. Definitely recommend this class!",
    "This is a great introduction to current issues in astrophysics. You will learn a lot about some interesting things you have only heard mentioned before. And the professor is incredibly engaging.",
    "This is not the easiest QR or science out there--if that's what your looking for--but it's an interesting class and will reward anyone who actually wants to learn astrophysics. The workload is very manageable. The first test was pretty tough, but the others weren't bad. If you want to understand everything (and you want the points), plan on showing up to lecture.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Frontiers and Controversies as the most interesting \/ least busy-work-filled way to get a science or math credit or just as a very interesting course, especially for those with no prior scientific knowledge but an interest in how the universe works beyond our own planet. We covered three topics - exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter - all of which were extremely interesting, relevant, and related - we used the same basic concepts and equations for all three. Course progressed at a perfect pace - always manageable but never boring. Section was enjoyable and the tests were extremely doable - you get to make a sheet of notes on which you can fit everything you will need. I learned a lot (truly altered my conception of the universe) and never got overwhelmed by the science, math, or workload (there are problem sets, but they are pretty fun).",
    "Astro 160 is an interesting course that covers current topics in science without getting extremely technical. I would recommend this class to a student interested in theories and concepts and not so much in math.",
    "The best possible QR for non-majors - actually well-taught, interesting, challenging material. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Decent, and pretty unchallenging if you want to get a QR out and find black holes and such vaguely interesting. But Geha doesn't go into any depth on the topics, recognizing that it isn't for science majors; you never really get past the superficial into how things really work. Which was kind of frustrating at times if you're the kind of person who always aska \"...but why?\"",
    "This is a good QR class if you are looking for one that isn't too impossible. Note it is not the easiest one but it sure does beat other ones available.",
    "I would say this is a good course for more visually oriented people trying to fulfill their QR credit. It can be tough to find interesting QR classes for people not in a math major, but I thought this was great. I went into it with hardly any memory of my high school pre-calc classes, but while the homework could sometimes be challenging, I could handle it. The subject matter is also fantastic. Black holes, dark matter, and \"other earths\" are easy to get interested in, and it's taught in an engaging way that's easy to follow. I would say, however, that you should go to every class, because there is no textbook, and it's really tough to catch up on anything you miss.",
    "Yeah definitely. It wouldn't be anything an astrophysics major or even a math or physics major would want. But for anyone looking for a science or QR credit it is so perfect. The math is not too tough and the material is incredibly interesting. Take it for sure",
    "An excellent Sc\/Qr, it covers fascinating material that I've always wondered about but never could discern from wikipedia or other resources, like dark matter and black holes. Not much work at all (weekly p-set, 2 unit exams, final), and the subject matter is really clearly presented."
