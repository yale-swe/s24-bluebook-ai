    "If you are interested in contemporary analytic philosophy this course - and any other course with Prof. Szabo - is an essential course to take! The syllabus is challenging, but really well-structured, not a lot of readings but in-depth discussion.Prof. Szabo is a rock-star: really enthusiastic about the material, an extremely clear thinker who succeeds at explaining every problem in an easy to understand way. As Prof. Szabo is a rigorous grader and a professor who does not tolerate any bs-ing, this course will challenge you to think and write more clearly and become a better philosopher. Absolute must-take!",
    "It was OK, but make sure you're into the subject before taking it.",
    "This course was a challenging and rigorous introduction to the logic and metaphysics of modality. I recommend it to those who have taken and enjoyed mathematical logic, and are interested in the philosophical questions that formalizations pose. Professor Szabo is a fantastic instructor and the texts - Naming and Necessity, On the Plurality of Worlds, Sider's Logic for Philosophers - are texts that every serious student of metaphysics should read.",
    "Modality is, overall, a good course on an important area of contemporary analytic metaphysics. Don't take it unless that's something you're interested in. Szabo is a good professor; the handouts for the class are excellent.",
    "I would recommend it but only if you've done a fair amount of philosophy before, because it's not easy.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone interested in a good analytic philosophy course.",
    "Good overview of the theories of possible worlds. Definitely worth shopping, and if the subject is interesting, taking! Szabo always makes things interesting."
