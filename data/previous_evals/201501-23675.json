The professor was able to set up meetings with important and interesting people in the field, catering toward who we wanted to meet. Also, learning from the instructors experience was helpful. He cared deeply about our learning.",
    "The trips to the UN were the best part of this class! Very informative and the professor went out of his way to arrange special meetings for us.",
    "Field trips.",
    "I really enjoyed the field trips in this course. I thought that meeting individuals in the UN was very enlightening and I learned a lot about new subjects (such as BBNJ). Additionally, I really liked the class discussions in which students presented an issue.",
    "I really enjoyed the field trips. It was just great to meet and talk with people at the UN. I also appreciate Professor Lee's insights based on his experience working with the UN. I think the class really gave a great overview of how the UN works and allowed me to make some connections with people at the UN, advancing my career in the field.",
    "The interaction with a very knowledgeable professor, with other similarly interested fellow students and with experts at the UN whom I would never have had access to otherwise.",
    "Field Trips to UN & other missions",
    "The in class discussions were great with the students who actually participated. Roy Lee has a wealth of information and is excellent at analyzing situations and getting the students to see global and regional issues from different perspectives. The trips to the UN and missions were invaluable. This is truly one of the best classes offered at F&ES. I would love to see more classes like this Those who actively engaged in the class seemed to gain a lot from it. I was one of those.",

   "comments": [
    "I think the organization of the course could be better improved. The instructor told us what students had done in previous years, and it seemed a lot more substantial than what we did this year. They present to UN bodies or interned with them, created some sort of grey paper, etc. The instructor left things up to us, but I think we had the expectation that he was going to provide some guidance and structure. Toward the end of class he had students present on the information, and that was a great way to get involved. If we could have had a substantial deliverable to work on from the beginning of class, I think it would have been more beneficial to our learning.",
    "Structure of the course, sufficient work load, better discussion sections, more responsibility for the students, better organized field trips.",
    "I think there needs to be better coordination between the students and the UN office. Many students would sign up on these trips and not show up, which was very disappointing. I think there needs to be a system where deadlines are strict and clear. Additionally, there should be repercussions if students do not show up to the designated field trip (such as a deduction in grade). Trip dates should be made clear at the beginning of the semester so that students can plan accordingly.",
    "I think the Teaching Assistants could do more to make the classes more interactive. They could prepare presentations, or pull up readings on the projector while professor Lee is lecturing.",
    "The ahead planning of the field trips to better be able to coordinate with our schedules.",
    "None",
    "I would have liked the opportunity to work in one of the missions as part of the class. It should be mandatory for everyone to participate during the class. It was disappointing to hear people say they wanted more out of the class when these very people who would not participate during the class discussions about the readings and current UN affairs. It was made clear that participation was necessary. The TA for next class needs to be more organized about the tickets. There should be a consequence for someone who signs up to go to a mission but fails to show up. This consequence should be either not being able to attend any more or a reduction in their grade.",
    "- More in-class discussions would be very valuable. - An introductory class to understand the international governance of the environmental issues might be helpful.",
    "Coverage of the content in the classes",
    "The student presentations were often very basic and not well researched. It was clear that many the presenters did not put a lot of time into background research, and they often did not clarify what was fact and what was speculation or opinion on their part. For example, the geoengineering presentations sounded on the surface like the presenters were experts on this matter, but in fact many important facts were not given or presented in the wrong context. Also, the presentation on short lived climate forcers on the final day was a repetitive and poorly researched version of the presentation Julius gave some weeks earlier - it was clear that the presenter did not listen very closely to Julius' presentation and therefore was very repetitive. Some suggestions: clarify that when students do mini-presentations, they should be honest about not being experts and give an overview maybe with one case study they know in more detail. A more stringent feedback or fact checking on presenters might encourage students to do more rigorous background info gathering."

   "comments": [
    "The class should be focused on presentations every week by 3-5 students followed by a discussion. Or the class could be centered around a presentation at the end of the semester to the entire school. This presentation should involve role-playing on the interests of each country and involve students representing different country interests. This can culminate in a series of panels at the end of the semester on various issues. It would be great to have this next spring following the COP-21 negotiations.",

The instructor is very knowledgeable and cares about your learning, but is not great at creating a master plan (at least he wasn't this year). So see which meetings you want to go to, which topics interest you, and take the learning upon yourself with the guidance of the instructor.",
    "The trips are very valuable and you will make great UN contacts.",
    "During the shopping period I would really try to clarify with the professor what you're gonna do the semester and learn from the course. Make sure that the professor has a clear course outline and learning objectives. It should really be improved if you want to learn enough from it. Would try to make that clear as early on as possible and otherwise reconsider taking the course. Don't take it as an easy credit; then you're wasting your time and money at Yale.",
