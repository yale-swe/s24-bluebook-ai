   "comments": [
    "If you're planning to do research in any field, especially concerning human subjects and their stories, this is a necessary class.",
    "Definitely take this is you are an anthropology major! It's good to learn and practice the methods. The workload is not big for a writing credit.",
    "Take this as your Global Affairs research design credit!! You won't regret it.",
    "A must-take if you want to actually learn how to do qualitative research! Its one of those classes that actually gives you useful tools that you can use for the rest of your life. Overall a great course to take.",
    "A critical exploration of ethnographic field methods. The course will make you question and reflect on your own positionality as well as questions of representation. The syllabus is super creative. That being said, don't take this as your first anthro course. Much better to take as a junior preparing for thesis fieldwork as opposed to your first introduction to the discipline.",
    "I definitely recommend this course! Even if you're not a an anthro major, it's fascinating to learn about how ethnographic research is conducted, and working on the weekly assignments were really fun: everything from interviews to participant-observation. The workload isnt extremely heavy, but theres regular work due every week.",
    "You're probably taking this because you're an anthro major. It'll be low-key and a fun way to dip your toe into fieldwork, and probably will be helpful if you're trying to do research for your senior thesis -it'll give you a jumpstart on the planning process and getting a taste of what you might expect.",
    "I would recommend this course: nice intro to anthro class, learn a lot about ethnographic works.",
    "A series of weekly assignments with a different ethnographic tool, most of them centered around investigating the same theme. Assignments from theory and the intros of ethnographies.",
    "I wasn't doing any of the readings and I was getting almost full marks."
