   "comments": [
    "CENG 210 does not feel necessary and isn't the most well-taught. However, it does provide some important information that will hopefully be explained in other classes.",
    "CENG is general introduction to the field of chemical engineering, summarizing the types of mathematical and scientific tools and concepts that are fundamental to the field without stepping too deep into the very technical aspects of these same topics. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of what it is that chemical engineers do and\/or study.",
    "I would only take this class if you are required to for your major. Otherwise avoid it. From what I can tell, it does not do the subject justice--for all the interesting facets of chemical engineering, this class is boring and very poorly taught. Avoid taking it with Professor Pfefferle if possible. That said, if you have to take it, the class is not much work.",
    "Take this class if you have to. When Pfefferle taught this it was pretty easy, and I'm not sure how the class could've been made difficult. The material was just extremely basic",
    "CENG 210 is a good overview of the kind of work that chemical engineers do. It was barely any weekly homework and the 3 tests usually weren't impossible if you did the homework and paid attention in class.",
    "The material seems like it should be useful and not extremely difficult, but to be honest-- if Yale is going to have an intro Chemical Engineering course, they should at least have one that entices students interested in Chemical Engineering to study in the field further, not make a course that is automatically testing the will-power of students to continue on with the major. This class overall does not do the field justice and I fear works to scare potential ChemE students away.",
    "A pretty basic introduction to some fundamental chemical engineering principles and techniques. The workload for this class is very light although taking Pchem concurrently with this class definitely helps a lot when the lectures and textbook aren't as clear. Nonetheless, there aren't that many chemistry concepts to learn for this class and common sense\/logic can get you pretty far, so this is definitely not a class to be worried about. It's not a great class, but it is required for the major and I guess you walk away with some new knowledge. I would just make sure not to walk into this class sleep-deprived or find some strategy to keep yourself awake because it is not easy to hide in a small class."
