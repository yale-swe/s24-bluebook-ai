   "comments": [
    "The course was did not provide the level of detail or difficulty that I would expect at Yale. There were no graded HWs which, as any economics professor knows, eliminates any incentive to do work outside of class. The exams were too easy as well, again, not the level that I would expect. I understand that your want this to be accessible to most students but I think it's more important to challenge everyone in the class then be sensitive to those who may slightly lag behind.",
    "The class provides a useful tool for scientific desicion. The class contents were reasonably arranged.",
    "Great course!",
    "It's a very useful course. the teacher is really great.the time of lectures is too late, overlap with the dinner time.",
    "strength: understand the concept of cost-effectiveness and how it can be used in practical problems.interesting instructor and topic.make yourself feel becoming more clever.it will be great if the ppt can be provided before class.",
    "Very useful and provide an important tool in accessing policies and projects. Connected theory with practical work and projects.",
    "Excellent courseOne of best taken this fall...Great professor",
    "The time of the class is tough. I think more of the class content would be retained by students if it met more than once a week, perhaps with the TA. I realize that others may disagree with this format, but I would suggest an early morning, 40 minute, word-problem class (daily or weekly\/sections) in order to drill this stuff into our minds and ensure that students would leave knowing how to perform CEA not just know the aspects of CEA.",
    "Great course. I think it was run fine. I think the lectures were, by and large, educational and informative as well as fun and interesting and the concepts I learned in this course are ones I can actually see myself applying outside of this course.",
    "I think there should be at least a few (maybe just the important) assignments during the year that are mandatory and graded. For me, I would have gotten more out of the lecture and been more prepared for the midterm and final.",
    "Self taught course, don't expect to take much away from lecture",
    "Could be improved by more challenging assignments and a faster pace. The course's greatest strength is the professor.",
    "This was a good course, but I wish it had spent more time developing more advanced cost-effectiveness methods. It also would have been cool to apply the methods to specific research questions so that we could learn to conduct research in this area.",
    "Strengths: compared to other YSPH classes, this definitely offers a new skill set that is valuable for any career in the health care field. I thought the mid-term and final were very fair. I thought Lisa Suter was a great guest speaker.Weaknesses: throughout the semester, I felt like there were ups and downs in regard to the pace of the course. Due to the wide variety of backgrounds, I understand that we had to go a little slower than I personally would have preferred but the pace didn't seem consistent. Although I supported the practice cases not being graded homework, I think more emphasis on their solutions and\/or a few more cases would have helped keep up the pace and focus the course a bit more on some examples.",
    "Very self-taught, the lectures do not do a good job at introducing information\/methods.",
    "The course introduces powerful tools and concepts. One feels that the course execution limits itself too much to more basic problems. Put differently, one could get even more out of the course if the overall level would be increased.One opportunity might also be to adapt the exam structure. With Mid Term and Final both at 50%, requiring, a day of work mostly on the more basic concepts does not lend itself to pushing students to give their best. Perhaps one or two smaller group projects with a more complicated set up might be a great addition to the syllabus.",
    "Challenging but very interesting. Totally different way to look at things.",
    "The first half of the course is excellent because there is more practice with problem sets. During the second half the course, I would have preferred more practice with resource allocation and Markov Modeling. Please turn the lights up! People get very sleepy around dinner time.",
    "I thought the course was excellent!",
    "This is quite a narrow course but nevertheless has wide implications and application. It's a bit of a wake-up call for people whose Excel skills are not all they might be, but the topics are well organized through the semester. The pace of lectures seemed sometimes to be too fast and sometimes too slow, but mostly was about right. I really enjoyed the guest lecturer session.I would have appreciated the lecture slides being available the morning of the class - I find it useful to jot notes onto printed handouts, and would have got lost less often if I had the previous slide to refer to (yes, I know I should have raised this in the mid-term feedback). I know there is a risk of people not coming to the lectures, but frankly why worry about those kind of people? The available-before method has worked fine in other classes, and it should work for this one.The lack of a good textbook is a problem - different course readings used different mathematical terminology. But at least we didn't have to shell out money on a bad text!",
    "The strengths would be that it is something new and it is a course that provides students with a real skill when they complete it. The amount of work is dependent on the student, so there is a lot of flexibility in the course work.Weaknesses would be that it is a course that is challenging for some, and easy for others who are strong in econ. Might be better if this course is labeled intro and a more advanced course is offered for those with no experience in cost-eff.",
    "I found the course very interesting. I am not sure what I will use it for, but really glad I took the course.",
    "excellent instructor -- I really like his teaching stylegood readings -- interesting and clearI liked the periodic class surveysI liked not collecting homeworkthe final was very fun to doOverall I enjoyed the course and learned a lot.",
    "The strength is the instructor, who is very humurous and made the class very interesting. The weakness is there is no homework assignments throughout the semester so we do not know how we perform until the final exams.",
    "Overall, the course is very interesting and helpful for students who needs an introduction to cost effective analysis. The problem sets were very helpful, and the lectures were interactive and thorough.",
    "too loose",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale. The tool and methods learnt are extremely useful and interesting. The professor uses real life examples to illustrate concepts. Phenomenal class."

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very goodwittysmart one linersthe same concept is explained in different formats, so that at the end of it everyone in winslow has GOT IT...",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Professor Paltiel does an incredible job at making an otherwise dry topic, entertaining. His love for the work and curiosity for new ways of doing things engages all of us. However, he moves too quickly through slides he has reviewed over 10 times. If this class is based on excel or diagram drawing, then he needs to slow down his speech and allow others to either draw or build the excel tables individually (not just watch him dance through it, and try to cut\/paste\/input into his formulas later). Other than that, the amount of information covered in each class was entirely doable.The pace of the curriculum wasn't too fast, just his speech in class.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Great. Very fun. Keeps people involved in lecture and more than willing to put in extra work to make sure people understand the material. Couldn't ask for much more than that. Provides opportunities to delve deeper into subject matter as people see fit and lots of resources. Really enjoyed the excel tips and tricks that were sprinkled into the course material as well.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Fun, but sometimes glosses over important points and gets too caught up in the Excel, which prevents us from really understanding the intuitions behind some of what he does.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is a very enthusiastic professor and a great instructor for this course. He is very concerned about everyone understanding the different topics and constantly asks for feedback (about certain topics covered and after the mid-term is handed in). He also makes himself available outside of class and via email if extra help is needed.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0A very good instructor! Knowledgeable, prepared to engage with students in class, good linkage to real world problems.The decision to not assign a course text is also a very good one, and it is appreciated that providing selective reading actually means more work for the instructor.One suggestion is to really step up the level a bit or find a way to also cater to students who might be interested in more advanced applicationsof the material.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Absolutely great! Makes very dry subject fascinating. Very engaging, makes you think.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is very energetic, engaging, and patient when it comes to explaining the concepts and doing the problems. He does a very good job with his excel files examples. I wish that there was a summary of each class in the notes section instead of student notes.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0David is enormously enthusiastic, very approachable, and great fun. What more could you ask for in an instructor. He could be a bit figures-oriented at times, but everybody should be allowed to get excited about something, and he really knows his stuff.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Prof Paltiel was amazing - he had an ability to take a subject matter that can be very challenging and dry, and made it easily understood and engaging. He had a great demeanor and was able to engage students during each course. He has great energy!",

Also, the weekly work load is on the lighter side.",
