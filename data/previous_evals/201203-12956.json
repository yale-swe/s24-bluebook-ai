    "Whether you're Latino, from NYC, or neither, you're going to really enjoy this class. All the material is interesting, including fun videos we watched in\/out of class, and it made for great discussions. Great professor too.",
    "Take it!!! Laguna is very engaging and the material is interesting. Hopefully you'll be able to take trips down to NYC with the class next year.",
    "Good course! Laguna is really awesome and I would definitely check out anything that he is teaching in the future. The assignments have a lot of creativity for anything that you are interested in. I would say that the class (as with all seminars) is pretty dependent on who is in it, so be aware of that if you shop it.",
    "I would totally recommend this class. You don't have to be Latino or have studied anything Latino before to really get into it and learn a lot about the issues of race throughout the US, not just NY.",
    "Prof. Laguna is awesome. If you're looking for a funny teacher who knows his stuff and is totally open to any medium of teaching, take this class. Although it's on Latinos in NY it also gives pretty brief survey of Latinos coming to the nation in general. We touched on graffiti, TV shows, spoken word, west side story, census info, etc. There is a massive range of material that keeps the class super interesting.",
    "Yes, the class is important to take and Laguna stimulates interesting intellectual discussions.",
    "Very good class. Section discussions and readings were interesting.",
    "This is a GREAT seminar. A lot of cool readings and great discussion. Professor Laguna is great. You will learn a lot in this class, definitely take it.",
    "This class will teach you the history of the relationship between the histories of Latinidad and New York. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in better understanding the different cultures of various Latin American& Caribbean countries, and how the formation of these cultures was affected by New York."
