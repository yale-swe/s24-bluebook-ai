    "This course was extremely enlightening in exposing me towards the behavioural considerations from liquidity, credit, savings constraints etc. which govern the demand and supply of goods and services in developing countries and communities.",
    "I learned to more critically analyse and think about various types of evidence. I also learned to think more about the why individuals the make purchasing choices they do.",

    "The strengths of the course was Prof Mobarak's expertise in this field. His immense research background was an asset in helping us engage with issues that surround the uptake of products in these countries.",
    "The course was great, I think it could have benefitted from being longer, it felt more like summary at points.",
    "Strength: The messages by the professor that we should focus on demands of local people rather than supplies of items and that we need to make aid policies based on clear evidence were inspiring. Weakness: The professor put too much priority on class discussion. Due to long discussion which prevented smooth progress of the course, the speed of the last twenty minutes of the classes was too fast to follow. It seemed a few students asked irrelevant questions (to get high grades?)."

    "Absolutely! For an extremely rigorous course rooted in economics principles.",

    "Yes I would. The professor showed us a wide variety of perspectives on the people's demand, which is applicable to policymaking in developed countries as well as emerging markets."
