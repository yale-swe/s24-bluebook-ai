   "comments": [
    "Really interesting seminar on a cool topic. I took it as someone interested in law and the penal system, and it definitely delivered from that standpoint. Fair workload as well, only paragraph-length reading responses each week and two papers. Despite its cross-listings, though, the seminar is heavy on philosophical inquiry.",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar. I loved the class, the material is interesting (and at times polemical). Professor Goldman is the BOMB. He's a super organized professor, always coming in prepared with printed out notes of the previous seminar (so that during class you can just focus on discussion). Also he did a great job of guiding the discussion with his own input, without dominating the conversation. Super interesting class, take it.",
    "Theories of Punishment offers some really cool insights into justifications for and applications of punishment over the past few centuries. Some of the material is a little dry, but pretty much all of the modern philosophy (20th century) was both accessible and fun to play with from a philosophical standpoint. The papers weren't too bad lengthwise, and Professor Goldman was great to work with. If interested in philosophies of punishment, definitely worth taking.",
    "It was a good course, but not quite what I was hoping for. There was a lot of focus on trying to guess what authors meant and the discussions of the actual normative issues just didn't seem that substantive to me.",
    "I thought it was a great class, and a good way to practice some applied ethics and political theory on one, focused issue. More philosophical than anything, really - you won't discuss policy or anything like that, mostly moral and rational justifications of punishment. You read Foucault, Nietzsche, Bentham, Hobbes, and a lot of modern American philosophers - very diverse reading list. Would highly recommend.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the topic and enjoy philosophy. Professor Goldman is great, and I always felt like I came out of our discussions with a better understanding of the book (and more to think about) than I'd started with. The reading load is pretty light for this class, and none of it overly difficult, and the papers are reasonable (though get started on the final paper early!)"
