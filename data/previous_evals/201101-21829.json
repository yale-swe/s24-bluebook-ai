    "This is a class about the most important themes of urban history, ranging from the history of disease and disease consciousness to the role of the federal government in white flight. It's a difficult class but once you come out of it you are actually more aware about the world and about history.",
    "YES. A dynamic and in-depth look at issues of urban development, city politics, race and gender issues, labor. Essential for understanding contemporary U.S. politics. Prof. Klein is intense and demanding in the best way possible--she is supportive, readily available, and clearly cares about the learning of students. The result is much learning and lively discussion. The exciting seminar atmosphere is also reflective of a rich syllabus. The course will undoubtedly move you, and you will likely find yourself coming back to these thoughts while strolling New Haven or another city."
