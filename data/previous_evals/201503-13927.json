    "I would recommend ENAS 752 to other material science related graduate student. The class cover fundamental understanding on crystallization and growth process. The course encourage discussions among professor and student which I think is a very beneficial for graduate level doing researches.",
    "Obviously you should be interested in the topic to be useful for you, but if its the case then is a very good class to take.",
    "Would highly recommend to anyone interested in thermodynamics\/kinetics of materials processes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend ENAS 752 to any student who wants to know the science behind phase transformations. The course started from basics of thermodynamics and covered most of the details of phase diagrams and solidification. Also the work load is light and the way of teaching is such you won't require any test to remember things taught in class. It is a very good course."

   "comments": [
    "The class benefit my research a lot. Reviewing basic thermodynamics was very useful and the nucleation and growth, and glass formation process is directly related to my research.",
    "The course material heavily overlapped with my Special Investigation, so the course was tremendously helpful for me personally. It is also a good review of basic thermodynamics and materials science concepts, in addition to giving a very useful high level view of the behavior of the most commonly encountered engineering materials classes."
