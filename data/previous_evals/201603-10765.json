    "Without requiring a background in history of art, the course helped me develop a taste for art, and words and form with which I could use to defend my opinions of a work. I believe my writing improved substantially with the help of Professor Spillane. Beyond that, the class also exposed me to figurative painters I had never heard of, which struck an art historical curiosity in me.",
    "This course is a good introduction to writing about art, as the title sayssomething between journalism and a review, with a lot of visual detail.",
    "I learned a lot about how art critics write, specific contemporary artists, and conveying an opinion through my writing.",
    "A working and ever growing vocabulary through which to deeper engage with the material",
    "Writing about art in an engaging and inventive manner, reading reviews for craft.",
    "I feel like this class improved my writing in leaps and bounds. It also was like a crash course in how to visit an art museum and not feel like you're just pretending to be cultured. It restored my confidence in my own opinions and inspired me to love art--especially contemporary art--with a new critical intensity."

   "comments": [
    "The class was so well paced, and the amount of writing we were producing was so appropriate that I always felt as though we were covering styles and techniques with reasonable investment. Students' work was workshopped with so much enthusiasm, and so thoroughly, always. The writers we read in class, as well as the artists we looked as, were all so carefully selected, and the entire syllabus flowed flawlessly.",
    "I think this course has a lot of potential, but seemed to fall flat to some extent. I loved a lot of the readings we did but often felt like discussions we had about them did not go anywhere. I think the workshop format was very helpful,but I also feel for each piece we wrote it was never entirely clear what the style should be, who our audience was, etc.",
    "I think one of the weaknesses of the course was that it was much easier for the artists to take part in the discussions. However, I enjoyed that the class was welcoming to students who were not artists and thought that the discussions we had were really interesting for the most part.",
    "very inclusive even if not \"art\" person. different writing and class style which was great. flexible.",
    "Excellent teaching, but discussions were somewhat lackluster. This was perhaps a reflection of the students in the class, though. I thought the readings could have been more inspiring, too -- and discussions of said readings could have focused more explicitly on the tools and techniques that their writers employed (and less on the art).",
    "The workshopping is the best part of this class, and some of the readings are interesting. But at the end of the day, very little of the reading is necessary and so very little usually gets done. Often times the class suffered from a lack of direction or leadership. We spent a great deal of time discussing articles that other students brought in that were not hugely fruitful. I would've loved more time examining reviews and how they work in detail. Considering it's a writing class, more emphasis could be on that. We praised a lot of pretty bad writing in workshop.",
    "As far as content goes, the title is everything. Students write about contemporary figurative art. This was not a rigorous course; much more of an ENGL 114 type of teaching, editing and conversation. Assignments were scattered, almost no one even glanced at the reading, and the writing felt much more like busy work than joyous learning.I would not recommend this course."

    "This is perhaps one of the best courses I've taken with one of the best professors I've ever had. Professor Spillane is the most invested professor I know. She is there to teach and ensure her students come out of her class proud of what they've accomplished.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that is interested in another side of art history and museums.",
    "Fun class about something worth knowing.",
    "Yes a hundred times yes! One of the best I've ever taken.",
    "Professor Spillane is an excellent resource as an instructor, but this class fell short of my expectations. Very writing heavy, but the assignments and readings are underwhelming. I know some other students loved the class, though, so I'd say it was a mixed bag.",
    "Take this to learn some stuff about art, and look at interesting contemporary artists.",
    "If you want to get better at writing--if you could spend hours perfectly happy in a museum--if you have even a passing interest in figuring out what defines beauty, power, and inspiration--then take this class. I don't know what else to say, man. Take it.",
