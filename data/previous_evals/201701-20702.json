    "Analytical writing and source analysis. Tough class, grading was harsh.",
    "I developed my ability to make and analyze historical arguments. I gained a much better understanding of historiography and of primary source analysis, and learned to think more like a historian. I also learned a much broader sense of the history of Germany.",
    "Learned to critically read historic texts",
    "Learned the basics of German history. Loved the course.",
    "In this class I learned how to think about history like a historian and consider the arguments of historical time periods. I also received significant help with my writing and reading skills. I learned about Germany's complicated history, but also how to think about this and the long term impacts major events had on citizens and the world.",
    "This course focused on a very precise academic writing skill-learning, which was acquired through most of the exercises.",
    "I learned an enormous amount from this course. I was already familiar with modern German history from some other classes (such as John Merriman's European Civilization and John Gaddis' The Cold War), but I still learned an enormous amount from this class. The periods I learned the most were probably the domestic politics of the Bismarck era (the Kulturkampf and anti-Socialist laws), the Weimar Republic, the Cold War, and post-Cold War Germany. My writing skills also definitely improved significantly thanks to the course. While the grading was sometimes somewhat demanding, which frustrated me at first, because it was so demanding I improved much more than I would have otherwise, which I really appreciate.",

   "comments": [
    "This course does an absolutely great job as a history lecture. It's objectively the best history lecture that I've taken at Yale. Professor Allen meticulously plans every lecture, and the outside readings do a great job of focusing on certain themes and contributing to a productive discussion section. My only real complaint with this course is the ID quizzes. I think it's a bit ridiculous to have us memorize 70 keywords for a quiz worth 3% of our grade. Most final exams I've taken have had fewer key words. I think the lectures shouldn't have 12 key words. It's just a ridiculous amount, and really disheartening when studying for the quiz. Focusing instead on the 5-6 most important key words would really improve the one complaint I had with this course.",
    "I have already studied the Holocaust (~extensively~), as a preface to this critique. That said, we spent way too much time on its aftermath and memory. After we left the postwar period of the lectures, we still continued to examine the Holocaust every week. While that's an important event, the ~fixation~ on the Holocaust impeded learning about the period of Germany we were supposed to be studying (like 1970s, 1980s Germany, for example). This probably has to do with the fact that Professor Allen likes to focus on historical memory so it's not a ~big deal~ but I just wish we had a more holistic view of German history. I really enjoyed how many assignments there were; it kept me on my toes. Also, grading was HARSH but I loved how much I improved as a writer!",
    "I appreciated the harsh grading. It was refreshing.",
    "Amazing, amazing, amazing lectures. Very heavy workload I wish there were less work so that more people would take it.",
    "The writing assignments were fairly intense, and it felt like this course could almost be turned into a WR course. My writing definitely improved as a result of the feedback given. However, assignments could be given back a bit more promptly.",
    "The lectures could have a little more broad themes and big ideas.",
    "Strengths: well-organized lectures, engaging sections, stimulating readings, fair essays Weaknesses: ID quizzes are worth so little as part of larger grade yet require so much studying to do well on them",
    "Loved it",
    "Lectures were incredible and dense and very easy to follow and be engaged with. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "This course provides a detailed and fascinating overview of German history. That said, the grading and lack of TF engagement made the course incredibly challenging and frustrating, despite my efforts to succeed.",
    "The assignments were very stressful because of the inflexibility of the professor and TA. I think emphasizing deadlines is great, but it often made me afraid to reach out for help when I needed it.",
    "Professor Allen is a very engaging professor, who packs a lot of political, economic, cultural, and social history into the course. I came away with a much better understanding of contemporary Germany, as well as themes throughout its history (i.e. experiences with democracy as asked on the final exam). The primary and secondary source readings were great selections, and I loved all of the artwork and music that Professor Allen shared during every class. I thought the grading of essays should have been more clearly stated. While individual feedback on papers was plentiful, it still felt subjective at times when compared to the guidelines given ahead of time. Additionally, I did not think the two page essay was the best assignment, as it is very difficult to articulate and support any strong historical argument in a two-page paper. I also think it would have been better to keep the ID terms up longer than the few minutes before class started. I had another class right before this one, and oftentimes I would miss the terms even though I was still on time to class. Lastly, essays were often not graded in a prompt manner. As an example, I received my graded abstract with feedback only a few days before my last paper was due, which would have left me very little time to make significant changes to it had the abstract feedback suggested them.",
    "This course has many strengths and really no weaknesses. Its biggest strength is probably its content, German history from 1871 to the present. The amount of reading, a very healthy amount, is also a very big strength of the course, especially considering the exorbitant amounts of reading assigned in many history classes these days. The specific readings that were assigned were also a strength of the course: a mixture of primary and secondary sources. At the beginning of the course I was rather disgruntled because of the primary-source heavy reading regimen, feeling that we didn't have enough secondary sources readings that grounded us in the historical background of the primary sources we were reading. But I think that over the course of the semester I came to realize the merits of the reading regimen that Professor Allen prescribed. Having more secondary source readings would have greatly increased the amount of reading assigned, which would have hurt one of the biggest strengths of the course, its reasonable work load. In addition, I found that, especially in the second half of the semester, Professor Allen's were strong enough to provide us with the historical fact that secondary sources would have provided. Speaking of Professor Allen, her incredible knowledge was definitely a strength of the course, as was my TA, Heather Horn. The course's final strength was its assignment regimen: a map quiz, three short quizzes, three essays, and a final exam. Similar to the demanding grading and the reading regimen, this was something that at first frustrated me about the course but ended up being one of the things that I actually really appreciated about the course. First of all, it was nice having four quizzes that were concerned with raw facts when so many history courses these days de-emphasize facts in favor of themes. Second, having so many assignments made it so that I had to keep up on my reading. As such, I kept up with the reading in Germany from Unification to Refugee Crisis while I fell behind in all my other classes over the course of the semester. Third, having so many grades made it so that one could not do as well as one wanted to on and assignment or two and still do well overall in the class - it was less pressure than having fewer assignments where one had to hit it out of the park in practically all of them in order to do well in the overall class. Fourth, having so many writing assignments better enabled me, like the tough grading, to improve my writing over the course of the semester.",
    "The lectures were very interesting, and I didn't mind how many assignments there were. However, sometimes I felt like the class was graded harshly just so that students continue to work hard, instead of actually grading based on quality of papers. It felt like we were expected to write essays at a professional level, instead of at a collegiate level. I wish the grading weren't as unnecessarily harsh. I would have gotten the same out of the class, but without the added stress and frustrations.",
    "This course is garbage. I would not take it again because the objective of the course is to make you fail rather than thrive. Weaknesses (& some strengths): Instructor: o Professor Allen is a nice person at heart but she has an out to get you philosophy in the sense that she doesnt want you to do well. She is constantly threatening to reduce your grade (anyone who submits the essay at 4 35 instead of 4 30 will get a C instead of an A!!\") and wants to make the class more challenging for the sake of it being more challenging. o Moreover, in the first essay she orchestrated a string of bad grades for the entire class just to force everyone to go to a writing tutor and the TF and rewrite their essays. She then shared with us some model A-grade essays and most of us agreed that they were pretty poorly written and were no better than many of the essays we had written. When professors try to lie and dupe students into working harder, the pedagogy is just questionable. o Professor Allen treated us like we didnt actually know anything. Some of us were juniors and seniors who had aced classes much more advanced than this lecture but she assumed everyone was a sophomore\/freshman and wanted to punish\/teach everyone as if they had never written a history essay before or looked at a primary source before o Professor Allen can be quite vain about her own teaching methods and philosophy and is quite closed to feedback, criticism, suggestions or counter-points of any kind, which is sad for a history professor. For example, for the entire semester, Professor Allen and the TFs she trained believed there was ONE singular, correct way to write essays and nothing else. My essays werent poorly written (in fact, the writing tutor was quite happy with the essay) but were said to not conform to the way Professor Allen prefers writing Certainly, some writing is better than other writing but in history, there cannot be one correct way. Assignments: o This was another sad part. The first essay with a 2-page limit required analysis of an entire novel and its effect on inter-war Germany. Professor Allen called it challenging because it was short. We called it imprudent. The main feedback everyone got was not enough detail or analysis or lack of clarity in argument. But the assignment was foolishly ambitious and a disrespect to a nuanced and complex issue that books have been written about. The grades for this assignment were orchestrated and everyone was handed Cs and Bs so they would rewrite even though I had no doubts (and the writing tutor agreed) that it was an A-grade paper. o The final exam was garbage. She literally assigned us questions that she had assigned for full-fledged essays early on in the semester (for which we had 2-3 weeks). The prompts were half-a page of Word document long and it took me 5 minutes to understand what she was asking. Then we had 55 minutes to write the essay One of the prompts asked us to use two dates and describe what stories they told about all of German history And then, we were expected to CITE sources during an actual timed exam. Ridiculous. We were not given a practice exam\/question\/any guidance and Professor Allen suggested that students who hadnt kept up with material over the semester would surely fail! Once again, the professor wanted you to not do well in this class. Course content (Lectures): o o Lecture slides were not posted online. Every day, you would need to show up 5 minute before class to note down ID terms that were present in the pre-lecture portion. I thought this rule was quite disrespectful to people who had other classes (sometimes up the Hill) before her class and couldnt possibly make it on time. Students at Yale dont like being late to classes deliberately she treated us as if we were remedial school students. Professors must respect students if they want to be respected. Course content (Readings): o The readings were excellent",
    "Great course all around!",
    "The course covers a large swath of history, but manages to do so without feeling like it doesn't go into depth enough. Though there is a lot to cover, it might be nice to spend just one more lecture on the postwar period, especially on cultural developments."

    "If you are dead set on graduating Yale without ever challenging yourself or putting yourself in a position where you might get a bad grade, then don't take this course. But if you want to make the most of your education and take the courses that make Yale special, then you should take this course. Ignoring the content, this is one of the best history lectures at Yale. Professor Allen meticulously plans every lecture, and the readings perfectly complement the lectures. For the essays, the feed back is extensive and really focused on making you a better writer. In terms of content, everyone should be familiar with modern German history. It's just too relevant, especially in a world with increasing ethno-nationalism and accusations of \"fascism\".",
    "Take this credit\/d\/fail. Professor Allen is not like other Yale professor I've had, in that she is not understanding about the fact that life and extenuating circumstances can get in the way of assignments. DO NOT ASK FOR EXTENSIONS UNLESS YOU WANT A HUMILIATING SNARKY EMAIL THAT MAKES YOU FEEL HORRIBLE INSIDE. Professor Allen makes you work HARD and my writing vastly improved. That said, it may not be worth the stress to take this class for a letter grade.",
    "Professor Allen is incredible, and the class was fascinating. Definitely take it, whether you are a history major or not!! You won't regret it! If you aren't a history major, start with it credit\/d though, because the grading can be harsh...",
    "Tough class, most will get either a B or B+. I personally don't care, but I know you Yalies want that Goldman internship, so maybe think twice. It was an awesome class. I learned an unbelievable amount about Germany and the world generally from 1871 to present. Allen's lectures go at 100MPH and you'll be scrambling to record all the information because its all just so damn interesting. Fantastic reading list and amazing lectures.",
    "Perhaps the best lecture I've taken at Yale (and I took it as a senior!) Professor Allen puts so much thought into organizing her lectures and it absolutely shows. She's incredibly engaging it's one of those classes where you'll take eight pages of notes and leave absolutely buzzing about the material. I was initially wary about taking a course so narrowly focused on one country, but Germany's history is basically Europe's history during this period, and this history in particular is so important to understanding the present. Could not recommend more highly. That said: sort of a ridiculous amount of work for a history lecture. Three papers, four quizzes, and a final, along with weekly reading responses, felt a little excessive. Professor Allen cares deeply about helping you learn to write better and think more critically about history this is a great goal but you should be aware of the workload before taking it.",
    "Yes, but only if you're willing to put in the time.",
    "This class is a ton of work. Often, people will look at the syllabus, register that it says (for example) \"a map quiz, three ID quizzes, three papers, and a final\" and not really think about what that means. This course is two 1h15min lectures per week, plus a 50min section. There is a map quiz, three ID quizzes, three papers, and a final, which, as noted previously, is a lot of work. There's also weekly readings. The grading was pretty harsh in the start, not sure how it was for the second and third paper. Basically, Credit D is a great option here; it almost lets you just audit the lectures (though easy participation points in section are great). Professor Allen has a very formal and theatrical lecture style and she speaks sort of slowly and gives a ton of details, which isn't my favorite style, but I could just be wrong, so go check out a lecture for yourself. Overall, I was a little disappointed in that this class didn't revolutionize how I thought about Germany and Europe, but it did do a good job discussing the Nazis, which is what most people care about. In short, Credit D works great, be prepared for a lot of not-easily-graded work, and hope you get Heather for section (though she is also a total Destroyer of Worlds in terms of grading, but whatever).",
    "Absolutely, such a gem",
    "Yes, great lectures and very interesting if interested in Germany",
    "This teacher thinks she is a huge deal",
    "I would and have already recommended this class to many of my friends, some of whom aren't history majors. I think its content is important for anyone and the reading and discussions would engage anyone.",
    "Yes, but strongly consider taking it credit-D.",
    "This course is great but the heavy grading and stressful assignments shouldn't be taken lightly. They're looking for very specific things in the assignments with little room for flexibility and will give failing grades.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a good course to take Credit\/D if you want a comprehensive overview of German history in the past two centuries. If you are not taking it Credit\/D, be prepared to invest a good amount of time into the essays and IDs to ensure that you are receiving high grades on them. They are not extremely difficult, but do require significant investment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course content was fascinating and the readings were incredibly illuminating. Professor Allen is an incredible professor, and my TA Heather Horn was one of the best TAs I've had at Yale. I would even recommend this course to a student that doesn't study Germany, Europe, or even history, because Professor Allen hits a sweet spot both making this course accessible to students unfamiliar with the content (it is evident that no prior knowledge is assumed in the course) and teaching people like me, who are European History majors, a tremendous amount. I would, however, caution the student to one dimension of the course: the grading is quite demanding, which will turn off some students. I appreciated it because it helped me improve my writing, but prospective students should take note of it.",
    "Yes! Professor Allen was very well organized and every lecture was really interesting.",
    "Great class, but know that you probably won't get an A. A ton of work, also. But interesting stuff, not only teaches you German history but also drills into you how to write a good history essay.",
    "Definitely take this course! Professor Allen is a brilliant and compelling lecturer who really goes above and beyond. Give this course a chance because you'll realize how much German history can teach you about the present day. The lectures were engaging, the assignments were challenging but extremely rewarding. Professor Allen really knocks it out of the park and goes above and beyond. Be warned: The grading is tough, but it makes you a better writer and a better historian-- it's for your own good! Maybe start it out Credit\/D and see how things go before midterm.",

She is quite arrogant and takes the course far too seriously which turned an interesting class into a miserable experience.",
