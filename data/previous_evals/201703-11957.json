    "The biggest (and pretty much only) problem with the course was the room in which it was located. It was too small and too hot (nearly 80 degrees F) for me to pay attention. It was also structured in a way that seemed to maximize mean distance from the blackboard. A couple of more homework assignments would've been good to get some more practice on some things. Or maybe have two projects: one more guided or uniform for the entire class and a final one that is the students' choice."
