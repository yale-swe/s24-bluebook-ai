    "be prepared for lots of words to memorize everyday with daily homework and quizzes",
    "This is the continuation of CHNS 132. Yes, there is a lot of work, yes there are a lot of characters, and yes it is class everyday, but Liu Laoshi is awesome. You will learn so much, and improve so much, after dedicating this year of learning heritage Chinese with her. At the beginning of the year, I could only write and recognize a dozen or so characters, now I can write 800 character essays! I am so happy I decided to take this course. It is very hard, and you need to put in a lot of time if you want to do well, but like most language courses at Yale - if you put in the necessary amount of time and work, you will probably do well in the course. I definitely recommend to anyone serious about improving their Chinese.",
    "I do recommend this class because you learn a lot. However, Chinese is Chinese and you will have to do 2-3 hours of work everyday. Class is fun and engaging and I loved learning. One of the cons is that everyone comes in at different levels of Chinese fluency, so people will still consistently do better or worse than you irregardless of being taught the same material by the same professor. That's just something to deal with.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class! Liu Laoshi was a great teacher to take this class with and I learned a lot this past year. As a heritage speaker I had very little conversational fluency and could read and write basically nothing. I could understand a lot of conversational language. I think this class was perfect for my level of Chinese.",
    "Overall, this course did an amazing job of improving my Chinese writing and grammar abilities. I'm grateful that I took this class, as it forced me to learn large amounts of vocabulary. That being said, I often felt stressed and overwhelmed by the number of new words I had to learn every week. Immediate familiarity with them was basically a requirement, and although I spent several hours on Chinese every day, it sometimes was not enough. I also feel like there was a wide range of familiarity with Chinese within the class itself. If you do not feel confident in your fluency AT ALL, be sure your other classes aren't too overwhelming because time will be a problem.",
    "This class is more intense compared to CHNS132. The teachers will try to rush through 2-3 chapters a week, and the quality of learning will suffer as a result. So just be warned that this class is much less fun and less manageable in comparison to 132.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a heritage speaker who wants to learn more of the language."
