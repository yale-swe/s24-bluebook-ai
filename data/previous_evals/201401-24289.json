    "In class discussions and Homer Assignment",
    "The reading material is interesting and relevant and the Professor brings a lot of real-world experience to the classroom and is able to provide a genuine insight into Energy Issues in Developing Countries. The course provides an overview of several of the current problems in developing countries.",
    "Towards the end of the class, I realized I had learnt a lot from the class -The HOMER modeling exercise was very valuable in terms of understanding a holistic view of energy issues.The classroom discussion sections were informal and allowed space for free expression - I could participate despite usually feeling intimidated.",
    "This is one of the few classes that discusses the Homer model which is very valuable. I liked the emphasis on writing an interdisciplinary focus for the final paper. The discussion sections were very valuable but the time alotted for them was sometimes insufficient. Guest speakers (both Douglas Barnes and Chris Hebdon) were great.",
    "The readings.",
    "I like how much the class covered. I would like a little more information on how we might apply the information in our jobs. Many of us are going to work for governments, NGOs, etc., that work on energy issues, so I would like more info on how material could be used in those positions.",
    "HOMER project. Some lectures were really great.",
    "HOMER modeling project, thoughtful feedback on weekly writing, the way the class was organized to look at issues from the household to global scale"

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes the material is too rushed and I would suggest selecting a few topics and exploring them more deeply. I would also modify the lecture style to be more engaging and interactive by asking students to do the research and present some of the material (with guidance from Prof. Bailis). I would also encourage the Professor to test the students more frequently to ensure that they actually learn the material.All too often at FES, it's easy to skim the reading material without really absorbing or learning anything beyond the period of the course. More rigorous testing (like written exams) ensure that students actually study in order to learn.",
    "It would be great if we could have pointers or suggestive prompts about for reading responses. It would help make all the class think in the direction that the lecturer expects us to - for each set of readings. Or perhaps have a question for each week that the lecturer would like us to answer by critical analysis of the readings.",
    "Don't bring back the Ph.D student that guest lectured while Bailis was gone on week. He was unprepared and terrible.The class discussions were mostly unhelpful. I would instead like the last hour or half hour to spent discussing the issues in way that doesn't include silly role playing. We didn't learn much in the unrealistic scenarios. I would rather that time be put to better use actually having a debate or discussion about the topics at hand.",
    "Need to always allow enough time for the simulation exercises, adjust time per slide in lectures accordingly.",
    "Outdated materials in the weekly reading assignments"

   "question_text": "Was the relationship between the course lectures and discussion\/lab section",
   "comments": [
    "The discussions are often bordering on mediocre. I would replace the discussions with student presentations (individual or in pairs) on specific topics. That way, students learn as they prepare the presentations and other students pay more attention as they get to learn about different topics in more details from their classmates. It also adds variety and generates interest.",
    "The flexibility of the discussion sections allowed for creativity. One of the discussion sections was a quiz, some of them were role plays. All of them created different types of value.The quiz was quite interesting because it gave a chance for a refresher and a overall review of what was taught in class. This could be great for retention of takeaways. Students could be suggested to alternate between role plays and quizzes of they do not mind taking suggestions from the TA.",
    "The discussion section was good but there was not enough alotted time to have indepth discussions. I would suggest that instead of a reading response prior to class, a follow up response after the discussion would be more valuable since it would give student the opportunity to reflect on the discussion and the lectures and give well thought out solutions\/memos.",
    "The quality of the discussions varied week to week.",
    "Yes, the relationship was effective.",
    "The student-led discussion section could have benefitted from more moderation by or insights from the instructor."
