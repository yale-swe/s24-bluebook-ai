    "Very engaging class, excellent readings and atmosphere for discussion.",
    "The TA was always available and very helpful. She played a much more involved role than my TAs in other classes. I did not love the format of the class - we had 1\/2 lecture, 1\/2 discussion. I would have liked for the two to be more integrated.",
    "The topics covered in the course were enlightening and very necessary for anybody interested in development.",
    "The course would have greatly benefited from an introduction to social science and a conclusion. The last class should not be more of the same but give closure. I did not feel it did that.",
    "Question 9: This course could benefit from some field work\/trips, or having speakers come in.",
    "This course was for me the best class i have taken. As a development worker, it provided me insights developmental interventions and its impact. The class was thought provoking and an eye opener."

    "The professor and the discussion",
    "The student discussions and getting to debate, interact, ask questions, and listen to experiences. I also liked when the instructor brought goodies to class!",
    "The final paper was a great way to incorporate a lot of what we learned. The best part of the class was being able to incorporate this new knowledge into an area of our personal interest. This flexibility was great.",
    "The way its structured is extremely conducive to learning.",
    "The readings and the lectures but not the discussion.",
    "The materials used for the course gave a different perspective on the topics covered.",
    "The readings were wonderfully well-chosen. Each week's readings complemented their counterparts, and reinforced and expanded on earlier themes. The weekly thesis sentence assignment ensured close reading a shared starting point for discussion.",
    "The class allows people to articulate ideas about development and conservation as well as structure their arguments for or against it. Also, the reading expose student to what is being read about development and conservation.",
    "The readings. Many of them were very informative. The class discussions and lectures were also great.",
    "The interaction with students",
    "The lecture\/discussion format of class kept the course interesting. I particularly enjoyed that the discussions were student-led and tended to be tailored to personal interests of the students.",
    "Our class discussions. We had a very broad and diverse class which made for very interesting class discussions.",
    "The reading materials. Though i struggled with some of the reading materials, it was very engaging and thought provoking.",
    "Reading different case analysis from diverse parts of the world.Redirecting my view and standpoint on the underlying aspects of development and conservation initiatives. This course has provided me with awareness knowledge on how to look into my own biases and perspectives on development and conservation.I also enjoyed the in-class discussions on the weekly readings."

   "comments": [
    "Do not read out loud who wrote amazing sentences. It is uncomfortable for both those who did well and those who didn't. If you want us to have an understanding of good thesis sentences, email them to the course without the author's name.",
    "I did not find the thesis sentences to be that helpful, except for when it came to writing the final paper.",
    "This class is perfect. Nothing needs improvement.",
    "I thought that the instructor could perhaps have spent a bit more time lecturing about the readings and also in greater detail.I also think that encouraging more critique and critical analysis of the readings during class discussion would also be useful to stimulate more independent thinking about the ideas presented through the readings.",
    "The discussion.",
    "It would help to improve the way students receive feedback on assignments.",
    "A closer commitment to the content of the readings during class discussion. We had a tendency to stray rather far.",
    "At points during the semester, it was very repetitive. The readings had the same tone and the same thing with the discussion in class. This made student loose interest in the class and get tired. Also, the methodology to conduct discussions needs to be evaluated because the current set up leads to only a few people talking. Some people never spoke.",
    "The readings. There wasn't enough time to read and then digest the material. I also think there was a bit of a break down in communication between the instructor and the T.A. I have talked to them both about different topics, to get different responses on information that should have been the same, or similar.",
    "Everything about the course is balanced.",
    "I recommend that the course starts with a general explanation of the social sciences and the major actors\/concepts related to the analysis the class will partake throughout the semester. This first class will serve as an important guide\/tool for the analysis and evaluations undertaken within class discussions."
