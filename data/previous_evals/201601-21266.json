   "comments": [
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. Too much work for uninteresting material.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Professor Washington is not only great at explaining concepts and making them interesting, but she genuinely cares about student involvement and made an effort to learn everyone's name by mid-semester, which I've never had happen in a Yale lecture before. Also an incredibly useful class in terms of understanding what's going on in the world - I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "PLSC 218 is a great class for learning more about the intersections of economics and policy. I would recommend it if you are interested in both of those subject areas. The class does require a pretty solid microeconomics background.",
    "TLDR: TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR WASHINGTON. SHE LITERALLY SLAYS AND THIS CLASS WILL TRANSFORM YOUR VIEWS ON POLITICS AND ECONOMICS. As someone more interested in humanities, I was honestly expecting this course be pretty dull and tedious -- and I only took it because it was during an election year, and I wanted to be more informed. That being said, I could not have been more pleasantly surprised at how Professor Washington was able to bring the course material alive through engaging and fun lectures, getting to know our personal interests, and even allowing us to evaluate current policy proposals from presidential candidates. (Screw Trump.) She is friendly, approachable, and nothing if not willing to engage you thoughtfully in conversation. Her laugh is precious. Leave it for a women of color to be the best professor in a department and university notoriously lacking in diversity! yes yes yes The P-sets are admittedly kind of hard, but the exams and grading are incredibly reasonable. If you are remotely interested in how education, healthcare, welfare, taxation, etc., are affected by public and economic policy, YOU CANNOT LEAVE YALE WITHOUT TAKING THIS COURSE.",
    "Interesting material but not always a great presentation. Harder than expected but would recommend the course.",
    "A really interesting and incredibly relevant course. Terrific textbooks and intriguing assignments and exam questions Favorite Econ credit so far and I am majoring in economics For anyone interested in government and public policy and actually wants to understand public policy, this is a phenomenal course!",
    "Very applicable information, like taxes and stuff that you need to know. Not always the most interesting but super important.",
    "As a non-econ major, I really enjoyed this course! It goes over some very practical applications of economics, so if you are interested in any kind of gov\/politics\/education field, this is a must-take. Assignments are fair, the three exams are all reasonable, and lecture and section are both optional (although I highly recommend going to both!).",
    "With Ebonya - stay away. Without Ebonya - OK class, nothing more.",
    "Yes, this course is helpful for those that want to understand how the government should or shouldn't interact with the economy.",
    "Public Economics includes material that most citizens should honestly know. Especially if students don't intend to take another economics course in their time in college, Public Econ is a pragmatic entrance to the field in the cast of questions in which economics is often most powerful: policy."
