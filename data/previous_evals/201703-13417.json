    "I learned how to do a kind of philosophy I hadn't really done before the classic, Judith Jarvis Thomsontype systematization of intuitions that normative ethicists do. Of course, the class is nominally philosophy of law, and we did touch on some legal topics (tort and the justification of criminal punishment), but generally this was a course in normative ethics.",
    "It's a normative ethics class where the case descriptions are in the law. There's really no reading of cases, but one learns a lot more about philosophy. I also became a clearer writer."

   "comments": [
    "The main \"problem,\" although I wouldn't really call it that, is that there was a great deal of material on the syllabus that we didn't get to. I wouldn't call it a problem, though, since the reason we didn't get through as much as planned was because the class discussions were engaging and Professor Yaffe's lectures were so comprehensive that it was impossible to fit all the material into the short amount of time we had. I suppose law students might also have been irritated by the paucity of material that was clearly legally relevant, but since I'm not a law student I didn't mind at all. The strengths: really great and really challenging! syllabus; absolutely fantastic, incredibly careful, lectures; and a smart, engaged set of students. This was a great class.",
    "Gideon is really interested, as all philosophers are, in the structure of the argument and breaking down the argument. That being said, the lectures are mostly detailed reexplanations of the arguments in the text, and the comments are attempts to point out inconsistencies in this argument. It's not for everyone, but some people really enjoy this style."

   "comments": [
    "I'd definitely recommend it to students with a decent amount of experience in contemporary, Anglo-American philosophy, but might suggest that others think twice before enrolling. This is just because the material is hard, and the lectures although absolutely fantastic! presuppose familiarity with the methods typically employed in contemporary analytic philosophy. For those with the relevant background, though, I'd certainly recommend the course: the readings are great, the professor is fantastic, and the the topic is both intrinsically interesting and with clear social relevance.",
    "Definitely take it if you're a philosophy major. It is a classical analytic philosophy class. And the grad course is not that intimidating-- half of my class was undergrads. The papers are also standard philosophy papers."
