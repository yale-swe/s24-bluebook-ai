   "comments": [
    "Yes. I think more Electrical Engineering students and Biomedical Engineering students should take this class. It helps not only lay the foundation of estimation theory but also build up a framework where you can understand you research problems better. If possible, I would recommend it to be a required course of BME students who are focusing on imaging or image processing.",
    "This course presents the theory and examples and statistical estimation theory in the context of medical image analysis. The course particularly covers techniques for estimation problems that come up in image analysis, but the ideas presented are relevant to any other field where estimation problems can be encountered. While theory is emphasized, its presentation is not too rigorous andthe professor presents the material in concise and clear manner. Helpful practical applications are also given to reinforce theoretical concepts. I would highly recommend this course to anyone whose work involves estimation problems.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student in any system science related field. While I had some complaints, I still want to emphasize that this is one of the very best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any EE\/BME student who wishes to get a solid foundation on estimation theory, and who wishes to get familiar with the powerful tools within statistical inference. Whether or not you are interested in imaging, let alone medical imaging, is not an issue, as this course can be applied to many different areas.",
    "This class introduces many useful estimation techniques\/theory forimaging. Any image processing student should take this class. The foundation is necessary for many imaging analysis."

   "comments": [
    "It helps me to link the real world problem into mathematical model. It will help me a lot in my research.",
    "The course is very relevant to my research in medical image analysis. Problems in my research can be formulated using both Bayesian estimation and the EM algorithm, and this course introduced and developed these ideas so I could directly apply them to my work.",
    "This course was directly applicable to my research and I am already applying the material in my most recent experiments.",
    "This course has given me a crucial understanding into the methods I would have otherwise simply used as tools. I suspect it will have a profound impact on my research.",
    "As a first year, I'm not sure how accurately answer this question. I imagine what I learned in this class will be a necessary foundation for all future work I do."
