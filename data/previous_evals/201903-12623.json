    "Part I - Dynamic programming in Matlab, log-linearization, Recursive equilibrium, uncertainty with incomplete markets Part II - Differential equations, continuous time discounting, current value Hamiltonians, events with Poisson arrival rates, refresher in differentiation of integrals, and essentially all of the models of exogenous and endogenous growth",
    "This course is a comprehensive introduction to certain areas of macroeconomics theory. The first half focused on general equilibrium theory (Sequential Market Equilibrium, Arrow-Debreu, etc.) as well as Recursive equilibrium and RBC at the end, while the second half covered a wider variety of topics, including Endogenous Technical Change, Quality Ladders, OLG models, and various other concepts with a focus on continuous time. The primary tools that are developed in this course are dynamic programming (first half) and the use of optimal control theory (Hamiltonians and the like).",

   "comments": [
    "In both parts of the class the assignments were well designed and complemented the class material well. The course presented a lot of material, but each subsequent section built upon the previous in a manner that was helpful in being able to learn the material and make connections between the different concepts and models. One weakness is that the dynamic programming component of the class is quite challenging and comes very early on. I am not sure the solution to this problem. I suppose math camp helps address some of the learning curve, but there is still quite a steep curve.",
    "This course is overall extremely strong. In the first half, the only major improvement would be to post the lecture notes at the beginning of the semester and then modify subsequently as needed, as this facilitates learning. The second half had all the lecture notes posted in advance at the start of the quarter, which was extremely helpful. Distributing chapter 7 of the Acemoglu textbook during math camp would be highly useful as well, as the exposition of Hamiltonians in math camp was not as clear as in the textbook. The quality of teaching was superb, and pacing was good.",
    "Clear teaching",
    "The strength of this course is that it introduces a way of thinking about and working with macroeconomic models. Some of the material, particularly the real business cycle model at the end of the first part of the course and the political economy material at the end of the second part, went by very quickly. While these are interesting topics, they did not receive sufficient time for them to sink in. That having been said, I don't think it would be a good idea to try to do the other models faster. It feels like there is just a little too much material to fit in this term. The other weakness of the course is that it isn't clear where the material fits into the broader intellectual history of economics. That isn't necessarily the point of the course, but it would be nice to have.",
    "I would have appreciated more instruction in the Matlab coding and algorithms we were expected to use in our problem sets. I had no prior experience with Matlab and I know other students struggled with this too. It seemed like it was just assumed we knew how to use these algorithms, but I actually found it much more challenging than the theory. This made it hard to know how to allocate my study time in the course I could solve the theory questions in a decent amount of time, but I felt I could never finish the coding, no matter how many hours I put in.",
    "Overall okay but weird that we spent only one lecture at the very end on RBC?",
    "I find a lot of the course material really interesting. Sometimes the lectures are not as engaging as they could be. I also would enjoy more opportunities to link the course material to the real world and to economic research."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The models and concepts used are helpful in many economic sub-fields. I think it is a solid course in economic fundamentals.",
    "Given that this is a core required course for the PhD, you don't have a choice but fortunately it's a great class. For undergraduates, I would strongly recommend this course if and only if (1) you have an interest in macroeconomic theory, (2) you intend to go into academia in economics or a related field, and (3) you have sufficient mathematical training, preferably at least vector calculus, linear algebra, and real analysis. The mathematical tools that are course-specific are well developed, but students will struggle in this class without sufficient mathematical background. That said, the mathematics are never particularly complicated despite the fact that a deeper understanding of math certainly makes this course easier.",
    "Yes. Tools + theory",
    "I would recommend this course to any student pursuing a PhD in economics, because it is required for the PhD in economics.",
    "Yes, good introduction to macroeconomic topics"
