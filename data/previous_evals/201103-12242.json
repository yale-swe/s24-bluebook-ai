    "This class is BRILLIANT. I promise you will never regret taking it. Prof. Kastan is a total boss, and easily the most talented lecturer I've had during my time at Yale. His insights will leave you seeing the world in a whole new way (and that's not an exaggeration). Even if you don't love English, or don't have that much experience with Shakespeare, I guarantee you'll get a lot out of this class. A must-take before you graduate.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants a broader base in Shakespeare. While the amount of reading for this class (about 1 play a week) doesn't allow for Kastan to go tooin depth for any one play, coming out of this course I feel well-versed in all of the histories and tragedies.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I am sure there will be a lot of reviews about how wonderful this course is. And I know other people who really enjoyed this course, but I did not. There is nothing to compel you to read but yourself, so I left most of it until Thanksgiving break,but a lot of people simply do not do the reading. This is a course for which shopping period is invaluable. You might love it, but don't be forced into feeling that way.",
    "Fabulous in every way. A course on Shakespeare should be required for every Yale student. A course on Shakespeare with Kastan is even better. Enlightening and fun lectures. I looked forward to every class and I'm sad it's over.",
    "Fun if you don't have any other work at all, want to try to read the plays, and actually really like Shakespeare. Think about that really hard before you take it.",
    "This is a great class, in which you read 1 play per week. Professor Kastan gives amazing lectures, and you will be captivated the entire time. And the reading list is simply second-to-none.",
    "LOVE IT",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Take it!",
    "I loved this course. Almost all of professor Kastan's lectures were interesting, informative and fun.He did an especially nice job with the paper prompts. I ended up writing papers on topics I was genuinely interested in and enjoying the process.While Professor Kastan was sometimes slightly unprepared for class, even on those days he gave great lectures.TAKE THIS COURSE!!!",
    "This class will get you to engage with the texts on the reading list, but don't expect miracles from the lectures. I found them fairly unhelpful to attend, and preferred to read the commentaries in the Norton Reader instead. Sections were interesting and generally engaging, and the assignments were terrific - I really feel like, despite wanting to pull my hair out in frustration at times, they helped me expand my command of close reading and careful argumentation. Be careful, though - the take-home final takes a painstakingly long time to complete, and is pretty challenging.",
    "Take it! Great for English majors especially.",
    "Yes, it's a fantastic course. It's a wonderful introduction to all of the tragedies and some of the histories--you'll get a lot of out it.",
    "If you have ever found Shakespeare even remotely interesting or enjoyable, you MUST take this course! Not an experience to be missed.",
    "I hate to contradict what will probably be a David Kastan love-fest, but this class is kind of awful. The lectures are amusing, for sure, and Kastan clearly knows what he's talking about--but they're essentially performances that get kind of old after a few weeks. The workload is an entire play a week, so you never feel like you're really engaging with any one text. The class feels rushed and breathless. And by the time you get to the awful monster final (which literally took me twenty hours, spread out over five days), you regret ever taking this class.Basically, the TA makes all the difference in the world. He or she will determine what grade you get and whether you feel like this class is a huge waste of time or not.Caveat emptor: I am not an english major, so none of this may be useful or applicable information.",
    "If you need a pre-1800, this is a good class to take. But I would probably not recommend it otherwise. It's not bad, but there are too many other English courses that are much better.",
    "Yes. Take it. Beware the final (its killer and will make you never want to read Shakespeare again) but the rest of the class is a pretty low workload and lecture is fun and entertaining.",
    "Histories and Tragedies is SO GREAT. Professor Kastan is brilliant, and he really tries to get to know his students (even though the lecture is huge). My TA (Tessie Prakas) was AWESOME and I really learned a lot in section.HOWEVER. BEWARE OF THE FINAL EXAM. It is listed as a \"take home\" on the syllabus, so you might think, hm, how hard could it be... yeah, SIX ESSAYS LATER you're wondering how you ever fell prey to thinking that it wouldn't be too bad. Finals week was a total nightmare all thanks to this load of an exam. If you're not good at producing great essays under an extreme time crunch and if you're really attached to your GPA, consider this course carefully. However, if you are an English major and are in love with Shakespeare, this course is a must-take.",
    "Great lectures- not sure if that makes up for lackluster sections lead by pompous, under qualified, and unknowledgeable grad students in the Eng. department here. Keep in mind that these fools are responsible for grading and evaluating your work. You may get lucky, though. Len is the man.",
    "This is a great class--you get to read Shakespeare's best plays and then hear a really knowledgable and interesting lecture about them twice a week. Professor Kastan is obviously a great lecturer. He is engaged throughout class and sticks to a couple of main ideas per play (which though at times feels like shortchanging the play, is a much more followable and deeper understanding than lectures that attempt to cover too many ideas in one sitting).",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Thoughtful, unexpected lectures that cut to heart of the most interesting questions in Shakespeare. Don't expect plot summary in lecture. This class is also notable for the unusual essay prompts; they require some creativity and an affinity for word-level analysis.",
    "I would recommend English 201 to another student only if he or she is interested in reading many of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. Do not go for the value of lectures. Kastan's ego outweighs anything that he might say, and most of his analysis of the plays is based on his repetition of the same argument over and over again, without any true support from the text. In general, the discussion of texts is no better than that of a high school sophomore english class. Kastan routinely embarrasses students in front of the entire lecture hall and always runs over time. He seems to forget that people are taking more classes than just his - his assignments are ridiculous. The final is a nightmarish compilation of 6 essays that has no page limit, but easily reaches 25 pages. English 201 is worth it only because you feel that you should read a play a week, but you could easily get through the semester without reading more than three or four of the plays. However, the TF's are all great and capable of leading constructive discussions that lend at least some purpose to the class.",
    "Eh. Worth it for the reading if you do the reading (and you can do fine in the class without doing the reading), but not much else. Lots of people love Kastan, but he's incredibly smug and sometimes alienating, as his humor often comes at the expense of students and TFs. The lectures were fun but not always substantive. And the assignments are frustrating and not worthwhile. But Shakespeare's great, so if you do the reading you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Kastan is a *great* lecturer. The work is not too bad, the weekly readings can easily be done in an evening (if you do them at all). The papers are not too bad, until the final. The final was a series of essays to be done at home. In all honesty, it was the most demanding assignment I have ever done. Not only were the essays objectively difficult to handle, they took a very long time. Just know that going in and start early.",
    "If you want to read lots of Shakespeare, then take this class. Three assignments (papers, but Kastan likes to make sort of quirky assignments) and a take home final (which is sort of a pain...it has no maximum length and consists of 6 (yes, six!) essay questions). Kastan is a lively lecturer. Does not allow computers in the lecture hall. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone with even a cursory interest in Shakespeare.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It's A LOT more work than I was expecting, though. A play a week can get overwhelming at times, but it provides a great foundation of knowledge about Shakespeare, which is what I was looking for. There are 3 essays and a take home final which is a TON of work (6 essays), but overall I'm glad I took the class.",
    "ENGL 201 is a survey of the histories and tragedies. Kastan is an energetic lecturer, although his arguments are not always presented with the rigor that one might like. The course moves rapidly and there are frequent assignments, but they tend to be unusual and engaging.",
    "This is a fairly painless English course if you're a non-humanities person. If you are a humanities buff, this course is still great. Just be wary of the take-home final--it's six essay questions, which means churning out 20-30 pages during reading week.",
    "This is a great course! Professor Kastan is an amazing lecturer, he's so entertaining and his lectures are really interesting you'll actually look forward to going to class. this is a great way to fulfill the pre-1800 requirement for the english major but it's also an excellent class for anyone who likes shakespeare",
    "This class requires assignment based analysis of Shakespeare's Histories and Tragedies to improve close reading skills. I would recommend this to another student if he or she wishes to improve his\/ her close reading.",
    "A must-take Shakespeare class that teaches you how to read him in an entirely new way. Kastan is a legend--you'll enjoy his lectures. Be sure to keep up with the reading otherwise you won't get as much out of the class.",
    "I did not enjoy reading all of the plays or the lectures about them but section was always very rewarding because I learned how to talk\/comment about scenes that at first seemed hard to understand. For example, in Antony and Cleopatra, when Cleopatra is described, we see how she is made into an exotic Other through language. You learn really close reading, like the effect of a conjunction.The three papers we wrote have clear instructions and prompts and help you, especially English majors, think about specific plays. Rereading (knowing the plot well) and creativity is a must to do well on them.",
    "This is a great course and a must-take for anyone who has not read all of Shakespeare's plays twice or thrice. (Though I hold the conviction that anyone will walk away from the class with new knowledge and the fun experience of listening to Professor Kastan lecture.)Professor Kastan is charming, quick, humorous, and overflowing with knowledge. His personality truly makes the class enjoyable in a way that no other professor will be able to emulate. His stories about family\/past experiences\/the TA's are short and elucidate points, keeping the class on track. He needs to cover a lot of material in only a little time, but he does so in an organized, thorough way.Students walk away knowing how to read and interpret Shakespeare with confidence. This is an extremely valuable and enabling skill. Take this class!",
    "A comprehensive, if somewhat scattered, overview of Shakespeare's historical and tragic plays. I would definitely recommend this class, but I would also recommend the Comedies\/Romance lecture with Lawrence Manley. I think the latter is underrated, and the former, while I wasn't necessarily able to enjoy the material as much as in Comedies\/Romance, did improve my critical reading and essay writing to a great degree.",
    "A very good and very challenging course. It's difficult to do all the reading and do it well as it's at least a play a week and this is dense stuff, but Shakespeare rewards all the time you're willing to put in. Kastan is a great lecturer, and I get the sense that most of the TFs for this class were strong. The assignments are hard but different and can even be fun. The take home final is sadistic, so take the course with friends for moral support at the end of the semester.",
    "Definitely take! Excellent lecture, professor and plays!",
    "Great course. A play a week, tough but interesting assignments. Absolutely worth taking whether or not you're well acquainted with Shakespeare's plays. Kastan is brilliant and entertaining, hands down recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend the course only if you are an English major in need of a course to complete the pre-1800 requirement. Otherwise, it is a fun enough course to take Credit\/D",
    "A really good introduction to Shakespeare, a must-take for an English major.",
    "Yes!",
    "English 201 is an amazing class. Regardless of whether or not you like Shakespeare, take it. Amazing professor, interesting assignments, and great reading!",
    "It's a great opportunity to read a lot of Shakespeare plays in a short time and hear some great commentary on them, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're ready for a lot of close reading and textual analysis. If you're more interested in dramatic criticism, this may not be the right course for you. Then again, the lectures are very entertaining.",
    "I would as long as you enjoy Shakespeare. There's a lot of writing and the take home final is absolutely awful, but if you enjoy detailed work with Shakespeare texts, then this is an awesome course.",
    "Lots of plays, interesting lectures, but you don't really end up getting a comprehensive understanding of any of them",
    "An intro to Shakespeare Histories and tragedies... pretty self explanatory.",
    "Kastan's lectures were interesting and enjoyable although not as exceptional as I expected from his charismatic personality. He provides an important but not tiresome historical context for the plays we read and never fails to entertain. I enjoyed reading the history plays which usually go untouched in Shakespeare courses. The take home final was unnecessarily long (several full essays).",
    "A great course. Professor Kastan's lectures are absolute gems. It's a very manageable load, with approximately one play per week. Even if you get behind on the reading, it's not a big deal. You're never actually tested on it. The final exam is a compilation of essay questions and is a take home, with open book and open notes. It's a huge pain, though, so do not leave it until the last minute. We had 6 essay questions to do and most people ended up writing between 15-30 pages. Kastan's essay topics throughout the course are actually quite unusual and interesting, though, and I thought I learned a great deal from writing his papers. Make sure you get a good TA! They do all of your grading, so finding a good section is crucial.",
    "Take it -- you NEED Shakespeare, and you NEED Kastan, who is so kind as to go out for coffee (or drinks) with anyone who asks.",
    "Professor Kastan's lectures were repetitive but curiously managed to be enjoyable and instructive anyway. Lecture conclusions often gave me goosebumps. The course does not require you to stay on top of the reading list or class notes so long as you read what is needed to answer the essays after prompts are distributed, but you definitely get more out of the class by carefully reading each play.",
    "Brilliant and witty professor teaching a brilliant and witty author. Great assignments which help you to develop as a student. Take this class."
