    "Good course. If you've taken Development Under Fire with Jason Lyall and liked it, this course covers somewhat similar material - the causal mechanisms behind how non-state service provision has an effect and impact evaluation. Not high stress, but you will learn to think about causality.",
    "Would not recommend it as there are more interesting classes that touch on similar ideas and topics.",
    "Yes but only if you are actually interested in program evaluation.",
    "It's a great overview of welfare states and non-state actors, allowing you to look at foreign intervention from both a quantitative and a qualitative standpoint.",
    "This was a great class! We had some wonderful discussions, and I think I learned a lot about NGO evaluation and the broader theories behind service provision. A big focus of this class is NGO program design, which I liked a lot but did not really expect when I signed up for the class. The readings were interesting and a manageable workload."
