    "Take this class whether you think you know about the Continent or not. Doesn't matter if you're from there, the class covers many topics that you may not be familiar with and will be surprised to learn about. Loved it and the professor is very approachable and friendly-- allows for engaging discussions in class.",
    "An amazing summary of important topics in both a general sense of the world's issues but with specific case studies as well"
