   "comments": [
    "Nucleic Acids is a really chill lab, but it's more fun than most other labs because students work on real projects over the course of several weeks. Workload is extremely low (except for the final report), and the work that we did have felt useful and instructive. Dr. Nelson is such a joy to work with!",
    "YES! Take this class!",
    "Ken Nelson is smart, experienced, and patient, and this really shows when he teaches the class. Explaining some concepts like NGS can be really difficult and confusing, but I think everyone in the class left with a firm understanding. He is also incredibly nice, and cracks jokes left and right. Class was a blast!! Take it!",
    "Ken Nelson is SUCH a sweetheart. He's adorable, and he's so meltingly nice! He is a tad (or quite a bit) scatterbrained, which makes his lectures all over the place. He's very knowledgeable, but again, lectures were piecemeal. Experimentation is fun if you have friends in the class. The class is very little work--no weekly lab reports (just one monster report at the end), and short problem sets. This lab is one of the few class labs that do actual research--you take on projects from actual laboratories at Yale, so the projects change each year, and each year presents a radically different academic focus than the last. Which keeps things interesting! And also very possible for experiments to fail, like my class's did (half a semester's worth of cell sorting and gene expression work... nope.). My class was the first group at Yale to use an ion torrent next-gen sequencing machine, which was awesome. Not a hard class at all--Dr. Nelson and the TAs are always willing to help out on the problem sets. But this means the grade distribution could be unsavory.Love to Dr. Nelson. He's wonderful.",
    "If you're premed, you need a year of bio lab, and a semester of nucleic acids (I and II) fulfills this. It's pretty decent, really chill.",
    "Take this if you need a bio lab! There is not a lot of work at all until the end of the course when you have to write up all you have done.",
    "It's a solid lab course for anyone looking for either pre-professional credits or major credits. I'd absolutely recommend the class, on account of the workload is pretty light and the teacher is wonderful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student, whether or not a Biology major. Unlike most undergraduate lab, this class is not about following a cookbook and repeating experiments that have already been performed several times. Rather, it will allow you to engage in new research, and approach it with critical thinking. It will also allow you to acquire or refine fundamental laboratory skills, and it will give you the honor to use some pretty cool and unique instruments and techniques that not every undergrad at Yale gets to use!",
    "Take it. It's a great way to get in bio lab requirements and its a good class in general. If you can't get in, don't be shy to just sign up for the second half of the course. There's always extra space there.",
    "This course is excellent to take in order to fulfill a Biology lab requirement. Professor Nelson is fantastic, and one typically leaves lab within a reasonable time. The techniques used are quite advanced (most research labs would complain of the expense), but are explained very clearly.",
    "Yes-- it is ultimately a great bio lab",
    "342L is a laidback, fun lab with an awesome professor. Get working on the final lab report early and make sure you understand what you are doing during each lab - if not, ask Professor Nelson and he'll be more than happy to explain it to you. This lab is a bit unorganized, but a great bio lab nonetheless.",
    "i'd recommend this if you're looking for a lab to meet a requirement, especially if you want one that isn't too intense and doesn't need a corresponding lecture course."
