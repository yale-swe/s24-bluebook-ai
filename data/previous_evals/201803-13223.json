    "I developed better skills in reading and understanding linguistic literature. For example, I learned how to read a paper and take away key points, as well as to work around smaller details that are less relevant to what I am interested in. Additionally, I learned how to compare the proposals and arguments made in one paper against other proposals, and how to think through the various predictions and assumptions that each proposal makes.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The pacing and structure of the course was good. Professor Zanuttini is flexible, taking into account the interests of the class and revising assignments and deadlines so that each student gets the most out of the course. I think the reading questions added toward the end of the course were the most helpful in getting me to think through each paper we read."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course (or any seminar with Professor Zanuttini) to another student. The level of the course is definitely too high for anyone without adequate linguistic background, but if you have the background it is worthwhile and interesting to take the course. I appreciated the flexibility with which we could pursue our own interests and develop our own ideas and proposals for phenomena of interest.",
    "This class was a really interesting opportunity to look at research being done in syntax about categories not traditionally considered to be within the domain of syntax. I enjoyed the readings and the freedom we had to decide what topics we wanted to explore."
