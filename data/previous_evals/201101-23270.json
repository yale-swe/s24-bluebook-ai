    "I would recommend it if you have a specific reason to study Iraqi. Otherwise, stick to Modern Standard. There is really no vocabulary expansion - the main focus is giving us the common-but-different-than-standard words and using them in context.",
    "Iraqi Arabic is an introductory course in the Iraqi dialect; you'll learn basic, useful vocabulary that you may not have learned in Modern Standard. It's highly focused on words\/phrases that can actually be used in conversation.",
    "This is a solid intro course to Iraqi Ameeya. Don't take the class expecting to emerge as a fluent speaker, though; you'll understand most of the basic expressions used on a daily basis, but it will still be difficult to speak fluently in Ameeya. The work load is relatively light, about 4-5 hours all told per week. The listening drills could be a bit of apain, but if you power through them it does help you.",
    "If you want to actually speak Arabic, you need a colloquial dialect. Iraqi is a good dialect to learn and Usteza al Ani is a really wonderful teacher. She is sweet and a fair grader and the work is not at all overwhelming (10-40 minutes of homework per class + some quizzes and tests over the course of the semester)."
