   "comments": [
    "There is A LOT of reading. But it's mostly interesting stuff. In the end, you've learned about that country that is demonized so.",
    "Took this on a whim (for a social science credit) and it became my favorite class of the semester. Narges Erami is absolutely lovely, and class was a joy to attend--the topic is fascinating and its implications wide-ranging. Would take again in a heartbeat.",
    "This class explores the culture, history and people of Iran, recognizing that we experience it through a variety of representations as American students. It's a poignant and respectful survey of a place that is repetitively demonized and mystified in American media. I would recommend it to every Yale student; Iran will become increasingly important in our lifetime, and this class provides a wonderful foundation about this place. There is a lot of reading - and you can get away not doing it - but I would recommend absolutely all of the reading. It's incredible, and I caught up over spring break with the readings that I didn't finish during the term, and it was totally worth it.",
    "Terrific course! I am a MMES major and took away so much from this course. You also by no means have to be a MMES major in order to have a meaningful experience in this class. It is a terrifically comprehensive curriculum and touches on nearly every facet of Iranian society. I CERTAINLY recommend this course to anyone who wants to learnmore about Iran in a fun, low-stress environment",
    "Pretty strange class--not very organized and totally unclear expectations on assignments. Certainly very interesting material, though, and cool readings, so you'll sort of get out of it what you put in. Professor Erami is hilarious and fun to be in class with, especially if you approach it more as a casual discussion group about Iran.",
    "Fantastic class with an excellent professor. I knew relatively little about Iranian culture going in, and I now feel I have a far better grasp on the life, history, and situation of the modern Iranian.Professor Erami is just the best. Definitely a class to take.",
    "If you have any interest in seeing the Iran behind the nuclear issue, take it."
