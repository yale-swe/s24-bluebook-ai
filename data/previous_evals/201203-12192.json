    "Absolutely. It's unfortunate that Mme Tamalet is leaving this year, because she's an expert in this field and also very nice. If you're a French major or generally interested in French culture, you owe it to yourself to take a course on this topic. French North Africa is often glossed over in intro French courses, but it's incredibly important in France's history (and future too, given the current debates over immigration).A lot of reading, but worth it - and since the essays are largely free-response, you can skim some of it. A few films help balance out the readings.",
    "Great readings that are underrepresented elsewhere in the French department; very interesting class on the whole.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 215 to another student. The workload was reasonable, and the material you learn is very interesting. A great French class!",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, whether or not he\/she is a French major. The course is a fabulous introduction to a region affected by France that doesn't often receive coverage in the American curriculum for French. The syllabus is composed of works that range in difficulty and incorporated theories surrounding identity, colonialism, and literature. The is an interdisciplinary course that will offer a holistic view of the Maghreb region, and the tenets of the course are applicable to almost any other course a student will take.",
    "Literature and culture of the Maghreb. Literature focused with a lot of history and culture added for context."
