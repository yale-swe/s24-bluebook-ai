    "This class is a great text course. While it was supposed to be a survey of Middle Egyptian literature, we ended up reading the entirety of Sinuhe, instead of reading parts of both Sinuhe and the Eloquent Peasant. However, reading all of Sinuhe allowed us to really focus on the intricacies of the story, all the while working on the grammar. My only regret is that we didn't get an introduction to hieratic; nevertheless, there are more classes at Yale where you can do that. As for Professor Manassa, she is wonderful! I wholly recommend any class with her at Yale -- she is one of the best professor's I've ever had here!",
    "This course was AMAZING. We read The Tale of Sinuhe (of which the anonymous writer has been dubbed \"the Egyptian Shakespeare), and honestly I feel that I understand that story far better than most English books I have read. We were offered a glimpse into the mindset of the Ancient Egyptians through a highly popular story; this story not only was of great literary value in itself, but offered the chance to learn about the background and history behind it. We read it in its completion, which I feel was an excellent choice. Professor Manassa is, in a word, amazing. She knows everything, always takes time to answer questions, is fair, and is willing to take the course in whatever direction the class chooses. For example, several of us (I included) petitioned to read \"The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre,\" (look it up if you have not heard of it) and not only did we get to read it, but Prof Manassa just happens to be THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERT ON IT. I KNOW!!! I suspect she is the world's leading expert on many things, though.I cannot stress enough that this opportunity would never exist anywhere but Yale, and you MUST take this course.It is a lot of work to translate as many pages as you need to each week, but since it only meets once a week, you have all the time in the world.Even the final exam was fun. I kid you not.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, it is a good step up from the intro egyptian courses and covers a very interesting story at a good pace.",
    "If you are interested in the Egyptian language and are willing to delve into the grammar of translations, I would say definitely take this class. You will have a great time and learn a lot."
