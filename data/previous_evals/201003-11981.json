   "comments": [
    "It's a great course, so take it if you want to study translation of French into English. Unfortunately it doesn't include translating English into French, so if you're looking to improve your French with this class, that won't happen. But I totally recommend this course - it's so much fun!",
    "French 185 is an introductory translation class, which focuses on different issues with translating French into English. We translated one passage of contemporary fiction eachweek, which we would then workshop in class. The seminar is very interactive and focuses more on improving your language abilities and learning the nuances of French and English than creating the \"perfect\" translation. The work-load is very reasonable; even the final translation of 7-9 pages felt reasonable after working in smaller chunks all semester.",
    "No, it is not a good class for french majors; it is pretty much an english class. also, the translations are really free so the more creative you are the better. It didn't enhance my french knowledge.",
    "Great class!! Really enjoyed it. Excellent exposure to subtle techniques of language. Makes you a better reader of French and a better writer of English. A nicely different way of thinking that offsets other Yale classes in the semester. Thoroughly recommend!!",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. It makes you think a lot about the nature of language and the troubles of translation. I loved doing the homework (translations of excerpts from French literature), and I loved going to class. Alyson Waters is fantastic.",
    "YES. Best class I have taken so far. I very rarely say that I have really enjoyed a class, rather than just preferred it to others, but this one really is great. Turn up to the shopping period classes as it is always too popular, but you won't regret going. The workload is not stressful at all, and you will want to do the assignments anyway.",
    "Good, varied look at translations of different styles. Not much outside of the translations themselves in the way of reading or anything.",
    "Awesome! Definitely Take it! You will improve your writing skills in English and French. The course load is no problem!",
    "This class was an absolute joy - the highlight of my semester. I recommend it highly.",
    "I would recommend this class as a laid-back way to keep up your French and get exposure to some of the difficulties involved in translation. But this class does NOT go really in-depth or focus on various \"theories\" of translation; Professor Waters doesn't really believe in consistent, theoretical approaches to translations and thinks translation is a skill you just have to pick up over time, and learn to apply in order to solve problems on a case-by-case basis.",
    "Definitely take this class! If you're at all interested in translation and literature it'll be a really great experience",
    "Translation is great practice in French comprehension (especially the contemporary idioms you don't often get in language classes), English composition, and the patterns of thought you need to function bilingually. There's not much theory: a couple brief discussions of what translators do, but the emphasis (rightly, I think) is on the practical."
