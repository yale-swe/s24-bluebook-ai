    "This class is an awesome way to learn Spanish non-traditionally! The class is very small so you get to know all of your classmates. The professor is awesome as well. By the end of the class, you'll feel really at home and comfortable with everyone.",
    "Class is a lot of fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, it's a very manageable course.",
    "Spanish 227 is a great class if you're into creative writing. I wouldn't take it just to practice your Spanish. The workload is manageable (a lot of it is how much you want to put into your writing), and Maria is excellent. She's extremely nice and very reasonable with work\/grading."
