    "It is essentially a speaking practicum in which you will read longer italian novels that you probably have in any other levle 5 italian course, and discuss how the content of thsoe novels affects your own ideas about italy and italian culture more generally. You also have the opportunity to bring some of your own interests into the class through individual presentations and papers with topics of your choice. I would recommend this class for anyone looking into strengthening their speaking skills in a non-stressful environment",
    "Students will get out of this class what they put into it. The first few weeks of the class centers around discussion of Italian history up to the present day, when we began to delve into the Italian political scene, modern journalism, and fiction novels that examine Italian culture. Presentations and papers are about whatever you find most interesting related to the current topic. I think this class really improved my Italian reading (and speaking!) skills and taught me a great deal about contemporary Italian culture, thanks to the wonderful Professor Iacovella and discussion-based classes.",
    "Overview of Italian history and topics in contemporary Italian politics\/culture",
    "NO. The course is a mess. The professor is too nice to make it clear what she expects from you, so she gives no assignments. The amount of work suggested by the syllabus is impossible. You feel frustrated no matter what you do, either for following the syllabus and working too hard, or for disregarding the syllabus and learning nothing."
