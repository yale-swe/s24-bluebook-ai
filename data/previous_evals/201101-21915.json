    "Cool course - writing section is totally worth it.",
    "Great class if you like the classics. A good follow-up from Kagan's Intro to Greek History that provides you with chronological perspective without getting too specific. A must take for history majors.Plus, a VERY easy and fun WR if you opt for it. 2 essays tops plus some small assignments.",
    "If you need a writing credit, take this. If you are interested in Alexander and Hellenism, take this. If you have a quite heavy course load already, take this.",
    "take it if you took greek history with kagan the semester before, so you can have the complete greek experience here at yale.",
    "Super easy class. Take it writing- you get more out of the sources when you have to write papers on them. Manning is great.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would summarize this class as a fairly laid-back survey of the Hellenistic period with a focus on primary sources. I would certainly recommend this class to someone interested in classics or ancient history. Be warned, however, that this class really is not about Alexander the Great. Only the first 2-3 weeks are about him, after which he is rarely mentioned again.",
    "I believe this course's title is a bit misleading as it only briefly touches on the actual life of Alexander. The course focuses much more on his successors and the world after Alexander's death. Nonetheless this is a fascinating time period which sheds light on the development of the Western world. It spans from the Greek world before Alexander's conquest all the way to the rise of the Roman state, and though it covers a large amount of time and space in history, it does not feel as though that coverage is superficial.",
    "The course is overall quite good if you're extremely interested in hellenistic history. If not, it's quite fragmentary so you feel like you're learning in the middle of nowhere history.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. It is a great writing credit and is very interesting. Its one of the best history classes I have taken.",
    "It is exactly as the title of the class would imply.",
    "Yes. Great ROW credit and not a lot of requirements.",
    "Summary of the period from Philip II to Cleopatra. Interesting at times, repetitive for a lot of it. A lot about logistics, constraints and WAR ELEPHANTS. So many war elephants. This could be a great course if it were taught in a better, more cohesive way, but at the moment its just a mishmash of ancient history.",
    "This is the worst history class I've taken at Yale. One of the worst classes period. Don't let the lack of work fool you; while it is easy, you will hate your life. The lecture is dull. The readings are dull. It's a fascinating period, and somehow it becomes scattered. There is literally no narrative. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There are other writing credits and other rest of the world\/preindustrials.",
    "Great class that is not too difficult. I would recommend this to science majors looking to learn about the classical\/Hellenistic world while earning a not-too-hard humanities credit.",
    "I would recommend this course. Not too much work, interesting, and a good WR.",
    "Not great, not bad--interesting subject matter.",
    "Alexander the Great is a solid introduction to an area of history that has often received less attention than it is due. It covers state formation, cultural developments, and the constant political fluctuations. Professor Manning is really nice and enthusiastic, although a little scattered. The workload is quite light, so you get out of this class what you put into it. The reading list is a cool combination that provides a good array of primary sources",
    "This is a fun class. The material is really interesting, and Prof. Manning presents it well. There's a lot of reading, but you can get away without doing all of it, so there's very little work."
