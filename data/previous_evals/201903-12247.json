   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with a robust framework with which to analyze the world from a spatial perspective. We looked at critical theory that stretched from Kant to the modern day, and I feel as though I am able to understand space in a new way and analyze it from a variety of perspectives, be that empathy theory, marxist geography or perspectival space, just to name a few. This class has taught me to clearly articulate my ideas (both spoken and in writing) about space and spatial theory by giving me a large vocabulary of relevant terms. The course pushed my ideas about what space is and where it is relevantin architecture, art, criminal justice, feminism, colonialism. I also learned how to effectively analyze objects from many of Yale's collections and use them in building an argument.",
    "I gained a really comprehensive understanding of spatial theory, ranging from philosophers like Descartes and Kant to artist-intellectuals like Moholy-Nagy. I've also developed my ability to parcel out difficult or convoluted arguments from a text. Lastly, I believe my ability to articulate very abstract arguments in writing is much stronger than before.",
    "This class was a fantastic introduction to spatial theory and the many different periods\/thinkers who have contributed to the discourse. Though it wasn't strictly or traditionally architectural, it made me think about architecture in new and different ways.",
    "The first half of the semester focussed on a (roughly chronological) development of Western ideas of space from early philosophy (Descartes and Kant) to twentieth-century art, considering perspectives mostly from philosophy, art history and architecture. The second half of the semester brought in more political and social elements, looking at postcolonial theory, marxist spatiality, incarceration, gender, race and technology. This course was essentially an introduction to major interdisciplinary thought about space and spatiality.",
    "The coursework was so fascinating. I learned how to parse through, question, and criticize philosophers' understandings of \"space.\" I had more abstract conversations about architecture than I ever thought I would, and sometimes they were difficult to keep up with, but I learned so much about thinking. I learned there is absolutely no way to concisely define space, or void.",
    "I learned about the changes in our understanding and representation of 'space' throughout history.",
    "In this class, I was not only pushed to do more reading and writing than I ever had before, but I also enjoyed every minute of it. The materials Prof Buckley put together stimulated wonderful discussions every week. New insights in how we interpret space as a species and within our own minds.",
    "I learned a lot about philosophies of space and the trajectory of spatial thought over time. I had the opportunity to compare different philosophies of space and make arguments based on those comparisons."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: 1. Immaculately constructed syllabus brings a variety of perspectives and keeps the course content fresh every week. 2. Topics resulted in very rich discussions that always went up to the very end of class (and sometimes over). 3. The class brings you to look at objects in a variety of Yale's collections (Beinecke, YUAG, YCBA, Haas). You are in a different location pretty much every day and the class discussion is always accompanied by relevant physical primary source material. 4. Professor Buckley steers the discussion extremely well, interjecting ideas when appropriate but a lot of the time just allowing us to work through readings. Weaknesses: 1. There are pretty much no weaknesses for this course. The one thing I would say is its heavy focus on Western European art\/architecture (specifically Germany) is worth keeping in mind. The course does touch on non-Western themes, but they are often grounded in a Western context (e.g. looking at Egyptian architecture, but through the lens of colonialism).",
    "I loved that the course always met in a different place each week and that we were able to engage with physical objects related to or mentioned in the readings. This was by far the best and most enriching aspect of the class. One weakness was that some of the reading presentations felt a bit monotonous or repetitive.",
    "The weekly class discussions and visits to different on campus archives made this class really special. Ever session was incredibly engaging with good interaction from the whole class.",
    "The readings for this course were very well-selected, and the seminar\/discussion format was ideal for grappling with the (often very abstract) material in a meaningful way. We looked at a wide variety of material from Yale's collections, which presented an opportunity to apply the theory we had learnt to physical objects (without this element the class could very easily have seemed not particularly tangibly relevant). I think the interdisciplinary nature of the course sometimes made it a little confusing - it was sometimes a little unclear what methodology to use when critiquing a given reading or object, and sometimes the readings referenced a lot of other material in their field (for example, other art theory or philosophy) that would not be understandable to someone with no background in the field. This challenge was mostly solved by the weekly reading presentation (where one or two students are responsible for doing some research\/additional thinking on the reading to help the class collectively parse out its meaning), but does mean that there is a fair workload involved in figuring out some of the background information for oneself if one is not already familiar with it.",
    "The reading list is really great, and having to do reading presentations allows you to really dive into three or four readings in a critical way. The course makes really great use of Yale's collections, and it was really helpful to be able to base very theoretical conversations on concrete images.",
    "so great. would be inerested in having one guest speaker to stimulate a discussion",
    "Conceptualization of Space was a very interesting and well-structured class. I liked taking on a different theme\/era of thought each week, and I also really liked the student presentations that happened almost every class."

   "comments": [
    "100%! 1000%! Please please take this course. It was definitely Ione of the best courses I have taken at Yale so far. After every class period I felt so much smarter and the ideas we discussed often would come up in my other architecture\/urban studies courses. This course genuinely felt like it tied a lot of my other learning together under the umbrella of space and allowed me to build a more comprehensive understanding of design. Cannot recommend HSAR 455 enough. The readings will challenge youthey get at some very difficult conceptsbut during class we would parse through them and I always came out not only understanding what I had read but having formulated many new ideas as well. I could go on, but just take the class :)",
    "Absolutely! This is an absolutely fascinating couse if you are willing to put in the effort. The readings can be tough and quite confusing, but if you take the time to dissect them, your in-class discussions will be thoroughly engaging and enriching!",
    "Yes, this class provided a great intellectual setting for exploring pretty abstract thoughts\/readings. Considering that many classes at Yale are about more concrete subjects, this got me in a different headspace which i really enjoyed.",
    "This is the best course I have yet taken at Yale, and I would especially highly recommend it to anyone interested in art history, philosophy, architecture, urbanism, politics or sociology. The class is extremely well organised to encourage students to think deeply and critically while gaining an overview of the major thinking (and thinkers) about space over time.",
    "Yes! It was interesting and fun. I had never taken a more philosophical class before so I felt a little out of my league at the beginning, but by the end I felt comfortable talking about the concepts and exploring theory in my papers.",
    "Yes!! Prof. Buckley clearly contains such a wealth of knowledge on the subject which I think inspired everyone to engage with the workload. The readings were excellent - the weekly themes were cohesive and varied and I appreciated the breadth of academia that we spanned throughout the course. Class discussions were honestly quite fun (!) and I loved going to the YUAG \/ YCBA \/ Beinecke to look at different artifacts to support our discussions.",
    "YES It's a very fun class because we go all over campus and everyone in the class is very smart",
    "Definitely! Conceptualization of Space was so interesting and changed the way that I think about space and about the intersection of philosophy and art. Prof. Buckley is wonderful, and discussions in this seminar were engaging and productive."
