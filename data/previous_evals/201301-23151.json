    "This is a pretty worthless class. You don't really learn anything new, especially if you've just taken thermodynamics. Professor Taylor's video project that he talks about all semester is a complete waste of time and is more appropriate in a middle school classroom than at Yale.",
    "Buy the Geankoplis book. It is so much clearer than the recommended primary textbook - fewer derivations, more example problems.",
    "You probably have no choice as to whether or not you want to take this course. If Professor Taylor is teaching it, I would take it.",
    "Difficulty absolutely depends on who is teaching the course. Can be easy or extremely difficult, try to take it with friends so you have some moral support. If Taylor is teaching there will be an unfortunate video project, which you will have to do and not get much out of."
