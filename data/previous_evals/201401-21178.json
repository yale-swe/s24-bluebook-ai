    "Yes.",
    "Directed Studies: Historical and Political Thought is definitely a challenging course: the workload is formidable, both in terms of readings and papers. That said, I definitely think the effort was worth it. Before having taken this course, I knew shockingly little about political theory etc. Now I find myself able to hold (at least somewhat) educated conversations with my much more politically-minded friends, including sitting on a couch with friends until 3 am discussing what we would imagine to be the ideal city, in our own recreation of Plato's Republic.",
    "Would recommend it highly. I feel I learned a lot.",
    "Second semester deals mainly with political thought, rather than historical thought. However, the syllabus still clearly builds on what we learn in first semester, and a lot of the thinkers we read in class are directly relevant to issues that we are still grappling with today (the nature of democracy, mob mentality, threat of totalitarianism, colonialist attitudes, etc.). I thought the lectures were much better this semester than those of last semester. My seminar was wonderful--Professor Semmel is incredibly nice and approachable, and he led great discussions. He's a history professor, so he was also able to offer us the historical perspective that we would have missed out on otherwise.",
    "Directed Studies History and Politics is so much better second semester. DSers finally get to read political philosophy. Make sure you stick with DS, and if you do, Professor Semmel's section is a great choice! He is approachable and knowledgeable about the subject!",
    "I would highly recommend continuing with Directed Studies in the spring semester. Lit and H&P, in particular, get extremely interesting, and it's lovely to get into the history of political philosophy as opposed to a lot of the histories in the first semester (soft spot though I may have for Herodotus and Thucydides). Semmel in particular is a wonderful instructor. Kind, smart, caring, funny, you'll have a wonderful section, particularly, if your like mine, is a small one. Don't switch out. It's also nice to get a good bit of historical background - Semmel's area is British history, and many of the authors we read are of his time period of expertise."
