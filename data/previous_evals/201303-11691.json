   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course that spans a very wide breadth of material. The material is all very useful if you are at all interested in studying phylogenetics; however, if you are not interested in phylogenetics, I would advise against taking this course as it is extremely fast paced and detailed.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wanted to get a broad overview of phylogenetic practices and concepts. Interesting and useful in my knowledge of biology, however it sometimes was a bit uninteresting.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're very into evolutionary biology, ecology, or really any biological science. Species trees are essential tools to the study of biology and something every aspiring biologist needs to understand. I would, however, recommend that you have some solid background in statistics before taking the class - it would definitely have made learning about the various phylogenetic analyses much easier.",
    "Definitely useful for anyone seriously considering a career in research in any branch of ecology and evolutionary biology."
