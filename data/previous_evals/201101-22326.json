   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to all those interested in media, computer science, design, sociology, futurism, sociology, history, and law.",
    "This was an awesome course, unlike any other in the English department. You learn about the history of new media theory, including the history of the internet as a technology, the history of cyberspace as an idea, and issues about the self in the digital age. The reading load is reasonable, though some of the theory can be a bit dense. Jessica Pressman is a wonderful human being and lecturer. Will make you think differently about the media you encounter on a daily basis. Highly recommended. My only complaint is that the post-structuralist arguments can get a bit repetitive: \"Everything is unstable. Nothing is certain. Question all.\" Not necessarily a flaw of the course; just the message of all the literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is fun, really exciting, and incredibly important in our day and age. It is a nice twist on conventional english courses at Yale.I would summarize it as a an intro to thinking and theorizing how we use and understand new media with a bent towards the literary - how media changes literature and how we can read into the medium of our literature.",
    "Take the class. It will make you look at everything you do online in an intelligent\/critical way, and given that we do more and more things online every day, this is crucial.",
    "Take this class. Take it. Professor Pressman is one of the most brilliant and generous professors on this campus, and in no other class will you be dealing with material more directly relevant or critically important today. She'll make you think hard, but it never felt like a burden.",
    "New Media Theory is one of the best classes I've ever taken. Honestly, we are all being shaped by media, and that idea will really resonate with you by the time you leave. The readings are interesting and really make you think. The syllabus was structured in a way that would help you develop your own thoughts, it was an excellent guide through a new world of ideas that I hadn't known existed.Take this class if you're interested in theorizing the Internet. Read some Marshall McLuhan first. If you think he's interesting, take this class. Even if you think he's full of bs but still interesting, take this class.",
    "The hardest part about this course for non-English majors is accepting that it is a course in theory, and that there may not always be a \"point.\" That said, this course is my favorite that I've taken here and sparked an interest in new media. Pressman is engaging and intelligent- take the course.",
    "If you are interested in new media, internet networks, and the theory behind it then you will definitely love this course. This course is very interdisciplinary and will expand your knowledge of New Media in both depth and breadth.My perceptions of Media after taking this course have completely changed, I definitely recommend it. Take it!",
    "This was a really great way to think about media as more than just a new interdisciplinary subject, but rather as a growing and evolving field that needs to be assessed and examined in real time. I thought I would be learning about the different between books and the internet, but this class was so much more than that. We studied everything from cyberpunk fiction to social\/political racism on the internet to attention span. This class really got me thinking about my life and our society in general, and I loved that it did that within the realms of English\/media studies.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This is a course unlike any other I have taken; the approach is interdisciplinary and the teaching style is varied and never stagnates. This course deserves to fall in the English department; our reading of literature and discussion of theory bases it in English. The content, however, is applicable to all areas. All students would benefit from this course.",
    "Take this. Pressman is awesome, new media is awesome (and if you want to be a good citizen of the 21st century you need to take this class to figure out what the hell new media is!)",
    "This class has a midterm and a final with weekly blog responses so its not too bad work wise. The material is very theoretical but the tests are very doable.",
    "Yes.",
    "Read the course description. Then expect to have your mind blown with AWESOME in every possible direction.",
    "It's a very cool class about the history of how we use media--like computers, phones, books, and everything now. If you're into that stuff, you'd love this."
