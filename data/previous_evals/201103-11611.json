    "Great class. Loved the discussions",
    "Very relaxed senior econ seminar. Two presentations per student plus a final 20 page paper. The presentations entailed making a handout for each student, with graphs, tables, etc., on a topic of the professor's choice regarding some aspect of the financial markets. Final paper on a topic of your choice relating to the US Banking System. Class discussion was minimal: Prof. Perna usually lectured, with student comments interspersed here and there.",
    "I would definitely recommend any econ major going into finance or consulting take this. Like others have said before, it's a great way to keep abreast of news in the banking system and learn a bit too. I found myself really enjoying the readings and the paper was super interesting too.",
    "Best seminar offfered in the economics department.Take it.Just read the Journal every morning and you'll be good for class."
