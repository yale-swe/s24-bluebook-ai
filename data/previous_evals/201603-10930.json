    "This course helped me learn a lot of German. I thought it was a large leap in pace from L1, and initially that was very challenging. We learned many tenses and grammar structures, as well as a lot of about German culture. I learned a lot about myself as a language learner and what I needed to do to get the most out of the course.",
    "A deeper understanding of the German language and culture as well as the development of German speaking.",
    "This course was helpful for improving my spoken German and comfort with conversational talking.",
    "I developed German grammar, comprehension, vocabulary, and writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was very fast-paced and it was hard for me to use the outside resources to help supplement my understanding. However I thought I did learn a lot from this course about both contemporary culture and the language, which I appreciated. The biggest complaint I have is that the final project we must do is a group project, which I think doesn't serve to help language skills and is more a stressor in terms of trying to coordinate schedules between busy people with different levels of engagement.",
    "The course is very intense specially if you are taking other classes or if you are part of a graduate degree. I had very little time to spend on assignments 3 or more times a week, especially when they took more than 2 hours to complete. Also the group assignments can be a bit draining for introverted people, especially when cooperation from the other partner is absent.",
    "It seems like it could be helpful to begin each topic with defined rules\/vocab, etc, instead of just launching into examples. I also do not think the final project was a very effective way to demonstrate our understanding. It was much more work to try and facilitate the video and a lot of that time could maybe be better spent doing actual German. That said the class was for the most part engaging and my teacher was always happy and able to answer questions.",
    "I felt that the textbook was prohibitively expensive and that my experience would have been just as productive if we had had an exclusively physical textbook. The online platform was often aggravating to use and it took more time of master the system than to learn the actual grammar points. I found it very helpful to do grammar exercises in class so that we could go over the logic behind the answers together. I felt that some of our oral exercises were less helpful for me personally."

    "If they are willing to take on the time it takes for the assignment as well as taking the class every day, the learning experience will be like no other. The language will stick fast and you willl be ready to go out and work the language at its place of origin.",
    "Yes, this was a good course to improve my language skills and become more comfortable with speaking German in general.",
    "This class was definitely an effective way to develop my oral and written German skills. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, absolutely!"
