    "Depends on the Capstone project",
    "Maybe. I think it will be much better next time because they went through the trial and error phase with us. The subject is very interesting, so if you're interested in the micro-level projects of cities and economic growth, it should be great. If I could do it again, I think the class would be better because we would all know what was going on and how to approach the class.Strengths: very student-oriented, interested topic (cities and economic growth), got to talk with people from the World Bank.Weaknesses: very student-oriented and thus disorganized. The World Bank could have been better in terms of assigning us cases or projects; we were first told to do something that took up a few weeks in the beginning of the semester, where it wasn't related to what they ultimately wanted. They should stick to one project (say Nigeria or South Africa) and give it to the students at the beginning of the semester so that students don't waste time doing internet research that is not going to be even useful. The parameters that they wanted were also very strange and difficult to tailor to: they gave us five fields (funding, governance, land, infrastructure and skills) and told us to design a project that would foster job creation in a city either in Nigeria or South Africa, which are criteria that were difficult to mesh together. I guess that was the challenge, but it was also a weakness because we couldn't decide which project we were going to do until pretty late into the semester because the topics were so confusing and vague.Again, I think these weaknesses were largely because we were the first class to have done this, and students should not be discouraged from choosing this capstone if they are interested in the subject matter.",
    "don't go for a big name (like the World Bank). Chances are you will do more meaningful work and have a greater impact working for a smaller client. Still, this is a very interesting class; gives you lots of practical skills and insight on how important organizations work.",
    "The course will definitely undergo several changes so this response might be irrelevant. Currently the course does not really fulfill its vision. It suffers from a lack of specificity from the client (ie the World Bank) that started with very vague instructions. Communication with the client was also not as regular as would ideally be desired. However you are exposed to the working mechanism of an international organization such as the World Bank, along with all its pros and cons. Quite a different experience, and in spite of the few glitches, perhaps still worth it on the whole.",
    "Senior capstone projects are pretty unique, so I doubt that the specifics of the class will be relevant to anyone reading this review. Ours was the World Bank capstone on urbanization and economic development. I think that it is somewhat silly to think that ten Yale undergrads can teach the World Bank something new, but overall I think this was an excellent opportunity to feel like a practitioner and do some serious research. We had very little direction from the World Bank, so deciding on what we would focus on took a very long time -- I would suggest that anyone facing a more open-ended capstone in the future think as specific as possible and try to not to save the world in one master stroke, as some of us did in the beginning. Personally, I ended up working on a project that was interesting, but not something I truly cared about, and this lack of freedom is probably my largest disappointment about the capstone project. The class was not that easy in the sense that the pressure to add value to the client is pretty immense, so I found myself putting a lot of time into my project and constantly researching and thinking about it.Wallace was also a great professor. He gave us awesome direction despite working outside of his field, and kept things light-hearted and fun when we didn't know what exactly we were doing. I would love to take another class with him.",
    "The way it stands, this course is a disaster. I still can't believe this course was the equivalent of a Senior Thesis. If you're a Global Affairs major, you will probably have to take it; I just hope that by the time you do the Jackson Institute has made major improvement in terms of structure and increased communication on all levels to make this course better."
