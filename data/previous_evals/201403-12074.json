    "A good course for anyone interested in 19th century Russian lit, the reading list is great. We didn't do a log of the big novels (just Crime & Punishment), so I wouldn't worry too much about workload, since Prof Brunson does a great job of mixing long and short texts. Professor Brunson knows her stuff and was very competent as an instructor, but I didn't always exactly feel that class discussions added much to the texts.",
    "This is a great introduction to Russian Lit. Professor Brunson is really EXTREMELY knowledgable, really incredibly nice, always approachable (she really made herself very available via office hours, meetings after class). She really was very diligent about commenting on essays. Overall, I had a great experience with Prof. Brunson. She deserves a lot of credit for how effortlessly, effectively, and enthusiastically she ran the class. One of the nicest professors I've had at Yale. And she really knows her stuff, is a good critical reader of essays, and knows how to lead class discussion. The texts: Mostly pretty engaging, some are a bit of a bore. Crime and Punishment, and Fathers and Sons, and Gogol are the highlights for most people, I would say. Some of the early stuff is a little boring, but all very important for understanding the trajectory of the course. Brunson does a good job of contextualizing each work. I would say take this class!!!",
    "This course gives you the chance to explore a great selection of Russian literature in a low-key seminar setting. While a lot of professors tend to monopolize conversation in their seminars, Professor Brunson does a great job of letting students drive the conversation, while she guides it with questions to keep it interesting and on track. Even if you generally don't like speaking in class she makes it easy and minimally intimidating to do so.",
    "I recommend it. It's a seminar survey of 19th century Russian literature, so there's a range of authors, and you will probably like some more than others, but most are good. Prof. Brunson knows her stuff and runs a good discussion and is very devoted to the class. Don't be intimidated by the fact that it's Russian literature the reading is doable.",
    "Masterpieces is a great introduction to Russian literature. You don't need to have a background in Russian lit, just a desire to read some of the best works! Professor Brunson is great and very understanding about deadlines\/needing to catch up on readings. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "A wonderful seminar with amazing books and a great professor. Russian literature is captivating, and one of the biggest treats of this class is being able to watch the development of Russia's literary tradition from beginning to end. I appreciated Tolstoy's and Dostoevsky's works so much more when I realized that they had so little of a tradition to build upon. I highly recommend \"Masterpieces of Russian Literature\" to former students. The texts we read, from Pushkin to Gogol to Chekhov, are so remarkably evocative that our discussions were incredibly vibrant. Professor Brunson did a great job at the helm. She is so excited and knowledgeable about the books we read, and she always came so well-prepared for class. She is a fair grader and really helped me with my writing, offering some very good criticisms that other professors have glossed over in the past. Definitely take it!",
    "It's a whirlwind tour of 19th-century Russian literary milieu. The focus of the course is close reading: historical and political contexts, while important in the seminar, are less important than explication. I call it a \"tour\" because each assigned text is discussed for a meeting (or three, perhaps, for the longest works). Someone who takes this class might not learn about the significance (if any) of Achilles's attempt to stop Svidrigailov from going to America, but he will learn about how the \"Greatest Hit\" Russian authors built on each other's works. I recommend the course: the literature is great, and the approach is fitting for an introductory course.",
    "RUSS 250 is one of the best courses you can take at Yale. Professor Brunson is BRILLIANT, fun, engaging, and a reasonable yet thought-provoking and challenging grader. Your writing and reading skills will improve from this class, but mostly you'll come out with a deep love and appreciation for the genre of 19th century Russian literature. You will learn the political and cultural context surrounding some of the world's finest and most fascinating works of literature, and you'll walk out of class discussions wanting to think about them for hours on end every day. I will be thinking about this class for the rest of my life. DO NOT miss a chance to take this, especially if you've ever found Russian literature appealing or interesting at any point in your life--but really ever educated person should know this stuff and you don't want to miss learning about these incredible works from such an amazing professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is interested in a general introduction to Russian Literature"
