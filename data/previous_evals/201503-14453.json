    "Math 683 is a study of the recent (i.e. post WWII) efforts to use category theory to studying representations. Zuckerman does a very good job motivating the material and if you keep up by reading the mentioned papers outside of class it is more than accessible. A good class that taught me a lot, and if you have any desire to learn some category theory or representation theory I would highly suggest taking."
