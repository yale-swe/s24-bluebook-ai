    "This class helped me learn how to analyze ethnographies and work by famous theorists. The reading was difficult at first, but over time I developed the skills needed to properly analyze these texts.",
    "I really learned how to connect theoretical frameworks to empirical examples and that is a skill I will keep with me!",
    "I learned so much about how to read, understand and engage with theoretical texts and how to look at ethnographies and relate them to theoretical arguments. As far as content, I came in knowing virtually nothing about linguistic anthropology and now I definitely feel like I can start to discuss and form arguments about different theories and phenomenon in linguistic anthropology, specifically how they relate to South Asian contexts."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - catered to students' interests and had a good variety on the reading list! Weakness - I wish we focused on topics for more than a week! Also, a little more discussion\/guidance on the theorists would have been helpful.",
    "The strengths of the course are that the readings for the most part are very interesting and provide good foundations for class discussions. The writing assignments are fair and interesting, and class itself is very engaging and structured to very much be a discussion between students and is based off initial thoughts and questions, which was very conducive to learning and growth. Feedback in the course was also phenomenal and helped me grow arguments and thinking process a lot. A weakness was that sometimes the readings were very long and got a lot for one week's time."
