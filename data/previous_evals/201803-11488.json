    "I gained a better understanding of how to write a psychology research paper. While I had come into the class with probably decent research paper writing skills, this class has made me look deeper into the complexities of my logical arguments. Furthermore, I have become more adept at discerning what information is necessary for my paper and what information is not.",
    "Awesome class! I really learned about the principles and methods that psychology researchers have in mind during their work. I gained the skills that I need to do psychology research in the future, and I even got to run my own experiment. Awesome class!",
    "As it said it would, this course taught you how to design experiments and how to write publishable level papers. Whether or not we got there in the course of one semester, this class certainly helped me understand the standards for academic psychology research.",
    "I practiced collecting and analyzing data.",
    "how to write research papers in preparation for publication, how to formulate hypotheses, how to make lab discussions",
    "I learned all about how to actually perform a psychology experiment",
    "How to design, implement, and write up psychological research."

   "comments": [
    "Although the group project and individual project papers were extremely helpful assignments in terms of developing my research method skills, I felt that the textbook readings were not as helpful. The design critiques were helpful but having three of them made things feel very repetitive and also took time away from our individual project papers. I wish that more time were spent on the papers (especially the individual project paper, as it was the most intensive assignment of the course and required a lot of extra help) than on the textbook materials\/design critiques.",
    "This course was incredible! I am very thankful that the final exam was done by the midterm and that we had the group project with the option for revisions as our first attempt at writing a psychology research paper before we being asked to try this skill on our own with our individual project papers. I have also saved all the instructional handouts were were given during this course. I will definitely looking back on the guidelines and criteria for writing these papers when I write my senior thesis.",
    "I loved the individual project and felt that it was really interesting and good practice for research. I also liked all the detailed feedback we received on our group and individual projects. At times I felt that some of the busywork homework assignments in the first half of the course were excessive.",
    "preface: i am salty the psych department did not make a course available for the research requirement that wasn't neuro and that wasn't writing intensive. the lack of flexibility in the department is unacceptable other preface: i doubt the teachers have much control over the structure of the class so these critiques aren't on them directly weaknesses: - why on earth is there a need to do a reading quiz before every class? are we 12? sometimes reading would take several hours. at first i thought it would just be a simple questions but the quiz questions required really close reading. the book was super dummed down but questions would be like \"which website is best for doing x type of research?\" and it would be multiple choice of 4 sites like what the actual heck was that - i learned much in this class but it was unforgiving for a while. the standards for papers are the same you'd use in publication. this is a class designed for early in a psych major's career before they do any research or professional writing. i feel like there was no grace for people from different backgrounds. those of my classmates who had research backgrounds still struggled with the unreasonably high standards for this class - ok back to the book. it was absolutely useless. - this class legitimately made me rethink if i want to pursue a phd in psych. i think i probably won't after this class. not being dramatic just being realistic--it made me realize this is what the psych research world is and i don't want any part of it. so maybe that's a strength is this class' honesty to the field. - profs gave great thorough feedback but i was always under the impression nothing i could ever do was enough. if i got this thing perfect well there's something else i forgot. i feel like they tried to see things that went awry more than places we succeeded. i would've preferred if they kept themselves to the mindset that this class is a learning opportunity and exposure more than it is prepping for publication. - no absences allowed. not even one. with a class like this ya need a break - homework was worth a single point when quizzes on the BS book were worth 10 a pop - lucky i had a stats background but i feel like it would've been tough without one, even tho they don't have a prereq for it - having things due at 11pm is absurd. just give us the night. what kinda college student starts work by 11 strengths - really good feedback from prof & tf. i feel like they took the time to be thorough and always made themselves available. they really tried their best with a horribly-designed course. - lectures were fine - group collaboration was nice and made me feel like the class was one big happy lab family - i liked the student to teacher ratio - ya moral of the story: stay away from this class if u can. and @ psyc dept change ur ways bc this was truly some of your worst work",
    "I loved this course. I loved how it was small in size and we were able to ask questions.",
    "It was well organized to facilitate student learning. Comments from the TF and instructor were very detailed and helpful. At times it felt like being handheld, but I overall really appreciated how thorough the course was."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student only if they were really struggling with research paper writing skills. Otherwise, it is helpful, but not helpful enough to spend an entire semester on.",
    "Awesome class! Especially with Professor Johnston, who's a great teacher and really breaks things down in such a way that anybody could understand it.",
    "Only if you are a psychology major. I completely understand why this course is required for all psych majors. Is it essential! To gain similar but not as in depth insights I would recommend taking the Statistics Course offered by the psychology department instead.",
    "not if you have a choice but you probably don't. read strengths\/weaknesses for a thorough dissection of my reasoning. this was probably my least favorite psych class i've ever taken and a constant source of stress and anxiety when it was absolutely unnecessary.",
    "Yes! I had never learned the logistics involved with Psychology experiments, nor the definitions of internal validity etc.",
    "If you plan on conducting psychology research, I would highly recommend this course. Also, getting to design and implement our own studies was exciting."
