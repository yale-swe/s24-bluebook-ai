The class was interesting and informative as well as practical in building skills for real-world application.",
    "How to better work in teams and with clients, how to work with limited datasets, and how to better visualize data in Arcgis",
    "Learned a lot about how NRDC, the client, operates, what kind of issues they work on, and how they work on them. Guest speakers in the seminar were interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Aligned well.",
    "Fairly. I learned less about environmental advocacy, and more so applied existing skills to an environmental advocacy effort.",
    "As a law student, I had expectations for a clinic course that were much different than what the EPC embodies. EPC applies a much greater hands-off approach than my previous clinic experiences, and I am not sure that is a good approach. Greater oversight and better student assignment for certain projects should be incorporated into the process.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a lot of the improvements I might suggest are going to be implemented next semester, but I've listed some of them here: a more tailored group of potential projects, peer reviews partway through the semester, and maybe more frequent check-ins with supervisors.",
    "I think some of my proposed improvements are already underway for Spring 2019, such as more integration of forestry and law students. I thought another weakness was the faculty advising. Our group meetings with our faculty advisors ended up being essentially time wasted. It was one thing that our advisor was not particularly knowledgeable about our topic, but moreover didn't review our deliverables before our meetings or really offer any tangible guidance at all over the semester.",
    "The course offers great projects and clients with whom to work for a semester. It could be improved by greater oversight during the student assignment process and throughout the semester to ensure projects are meeting their targets. I also think seminar could be structured a bit differently to encourage greater student involvement and more meetings among groups and with supervisors.",
    "Breadth of projects was excellent but there were serious issues with the level of commitment in our group that could have been mitigated by a formalized mid-semester peer evaluation\/check-in."

   "comments": [
    "Communicate clearly and often with your client, even if it seems unnecessary. Communicate clearly and often with your team; it is never unnecessary.",
    "Take this course only if there is a project that really excites you - both in terms of topic and proposed scope of work. You will learn a lot about a specific topic, which can be very rewarding if it aligns with your objectives.",
    "Be sure to keep up with your work throughout the semester, including updating your clinic hours. Without doing so, it is easy to derail projects or cause issues among group members.",
    "Don't work in a group with your friends or close colleagues unless you trust them to pull their weight throughout the semester.",
    "Choose a clearly defined project"
