    "It's an intimidating, challenging, humbling and incredible course. Shelly will force you to state and defend your own moral positions, push you more than pretty much any other professor on this campus, and be brutally honest with some of his feedback. But he'll provide you with enough feedback (often more than twice what you write) and guidance to help you meet his expectations. Few professors can match his dedication to his students. You'll leave this course with, in addition to a solid grounding in normative ethics, a much better skill for understanding, making and responding to arguments. Don't miss this opportunity to learn from one of the most accomplished philosophers, teachers and people on this campus.",
    "Don't be afraid of the grading rumors\/ first day grading speech: the bottom line with this class is that if you do good work on the papers, you will get good grades. If not, Shelly will give you a D. That said, this was easily my favorite class that I've taken so far at Yale. Definitely take it if you can get in. Also if you're a sophomore EP&E major, definitely try to take this your sophomore year- it's an amazing way to fill the ethics requirement (if you qualify to take the class, etc.)",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in moral philosophy. Shelly is a great teacher and will really improve your ability to come up with and express your own ideas. The grading is hard but fair, just not inflated like in most other classes.",
    "Take this class at your own risk. You will spend the majority of the semester in terror of actually failing. Of course, you will also learn a lot, and your philosophy writing skills will improve significantly if you pay attention to Shelly's extensive feedback. The quality of actual class time depends in large part on the other students in the class and how well they get along together.",
    "Really, really good course, mostly down to Shelly Kagan, who's one of if not the best teachers I've had in four years at Yale. His quality of teaching is fairly unusual, I have to say, for a scholar with his kind of name level, at least in a seminar context. He just puts so much into his students. He wants to hear what you have to say -- he stays after class to talk to students for long post-class discussions. And he'll take your comments and really work to understand the kind of position you're putting forward, in a deeply charitable manner, but also one that's committed to actually figuring out what's right and what's wrong. He's very frank, but in such a constructive and cooperative sort of sense. \"Is this what you're saying? Because I'm not sure if I fully understood. If it's this, then I don't think that holds. But you might be getting at something else.\" That sort of working through. He makes tons of time to work with every student who would like in advance of paper deadlines -- like spending a whole day fielding students. It's all from a place of such genuine embrace of and commitment to the learning process that we as students are experiencing. And he doesn't even see this as a process for teaching him new perspectives on philosophy! As he says in the first class, he's not going to pretend like we're teaching him things -- he's a professional philosopher, he's read thousands of papers by people who are also professional philosophers. But he still commits to the experience of teaching itself. Shelly's also an actually substantive grader. So he gives F's for things that don't cut it, every year. And he gives out only a few A's, though not in any dogmatic sense -- he's just giving out A's for things that are truly excellent. I was able to Cr\/D the class, which can be useful in this context.",
    "Take this if you have to, and take it credit d",
    "Take it!!!!!",
    "There probably is not much about this course I can add that you don't know already. Do know, however, that 20-some people in a seminar all trying to speak at once can be quite frustrating, and the early sessions may be difficult until your class has gotten into a groove of how to interact.",
    "Take this class if you are willing to do the work; I personally gained a lot from it, and have incrementally changed my thinking process.",
    "Take this class C\/D\/F at least at the beginning. Prof. Kagan grades hard and that's something you need to accept coming in. If you take this class-- come to class with things to talk about. Otherwise your fellow students will set the agenda and sometimes that's just not a good thing. Prof. Kagan chooses his students by the somewhat silly measurements of seniority and major, so don't expect anything too great from your fellow students. Overall, definitely recommended for philosophy students interested in figuring out what kind of \"ologist\" they are. If that's not what you're here for...don't expect to resolve ethical issues or even really get a chance to think about real-life things because you spend the whole class testing your intuitions about weird cases that will never exist. But seriously that's sometimes instructive and fun so I don't mean to sound too down on it. (PS I'm a senior phil major who came in not all that excited about ethics but kinda felt lame about not being excited about ethics.)"
