    "I mostly learned about Optimality Theory, in its classic form and its many daughters as proposed by various linguistic theories. The first half of the course taught me how to apply OT to problem sets, while the second half taught me how to apply it to data in general."

   "comments": [
    "I learned SO much about the different types of OT and I think it was really useful to get really deep into this widely-used theory in phonology. The main weakness is that the final paper seems to be too much of a jump from what we learn in the course. The paper is supposed to be at a level that it could hypothetically be \"published in the proceedings of a respectable linguistics conference\", which I think is quite hard to do, at least for the undergrads, given the information we learn in the course. However, I do like how it pushed me to apply OT to a topic I was interested and come up with a paper that I am proud of, whether or not I think it ended up reaching the goal the professor desired.",

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to students considering phonology for their depth requirement, or to students who really liked Phonology I, especially if you liked the last couple weeks of the course. You'll learn so much about phonology that will change the way you think about linguistics; my mind was blown on a regular basis because of the cool things we learned in this class. It got me interested in a lot of the papers we learned and has me wanting to read more. Truly a wonderful course.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course. Phonology is awesome and optimality theory is extremely fun."
