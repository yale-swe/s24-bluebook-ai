    "I would completely recommend the course because the material is clear and to the point. Although a lot of students are vietnamese speakers, everyone starts off on similar grounds in reading and writing.",
    "Take Vietnamese it's a fun class and as long as you put in effort you will be rewarded.",
    "Excellent class. Take it for the small class size, the personal attention, and the activities that really help you build your language skills.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you are interested in learning Vietnamese. Professor Quang is really nice and you become pretty good friends with everyone in the class since its pretty small."
