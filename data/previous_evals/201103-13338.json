   "comments": [
    "This English 114 course -- Monsters with Professor Hurley -- provided me a very exciting entry into the world of English at Yale! I thought we'd be reading Dracula, Frankenstein, etc., and was excited to do so, but was even more intrigued by what the course actually turned into. It provides a different perspective on life through the lens of monster culture; it goes much farther than discussing the general idea of a monster in literature or film. It's one of the most interesting topics, hands down!On top of that, the writing process in this class is very well-structured. You will never turn in a paper, never see it again, and get a grade. The class is centered on revisions, open discussion with classmates of your ideas, and improving your writing.",
    "The course is tons of fun and a great way to learn how to write a college-level paper. Don't expect Hollywood monsters -- this class goes far deeper than that. You'll tackle monstrosity in ways you never considered, and you'll be glad you did. I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend English 114 to another student, especially a freshman or one who didn't have much experience with writing. It really lays the foundation for writing academic papers and will help you to excel in all other courses that involve writing.",
    "As a science major I was dreading having to take a writing class, but after this class I realized how fun writing courses can be. I recommend it to everyone. This class taught me so much about different cultures and society in general, and it really opened my mind to examining society as a whole.",
    "I loved the theme 'Monsters.' I feel like I learned so much about writing and my essays improved tremendously. It was a wonderful class set up and I completely recommend it!",
    "Use the writing centers because they can drastically improve your writing.",
    "Yes, I believe it is one of the best English 114 classes offered with a great interesting theme with a great professor.",
    "I would highly recommend English 114 17 for other students. It is a great way to improve one's writing skills while also studying an interesting topic from an unexpected point of view. English 114 can be a lot of work, but if one stays on top of all the assignments, it is manageable. Professor Hurley picks out interesting topics for discussions and readings."
