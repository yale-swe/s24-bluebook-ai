    "I doubt John will be teaching it, but if you like Plato and want to improve your prose reading skills, go ahead and take it.",
    "Unlikely to be offered again. But if you are game for a semester of wondering poteron \u00ea ou didakton estin aret\u00ea, then this is\/was the course for you. Also: a fine bridge course between L4 and L5 Greek.",
    "Yes, it's a great course.",
    "I would recommend it. For every class the assignment was to translate a section of Plato and then we went over our translations, went over the grammar if there were problems, and then discussed it in a larger context.",
    "This was the fist class in Ancient Greek I took in a long time and not only was it a great class but it proved to be a good way to ease back into Ancient Greek. The text itself is interesting and relatively manageable in terms of vocabulary and it was well taught. I would suggest it strongly."
