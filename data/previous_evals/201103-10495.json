   "comments": [
    "It's a fine introduction to clinical and bioinformatics. However, if you have taken a bioinformatics class previously, say, on microarrays, half the class will be nothing new.",
    "only if they change TA",
    "This was a very informative class. I would certainly recommend it to anyone in Bioinformatics and suggest it as continuing education for clinicians. The TA made a special effort to include supplemental programming assignments that challenged students and provided opportunities for applying theory. He was also held extra sessions to assist with HW assignments.",
    "I would recommend the course, but you need to be comfortable with programming in R. The programming assignments are quite long and tedious.",
    "Yes, I would recommend CBB740 to another student interested in translational research and interested in knowing how clinical development might aid in translational research. THis course gives a very good introduction that serves to interface the 2 fields.",
    "I really enjoyed CB&B 740! It was well-structured and I felt like I learned so many new things each class.",
    "yes. an helpful introductory course",
    "I would summarize the course as a survey of clinical standards and some bioinformatics topics. In its current state, I probably would not recommend it. If each portion of the course were given more attention, as separate courses, I would likely recommend them (depending upon the audience).",
    "As the course currently stands, I would not recommend it. I did enjoy the homework assignments and felt they were quite invaluable, but none of the lectures contributed to the most useful portion of the class."

   "comments": [
    "It is a good introductory course, though I do not think it should be a requirement for a CBB student...unless it could substitute for another requirement.",
    "It somehow has some effect, but using way more time than it should.",
    "A lot of homework.",
    "This course expanded my knowledge in the discipline of bioinformatics and should prove helpful to future research.",
    "It provided me with a better understanding of clinical informatics, which was a topic that I was most interested in.",
    "It definitely did deepen my knowledge of what I perceive in translational and clinical research and how both fields complement each other and also the underlying complexities in both areas - where translational is more technical, the clinical side can get 'softer' when there are patients (and their families) involved.",
    "I feel that the homework assignments were the main part of the class that positively affected my research. The methods we used are widely used for analyzing gene expression data, which I had never done before. However, I still feel I have a rudimentary understanding of the theory behind all of the methods, so the usefulness is limited."
