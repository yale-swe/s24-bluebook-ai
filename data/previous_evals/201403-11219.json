    "Yes - it's essential for this material to be mastered in order to leave a skilled graduate student. Plan to spend a great deal of time on the course.",

    "Yes, I think this course was invaluable and I think it would be beneficial to students in other areas of psychology as well.",

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me think more clearly and critically about research design, so it is relevant to virtually every domain of my discipline and research.",
    "This course has greatly enhanced my understanding of and appreciation for research, as well as for clinical work and academia more broadly.",
    "This course greatly aided in my ability to draw conclusions from studies, both mine and of others, as previously I was somewhat of an uninformed consumer of research. I just wish there was a sequel to this course or opportunity to further check our mastery of this material in the future."
