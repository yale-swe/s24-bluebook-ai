   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended, but with reservations. I highly recommend this course because it is interesting, well taught, and an excellent introduction to antitrust law. It is also a terrific opportunity to apply theory to reality - one of the only times in which the economic theory of the econ core curriculum is used to analyze real-world business scenarios.My reservations stem from the difficulty of the course. The assignments are not difficult, but the reading is laborious. An average of 100 pages or so in a mammoth casebook, none of which is easy to read. It took me about 10 hours a week to get through it. And the material is extraordinarily difficult to comprehend well, for a couple reasons. First, there is a TON of it. Reading Supreme Court opinion after opinion, it can be easy to lose your way. Second, it is conceptually difficult to a degree I have not experienced in the econ department. This course requires the integration of standard economic theory with fairly complex legal frameworks: not an easy thing to do, and conceptually difficult to wrap one's mind around.",
    "Economics 453 is a lot of reading, but it is also the best econ class I have ever taken! It is so interesting and you learn so much over the course of the semester. Especially if you are considering law school, take it!",
    "Take the course. To get the most out of it, be prepared to invest ~10 hours\/week in the reading and homework (and, when possible, doing extra reading.) This is a subject into which you can dive and apply many aspects of the economic coursework you've taken up to this point. Game theory, microeconomics and theories of cost&competition all play a role. Really an interesting course, and a good entry point into law.",
    "There is a lot more reading and writing than for any other Economics class. However, I believe it's worth it as antitrust is an incredibly interesting field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There's a lot of reading involved but it pushes you to think critically. You'll learn a lot about the law in an economic context and come out with a thorough understanding of the Sherman Act.",
    "I would recommend this course highly if you know that you are interested in delving deeply into antitrust law and antitrust cases. It is an intensive course, however, so be sure that this is material that you are fascinated by. If it is, you will get a lot out of the class, and will learn a great deal from Professor Klevorick, who is incredibly knowledgeable in this subject area. If it isn't, you will have difficulty keeping up, as there is a significant workload in this course."
