    "I applied my analytical skills to resources I would not have otherwise had access to, isolating and delving into historiographical trends. I learned history, but in effect, I learned how to read history critically to extract useful information to develop hypotheses about the past.",
    "This was my first class under the classical civilization category and it was very interesting. I enjoyed learning about the beginning of written history and how it was carried on through the common era.",
    "A deeper understanding of the development of the field of history and just how subjective any individual historian may be. Also the diversity of genres that may be considered history",
    "This course helped me think more critically about history as a genre. Despite the fact that I'm a senior history major, I had never reflected on the origins of history as a discipline.",
    "I learned a wide survey of knowledge regarding historiographical methods in ancient history.",
    "This class is amazing at helping you learn how do dig deeper into texts and putting them into context in the grand scheme of history."

   "comments": [
    "The class had very interesting and engaging lectures, but they often ran a little long.",
    "The class was very interesting. The lectures were engaging and enjoyable, however sometimes Professor Johnston ran out of time, so the lecture would have to be finished in the next class. This was fine but sometimes put us slightly behind schedule so some of the classes felt slightly rushed.",
    "The course is well-designed, thorough, and engaging. The one small alteration I would make is to have slighltly less material overall; we frequently ran over from class to class and had to skim over a few sections to cover all the material.",
    "This class was fantastic. I recommend it as one of the best at Yale, with one or two small precautions. The course material covers historians and their methods of writing histories, from Herodotus and Homer up to the Christian era, and Professor Johnston really guides the narrative amazingly well in his lectures and keeps the often very disparate readings cohesive and relatable. Unlike most other history classes at Yale, this class really dives into theories about what it means to write history, what the genre of history looks like, and how specific historians have thought about these questions. The course readings can be dense and lengthy at times, however; and I would thus strongly caution against anyone taking this course without at least some basic, preliminary knowledge of Greek, Roman, and Early Christian Histories. In order to get the most out of this class, I think someone needs to have already taken Roman Republic and Empire, as well as maybe something like Origins of Western Civ. Without these foundations, this class could be daunting. In a similar fashion, Johnstons lectures are crammed with information and it can feel overwhelming at times in the amount of things to keep in mind. Still, given that the grade comes from a midterm, two essays and participation, this doesnt need to be a problem - find something you were interested in and go more in depth there. Overall, this is a highly recommended course for any history major, and should be mandatory for all Classics Majors and those focusing on Antiquity. Even those outside of the field of history will on the whole find this very enjoyable, engaging, and informative.",
    "I feel like sometimes we could have gone a little more in depth in lectures. If we spent more time on a specific topic, we might have been able to get a little more out of it."

    "Absolutely would recommend. Prof. Johnston is so knowledgeable about the subject, and he's an incredible lecturer. He's insanely helpful when it comes to analyzing class readings and planning for papers, and he's truly passionate. Lectures often ran a bit overtime, but they were always worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is very interesting to learn about the beginning of history. The material is captivating and the lectures are enjoyable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Any student interested in history or any related field should consider taking this class. It will completely change the way you view history, while also giving a basic survey of classical history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It presents an entirely novel way of conceptualizing and understanding history, and it's worth taking for both history majors and non-history majors.",
    "Amazing class. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in anything history related, or even if you need a solid writing credit. Professor Johnston is an incredible lecturer: engaging, tremendous knowledge of antiquity, and just an all around great guy. Style was mostly lecture, although he would occasionally ask questions to the class and let students give their opinion. Take it!",
    "Yes, heartily recommend!",
    "Prof. Johnston is an excellent teacher, and the material is very interesting."
