    "You get from this class what you take from it. The lectures are long and can be dry (it is a class about law), but if you pay attention, you really learn a great deal. I think the things I learned from this class will continue to sink in and become more relevant and clear as time goes on. I've already learned so much, but not at a superficial level - it's so valuable to understand the theory, history and complex workings of laws. The information I learned was not simply memorized details - it was practical application and awareness of law.",
    "Professor Robinson is an extremely kind professor and really created an open atmosphere to create dialogue and engaged with students inside and outside of class. I only wish we had little assignments in between as opposed to a massive 20 page single spaced paper due at the end. Although I felt like I understood the material during Professor Robinson's lectures, because I had never taken a law course, I felt a little lost when it came to approaching the final paper, as I did not have a very good idea of the expectations. If we had small assignments prior, I would have a better idea as to how I should be reading and interpreting the texts that were assigned, as well as experience applying the knowledge we learned in class in a format suitable for law studies."

    "Clear, and proper paced for students with no background in Law.",
    "Help me have a clear idea about the history and development of international environmental law.",
    "The final exam is a great way to merge everything you learn. It's challenging, though. You need to take good notes and pay attention as best you can during class.",
    "Really interesting and really important material to know.",
    "I liked that there were not 'busy work' assignments throughout the semester but rather one comprehensive final.",
    "This course provided solid knowledge of the history of international environmental law, examining its evolution from the very beginning. The professor speaks clearly and transmits his knowledge in an organized manner.",
    "It provides a good introduction to international environmental law and how negotiation is conducted at the international level. It also provides insights to all the key environmental issues that had or are being discussed globally.",
    "I absolutely love how Prof Robinson begins each class with a timeline of the particular issue and all the laws, treaties, regulations and cases that happened around that issue through time, while relating it to pivotal events in law and society in general. That was such a powerful learning tool and framework to understand the concepts. Anecdotal explanations, where relevant, were also wonderful, and really helped develop the understanding of the issues."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Too Theoretical. There were way few references to real life situations, or cases, or actual implementation, or usage of law. We only talked about formation or negotiation of law and treaties; but not about implementation of those laws and treaties. It would be better if this was a little case based course, that in first 1.5 hours we talked about history and how the laws came into place - and good and bad things about those laws. - And in second half, we analyzed some real life case in which one particular law or treaty was used.",
    "It might be nice to have recordings of the classes, so students can re-listen to the lecture and student comments.",
    "I wish the final exam paper had been given out just a little earlier, it was really time-intensive and an extra week would have let me balance it with my other work better.",
    "Lectures are long and it can be hard to pay attention for lecture for 3 hours straight - maybe more class-wide discussion would improve this.",
    "Weekly classes are too long. It would be better to have two classes a week for a shorter period of time to avoid de-concentration. Furthermore, the course is a little dry- more interaction needs to be promoted in class, and I think case studies, especially topical ones, would be extremely useful. Furthermore, apart from the readings, there is no other homework or monitoring of students' progress and I think this should be changed in order to motivate students to keep track and not fall behind. Lastly, the entire grade of the class is based on one final exam essay, and I think if we had weekly assignments or other methods of evaluation, those should influence the final grade.",
    "Perhaps my lack of an education in law set me back in understanding some of the technical terms used in class. It would be helpful if the lecturer could provide an explanation of the various law jargon at the beginning of the term to help bridge the gap for students without a background in law."
