    "It was definitely one of my favourite classes that I've ever taken and I'd go through the pain of first semester orgo again just to take this class with this professor.",
    "Hard class with little satisfaction, but you probably have to take it so you might as well take this one instead of a class with Ziegler. Going out of your way to meet with Professor Phillips will help you in this course - he's willing to help and a credit to Yale College - but don't expect anything from the TAs",
    "With Phillips? Definitely.This was the only class this semester that I was genuinely sad to leave (and I took some wonderful, wonderful courses), even after I spent the past semester despising orgo 1. I think I can speak for the whole class when I say that we're all his groupies now. Phillips is surprisingly funny, an exceedingly nice person, and a wonderful teacher. Stressing out for the first part of this class is pretty ubiquitous, but halfway through the semester, everything clicks and orgo gets much, much easier. Phillips is against rote memorization--open note tests and one of them is take-home. Instead, you really get a sense of how the electrons move, and you come out of it much better at a new way of thinking. And his tying everything into biomolecules made the course so much more relevant and interesting. You do have to write a paper (for orgo. actually.) but it's not too bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHEM 230 to another student! It was one of my favorite classes here at Yale. Although this course departs from the traditional Orgo II class, it covers almost the same material but introduces mechanisms and themes in a biological context.Professor Phillips wins the award for being my favorite professor this semester. His lectures are engaging and keep you awake! He's a genuinely nice person and has a knack for explaining organic chemistry.The workload is typical of most science classes at Yale. There is one problem set per week, and there are three midterms and a paper. If you put forth the work, you will get the grade you deserve.",
    "Take this class with Andy Phillips. The grade is three midterms (lowest one dropped), problem sets (take about 2 hours each), an easy paper (just 4 pages!) and a final. The class got easier and easier as it went on. Compared to first semester with Ziegler, this is paradise. He has no problem with giving out a prodigious number of As, and his lectures are generally entertaining as well. Orgo is never fun but this is about as good as it can get.",
    "Yes, if you have to take organic chemistry (which is actually very interesting and much, much better than general chemistry). This class is WORLDS better than regular orgo II.",
    "This class was the best science course I've taken at Yale so far. The professor is fantastic and is really open to working with you both during class discussions and outside of lecture. I would caution Chemistry majors because the course work is really medicine and biology-oriented (a lot of Pre-Med students), but if you're looking for a Pre-Med Chem requirement, this is definitely the one.",
    "This class was a great way to follow orgo I. After all the seemingly useless memorizing and recitation that defined first semester, the style and focus of this class proved a welcome breath of fresh air. The open note exam format really proved wonderful for making the learning more aboutconcepts, patterns, and creatively applying them than about purely memorizing a list of reactants and products.The paper was a great addition to the class, both to mix up the style of work and to allow you to really hone in on a particular compound to fully understand the relevance of the material we had been learning.Andy Philips was a fabulous professor. He seems to really understand students well, and formatted the class in such a way that the work load was entirely manageable. Even though we did not cover as much material as was his original ambition, I still felt the class never dragged, and at the end of the semester can honestly say that I learned about as much as I think could be reasonably be expected -- all relatively painlessly!",
    "I definitely recommend this class because it really brings about the beauty of Organic Chemistry and how it applies to medicine and biology.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Although the topic can be dry, Phillips is incredible and makes it fun\/interesting to go to class. It's more relevant than first semester orgo because, especially for premeds and bio majors, it puts chemistry in a biological perspective. I honestly looked forward to going to class every day. Also, a lot less work\/less difficult than first semester orgo.",
    "If you're taking this course, you're likely pre-med or else in a major that requires taking it...in any case, this class was great if you are like me and actually find organic chemistry interesting. Professor Phillips is new, but he handled the course very well and made orgo wayless painful than it can be.",
    "I would definitely, undoubtedly recommend CHEM 230 with Professor Phillips as a second semester orgo class. Professor Phillips is incredibly dedicated to his students, and he made biologically relevant organic chemistry a very interesting topic. One of the highlights of the class was writing a paper on a specific drug, as strange as that sounds in a chem class. Overall, I was really glad that I took second semester orgo with Professor Phillips, and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.",
    "It was a very interesting class, highly recommended for Orgo II takers. You should be very fluent in Orgo I before taking this class, because he doesn't spend time on the basics - he moves very quickly into applications, and you're expected to understand how the underlying chemistry works.",
    "YES!!!! If you have the chance to take Orgo 2 with Andrew Philips DO IT!!! This semester was super chill. All the exams were open note and open internet, and the class was curved to a B+\/A-. Also, you learn the organic chemistry behind biological processes such as Lipid Metabolism, glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and amino acid metabolism, which is extremely helpful for pre-meds.",
    "Yes, it was a very good course.",
    "This was such a great course!!! I loved learning the mechanisms of biochemistry, and I wish there was a second semester of this so we would have more time to go into things in more detail. Professor Phillips' philosophy of open-book testing really made the semester stress-free and I felt like I came away with a broad base of knowledge that can easily be supplemented by looking up specific mechanisms if ever necessary, as opposed to forgetting everything that I crammed into my brain the week before the final, which is what happened last semester. I was actually very nervous coming into CHEM230 because I barely remembered any of what we had learned, but we didn't use a single thing from last semester.Taking this course in conjunction with biochemistry was eye-opening because we would discuss biological pathways on a molecular level in biochem (like glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenation) and see how it ties into the rest of the body. Then we would study the mechanisms of those pathways on an atomic level in orgo (in the case of glycolysis this happened about two weeks apart, which was awesome). If possible, I would recommend to future students that they take the two courses together since having biochemistry really helps to contextualize everything and streamlines the process of learning the organic chemistry behind the pathways.The essay was a fantastic way to expose us to the side of organic chemistry that does not involve blind memorization. In place of a fourth midterm, we all wrote a 4-5 page (double-spaced) paper detailing the biosynthesis of a natural product, which was a ton of fun to research and write. It made me feel like a real scientist to be able to look up all of the information and then present it in a paper. This was a great experience that really complemented the course.The only weakness, in my opinion, is the length of the exams. I felt that all of our tests (excluding the take-home, for some reason) were really long. Everyone ran out of time on the first 2 midterms and the final took almost everyone the full 3.5 hours. This was just a minor wrinkle, however, because the final was worth about as much as each midterm, and we got to drop one midterm.In all, you should definitely take this course, especially if you felt that first semester organic only expects pure memorization. I really felt like that at the end of the first semester, and as such was really dreading taking 230 but Professor Phillips really brought a different kind of philosophy to his class that made it a great experience for me. I don't really know how he's going to have to alter it for a 150-person class as opposed to our 40-person class (I can't see anyone grading that many papers), but I would still wholeheartedly recommend this course! This was a really great experience.Also, to future orgo students, I would definitely recommend starting organic in the spring because you get to have a smaller class size which makes the environment so much more fun.",
    "A great organic chemistry class with an emphasis on biology. You will not learn as much about metal chemistry, but in return you get to cover important biological pathways. Take this class if it is offered.",
    "Chem230 is a difficult, interesting course. If you can take it with Andy Phillips, it's definitely worthwhile. I probably wouldn't recommend it with Shepartz, given that she's sort of mean.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend this course. The subject material is fascinating, as you will learn fundamental second-semester organic chemistry topics within the context of biological processes like peptide synthesis. Trivial topics usually taught in orgo have been cut out, making for a much more enjoyable experience. Plus, Professor Phillips is great - he is an excellent lecturer and is very receptive to student needs.Should I mention that all tests are open-note? While it won't necessarily help you too much on the midterms (which are a bit of a time crunch), it's still great that the emphasis in this class is more on thinking as opposed to memorization.",
    "YES. I actually enjoyed it. I think mostly because Professor Phillips is a great professor.",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone who who doesn't have to take it, but as far as premed courses go it's quite solid and enjoyable. I found the problem sets hard at times, but other than problem sets there's not much work. Phillips is very cool. I really liked him and his teaching style.",
    "This class was not as bad as it was made out to be. Mostly, the students who take it do so because they have to, but that being said, there are definitely worse science classes.",
    "Chem 230 was much better than the first semester of organic chemistry because the lectures were more organized and we all had a better feel for organic chemistry. I would recommend this course as I learned a lot.",
    "Phillips was a great teacher, and he explains everything so clearly. I really feel like I learned everything that was covered quite well, and I'm actually prepared to approach real-world organic chemistry!However, I can't necessarily describe the reactions I \"know\" (i.e. the reactions I could predict) by name, for better or worse. If I was asked to describe the \"things I learned about\" it would be difficult for me to describe. We studied more tendencies of what does and doesn't react with (or near) carbonyl groups and stuff than discrete reactions. It's just a little disorienting that I managed to not learn the names of reactions this semester; I do recommend learning the names.",
    "Chem 230 was an excellent course--the lectures and homeworks were engaging and interesting and the material well-taught. Professor Phillips is amazing! He is very approachable and engaging to talk to, both about the subject material and about things in a broader spectrum. Weekly problem sets, 3 exams, and a final (all of which were open book\/open note).",
    "If you can take this class with Prof. Phillips, do it!! This class ended up being one of my favorites by the end of the semester (and I realize that sounds ridiculous cause it is organic chemistry...) If you have Phillips, GO TO OFFICE HOURS! Even if you're acing the class (in which case, you are insane, and also I am envious of you..) He is so so caring and really wants to get to know students and is so dedicated to them doing well. He understands that his subject is a tough one, and he doesn't expect students to particularly like it. As a result, he tries to make it as interesting as possible. He also recognizes that students learn differently, and he tries to accomodate the class to give everyone equal opportunity to do well. This means making all tests open book and open internet (not as easy as you think) and then when people didn't do well on those, he gave us a take home test to give the other kids an opportunity to do well. There was also a paper. Oh, and he drops the lowest exam score and a few lowest problem sets.That all being said, this class is super tough! We had a failing average for our first exam (despite it being open-internet). I actually came very close to dropping the class, just because I could basically count all my passing scores on one hand. However, I stuck with it and I'm so happy I did. Take time to do the problem sets. Even though often they are only 1 or 2 questions, they are real world application problems, and it will take some poking around google.scholar and pubmed to figure them out. However, everything in this class is totally manageable which is certainly made more helpful with a professor that really really wants you to do well. In the end, you do NO memorizing, just a lot of understanding. And by the end you realize how much you've learned.In summary, take this class with Phillips!!!! and get to know him!"
