    "Pretty good. schoelkopf is a good teacher. Better than the 440\/441 lecturers, so I've heard. It's mostly typical problems, not as much of a theory background. The main problem is Schoelkopf is very busy (since he's a bamf researcher\/professor), so things became VERY rushed at the end and we started not understanding things as much. but the class was otherwise pretty good, and you get to learn quantum from someone very highly ranked in the field.psets aren't too bad, pretty straightforward. Maybe 3-6 hours\/week.",
    "Phys 439 was one of the best, if not the best, courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Schoelkopf is a very friendly professor, yet he still does a good job of keeping an atmosphere of academic rigor in the classroom. I went into this class with zero knowledge of quantum mechanics and came out feeling like a champ. In fact, I'm not bummed that I won't be taking any more quantum after this course. If you can get past the challenges of reading bad handwriting during lecture, then take this course - it's a phenomenal experience.",
    "Schoelkopf is a great teacher for a difficult subject. Definitely learned a ton, and the textbook is very helpful. I really enjoyed the class.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this physics quantum course over the phys440-441 2-semester quantum sequence. You don't really need to spend a year on this stuff unless you REALLY like it.",
    "Quantum Mechanics is a pretty tough subject due to the mathematics involved and the non-intuitiveness. This course wasn't impossibly difficult but it certainly can be challenging and some of the psets took a very long time (>10hrs) (others were shorter). Staying on top of the content is really important as it's kinda like learning a new language (also, make sure you learn any unfamiliar mathematical topics as they will help improve your understanding of the subject matter and help solve problems).Quantum is really cool and interesting however I would not recommend this class if you don't need it as you will learn things you probably don't care about. (this isn't a \"fun\" class. That being said quatum is pretty fascinating and worthwhile if you're interested in it (or fake it to make it).Schoelkopf is a very legit researcher and is a pretty solid lecturer as well. He sometimes has trouble understanding what things are confusing as he's so used to the material but he's happy to answer questions about the material and nice and approachable. Again, stay on top of stuff and go to class. Learning entirely from the textbook would be very tough and unpleasant.I'm not sure how the other quantum courses compare though I think the content covered is pretty comparable to the first semester of the other quantum sequence but I will say Schoelkopf is a good teacher if you're choosing between two quantum classes. Also, wehad an oral final which was super intimidating but ended up being a really good idea because you really have to know your stuff and get to explain stuff.",
    "I would definitely recommend QM to anybody interested in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, or getting an education. Very interesting stuff with so many applications. This is a must take for anybody who can do integrals.",
    "Schoelkopf is great and enthusiastic, and I liked the subject matter much more than classical physics.",
    "AP 439 is an aggressive introduction to quantum mechanics which moves through the material super-quickly. You will need both the lectures and the book to make sense of the material partly because neither is sufficient, but also because quantum mechanics is really challenging stuff."
