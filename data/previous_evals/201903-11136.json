   "comments": [
    "Note taking and research strategies - this is the first class in which I have been challenged to think about how I make notes, collate research and approach primary material. Extremely helpful. Engaging and open way to discussing what kind of research article is desirable. I enjoyed being asked to explain the academic articles I thought were good - it made me reflect on my own work in new ways.",
    "This course provided an opportunity to write an article-length essay on any topic in the broad areas of international and transnational history. The small number of readings and assignments beyond the main paper reflected on the process of writing history and on some of the methodological and conceptual problems that arise in the international and transnational frameworks.",
    "I enjoyed this writing seminar because we actually spoke about the process of writing and got feedback from each other. I gained insights into the ways research can be carried out and tools that can help me organize ideas.",
    "Many of the assignments in these seminar helped me improve how I do research at the archives. I learned about different programs that assist researchers in organizing documents, problems that scholars and students encounter at the archives and we also discussed what a successful academic article should have. There was also a session dedicated to discussing the process of turning a dissertation into a book and we workshoped portions of our papers together. These activities helped foster a supportive and incluvise environment."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - helpful supervising, good class environment. Weaknesses - the first draft felt like a big rush. How it could be improved - the introduction class analysis was really helpful. Maybe we could have facilitated more student-student interaction for related projects.",
    "I found the readings and assignments in this course to be generally effective in preparing me to think about writing the research paper, and I also appreciated that they were fairly small in number, giving me ample time to do research and begin my writing. Class discussion was consistently engaging and informative. There were a few assignments, particularly towards the end of the semester, that felt a bit more like a distraction from the main project of the course (the research paper) than a supplement to it.",
    "This class had a great structure and I liked the feedback from peers. I wish we had more sessions with peer feedback.",
    "The instructor was sometimes unclear about his expectations. Some of the feedback focused more on what can be improved but positive comments were always brief. This would leave me wondering if I was falling behind. However, I was very pleased with the instructor because he always made himself available and was very helpful during research and writing. He also made sure that everyone's opinion was heard and answered any questions that we had."

    "Yes.",
    "This is an ideal research seminar for history graduate students. It would also be of interest and help to students in other disciplines seeking to learn more about the historical process and get some practice in writing history.",
    "yes, it's a great opportunity to engage in critical research !",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the theme because the instructor is very engaging and committed to helping students. The assignments were also very useful because they helped me understand what early career academics have to do."
