    "Tanya is a great professor for this class. Its crucial in a class that meets every day to really like the professor, and its impossible not to have a positive relationship with Tanya.She's extremely dedicated, really tries to help each student improve, and makes classes an enjoyable and pleasant experience.",
    "Would recommend if you want to continue with basic Spanish, but do not expect to be at a sophisticated level by the end.",
    "Super fun class -- but make sure to get a good start. Using your lates and absences early is not a good idea, as these will inevitably be necessary later on in the term.The work load is pretty good, and assigned the material is very interesting. Take it!",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student seeking to learn Spanish. I would say that it's a daily course that covers basic grammatical concepts including preterite, por y para, subjunctive, imperative, imperfect, present, and future tenses. We also learned about some cultural things relating to Spanish-speaking countries."
