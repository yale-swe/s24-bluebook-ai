   "comments": [
    "Pretty standard American studies seminar and really good reading. Great way to explore independent projects on public space.",
    "Examination of American society through close examination of historical and contemporary issues related to urban spaces. Emphasis on the physicality of urban layouts, etc, with lots of ethnographic& cultural analysis. Not very much policy.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class with the caveat that it does end up being a commitment of time. For me, that was absolutely ok, but there are 5 field projects and a 25 page term paper - pretty substantial, but I learned a ton. And Prof. B is amazing!",
    "I thought this class was an incredible introduction to the theory behind city politics, the ways cities work, the right to the city framework, and leftist urban activism. This class is mainly theoretical, making it different from most of Yale's other course offerings that are urban studies related. I did think that this course focussed too much on the right to the city framework, as opposed to other important frameworks. There were many moments throughout the course when the instructor introduced other theoretical frameworks for the purposes of the discussion and they seemed as important as the right to the city. Also, while the five writing assignments for this course were good practice, I found them to be burdensome. Although on the syllabus it says that each assignment should be 3 pages, my classmates and I soon found thatit is impossible to do these assignments adequately without writing 5 pages (7-9 with images).Overall, a good course, which I'm glad I took."
