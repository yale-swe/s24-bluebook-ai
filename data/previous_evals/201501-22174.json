    "Take this class! So interesting, not stressful (just presentation and paper), a nice way to learn",
    "DEFINITELY take this class. It is a fantastic, eye-opening science course where the workload is completely doable and actually enjoyable.",
    "TAKE THIS. You will be very happy you did. You're learning about interesting, relevant things and you actually get to enjoy it because the class is low-stress.",
    "Great course and a fabulous science credit! I'd even say it's worth taking if not a science credit, which is saying a lot. Great if you like papers and presentations on interesting topics largely of your choosing. The professors were wonderful and really engaged with students to answer their questions and lead interesting discussions. Highly recommended.",
    "A great way to fulfill the science requirement. Forensic geoscience is an extremely specific field, but getting to explore a wide range of cases lets you take away larger lessons about scientific research and its uses.",
    "This has been my favorite course at Yale so far! I would def. recommend it to anyone interested in geology, forensics, art or really anything! You don't have to be a science major to do it and you get to practice your presentation skills while becoming an expert on a specific case study!",
    "Great class--really fun science credit. There were field days and lab tours. Manageable workload, and the professors were really fun and easy to approach (but one of them is leaving so they won't be co-teaching the course in the future). Material is interesting and relevant to current day problems.",
    "YES! This was my favorite class this semester (and I'm a humanities major). The professors are amazing, so knowledgeable and so kind. The class is also low stress. I loved learning about the controversies and practicality of forensic geoscience in multiple case studies and feel like I walked away with a real and useful understanding of the field. Great class and great science credit."
