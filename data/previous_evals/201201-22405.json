    "I think so.",
    "Very hard class. The workload (reading) is a lot, but, if you are willing to do all the reading and work, you will get a lot out of the course. You learn a LOT about China.",
    "While I definitely am leaving this course with a much stronger background in modern Chinese history, I would probably not recommend it to a fellow student.Perdue is not a good lecturer. His lectures are disjointed and often go on tangents. Following each lecture, I found myself having to completely reorder my notes simply so that the information was coherent and intelligible. While he makes Powerpoints, they are sparse and he doesn't really stick to them, making them a rather useless tool. This, coupled with the fact that his general lecture style is quite dull, made the 50-minute lecture seem eternities longer.That said, the information learned in the class was very interesting and relevant. All of the textbooks we used were quite good and the workload is quite manageable (although the reading can be hefty at points.)",
    "I would not recommend Hist 316 unless students know really little about Modern chinese history and has a strong desire to gain some understanding of this time period. Lectures are not really well organized and structured, and sometimes tend to stray into the irrelevance.",
    "Take it. A lot of fun, minimum work. Only the final requires cramming.",
    "I recommend it. Although the assignments can be a little nerve-wracking because you're not sure what to expect, they're generally very fair.",
    "Great course! I would definitely recommend it. I found the material super interesting, and important to know. If you have CJ as a TA you are golden. I thought it was taught well and Professor Perdue kept it interesting with clips of movies and songs. The only thing I can think of is that the powerpoints were sometimes rushed through. But it's a manageable workload and sooo worth it.",
    "HIST 316 is a gem in an otherwise bleak array of rest of the world history options at Yale. Course requirements are eminently reasonable (two 3 page papers, midterm, and final), and the grading is fair. Readings were interesting, and the circumventing visual and film materials were neat additions. Prof Perdue gets a reputation for being boring and uninspired. Don't buy into it. Although he won't jump around the room or do goofy impersonations, he is a smart guy with profound research interests that he brings to bear in lecture (although the rants against US imperialism got tiring). The TF's are also some of the best among Yale's grad students. On the whole, a great course, and a definite one to consider for students with even a nominal interest in exploring what brought about the China of today",
    "Yes, the historical material is incredibly important and you will learn a great deal. The historical background of late imperial and early Republican China is really essential to anyone thinking of concentrating on China and will really open your eyes. Lectures aren't flashy or performative or always the most exciting, but Dr. Perdue ultimately conveys some interesting ideas and overall selects good readings.One tip. Dr. Perdue enjoys teaching with visual images and films, which also turn up in ID questions on the midterm and final, so pay attention to\/watch\/study those!",
    "Don't take it unless you have a lot of time devoted to this class and are immensely interested in the history of China.",
    "If you are interested in China and want to understand what historical events, people, and movements shaped the country it is today, this is a class for you. That being said, this is not a class that focuses on economic development or Chinese politics (although, if you are lucky enough to have CJ, she will fill you in on Taiwanese politics).One important note! If you speak some Chinese, this will help you. Memorizing Chinese names and place names will be hard if you don't know a bit of the language.",
    "The course was a very useful introduction into the overall arc of China's history in the last 500 years. It systematically covers a long timespan and demonstrates a surprisingly varied China."
