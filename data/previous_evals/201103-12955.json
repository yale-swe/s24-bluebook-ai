   "comments": [
    "A basic introduction to Italian. I definitely recommend this course to another student, and definitely recommend Monica Georgeo as the instructor- she is, to put it simply, the best.",
    "Italian is really a beautiful language and I HIGHLY recommend taking it. There's also a lot of study abroad opportunities in Italy including an intensive summer course in Siena. I plan to be fluent in the language after this summer, going into sophomore year. Bragging rights of speaking another language are always fun!",
    "Obviously L1 classes are hard, but I made a mistake that people should avoid. I tried to get into a class with an established professor, but because of this, the class was over crowded and the teacher was not particularly amazing anyways. It was overall not the best experience. Although everyone else I talk to seems to really like their instructors and enjoy the class, even if their instructors were grad students. Pick your section carefully because it will have a big influence on your overall experience of the class, and don't assume the established professors will be better.",
    "If you are not good at language, this will be a difficult class. You are expected to understand and speak Italian from day one.",
    "Italian is not as difficult as some languages and a background in Spanish makes it much easier. It's amazing how much you will learn in one semester; from nothing to the subjunctive!",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. Although the class is quite a bit of work as it meets every morning, the workload is always predictable and manageable. Students learn a lot in only one semester, and the format of the class and its assessments gives students a large level of command over the language.",
    "Absolutely. Great course--a lot of time."
