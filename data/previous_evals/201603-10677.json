    "I gained a deeper understanding of some mathematical principles, such as matrix manipulation and subspaces, etc. I also learned a lot of new theorems and concepts that I hadn't been exposed to before. I was able to practice proving lemmas, which is something that I struggle with, so I found that helpful.",
    "I developed more in-depth insights into linear algebra and its connection with the state-of-art models in linear system.",

   "comments": [
    "I found lectures extremely boring and unorganized. Lectures always seemed to drag on forever, so I'm not sure how intellectually stimulating it was for me. However, I learned some new things so that was good.",
    "The notes and the lectures are superb. The pace of the second half of the course was a bit fast but later we were fine.",
    "Strengths were the notes are well-written, class small, and the material, though tough, is pretty interesting. Professor Morse was a little dry, however, and sometimes got lost while lecturing."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I found it more confusing and stressful than it needed to be due to the notes that were provided and the teaching style. I didn't enjoy it and if I could choose my classes for this semester again, I would choose a different elective.",
    "Yes, definitely. I would recommend it to any student in the systems field.",
    "If you need this course, I would take it. I did not get much out of the lectures, but working through the problems sets and reading the notes helped clear things up a bit. This is NOT an easy course, although the exams are much easier than the problem sets and Professor Morse is understanding when it comes to student concerns over grades. I am fairly neutral about this course, but if you are at all interested in improving your linear algebra skills or learning about linear dynamical systems, I would take it."
