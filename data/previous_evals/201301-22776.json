   "comments": [
    "Decent class where you get to spend time on some great texts. The syllabus is designed as a survey and the course does not hold itself together with greater themes or reflections about the evolution of the novel form, for example, in its current rendition. Discussions could have been more in-depth at times. Prof Zhuo is very approchable and kind too.",
    "Yes, take it if you enjoy reading French literature and\/or are majoring in French.",
    "I would recommend it wholeheartedly. The forum posts are a little stressful because the readings are very long but the toil is worthwhile.",
    "Take this course if you're at all interested in reading French novels in their original language. You will see the evolution of the novel form and some of the major themes of the time. Your written French will also improve.",
    "Good reading list. Sometimes a lot of reading each week, sometimes very little. Two significant papers, but not too bad work-wise overall if you're used to French classes. Solid course for a French major or devoted French student.",
    "The reading list is kind of like an expanded version of the last 2\/3 of 170, so if you liked those readings you will probably like these. Typical book-a-week reading load with 2 papers and a midterm exam. The course was pretty large this year, with ~16 students in it, which made discussion kind of difficult. Take it if the reading list excites you. If not, there are probably smaller classes with more interesting books (I was not a particularly huge fan of the authors) that will be more enriching.",
    "Originally, I was attracted to the course because the topic interested me a lot, as well as the reading list. The professor was nice, and the students were smart and good at french. All this remained true, but in the end, the discussions were just not that interesting and rushed.",
    "Yes. The syllabus is excellent and discussions are informative. I would say that all in all, you cover all essentials and go a bit deeper.",
    "It offers a treasure of Ffrench literature. The discussion is good but not too efficient."
