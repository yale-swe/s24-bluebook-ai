   "comments": [
    "A great class! The topic is very interdisciplinary - readings range from material on amateur female astronomers in 19th century England to NCAA athletes in the 21st century. We had lively discussions, which will make you question the very definitions of \"amateur\" and \"professional.\" We also learned about how to construct a research paper from the bottom up. The course is less about how to write well as it is about how to create and defend an argument well. Professor Isbell is a great teacher - very receptive, easy to approach, gives good feedback. Overall, I would recommend this course.",
    "English 114 08 has the same general curriculum as other English 114 sections, but the specific topic is professionals vs. amateurs. Though by the end of the course you will be sick of discussing professionals and amateurs, you will walk out of the course feeling that you accomplished a lot. Professor Isbell really helps tune your analytical and academic writing skills and the class itself if very engaging as it is structured as a true seminar where the students run the majority of the discussion and there is very little professor lecturing.",
    "This is a great class if you want to work on your writing in a friendly atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely! It's thoroughly enjoyable. The material is interesting and Professor Isbell makes it an absolutely fantastic time.",
    "Excellent course! Choose a topic that interests you!",
    "Take it if you want to improve writing skills and like the topic, but don't expect it to be your favorite class. Expect to like it, though."
