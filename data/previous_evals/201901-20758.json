    "The teaching by the professor was just --- I cannot think of a more approrpriate description --- bad. Not only was she difficult to understand, but each lecture lacked any kind of structure or cohesiveness. The course could be vastly improved by giving it a structure. Also, it would be helpful to present and discuss methods other than Sieve estimation, and to point out advantages and shortcomings of different methods. Generally, I would prefer instructors who do not mostly teach from their own papers. Given the circumstances and the material he was asked to cover, the TA did a great job.",
    "The class was fantastic. It provided me with all the necessary resources to advance my knowledge in the field. I would have enjoyed doing an application of the methods we learned with real data (as well as the simulation study). In general, I prefer a class at a slower pace but with more detailed exposition. I would also prefer to have two classes per week rather than one class lasting longer.",
