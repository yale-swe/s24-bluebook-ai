    "It's worthwhile and interesting if you attend office hours, do the readings, and really get the discussion. Can be a bit abstract and requires more logic background than what is officially required.",
    "This class is worth it if you are deeply interested in the material (succinctly put, the philosophy of what \"is\" is in all its senses as used in laguage and logic), and this is what you think about on a day to day basis. You can tell that it really matters to the Professors, and this is where a lot of the contemporary thought is being addressed.Beware though, class is notorious for going at least half an hour over time every week."
