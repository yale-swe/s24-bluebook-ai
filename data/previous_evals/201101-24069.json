    "The discussions that the studio fostered (informally and during pin-ups) were the most valuable aspect of the experience. We had a great group of intelligent, motivated students who all participated in the studio in different, equally meaningful ways.",
    "I think desk-crits or pin-ups every Monday and Thursday are too much and doesn't leave enough room for the students.",
    "All peripheral aspects to this studio, namely lectures, involvement of forestry faculty, and various last minute outside critics was next to useless. Actually I feel it was severely detrimental to the studio and a large waste of time. This was a great premise for a studio that through over complications, too many people involved, and lack of a cohesive vision unfortunately fell pretty flat."
