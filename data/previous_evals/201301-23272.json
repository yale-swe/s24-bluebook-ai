    "I would recommend this with Dr. Thomas. The topic is decent but the key is the professor. Dr. Thomas a a great teacher and will make you a better writer.",
    "Yes, it helps you form a better argument and to find tension in the arguments you come across. The seminar material on keywords is also very interesting. I was always surprised at how quickly the time passed in this class. I came in initially not looking forward to taking an English class, but this was a very enjoyable experience, I highly recommend Professor Thomas' class, although he won't be teaching this specific keywords class next semester.",
    "Great class with interesting readings; taught me how to critically read and analyze much better, and made me a much more confident and skilled writer. Classes were great, and the workload is not bad at all. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes! Amazing class! Although I don't exactly see how it betters your writing for other classes, it does gear you for better academic writing in general. It is NOT much work, and you should definitely take it with Professor Thomas! He is the most understanding and effective instructor possible.",
    "You take it because you have to. And afterwards you're very happy you were forced to take it",
    "Take this class! Your writing will improve while discussing important topics in modern society.",
    "Take this class! or take a class\/lecture with Professor Thomas!",
    "This is an excellent class that will drastically improve your writing skills. It also positively alters how you like at academic writing."
