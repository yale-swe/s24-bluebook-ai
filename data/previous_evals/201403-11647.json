   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is way to theory focused. Although the name suggests that every class would relate stigma to health most of the time we only talked about the theory behind stigma and why it exists. Having a more application based class would have been more beneficial for my future.",
    "This was an absolutely fabulous course about a crucial topic. I think the course might be even more effective if taught in a seminar style rather than traditional lecture. This might make it easier to integrate theory and practice on this topic.",
    "i wished the weekly assignments were more relevant to our final paper. I feel as though the assignments didn't start building up to the final paper until the last two assignments. I also believed weekly assignments were a little difficult prior to having a lecture on the topic to write about.",
    "Good course if you have an interest in stigma research! The lectures are a little bit dry (and you get all the necessary material out of the readings) but Dr. P is very nice and encourages participation in lecture so you should attend. Overall I liked the course!",
    "Very badly thought. No chance for class participation. Felt like we were being talked at and no opportunities to have conversations about the topic. Very boring.",
    "Strengths: Incredibly well organized. Interesting subject and great discussions. Weaknesses: Not many- a lot of material and it sort of all revolved around the same central topics. But regardless, not many weaknesses to speak of.",
    "The professor is a great, friendly, smart guy and he has a lot of interesting work to share. However, delivery of the material was a bit dry. I'd rather the class be more interactive. He seems like a great person to have discussions with, rather than straight lecture.",
    "Really great class-I appreciated the level of depth in the lectures as well as the opportunity to independently explore a stigma of our choosing.",
    "Course was refreshing in that it covered a new topic, but the link to health could have been stronger. I was hoping for more discussion on health research or health consequences of stigma, and not just individual level responses to stressors. This is partly due to lack of robust literature on population level responses to stress, however, too much theory than desired.",
    "Strengths: heavily empirical base with great examples, constant writing assignments ensured keeping up with readings, fair assignments. Weaknesses: lectures had more material than could be taught in one class, heavily lecture with less discussion than I would like. I wish there was a more health\/clinical focus of stigma e.g. a lecture on clinician + stigmatized interactions.",
    "Strengths- Extremely interesting topic, the class was very comprehensive given the time we had to explore this topic, the readings were great, doing the homework\/readings before class was great because it forced us to be ready for class, discussing in class articles was a nice touch, having the freedom to work on a stigma of our interest Weaknesses- Some people felt the class was too theoretical in nature and that there wasn't enough application in terms of the concepts. I did not mind the theory, I have a strong interest in sociological theory. Improvements: Integrate more group work, have more application for those who are not interested in theory",
    "The course can be improved by having more feedback on the assignments closer to the time in which they were completed.",
    "Overall the course was very interesting. I would critique the format of the final paper and arguing that sticking to the week headings as outlined in the syllabus was a little difficult in that some of the divisions seemed a bit arbitrary. Specifically I was confused regarding the distinction between social and behavioral responses to stigma and linking micro and macro. I guess the distinction could have been clearer in the presentations for those weeks. Overall great course.",
    "The course provided an in-depth look at the issues and stigma, and defined stigma in terms that allowed me to understand the subject better. The lessons for each section created a great progression which complimented the previous lectures. In terms of the articles provided as examples for each week, there was some subjectivity towards the topics that were limiting in terms of my personal interests, and the perspectives I would have liked to explore.",
    "This was really a fantastic course. Some highlights were that Prof. Pachankis took the time to comment on our weekly assignments, even though he had a TA; that the slides were well cited; and that we learned a ton of theory that is backed up by empirical research (and what kind of research can do that). I thought the expectations for the debate were a little unclear, but the rest of the assignments were good. I wasn't an enormous fan of the small group conversations; I think those are tough in a non-seminar class where people haven't gotten to know one another. I would have preferred final paper presentations, maybe instead of the debate. In any case, this course was really enjoyable and has had a big influence on my other projects.",
    "This was the most interesting course I have taken to-date at Yale. I loved learning about stigma in different contexts and at different levels. While the weekly essays were a lot of work, I found they really helped me to digest the readings by applying them to my topic of interest. I also really enjoyed the final class debate."

   "question_text": "Please evaluate the instructor of this course. What are the instructor's strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might his or her teaching be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0John is very kind and forgiving. However, he often ran over time for class and didnt necessarily relate it to health. His background as a social psychologist came through because it was heavily focused on theory and was much more geared towards a sociology\/anthropology\/psychology student body rather than a health-focused student body.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0John was absolutely wonderful. You can tell that he cares deeply about this topic, and he did a wonderful job of distilling his seemingly infinite knowledge on the topic in such a way that it is easily accessible to those who have not been exposed to it previously.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Such a wonderful professor. It is always refreshing when a professor truly is knowledgable and passionate about a class topic and that was the case here. I felt like I really learned a ton and going to class was an absolute pleasure.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0It was his first time teaching, so not sure if he'll change his approach for next year. He was a great instructor though! The lectures and readings could use some diversification, but good otherwise. Should have more built in participation as well to keep people interested! REALLY nice guy though who knows his stuff about stigma research!!",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Strengths: Presenting the theories and research behind stigma Weaknesses: Not able to facilitate class conversation, liked to hear himself talk most of the time, 3-4page assignment each week AND 15-20 page at the end of course was excessive and unnecessary. Class was extremely boring. Improvements: Revamp the ENTIRE course and make room for more participation and less writing.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Pachankis was phenomenal. I loved his style of teaching. He did a stand up job and really deserves recognition from the department for all of his hard work planning and teaching class.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Pachankis' academic background provides a unique perspective to the class material as it relates to public health, and he did a good job teaching the course. Weaknesses: The page length of the weekly assignments was a bit too long.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Really great instructor, interesting lectures and very responsive to student questions.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Instructor was knowledgeable but new and could improve the use of class time. More discussion related activities would be helpful to reinforce concepts, and to change up the structure of classes since it became pretty routine.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Wonderfully responsive to students. Generous grader with constructive input. Extremely intelligent and gracious with student input. Lots of work, but I learned a lot!",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Strengths: Very knowledgable, great at connecting diverse topics in stigma, good at proving feedback, friendly, he did a great job especially for teaching the class for the first time Weaknesses: Engagement (tone and volume). Hard to hear if you are in back of the class Improvements: Speak louder and be less monotone, this will help engage the class more.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Professor Pachankis was nice and well-informed, but the course was unorganized.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Overall great instructor. Powerpoints were well formulated and took time to carefully consider and answer students questions.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0John is a great lecturer, expanding on the material and presenting examples and perspectives that complement the overall subtopics.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Fantastic... Prof. Pachankis made the material easy for me to understand, did a great job of selecting interesting studies to focus on, and gave really helpful feedback. His research is also very interesting, and he is approachable.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0John is knowledgeable about diverse disciplines and I found him to be very thoughtful and engaging. He did a great job of engaging the class and allowing people to share their ideas. He also didn't rush through topics, allowing for us to get the most out of each topic area. He is an excellent professor and I would gladly take another course with him."

   "comments": [
    "Very theoretical. A ton of work and if you're not interested in theory...not really worth it. John is very nice and knowledgable and the information could have been very relevant and useful but i feel only if it was more application focused rather than theoretical focused. The course information wasn't really tailored to students interests and had we discussed theory for 1-2 weeks and then examples of how stigma has impacted health the remainder of the course I think it would have been much more useful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Stigma is a topic that does not get much attention in the broader public health world, but this course has shown me that it is an incredibly important factor to consider.",
    "Definitely recommend if you have an interest in stigma. More work than most classes but no tests or anything, just the final paper and weekly assignments.",
    "Don't take it only it has changed considerably from this year. I would NOT recommend it. Too much work and there really is no pay off.",
    "Highly recommend this course. Incredibly well organized and fascinating subject. Dr. Pachankis is a lead researcher in the field and he has an incredible roladex of information in his mind.",
    "The class covered interesting material, but was theory-heavy at the beginning of the semester. Weekly assignments require a great deal of writing.",
    "A lot of work, but a great course",
    "I would only recommend the course if the student is aware it is a psych course and lots of theory set up the course material for stigma. There is a lot of tedious writing, but I guess it did help write the final paper and prepare for lecture.",
    "This is a great course. It is a bit theoretical but puts the world of stigmatized individuals into perspective. Provides a great opportunity to work on writing and analytic skills.",
    "Great comprehensive introduction to stigma and health. Class can be theory heavy so that might not be of interest to everyone. I only recommend this class to students who are interested in the topic and do not mind sociological theory, although the professor does a great job at connecting theory to public health and stigma.",
    "This course applies stigma to various identities and medical conditions to show how stigma is a fundamental determinant of health. The course has potential but, as it was the first time being taught, it needs to be improved to be more enjoyable.",
    "Would recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely recommended for anyone seeking a more advanced SBS course; anyone who studies health disparities; or anyone who wants to learn more about social psychology and social theory. The main examples of stigma used in the course are mental illness, gay men, and black Americans, but the theories are pretty widely applicable. Prof. Pachankis is thoughtful, accessible, and gives helpful feedback on the assignments. It's worth noting that this is a theory-heavy course. I know some students are allergic to theory, and therefore didn't get as much out of it. If that's the case for you, this might not be as good a use of your time as some other classes. On the other hand, the relationship between theory and empirical research is emphasized (interesting and worth understanding), and it's probably good for everyone to be exposed to at least some social theory. In any event, this was by far my favorite course of the semester, and I would definitely encourage others to take it.",
    "Overall I greatly enjoyed this course. I would recommend it for anyone interested in understanding how stigma affects health and who would like to delve into understanding stigma in a specific population. While it requires a good deal of work each week, you learn a lot. John is an excellent professor and I highly recommend taking his course."
