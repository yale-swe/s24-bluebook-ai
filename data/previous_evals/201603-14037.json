   "comments": [
    "This course introduced me to a humanities course and I could not have been happier. I had never read books of such complexity and this course encouraged my development of critically reading old manuscripts. It was also a great introductory course to college.",
    "I developed better reading skills, as well as a higher level of confidence in small scale intellectual discussions.",
    "I learned about the travels, mindsets, and lives of several travelers in the Medieval age, ranging several centuries, but staying around 800 AD to 1300 AD. The course teaches the role of religion in their lives, as well as the travelers' thoughts on other peoples of the world. It is an internationally-themed course, not only limited to the lands where the travelers go. You also learn about the motives behind why people traveled in the Middle Ages.",
    "Reading, Critical thinking, etc.",
    "How to look at and determine the authenticity of sources and their uses. I learned a lot about Medieval history and medieval travel, but mainly learned HOW to learn about these things.",
    "The dark ages weren't really all that dark for other parts of the world! Also, reading about travel is fun. Oh and megalomania isn't bad at all.",
    "Taking this course allowed me to learn about an academic field that I had not known existed: travel during the medieval times. I had the preconceived notion that we would be learning about the historical events of the medieval times. But all of our assigned texts and class discussions focused on the difficulties of traveling during this time, the methods, the reasons, and the culture people learned during their travels. It was a subject that I did not think could be so deep nor one that I thought I would be interested in. But the texts and class discussions made learning about medieval travel an absolute joy. I can now say that I have valuable insights about the different medieval cultures from the orient, the middle east, etc. and about some of the famous travelers such as Ibn Battutah and Marco Polo."

   "comments": [
    "This course could not be made better. The material was great and very engaging, and one had incentive to do all of the activities. The final project was also very creative.",
    "The wide scope of readings and thought papers were definitely strengths. The readings allowed me to have a broad understanding of travel in medieval times, albeit from a Near Eastern and Western perspective exclusively. The lack of an Far Eastern perspective was felt by me, a prospective East Asian Studies major, but I felt it did not significantly weaken the course.",
    "The readings are very heavy and difficult to get through. The actual material isn't dense, it's just an incredible amount of reading for a rather short period of time. It was interesting and at times very funny, but the entirety of the readings never felt vital to the course. This was nice for workload, but probably detracted from the effectiveness of the course. There are a lot of opportunities for creativity, and the final project was very fun to do.",
    "I found this course to be very strong. The readings were at times dry, but on the whole I found it very engaging.",
    "The class had plenty of writing, but none of it (besides the final paper) felt particularly substantial - I never felt like I got to engage with material for particularly long or in depth. It would be nice if the class was changed to a writing credit where students could spend more time interacting with a work and crafting longer and more in depth responses.",
    "The subject matter became repetitive after about 2 months of reading travel accounts. On the other hand, the off-topic stories and information made of for it.",
    "I wish there was a way to better enforce the readings. Discussions and thought papers are great but you can get through them after reading a couple of chapters. Maybe have short pop quizzes?",
    "One thing I will say about this course is that Dr. T would often get side-tracked during class. Our tangents and unrelated conversations were still intellectually stimulating and thought provoking but again, they were unrelated to the readings. There were days when we would not even touch upon anything remotely relevant to the reading (this was sometimes a little bit frustrating when you actually did the assigned reading). Another weakness is that there is no way to know how you are doing in the course in terms of grades and whatnot. That being said, the amount of information that you learn in this course spreads beyond medieval travel (largely due to the tangents). But by the end of it, you have learned so much that you feel in general, much more knowledgable about the world around you. And perhaps the biggest strength is that it is such a pleasure to be in this class because of how energetic and passionate Dr. T is about his field. Dr. T's enthusiasm is contagious and you cannot help but be invested in this course."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a freshman looking for an introductory course to college. The work was difficult and required a lot of thought, but it was presented so well that one did not notice the toughness of the course.",
    "Definitely! It's a great freshman seminar, and Professor Toorawa was one of the most personable people I've ever encountered. He makes the class worth it. Additionally, it helps students, especially non-humanities majors, to develop their writing, reading, and speaking, invaluable skills for life generally.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student almost entirely because it's worth it to know Dr. Toorawa. The man is a vault of knowledge which he constantly shares. It is a very fun class, especially if you have other demanding classes and want something of a break.",
    "I would. I heavily enjoyed the course, and Professor Toorawa is a very interesting person.",
    "Dr. T is a gem. Extremely nice man, extremely effective professor. I would honestly suggest taking any class taught by him. I'm sure he would make any course he teaches interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, not only as a way to explore a culture that many people know very little about, but also as a means by which to read material that is not commonly encountered.",
    "YES! Dr.T is the funniest, most energetic teacher ever and it really is an amazing perspective on travel and the medieval era in general.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for a laid-back and intellectually fulfilling course. The amount that you learn in this course depends on the effort that you put into it. But even just listening to Dr. T in class will impart on some of his vast knowledge. But if you are looking for a very structured class with a set schedule, medieval travel is not for you (the readings were assigned on a weekly basis and were subject to change and, there was no way to know how you are doing in the class). Nonetheless, this was my most fun class this semester that while I did not need to put quite as much work into, I still learned a lot."
