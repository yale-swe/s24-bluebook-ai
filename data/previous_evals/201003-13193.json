   "comments": [
    "If needed for a Science credit, take it - well, more like bare it.",
    "Take it. It's a good introductory course and every educated person should know something about human evolution.",
    "Professor Watts is a good professor and wonderful in helping students out with questions or problems. He arranges review sections that he ran himself both for the midterm and the final (there were two review sections for finals) The TFs were really cool at helping you out with any problems as such. There are weekly study questions that you have to submit but they are not in essay form or as such and they serve as good study guides for the final. Overall the course is cool, at first it's kind of overwhelming, with the Australopithecus, the P. boisei etc but especially after the midterm it get much more interesting and it dwells with human mating, diseases etc. Also it's a science credit which is really cool for all of humanities majors and it does not actually involve a lot of hands down science. There are weekly labs (hence the science credit) but you do not really need to prepare for them and most are interesting (we got to handle bones) Anyway, an interesting class overall, would recommend it if you have a moderate interest in evolutionary theory or anthropology.",
    "Overall, the course is interesting, and not too difficult.However, some of the lectures can tend to drag on.",
    "Anth 116 deals with some really interesting evolutionary psychology--why we do what we do in terms of mating, food choices, group behavior, etc. I would recommend this for a student interested in human behavior. I enjoyed the class a lot and the workload is manageable.",
    "This is a good basic introduction to human evolution and behavior. If you are like me and simply want to take this class because you are interested in this subject matter, you will find yourselves in class with a lot of Anthropology majors and students who are trying to fulfill a science requirement. The material is interesting and Professor Watts is clearly very knowledgeable, though he is a bit of a monotonous lecturer (and this can make it a bit hard to focus your attention on the long PowerPoints). Lab will seem kind of pointless, but this is apparently the only way the class can count as a science credit. The book is interesting, as are the supplemental readings.",
    "This course, in content, is pretty interesting. Who hasn't wanted to know more about our species' history? However, Prof. Watts, while well-intentioned, is just a very lackluster lecturer. Very manageable workload, but then the tests are ridiculously difficult. You have to know every detail because the multiple choice is very particular and tricky.That being said, this is a good course to take for a Science credit or as a 5th course.",
    "The first half of the course covers the basics of genetics and evolutionary biology, primates, and the evolution that eventually led to the hominid lineage. The second half of the course looks at the specific evolution of hominids and the development and specifics of human behavior and appearance from an evolutionary standpoint. If you find the material inherently interesting, the class is tolerable, although it is made very dry by both the textbook and lecture style. Overall a pretty easy course with some interesting pockets; good way to fulfill an Sc or So credit without having to put in too much effort.",
    "only take this class if you need it for your major. it is a lot of memorization (you actually don't have to do the reading to do well in the class). i took this class thinking it would be easy but most of the students in the class were anthro majors so it was hard to do well with the curve.also, lectures were pretty boring and although section labs were interesting, the sections are held in the anthro lab on sachem st. which was inconvenient.",
    "Take this class if and only if you need a science credit. I took this and porn in the morn (no longer offered) to fulfill my requirement. I shopped this class 3 or 4 years in a row before finally giving in, but it really wasn't that painful a way to get the requirement finished.",
    "A fairly easy science credit. No overwhelming positives or negatives. Most of the material is fairly interesting, which is a plus.",
    "I would recommend if you need a science credit or are interested in subject matter. Not too much work, reading is heavy in first half but curtails after midterm. Tests are hard, lot of memorization in the first half, second is more theme based. Professor Watts is nice and usually helpful.",
    "Yes - it's a good class and an easy science credit.",
    "This class more or less looks at the origin of humans in terms of evolution. It covers broad concepts of the subject and is a good introduction for those interested either in Anthropology as a major or for people looking for a interesting Humanities\/Science credit. I would recommend this class because it is the type of class that you can dothe reading from the book if you so inclined, but if you have a lot going on, looking at the Powerpoints are just as helpful in preparing for the exams.",
    "Typical intro class - lectures boring at times, but just a midterm and a final with fairly straighforward problem sets. Good to get a sense of where humans came from, so I am glad I took it (very non-sciency science credit too). Multiple choice on exams is frustrating especially as the class is curved. Take it as an easy science credit or for an introduction to the material, but don't expect to be wowed.",
    "Easy science credit, just a lot of memorization. Pretty dull lectures but it's all in the power points.",
    "If you are looking for a relatively easy science credit I would highly recommend bio anthro. The material is accessible and Professor Watts does not expect in-depth knowledge, but a basic understanding. Problem sets and section are worth 30% of the grade which is really nice for people who aren't good at taking tests.",
    "I would recommend it to those who are interested in learning more about human evolution.",
    "The information is really interesting, especially the second half (the first half focuses primarily on primates and their biology, which can be a bit tedious, but the second half goes into Neandertals and cognition and evolutionary adaptations, which is cooler). This is definitely a class where, unless you are truly interested in human evolution and fossils and things, it's admittedly hard to stay motivated or involved. This is partially because lectures can seem long and drawn-out, with a slow pace. Lab is a nice addition to the curriculum, although a bit unnecessary; but it definitely helped to bring some of the drier aspects of the course alive. Weekly problem sets were kind of annoying to be honest. In the end I learned a lot, but mainly from studying for the midterm and the final.",
    "This course is good for someone who is very interested in Anthropology, but if you are taking this course to get a credit or fulfill a distributional requirement, I don't recommend this class.",
    "Great if you're looking for a science credit. The lectures are dry, but the material is REALLY interesting, I learned a lot, and the work load is totally manageable. It took this class as a total afterthought, but it ended up being my favorite course this semester.",
    "Sure if you want a science credit",
    "Its a lot about apes\/monkeys in the first half so if you are not interested in that part of the first stages of evolution towards humans then i would not recommend this class. if you can handle that first chunk then i would take it, i really liked the second half looking at neanderthals into modern humans.",
    "Anthropology 116 is a good science course for non-science majors. The first half of the course has a focus on human evolution, which can get complicated especially with all of the names, but the topics in the second half of the course were interesting.",
    "Painless Science. You're probably not going to enjoy it, but you won't dread it either. It's pretty neutral.",
    "The material in this course is super interesting-- evolution, primates, human behavior, etc. However, the course is excruciatingly boring. The lectures were dry, the labs were boring (and alwayswent ten minutes long, which is somewhat disrespectful to our time), and the problem sets were often based on material that we had not yet covered in lectures. The lectures themselves were interesting--the slides were good and chock full of information. The tests tested on random details, and it was never clear what was going to be on them. I really would not recommend this class unless you really want to learn about the material and are willing to put up with everything else.",
    "Anthro 116 is definitely a painless class for a non-science major. Like most non-science-major SC credits, you should expect it to be a little dumbed down--especially in section. The \"lab\" portion of the class honestly feels like high school (or middle school) level work, with worksheets and textbooks as the main base. That said, if you can get past that, it is actually a really interesting topic, and compared to many of these kinds of classes, I think you really can LEARN something new and interesting and valuable. It's a class that combines evolutionary theory with a more anthropological view on what makes humans unique, and the second half of the class especially gets into that in really layered and interesting ways. I definitely give it my vote for a great class to take if you're interested in the evolution of human life without getting into the ridiculous detail I hear History of Life and other such classes have. This is a class that cares a lot more about the broader importance of those details, that asks you to apply the specifics to a more theoretical view, and for that reason I feel I came out of the class with a much wider scope of knowledge.",
    "The material for Intro BioAnthro is interesting, and the class isn't too difficult, but Professor Watts is not the most engaging lecturer, although he is a very forgiving grader.",
    "I think it was an interesting and fun way to get a science credit, so I will recommend it to my friends if they are looking to fulfill that credit.",
    "I would not recommend it",
    "If you are interested in the material yes, otherwise might seem dry and pointless. Good way to get a science credit"
