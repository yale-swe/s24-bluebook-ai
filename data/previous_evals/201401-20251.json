   "comments": [
    "You just have to do this class, so get it over with. It's a pretty bad system overall",
    "Probably a required class so you probably have to take it. It's a good challenge and not an overwhelming amount of work, but it likely won't be your favorite class since it's straight from the textbook.",
    "MAth 120 is your standard multivariable math course. It's not easy and requires you to visualize a lot in 3-D, which can be very hard. Otherwise, if you're willing to put the work in, it is definitely managable. MAth 120 is obviously harder than Math 115 if you're choosing between the two, and between Math 120 and Enas 151, it definietly depends on which professor you have in each class. Otherwise, I wouldn't not reccomend, but I assume you're taking it because you need to and not because you simply love math.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you would consider yourself a \"math person.\" I found I had to learn a lot of the material on my own or rely on online resources. 115 prepares you well for it, but it is still challenging. Weekly problem sets, two midterms, final...standard math class.",
    "Only take this if you have to or REALLY want to.",
    "Interesting, but hard. You will learn a lot and feel accomplished at the end though",
    "MATH 120 is a multivariable calculus class. The class requires a really strong understanding of the concepts of single variable calculus, so I would not recommend taking this course if you do not have a strong background. The topics are interesting but become progressively harder to understand as the semester reaches the end because they are more complex. I would recommend using the peer tutors and other resources because they can help to clarify things that you are confused with in lecture.",
    "Pretty basic and useful (for math and physics) concepts introduced haphazardly. I wouldn't recommend the class because it was poorly taught, the material is important, but not thrilling, and it's often early in the morning. I often only felt things come together when I studied really hard before the midterms. Before and after everything was rather up in the air.",
    "If you can't get Miki, this will be an extremely difficult class. Study for the final.... as much as you possibly can.",
    "Math 120 is a challenging introductory math course that requires considerable dedication and concentration (for most people). I would recommend this course only to students who have a strong background in calculus.",
    "MATH120 was a good followup for Single Variable calculus, so I would recommend it if the student enjoyed Single Variable and wants to build on to those concepts.",
    "I would say take it, though recognize that the pace is quick and some of the material very difficult."
