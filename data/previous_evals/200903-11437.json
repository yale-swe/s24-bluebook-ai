    "This is the required class for all American Studies majors. If you are writing a fall-term or year-long essay, you must take this class. It meets every other week, and is all about the process. The other people won't know anything about your project, and you won't really be able to help them with theirs. But it's required.",
    "This is basically a support group for essay-writers. It is a fabulous way to actually learn about the amazing work that your peers are doing, and one of the only chances you will get to become intimately acquainted with the real craft of researching and formulating a topic for a long-term project. I loved feeling like I was part of a real intellectual community for the first time at Yale, sharing our ideas and giving suggestions and supporting each other through the research process. It was exciting to learn how to use the academic resources at Yale in a new way. This was an invaluable experience for me. It will also motivate you to really work on your essay draft, and it will stave off procrastination!",
    "Year-long senior INTENSIVE...not much else to say. You'll put in a lot and you'll get out a lot. Understand that doing a year-long project takes a ton of commitment; there were definitely times that I wanted to quit. Make sure you have a great adviser that's willing to work with you and that you feel comfortable with. Make sure you have a good idea of what you want to write about before you start the project; I thought I had a good idea, but then I realized I had nothing! It all worked out in the end though.",
    "If you are at all interested in going to graduate school, definitely take the year-long seminar because it allows you to go in-depth with your senior essay. Also, the resources and assistance you get throughout the process is so helpful. I have many friends in the history department who do not meet with their cohorts, nor do they have such rigid deadlines for their papers, and as a result, they get behind on their research. Because of the deadlines, I feel as though I am in really good shape to produce a well-researched and written senior essay.",
    "This class is a required course for the American Studies senior project. It essentially is a series of bimonthly workshops which helped with writing and research methods, including using Yale resources and peer editing. It keeps you up to speed and gives deadlines for drafts which are extremely helpful further down the line. I'm very glad that I had to write about half of my essay by the end of the first semester."
