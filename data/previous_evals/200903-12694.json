   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you're very interested in religious artwork from the North and are passionate about Art History--don't just take it because you like the Garden of Earthly Delights. Professor Wood is definitely a lecturer worth hearing while at Yale, and this is an interesting subject, but it's also a LOT of work (2 short papers, midterm, final, term paper, required visit to the Met), so be prepared for it!",
    "good lectures and readings. sometimes felt a bit demanding with the workload. great to be able to use the study collection at yuag. interesting artists to study.",
    "2 short papers, midterm, final paper, final. Interesting subject matter, but definitely difficult at times if you aren't well-versed in religion and religious studies.",
    "When Scully stepped down, I was kind of at a loss as to what HSAR class to take. The Northern Renaissance seemed like a really obscure place to begin. Now, at the end of the semester, I realize how much Northern art played a role in shaping modern art as we know it today. When we think of the Renaissance, we generally go straight to Italy, but in reality the Italian tradition was like a world unto itself. It was great, it was successful, but it was a dead end. The Northern Renaissance may seem a bit more obscure, but that's only because the iconoclasm brought about by the Protestant Reformation (which, obviously, did not affect Italy) destroyed and dispersed so much of the art.It might be a bias because I know more about Northern art than I do about Italian art, but I actually prefer the aesthetic. The Italians had a sugar-coated view of art and the world, while the Northerners maintained this fantastic, dark philosophical realism.Take this class. I don't know how I even went to museums before taking this class. From painting to engraving to woodcut to etching and finally to sculpture, you learn so much about the roots of modern art. It was fantastic.",
    "YES YES YES YES, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. It is accessible to students who have taken multiple classes in the art history department and those students who have never ever taken an art history class. Although there is quite a lot of work--2 short papers, 1 long research paper, a midterm, and final-- it is all well worth it. The TAs were great and Professor Wood is brilliant.",
    "HSAR 290 could not have been a better course. It is the quintessential college experience, what with the incredible lectures by Professor Wood, the sections in the art galleries, and the visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Although I could never adequately capture the insight and depth of Professor Wood'sinterpretations and theories, although I could never adequately paint a picture of the integrative body of knowledge of Northern Renaissance works provided to me by the lectures, I can say that each lecture was a masterpiece in itself.",
    "This is a great introductory class to non-survey art history courses. Take it if you like Durer, Bosch, Bruegel, Grunewald, van Eyck, van der Weyden, etc. If you hate christian art, this is not the class for you.",
    "This is a very interesting class, that provides its students with a solid background in Northern Renaissance Art, and as a result in the foundations of Western art in general. It is a great first art history class, and can be taken even if the student has little knowledge of art history or Christian ideology.",
    "Northern Renaissance is an unbelievable experience. Christopher Wood is a phenomenal lecturer and his vision for the class is cohesive and always exciting. The assignments are reasonable and so much fun to work on. Sections are incredible and so helpful in increasing knowledge. GET CHRISTINE SCHORFHEIDE AS A TA IF YOU CAN, she is a goddess. Everyone should take this class, it is not to be missed!",
    "Definitely take this class if you like art history, you come out of this class knowing how to talk about art and its a lot of fun!",
    "A good class, although slightly uneven. The tests and assignments can be frustrating, but lectures are great. Take a class with Prof. Wood! He is brilliant in lecture.",
    "If you like history of art, or appreciate art in general, this is a fantastic course. Exceptionally well planned out, exquisite slides, accessible TA's and a brilliant lecturer, this is one of the best Art History courses.",
    "YES! This class teaches about life through art.",
    "The material is a little off the beaten path, most people prefer art from the Italian Renaissance. Still, Wood is an amazing professor, and covers the material with a lot of knowledge and passion.",
    "This course offers an incredibly rewarding look at European art contemporaneous with the more well-known art of the Italian Renaissance. I would definitely recommend this both to the student who has studied the Italian Renaissance and to the student who hasn't but has an interest in art between 1400 and 1600. This might be a slightly demanding course if you have never taken an art history class before, but it is an excellent way to understand how to approach analyzing and writing about art. Finally, Christopher Wood is an amazing lecturer; he is a pleasure to listen to and is a well of information, so just getting to know him is reason enough to take the course.",
    "This subject is interesting and everyone should take a class with Wood at some point.However, the structure of the class at this time is not entirely thought out, the assignments are easy for a non-Art History major, but a joke for an Art History major. There is little to no guidance on the format for the midterm and final, at least at this time, which makes studying hard.",
    "History of Art 290 was an interesting course that looked at Northern Renaissance Art. With some historical context, and a detailed look into how the works of art were created, this course spent much of its time looking and discussing the paintings and prints of the North. I would recommend this class to anyone with some interest in art. Professor Wood's discussions were always incredibly interesting, the 50 minute lectures flew by every time. Sections were also extremely interesting and, as YUAG has many of the prints discussed we spent a lot of time looking up close at the works in the gallery."
