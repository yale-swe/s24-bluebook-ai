   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend it",
    "The opportunity to brainstorm with some of the best minds in the department about topics that excite them and that are still highly exploratory.I would recommend this class. Despite the high variability in the quality of the class the good sections were excellent and compensated for the others (which overall were more slow and contrived than truly poor sections). The ability to discuss some of the cutting-edge or controversial areas of immunology with the faculty here is a tremendous opportunity.",
    "Great class. Very interesting and helped me figure out what areas of immuno I'm interested in (and which I'm not).",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in the broader implications of the immunology field. Whereas the introductory course served to familiarize you with the breadth of material that comprises this discipline, the advanced course provided great insight into some large and significant questions, and how to perhaps look into addressing them.",
    "Each week you attend a lecture and a discussion lead by a different professor. It's a good way to get a broad overview of various research fields in immunology since the course focuses more on the topics themselves and is not run as a journal club type of class.",
    "I would recommend 531 to other students simply because getting this level of exposure to multiple faculty can be incredibly important in learning about the department and becoming a better scientist.This class offers you an opportunity to learn the subtle differences between instructors. You learn their biases and their backgrounds, and you learn to navigate around these differences in seminar and in HW responses.Some lectures like the classes on evolution, bioinformatics, bioengineering or microbiota (especially hard to pick up and Kleinstein's presentation was awesome) were incredibly useful and interesting."

   "comments": [
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of many areas of immunobiology which will be extremely valuable for my thesis research.",
    "This course extended my knowledge of immunology both in breadth and in depth. I was exposed to topics I would not normally be interested about and I was also challenged to think more about topics that interested me.",
    "Nice broad introduction to immunology, without just being a rehashing of IBIO 530.",
    "We read many papers in this course, which helped me understand the important challenges in this field.",
    "By having different professors come in each week, I felt I gained a much broader perspective on the different areas of research inimmunology. This will definitely impact the research I do and the hypotheses I form.",
    "This course was very useful in helping me in my research."
