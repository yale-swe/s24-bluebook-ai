    "This was a remarkable class. I saw so many things I would never have seen at Yale. And with only the weekly readings (a skimming will suffice), a final paper, and a final exam, there is very little work. It's like going on a fun field trip once a week to explore things you didn't know existed on campus -- and you get to discuss these treasures with the experts! A great way to end my Yale career.",
    "Yes, but probably better as a credit\/d class than for a grade. The classes are amazing and you get to see so many great collections, but it is hard to connect all the classes into a cumulative test or paper, which makes studying or writing for the course very complicated and difficult.",
    "The best class at Yale. By the end of the semester, this was a know fact on campus. This class truly epitomized what it means to \"learn.\" \"Treasures\" presented a broad, yet gloriously thoughtful education of people, history, and ideas. If you value primary materials, or studying amazing objects, this class is for you. You might just not be able to handle its amazingness\u0097 or Professor Bloch, if he decides to teach thecourse again. Hopefully he will, because then you'll get to experience how much cooler he is than you are.",
    "I would recommend it, but as a credit\/d class so you can really enjoy the lectures but not worry as much about the final and readings.",
    "Great course! Lots of reading each week but the topics are interesting (and you can kind of get by without doing ALL of the reading ALL of the time). Each lecture is independently fascinating, and Professor Bloch is great and funny. DEFINITELY take this course!",
    "Treasures of Yale and Howard Bloch are, interestingly, two real treasures of Yale. Each week you visit a different museum or collection at Yale (from the Peabody to the furniture gallery to rare musical instruments to the Beinecke to the medical library to an amazing off-campus theater library in a charmingly decorated house called the Lewis-Walpole), look at a huge array of extremely interesting, rare, and often valuable objects, listen to lectures from eminent scholars and professors who are world leaders in their field, and participate in discussions about what you learned. Each week there is a relatively large amount of reading assigned, usually a combination of background reading related to the general subject and some specific articles about the objects you will be looking at in detail. First, this is an excellent way to be exposed to all of Yale's amazing collections (who knew Yale had tons of coins from 400 BC, or a collection of rare meteors, or one of the finest Stradivarius violins* in the world?). Second, Howard Bloch is an AMAZING professor who is very organized, very fair, very nice, and excellent at facilitating interesting discussion for the huge range of topics covered by this course. Apparently, he knows everything. He is in email contact each week with the assigned readings, the meeting location, and gives you ample warning for weeks with a lot of reading. While we are on the topic, there is actually a lot of reading each week (I'd say 3-7 hours), and it is actually pretty important to do the readings to do well on the final. The grading includes one large term paper based around something you saw in the collections and museums (which includes everything, ever, so it is easy to find a topic of interest to you) and a final which is 50 identifications for which you must choose 40 to answer. Professor Bloch gives a review session which is very helpful for the finalHmm I was making a list about why to take the course, so I need one more bullet point... Third: cross off 15 items from your bucket list as you visit tons of epic Yale places (the brain room! The vertebrate zoology collections with rare birds such as the resplendent quetzal! The secret room of coins and medals!)Seriously. Take this course. TAKE THIS COURSE! It is amazing.*If you take this course, you get to hold the Stradivarius",
    "The week-to-week \"field trips\" of this class is awesome. You get to see a lot of really cool Yale collections (i.e. the musical instruments collection, the Walt Whitman collection, the bird collection, the coin collection, etc.) However, there is a whole lot of reading, so recommend you take it Cr\/D.",
    "for anyone who wants to know more about some of the rich resources that are at Yale, those of which are broad and wide-spanning"
