    "This is really tough for me to answer. I like the teachers themselves in the Arabic program but the curriculum needs a lot. of. work. If you're already up to L4 this is probably old news to you - you already understand that Al Kitaab is a mess of a textbook, that the vocab follows no rhyme or reason and focuses way too much on specialized concepts you don't care about or every tiny grammar concept for case endings and internal vowelling that you literally never plan to use. That said, I think the program \/ department is becoming aware that there's a curriculum problem and are hoping to make some changes and improvements. I'm glad I took this class of course because I wanted to learn Arabic, and I'm better at it than I was beforehand. But I had a lot of problems with the curriculum, basically because it follows Al-Kitaab to the letter, which I think is a totally useless textbook.",
    "Probably not",
    "I would recommend it. Learning arabic is challenging but is such an important step for anyone looking to engage with the Middle East at any point during their lives. Also the department at Yale is small, so taking Arabic the whole way through opens the doors to many scholarships, summer programs and post-grad fellowships.",
    "I took Arabic 140 to complete my language requirement and also because I hoped to master Arabic language, for I have been learning it for a few years now. However, I would not recommend Arabic 140 for other students unless they absolutely want\/need to. It is not the most effectively designed class, and if the class was anything like this semester, there are simply too many students in one class that it is impossible to feel completely engaged in class.",
    "A continuation of L3 with a lot more vocab.",
    "This is an Arabic course, not much else to say. Its like Arabic 130, but +10. We do the second half of the book. Have fun :-)",
    "It really depends on who you have as a teacher.",
    "Arabic 140 is mostly grammar and a whole lot of vocabulary. Get ready for some truly bizarre word units (I know how to talk about the Crusaders and the Middle Ages... but I'm still not entirely sure how you order at a restaurant...) and a lot of super detailed grammar. Not a whole lot of conversation, especially if you have a big class (which may or may not be a plus, depending on your particular Arabic style...)",
    "I would recommend this class if Ustadha Elham was teaching it, otherwise I might tell people to go do Directed Independent Language Study instead. The Arabic program as it stands needs an overhaul.",
    "Arabic 140 continues and completes the second Al-Kitaab book that was started in 130. There is perhaps more emphasis on listening and reading comprehension in this course than in past ones. However, the structure of the class is similar to L3 and similarly challenging.",
    "Yes, Arabic is a great language! There are, however, some issues with the curriculum (especially because Arabic includes dialects and a formal standard version. It will be much better in the future if the classes are separated into MSA (fusha) and dialect (shaami).) I would definitely recommend if Ustatha Elham is teaching it! The class can be a lot of work, especially the biweekly reading and writing assignments, but if you put in the work you can learn a lot. Be prepared in 140 to greatly increase your reading and writing skills but not so much your spoken communication. That probably will have to wait for studying abroad or if Yale changes the curriculum in the future."
