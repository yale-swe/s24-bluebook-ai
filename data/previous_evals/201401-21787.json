   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a moderately challenging QR or SC credit. You have to keep up with your work consistently over the course of the semester, but the material is really interesting.",
    "A great survey intro course to astronomy. Rigorous, but still approachable for non science majors.",
    "If you're just looking for a science credit, this is fine but it is not a gut. Expect to put in some work on the problem sets in the second half of the semester. It gets more difficult.",
    "Take this if you were pretty good at science in high school and want a science credit. The math is all pretty straightforward and reminds me of standard high school chemistry and physics. Some of the stuff you learn isn't that interesting but Professor Kenney is such a bro that it makes up for it.",
    "If you are trying to take this class as a gut science or QR credit I would say steer clear-it is harder than you think. I consider myself a strong math student, and while the math in the class is basic, sometimes the problem sets can take a bit of time because they are tedious and involve copious unit conversions. If you are genuinely interested in the universe, I would highly recommend this class and would say that you will learn quite a bit you did not know before and garner a much better understanding of the vast spacial expanse our Solar System occupies. For me, this class answered many of my questions about the universe but raised even more, thus sparking an interest in space that did not formerly exist. Kenney is a good teacher and the forays into black holes and relativity are particularly interesting. This class would be excellent if there wasn't such a large focus on the math side of the problem sets.",
    "take it",
    "You're almost certainly taking this for the Sc\/QR - this is one of the best ways to fulfill it. The psets aren't bad, Prof Kenney makes terrible jokes but is a decent guy, and you'll know some weird and mindblowing stuff about space afterwards. Would recommend.",
    "Great course that teaches you a lot",
    "Definitely take this! The workload is very manageable and the material is interesting. Kenney is awesome, super entertaining and a great teacher. It's really not that difficult either. Just a mid-term, a final, and weekly homework. You also get basically free points for attendance and reading quizzes that are based on completion. This is a great way to get a science credit, or just an interesting course to take regardless.",
    "Excellent class. One of the most interesting and well-taught out there.",
    "Really interesting class. Science based but not too heavy on science... Mostly pretty easy physics stuff. Not too much work, about a problem set a week. Definitely take it you will not regret it.",
    "this was a good class, again i'm not a STEM-major so i definitely enjoyed having a chance to explore topics i wouldn't normally engage with, and for people with a similar background to mine (humanities) who are curious about the universe or galaxies, i'd say go for it",
    "This is a great course to fill a science distributional requirement in a meaningful way. I learned a lot, felt challenged, but not in over my head. Grades also come from many places, which requires more work but takes the pressure off big tests such as midterm and final.",
    "Great course for QR credit if you are good at math\/physics. Otherwise, don't take it.",
    "Definitely take this course! I took it for my science credit and it ended up being super fun and pretty painless.",
    "Really good intro class to take if you are interested in astronomy or need a science class. It isn't a complete gut by any means but getting a good grade is easily doable if you put a decent kind of effort in. Professor Kenney is hilarious and a good lecturer who I would highly recommend to anyone - since attendance is mandatory it's nice to at least have a good shot at being entertained during most classes. It isn't particularly fancy, complicated math if that is what you are looking for but ASTR 120 is a great balance of some basic math and a good intro to concepts in astronomy that I would definitely suggest to other students if they are interested.",
    "I would heartily recommend Galaxies and the Universe. It taught me a lot of really interesting material, and it never felt onerous."
