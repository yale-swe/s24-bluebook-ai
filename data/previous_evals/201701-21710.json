   "comments": [
    "If you pick a good topic and advisor, this will be a good culmination of the history major.",
    "Writing a history thesis taught me so much about doing research, developing an argument, writing an extended paper, using footnotes, and revising and writing economically, not to mention the knowledge I gained about my topic. Ive really had no experience like it ever.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount during the senior essay process, both about my topic and also about my own academic insecurities, writing habits, etc.",
    "I learned how to do primary source research, write a well structured thesis, and do independent research.",
    "Analysis of a primary source document, contextualizing with secondary sources and synthesizing my insights into an argument.",
    "Although challenging, the senior essay has been one of my best academic experiences. It bettered my research, analysis, and argumentative skills, as well as pushing me to engage deeply with other works on the topic.",
    "Writing a year-long research project. I learned about research methodology, writing stamina, and planning my sustained argument over a long stretch of pages.",
    "Self-direction, independent research, working with librarians \/ advisor \/ history department, developing own methodology, justifying my own sources",
    "I learned how to plan, research and write a 12,500 word essay.",
    "Unquestionably became a better writer and researcher after completing my senior essay.",
    "Absolutely none. I developed all of my research and writing skills from previous history courses.",
    "Research",
    "Completing the senior essay allowed me to investigate thoroughly a single topic, for me, the development of Catholic canon law in France during the Middle Ages. More generally, I learned skills relative to how to complete a significant research project and a long, final paper.",
    "Professor Eire is wonderful; I do not know of any other professor like him. He is very down-to-earth in guiding his students and engaging in real conversation. He is just as much a friend as he is a professor, and encourages students to do their best with his good company. His understanding, knowledge, and abilities in research and teaching are incredible. He is also not afraid to speak the truth about the suffering and oppression in the world that so many people at Yale deliberately turn a blind eye to-especially in his native Cuba. Deserves to be treated much better by the University.",
    "I further strengthened my ability to locate and analyze primary sources, write a long paper in sections, and uncover previously unknown information",
    "How to research something on a much larger scale than I've had to do in the past",
    "My senior essay experience was really wonderful. I developed skills in archival research, critical analysis of secondary sources, and organizing and revising a lengthy academic work. In particular, my advisor, Crystal Feimster, was a wonderful person to work with. She gave me incredible guidance and feedback every step of the way. She has made me a much better historian.",
    "Ability to organize and execute a large research project. Writing and critical analysis skills developed. Interview skills improved.",
    "I loved writing my thesis! It was a really intellectually fulfilling experience.",
    "Good practice doing original research, academic writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The various deadlines throughout the year are really helpful at keeping us on pace. Bi-weekly meetings with Professor Blight were beneficial and enjoyable, as he always pushed me in wise directions and expressed so much enthusiasm for my work. The quick turnaround of the final daft after spring break was a bit difficult, but it worked, and it was nice to have the thesis out of the way for the final weeks of the semester.",
    "I think it would be helpful if the history department could set one or two writing deadlines in the spring, before the full rough draft is due before spring break. My advisor did this for her advisees, but I know that was not the case for everyone.",
    "The History Senior Essay is relatively well-monitored. I'd say it could use a little more department oversight in the first semester for those who are doing a two-semester thesis.",
    "The strengths were having a great advisor and great resources within the history department. The weaknesses were that there is a disparity among advising quality within the department.",
    "The one on one learning with the advisor is wonderful. I wish the assignments\/deadlines in the first semester had more relation to the end product.",
    "Perhaps would be beneficial if there were some standards\/guidelines set for student\/advisor meetings? There is definitely a range of engagement and it could be helpful to have the department set some sort of basis so that students don't feel it is on them to ask their advisors to meet more regularly.",
    "The senior essay handbook was very helpful and the deadlines in the fall were clear. Perhaps being more clear about deadlines in the spring would also be helpful.",
    "The deadlines 1st semester were tedious and I didn't think the shorter assignments were especially helpful",
    "Making the first draft deadline a week earlier would give more contact time for improving the final essay.",
    "I think the deadlines for assignments should be on Mondays and not Fridays, as they often were in the first semester. This made submitting them more stressful and gave me less time to complete them as I would have liked. I also think some of the assignments are unnecessary--no reason for the three-page primary source analysis. This is something almost every undergraduate history course at Yale assigns to its students, so doing it for the thesis felt redundant. I also think an info session should be given at the beginning of the year on some of the untapped archives filed away in the depths of sterling. Students should be steered toward using these resources, as it is much easier to complete research at Yale than it is to do it elsewhere. There is also so much here no one knows about!",
    "While my advisor (Jay Gitlin) was very involved with my research process throughout the school year, I had friends whose advisors did not take the time to meet with them on a regular basis, provide them with feedback, and ensure that they stayed on track as Professor Gitlin did for me. As a result, these friends struggled considerably in the weeks before the due date. Thanks to Professor Gitlin's guidance, I was not in this position.",
    "There should be a spreadsheet or some sort of evaluation method for advisors. Unless the advisors are engaged, the project is hard, tedious and pointless. Guidance is needed and some advisors are not engaged or extremely difficult to speak to.",
    "No improvement neccesary",
    "I believe the history department largely creates useful guidelines. My single recommendation would be to have more pages of writing due earlier in the process. Often, I find that needing to write forces more concentrated and targeted reading and research. Being forced to write earlier might have helped me spin wheels a bit less. One of the largest strengths was my adviser, Professor Anders Winroth, who was incredibly gracious with his time and generous with his feedback. The adviser system is incredible and offers a unique opportunity to work in close proximity with a fascinating professor.",
    "I had a wonderful experience working with my advisors Joanne Freeman and Edward Rugemer who did a great job of guiding me when necessary and allowing me the independence necessary as well. I thought that having steps along the way was also useful, however, I chose to write a 10 page outline rather than 10 pages of the essay, which I think should definitely be an option. Writing an outline enabled me to use this step to plan where my essay was going rather than write 10 pages that would not quite fit anywhere in the paper.",
    "The handbook is AWESOME! I think the bibliographic essay is a bit odd... What if a symposium was considered? I know most other majors facilitate SOME contact between other students. Even if it was informal\/ optional.",
    "I think the history department should do a better job of communicating about deadlines and submission procedures for intermediate assignments. Making sure we know in advance how we will be expected to submit each assignment would be very helpful.",
    "I needed more advisor guidance than I received.",
    "A crucial component of the Yale history experience. The most difficult thing I've done at Yale, but probably the most rewarding.",
    "If you get a disinterested advisor you're going to have a bad time.",
    "The senior thesis is a really good chance to engage in depth with a topic and get to do real history primary source research of a type most of the courses I have taken have not. I do think the major in general could have been designed a bit better to set students up for doing this type of research--the first time I ever learned to do archival research was when I showed up at an archive in Europe this winter break on my history department-funded thesis research trip. I figured it out, but it would have been helpful to have had a bit more preparation. Looking back, it's kind of crazy that I completed the history major at Yale, with all our archival collections in the Beineke, Sterling, etc., and never had any coursework that made use of any of that material. I think it would have been nice if we had a archive tutorial session at the Beineke for all the history majors, perhaps Junior spring or something My main complaint about the thesis is that although working on it was a very fulfilling and challenging intellectual exercise for me personally, I received very little feedback from Yale faculty over the course of the project. My advisor and most other peoples' advisors that I heard about did not give any feedback on any of the completion assignments for the first semester. My advisor gave helpful feedback and advice in meetings and on my draft, but my grader basically no feedback at all, nor did he return my essay, so although I am happy with my grade I don't really feel like I learned anything at all about how I could improve on this type of writing after completing the thesis."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend doing a full-year thesis to other history students. Its a great climax to your experience as a history major here. You take the research and writing skills youve learned in seminars and take them to next level. Theres no project that compares to writing a full-length thesis; you develop so much as a scholar, a researcher, and a writer. The deadlines are well-designed to keep you moving along but not too overbearing. Its an incredible journey to undertake, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "Do it! One of the most rewarding Yale experiences I've had thus far.",
    "Yes. I would recommend all history majors do the full year senior essay.",
    "It's the capstone of the History major. Worth the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is very exciting to feel like you are engaging academically on a new level and it is a wonderful capstone experience.",
    "Absolutely! a 2-term essay is recommended.",
    "yes, satisfying experience",
    "Gotta do it for the major.",
    "No but it's mandatory.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend the two-semester senior essay to any history students dedicated to the study of history. This course offers a unique opportunity to follow personal interests while working closely with Yale's incredible faculty. It is difficult and strenuous, but, in the end, was well worth all of the work and effort put in throughout the semester.",
    "Tes",
    "yes",
    "Yes, as it is a mandatory requirement. However, it did definitely feel like the capstone of my Yale career as a history major",
    "The senior essay is a very rewarding experience. I recommend doing your archival research as early as humanly possible - the summer before senior year or October\/Thanksgiving break are really the times to do it. That gives you time to adjust your topic to make sure you are writing about something you are really fascinated by. Make sure you don't leave it to the last minute, put effort into revising, and it will be a wonderful experience!",
    "Do a two semester essay on a topic you're interested in. Otherwise, why are you here?",
    "Absolutely!",
    "It's a requirement of the major, so... yes.",
    "Good experience--definitely do this instead of one semester essay."
