    "Chinese 153 is a lot of work, but well worth it! Take this class if you want to improve your Chinese quickly, but keep in mind that it has only native speakers, so make sure you can handle the course when you're shopping it.",
    "It's a great class if you haven't done Chinese for a while but have a strong Chinese background from when you were young. It's not too intense because it's only 3 days a week, but it's intense enough for you to keep up with your vocab and learning",
    "ALOT of work. Be prepared to spend at least 7-8 hrs per week on chinese, at least initially. Once you get the hang of it, once your own dictionary of characters expands, it tapers down to about 4-5 hrs per week.Take it, though, if you want a drastic improvement in Chinese. I took the class to get better at Chinese, not to necessarily improve my GPA (like many other language classes do)",
    "take it. absolutely. I hated Chinese school but managed to kind of enjoy this class while learning a ton.",
    "This class will challenge you but is worth it. Unless you grew up speaking Chinese constantly at home, it will be tough and will take a lot of work."
