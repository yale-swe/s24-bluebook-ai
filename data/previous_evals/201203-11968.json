   "comments": [
    "French 140 is a rather advanced french course, which tackles more than just the basic grammar, vocabulary and conjugation but also handles literary analysis, insights into French and Francophone history\/culture and demands a lot of oral work on the part of students. I strongly recommend this course.",
    "French IV is a tried and true course. It is very well structured and greatly improves the French of any student who takes it seriously. It does a good job of using a variety of media\u00e2\u0080\u0094novels, stories, audio-recordings, and movies\u00e2\u0080\u0094to help a student work on reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The grammar in the course packet is also very well presented, which makes the Baron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grammar book sort of superfluous. I suggest not buying it at all. The work for the class is very consistent (homework almost every night and bi-weekly exams and essays), but it makes the work more manageable in the end. Highly recommended if you want to improve your French.",
    "This class had an abundance of unusually depressing texts but the professor's great, and it is helpful for French grammar.",
    "French 140 was a work-intensive but mostly worthwhile course. I would recommend this course for a student with holes in grammar and vocabulary, but not so much for a student looking to improve his\/her speaking skills.",
    "Yes, great class. Lots of work on important grammatical structures through exercises and student's own writing (creative and essay form).",
    "A combinations of reading short texts on the subject of diversity and immigrations, literature, grammar, and vocabulary. Homework included exercises due almost every day which are short and help you to keep up with the material. In the classroom there was lots of conversation in which you're expected to participate. I would recommend this class for someone who wants to reinforce grammar, learn new vocabulary, and also read interesting texts.",
    "Recommend this class for anyone, regardless of future ambitions with the language. Develops language skills to the point where one feels confident saying he knows the language. Strong exposure to the culture.",
    "Take this class with Faure-Bellaiche! She is a fantastic teacher- kind and really good at starting interesting discussions."
