    "I thought the class ran too slowly. We often had lots of extra time at the end of class when more material could ahve easily been covered. I left feeling like I could learn more with the expendature of a little extra effort.",
    "Question 2: Professor Tomlin spent far too much time telling us about the way ESRI programmers think and not nearly enough showing us practical examples of the tools we're given. I estimate that of the total class time for the semester (39 hours = 13 meetings x 3 hours max per) we spent maybe 9 hours actually watching Professor Tomlin show us how a tool was actually used in ArcMap. The rest of the time was reserved for silly anecdotes, attacks against well-meaning programmers none of us will ever meet, and a bizarre habit of ending class early instead of showing us the same tools in several different examples and contexts, as would happen in any other class. As a paying consumer of this school's products, that's not nearly good enough.Unforunately, Professor Tomlin's attitude towards his students was frequently confusing and inconsistent. Grading policies and standards seemed to be all over the map, and several students agreed with me that your \"fate\" for the semester seemed decided by your first 2-3 assignments. For someone who professes not to care for grading, Professor Tomlin sure does spend a lot of time talking about it, perhaps to justify the absurdity of his system. It's not that the grades themselves were the issue - we're graduate students, it isn't the end all be all - the issue is the closely related and highly stress-inducing problem that we didn't know what was expected of us from week to week, or what the critical lessons and take-aways from each lecture were.Lastly, and most upsettlingly, Professor Tomlin's communications, especially via email, often came across as flippant and unsympathetic to students who were doing their best but remained confounded by his eccentric style. The most bizarre episode was when, during the week of what was considered by many to be the most difficult homework assignment, Professor Tomlin sent out a Word document with a collection of questions and answers that had been emailed to him throughout the semester. But the questions were in no particular order and lacked any labelling that would help put them in context. Most had short sentences for answers, and many seemed to be included more because the questions were \"dumb\" than because the answers were helpful. It was several pages of glib nonsense, and it was one of the most smug, derisive, insulting things I have ever seen from a faculty member.",
    "My response to question #2, being the teacher was magnificently clear, is completely honest. I can't imagine Dana being more clear, especially with a subject like ESRI's software.",
    "I have never met a professor at Yale or elsewhere as responsive as Dana Tomlin. He replies to emails within 24 hours and always with an answer that solves whatever problem you're facing, no matter how incoherently you as a student describe it. He is a complete master of the material. His self authored ArcGIS handouts are extremely useful.",
    "Lectures were well done. TOmlin is very resposive and helpful via email.",
    "Dana and Eliza were excellent.My only suggestion is that Yale should try to get Dana to spend more time on campus so he can teach the course in two sessions\/week. As it is, one three-hour session per week was often hard to take. It sometimes was just too much material. It'd be so much better to have Dana present a smaller amount of material in a classroom with computers and then to have time for students to practice it, and to break the class into two sessions per week. I understand that the classes would have to be smaller to fit into a room with computers. It'd be worth it; students would learn so much more.",
    "The instructor is wonderful - he knows everything and makes himself available to students to an incredible degree.However, the assignments, while the key learning experience in the class, often were frustrating. There were some issues with version 9\/version 10 but in several assignments, the wording was unclear and a lot of tinkering was required. Personally, I would have learnt more if I had a clear assignment to follow and then the opportunity to tinker with the program for one or two final flourishes in the assignment. But everyone learns differently!",
    "The work load for this class was VERY heavy, especially for students with no prior knowledge of GIS. The reason I dropped this course was because I did not have enough time to study the worksheets and complete the assignments correctly and adequately.The worksheets compiled for the course were excellent. Very detailed, with plenty of diagrams. I hope to be able to use these same worksheets to learn GIS on my own, with more time, at my own pace.It would have been very helpful for the instructor to mention the immense amount of time the course requires, so that students could have planned adequately."

He is also very responsive to student concerns and questions. In addition, I really enjoyed learning about GIS and how it is used.",

    "Dana's lectures were outstanding. I was a little skeptical of tackling this material in a lecture setting instead of in a lab but he proved that it works well.Although the homework assignments were long and often quite tedious, they were really addictive and quite fun.Dana's animated, kinetic teaching style was also a highlight.I also appreciated Dana's willingness to explain any grade that he had given us. I greatly appreciated his frank comments and willingness to be flexible.",

   "comments": [
    "The amount of material covered was too small",
    "This school needs GIS education. If anything, it needs more than it has now. Professor Tomlin may be esteemed, but he is ineffective in this context. This class would be most improved by having a professor who was committed to teaching students, not showing them how much smarter he is or ending class 90 minutes early every week.",
    "I think this class should have two TA's. If you go to the computer lab during TA office hours, she's running around like crazy, poor thing, and it's difficult for students to get a good block of time with her.The handouts from the Professor are full of useful information, but they're very difficult to navigate. It can take a while to find which document has the info you're looking for. The Professor should get some $$ to hire a student assistant to turn all those Word docs into hyperlinked text. That would be amazing.",
    "Nothing!",
    "The TA is not helpful at all.",
    "Final assignment was too broad. More specifics (like data options) would have been helpful.",
    "Slow start to the beginning of the course. Some weeks seemed a little more thin on content than others.",
    "Nothing",
    "the instructor made fun of some students and called some legitimate questions \"dumb\". makes it hard to ask questions in this environment.",
    "I wish Prof. Tomlin was at FES all the time! (&we didn't have to share him with other universities :)",
    "I found it difficult to keep up because I had a laptop that didn't have the power to run ArcGIS well. It was therefore difficult to follow along in class and get that practice in class. This made my learning much slower. If possible, I would suggest providing a few (up to 10?) laptops with GIS for the class time that would enable those students who don't have a laptop or who don't have a powerful enough laptop to be able to follow along as well.",
    "More than one TA or a TA that is enthusiastic and more knowledgeable than the class",
    "There was a lack of clarity about what the final assignment would be. It worked out well in the end, but I would have appreciated a clear explanation well ahead of time.I would also have appreciated 2 minutes per class dedicated to highlighting outstanding work done by my fellow classmates. Dana left the graded homeworks for all to see but it would have been nice to hear him comment in class with a visual aid on some of the better ( or worse) assignments.",
    "Add a second TA. This would help increase the amount of time for one-on-one assistance.",
    "See above.",
    "I understand the constraints, but having the class twice a week instead of once a week would have helped me gain more from lectures. At a certain point, it's just too much.",
    "The course needs more guided lab work as the assignments are difficult for a first time userto figure out on their own.",
    "Perhaps a better way to engage students during class. But this might be very personal- I am not a strong student in technology. I found myself having a lot of difficulty keeping up in class. I know other students had a much easier time than I did."

For GIS, being available via email is a far more effective way to be helpful than holding office hours. I contacted Dana frequently via email and he was very helpful each time.I did not use Eliza as much but the one time I went to her office hours she was helpful.",
