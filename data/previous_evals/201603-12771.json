    "A good introduction to Queueing Theory and Dynamic Programming. For the first part, we understood the methodology that is used and we can now use it in our research. Fro the second part, that was more complicated, what matters after all is that we know that some things can be done using dynamic programming and we also know where to look for the methodology. In general, the course offered useful research tools."

    "Great materials. Very helpful.",
    "The final paper presentation is a very good idea, that exposes us to applications of the theory in different fields. In my opinion, in the midterm we needed some more time. The difficulty was moderate. Some of the queueing theory assignments were just applications of theory that we would not cover. (It's a way of creating exercises, but not the best). I would also like to receive real feedback from the grader of the assignments. It is positive that the TA uploaded solutions, but I would like more feedback on my solutions."

    "Yes, if you are very interested in queueing models or DP, this is the very best course to take.",
    "Yes, because it is a very good introduction in Operations Research. Following the book guided by the Professor helps build strong foundations."
