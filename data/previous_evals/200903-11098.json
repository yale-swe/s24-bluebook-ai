    "Math 544 is a fairly self-contained introduction to homotopy theory and homology, with a brief glimpse of cohomology at the end. I would recommend it to a well-prepared student. My own preparation was thin, and Professor Casson had some doubts about my taking the course. I'm glad I did, and I'd recommend it to others with similar backgrounds, but with any less I probably would have been in trouble. So what do you need? Topology up through quotient spaces is very important; algebra certainly through groups. If you've seen free groups or pushout diagrams, that will be helpful, but Casson will cover the material without assuming you've seen it, so you should be fine if not (I had not).",
    "I would surely recommend it another student. It covered a lot of portion and almost no prerequisites were assumed."

   "comments": [
    "The course exposed me to a lot of topology I hadn't seen, obviously, and it also showed me much more sophisticated applications of algebra than I had run across before. That was very helpful. I do not intend to research topology, so it is unclear so far how it will contribute to my dissertation when I start one, but I suspect it will be very useful."
