   "comments": [
    "Interesting material, but the course lacks structure. If you're the type who doesn't learn much from lectures anyway this course might be for you, but otherwise stay away. Not much work until the final presentation\/grant proposal at the end, which was a killer during reading week. Start it early!",
    "Chill class that covers some pretty interesting areas of BME. Lectures can get a bit disorienting, but the class is more focused on discussion of recent developments in immunity, and Professor Fahmy is very supportive if you do decide to design something novel related to the course material.",
    "Excellent class to learn more about the field of biomedical engineering and immunology.",
    "Class focused on innovations in immunology. I'd recommend it to another student, but perhaps not a freshmen, to whom it might be a bit intimidating.",
    "BENG 463 is a great upper elective course. Tarek is super nice and helpful. However, if you are the type of person who needs a strict structure this class might be slightly stressful for you. The materials aren't always uploaded in a timely fashion. However, immunoengineering is exciting to learn about. Just make sure you keep up with the work and take good notes during class.",
    "It's a very interesting and laid back class on how advances in biomedical engineering can improve the field of immunology. You don't get exposed to too much in either BME or Immuno, and the material can seem repetitive, annoying, or confusing at times, but it's really fascinating once you understand what you need to know. Term project is fun and great to work on, although the paper for it can be a headache. All in all, I'd recommend it.",
    "BENG465 is a course that unites academic science and research in the form of an immunology class. The course begins with a survey of immunology and progresses to case studies of specific experiments and papers relevant to the field. After previous work in research and academics are addressed, students unite the two in practice with their own research project. I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a comprehensive, encompassing view connecting academics with practice."
