   "comments": [
    "I gained a lot of general knowledge about ancient philosophy, and different philosophers. Since it's pretty much a survey course, that's what I expected.",
    "This course was excellent, with comprehensive readings, clear lectures, and a dedicated focus on two main ideas (the relation between metaphysics and epistemology, and conceptions of happiness). I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a clearer understanding of the philosophical roots of the Western Tradition.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of Ancient Greek philosophy from the Pre-Socratics to the Hellenistic philosophers, and the ability to write thorough philosophical papers including textual analysis and original arguments.",
    "This was my first foray into Philosophy, and I learned a lot about the origins of philosophical knowledge. The biggest takeaways were Plato's Theory of Forms and Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics. I would say the knowledge of the pre-Socratics and post-Aristotelian philosophers were helpful as well, to get a background in the traditions that make up much of Ancient Philosophy. It was very cool to see how Ancient Philosophy influenced Christian theology and Eastern works such as the Bhagavad Gita that I studied in another one of my courses.",
    "Great overview of ancient philosophy, course does what it's supposed to",
    "I learned about ancient thinkers and about how to critique their views and personally philosophize.",
    "Developed argumentative skills. Considerable time in assignments was dedicated to working on phrasing an argument or idea in a way that is easily understood while specific enough to make a point. Gave a decent decent sense of metaphysics\/epistemology of Plato and Aristotle.",
    "Learning how to write a philosophy paper was useful and different and fun",
    "I learned how to balance nightly reading in a college course. I also learned how to think thoughtfully and logically about philosophical contents, such as coming up with my own objections and responses to existing philosophical arguments.",
    "learned how to think more systemically, learned some important arguments and thoughts about some important things, etc.",
    "An expansive knowledge of an array of thinkers I had not previously been acquainted with and skills for analysis of their thought.",
    "As this was the first philosophy class I have ever taken, throuhgout the course, I bettered my ability to follow and analyze the philosophers' arguments. I also developed the skills to write about a philosopher's argument and about an objection I have to it.",
    "Think a little bit different about a few ethical\/natural phenomena."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The sections were really fun as it was nice to discuss philosophy in small groups and solidify what we learned in lecture. The lectures helped clarify the readings, but the readings themselves were sometimes very difficult to get through and understand. I'm not sure how that format could be improved, but doing the readings always felt a little like an exercise in futility, since I never felt I understood them and they were explained better in lecture anyway.",
    "The course has good lectures, a clear focus, well chosen readings, and a good system of papers and grading (three papers, with the better ones receiving a greater weight). The only real weakness is the amount of material that has to be covered in a course like this means that there is not quite enough time to really dive into a specific philosopher, so much of the course leaves one wanting more information or specificity.",
    "Strengths: Good survey of important information, engaging lectures and sections Weakness: Need more helpful and constructive guidance when crafting essays",
    "Brad Inwood was a very good professor who made the content of the readings very clear during lecture. It was mandatory to attend, and I would not recommend skipping the class anyways, because the reading can be quite hard to understand at first or without some guidance. Dan Ferguson was an amazing section TF who led section very well and helped us get a better grasp on the concepts.",
    "I wish the lectures were a little more structured",
    "I thought the texts were great but the lectures were boring and just summaries of the reading",
    "Strengths: Essay assignments were very challenging. Weaknesses: Stronger critique of the ancient ideas in class would have been appreciated. Many of these old arguments were quite poor, and I think it would have been good guidance for the essays to, in class, have the lecturer a little more heavily criticize them. To see the example of that detailed criticism by the lecturer once in a while would lead to students developing better essays I would imagine.",
    "Going to lecture wasn't especially useful after you read that week's material. It was pretty much just a review of material. Maybe this changed later on in the course? I wouldn't know.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was in section. My TF, Reier, was absolutely fantastic. He made himself available to help students with papers and answer questions about philosophy, and allowed time in section for students to ask questions and clarify things that were not clear. He truly did his best to increase comprehension in the class. The biggest weakness of this course was, as someone who has never taken a philosophy course before, the beginning was a confusing period. There is no explanation on how to navigate the readings; students are left to figure it out themselves. In addition, lectures often went on tangents which, while usually interesting, did not help my overall understanding of the class or a particular philosophical subject.",
    "The lectures were on and off engaging. They could have been more carefully outlined in as far as I would have liked a more detailed approach to the various thinkers' arguments. The sections were bad--there was not enough structure to help us engage in a productive discussion. Honestly, the material carried the course instead of the instructors.",
    "This course was very strong overall, given the material it covered; I was overall very satisfied, and do not count myself as knowledgeable enough to critique its curriculum.",
    "The strengths are the texts read and the discussion sections held every week. Since it is an introductory course, one improvement that could strengthen the course would be a section to give sutdents, who have never taken philosophy before, tips on how to read a philosphy text, look for certain elements of the arguments, and write about them.",
    "Strength: interesting source material Weakness: sometimes the core learning points get lost.",
    "CHANGE THE BLIND GRADING SYSTEM. I hated asking the TAs to read my writing just for them to say no for anonymity reasons. I never got writing the papers correctly, and"

   "comments": [
    "The material is dense but very interesting.",
    "If someone really wanted to learn about Ancient Philosophy, then this course certainly provides that, and it isn't uninteresting. I think any dissatisfaction I had with the course might just be a result of my own waning interest in ancient philosophy, but the course itself I think was good.",
    "Yes, this course is an excellent introduction to the major players of ancient philosophy, taught by a real expert.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in further pursuing philosophy or a student who wishes to gain a good understanding of Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy.",
    "I would very much recommend this class to anyone who is at all interested in Philosophy or other liberal arts. It gives you a good understanding of some very important thinkers, and the intellectual gain from reading Plato and Aristotle is immense. It really changed my whole outlook on many things.",
    "If you want to be a philosophy major, yes",
    "I think all students should take ancient philosophy. I think Professor Inwood and the TAs were generous and well-meaning. However, the course could have been significantly more engaging.",
    "Yeah it's interesting",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they have a pre-existing interest in philosophy. Both in lecture and section, those who are teaching are very passionate about what they do, which always makes the course more engaging. Additionally, it is a good class to take even if you are not interested in philosophy, because it makes you more well-read, and the knowledge will help you in other areas of life.",
    "YES in as far as the material is one that pushes one to think more rigorously about interesting questions. However, the course was not particularly well taught.",
    "This course is exactly what it says on the box. Take it if you need it for the major or want knowledge of obscure Greeks philosophers; they're great for sounding pretentious",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because this philosophy class gave me a good foundation of knowledge about ancient Greek authors and helped me to better analyze and discuss a philsophical text.",
    "Yes, but I don't think I would recommend it as a brute intro course.",
    "No. Don't take it. I like philosophy, but I did not like the class."
