   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend it but prepare very well for the midterm and final as they are each 50% of your grade",
    "Best lab I've ever taken at Yale - Dr. Klein is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, and you learn so much. The midterm and final were fair, and the labs are a lot of fun (no weekly reports)!",
    "Great lab experience, but the grading is harsh. There are only two graded assignments- Midterm and Final. Doing poorly on the very difficult midterm will mean a poor grade.",
    "Awesome lab class. The midterm and final grading is very terrible though. It's extremely detailed and nothing is put into context so it is very hard. The actual lab class is amazing though. It is so hands on and we learn some of the techniques. Very little work whatsoever outside the midterm and final studying.",
    "Yes, yes, and yes!",
    "Yes! Great to fulfill a premed lab req.",
    "Definitely take MCDB 241L! It was by far the best biology lab I've taken at Yale, and the only one in which I learned anatomy and how to do surgery on a mouse. It's really great if you're pre-med. On top of it all, Dr. Klein is a great teacher. Just be sure to email her in advance for a spot in the lab -- it took me a year on the waiting list to get in. But it was definitely worth it.",
    "A fun and relaxing biology course that also manages to teach you good techniques and information. The problem is that, while there are no reports, all of the grades are based on the midterm and final--if you're very serious about your grade and don't like to take chances, you might want to look for another lab. That said, if you're alright with a possible B, by all means do it! It's a good experience.",
    "Lab course studying frog, fly, plant, mice development. Really hands-on. We fertilized frog eggs by hand, and could've taken them home with us if they hadn't died. We did IVF on mice, and made chimeras with mice morulas.",
    "The midterm is rote memorization of images in the handouts, and the final is a regular exam. Not that much work at all.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this lab! It was by far my favorite lab I've taken at Yale. All of the labs are interesting and you have the opportunity to perform a lot of experiments that other undergrads around the country do not have access to. You do everything from in vitro fertilization to manufacturing chimeric mice. There are no lab reports, just a midterm and a final, which if you study for, are definitely manageable. Email the professor early if you want to get a spot in this lab!!",
    "This is by far the coolest lab course I have taken at Yale. It really helps if you take it along with the MCDB240 lecture, since it can help to review some of the material for the midterms. It was great not to have lab reports to do, and the midterm and final weren't a huge deal.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was very fun, although the midterm and final were a bit difficult.",
    "I would really suggest taking this lab! There are no lab report and the exams aren't that bad. The material is extremely interesting.",
    "I would recommend this lab to someone who needs to take a bio lab. Don't take this class just for fun and because you think dissections are cool. The midterm is difficult and the final exam is hard. If you are excellent at memorizing then by all means, take the class. However, know that it is full of premeds. They go over and above when it comes to studying for the midterms and will ruin the curve. I know, because I was one.",
    "Great class, the best lab I have taken at Yale and I have taken everything form biochem to the standard pre-med labs. This was fun and enjoyable, but not for the weakhearted because we did a LOT of dissections.",
    "The best lab at Yale. No lab reports, only one difficult midterm practical and an easy final exam. Professor Klein reviews the material at the beginning of lab each week in case you didn't read the handout beforehand. You dissect frogs, mice, and plants. You impregnate frog eggs and make tadpoles. You practice some genetic engineering making chimeric mice. Lots of interesting labs, although they do get repetitive toward the end of the semester.",
    "Definitely take this course! This is the best SCIENCE lab I have ever taken at Yale. You have no lab reports- just one midterm and one final. The midterm can be a bit tough, but it is definitely manageable.",
    "It is a great lab. I definitely recommend it, especially for seniors.",
    "I would very much recommend this lab - it is by far the best I have taken at Yale and truly enjoyable. The material follows that covered in Developmental and Reproductive Biology pretty closely, but this lab lets you learn it in a very hands-on approach. Do not take this lab if you are squeamish. Also, contact Dr. Klein long before the semester you want to take it because spots fill up fast. The material is very interesting (you get to make chimeras!) and the work load very light - no lab reports, just a practical midterm and a final (though that means you really do need to study and do well on these). Take it! My favorite class this semester.",
    "Only take it if you don't mind cutting up mice, because you do a whole lot of that. Also, it can be frustrating at times, because some of the lab activities are incredibly hard, though if you get help form the professor it's not a problem. Take if if you want to, it's definitely interesting. Just be ready to go through a ton of mice and be frustrated at times.",
    "Take this class. It would be the best lab you've ever taken at Yale. It's very hands-on, there are no lab reports, and most of all, the instructor is always enthusiastic about teaching and always willing to help! The midterm can be a bit of a bummer, but as long as you pay attention during lab and do the readings you would be fine!",
    "Great lab for premeds- it was great to pretend to be a surgeon even if it was on mice. You work with a lot of mice so you shouldn't be afraid of them. Not a lot of work since there are no lab reports, but the midterm is really hard so make sure you study a lot for it.",
    "This was a very good class, and a very fun introduction to reproductive biology lab techniques. You'll learn a lot of interesting techniques, get to do mouse and frog dissections, and perform mock IVF. The labs can be somewhat frustrating if you're lost during a dissection or can't find something under the microscope, but just ask for help and the TAs or Prof. Klein will set you straight. There's a practical midterm that you should really study for -- it's tough but not unreasonable -- and a written final that's very reasonable. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this course\/take it again!",
    "yep. good way to fulfill premed requirement",
    "You dissect a lot of animals to look at their reproductive systems and learn A LOT. Excellent practice with the microscope. Totally recommend this lab if you have patience with working with small objects.",
    "If you have to take a secondary bio lab I'd recommend it. This is one of the most interesting labs you'll find at universities. The dissections and procedures you perform are some of the techniques used in innovative research.",
    "It is a lab that lets you learn by doing and allows you to work with animals. I absolutely recommend it!",
    "This class has very minimal work with only a midterm and a final. The midterm is pretty tough because you have to identify slides and anatomy parts without any context. No lab reports makes this a must take class for seniors",
    "It is a good lab course that exposes students to some of the actual techniques used in reproductive biology. I found it more enjoyable and chill than the other labs here at Yale- one because you are actually doing real stuff- dissections, embryo transfer, and two: the overall atmosphere is more relaxed. Professor Klein helps students a lot with the techniques- but the only hard part is a midterm, for which students need to memorize the whole lab packet",
    "The most interesting lab course i've taken over my four years. The experiments are actually relevant and I left with a lot of practical knowledge. It was not a stressful class, though the midterm is difficult and the final is as well. Mary Klein is very approachable and helpful throughout the lab. She goes over all the procedures at the start of lab and even does them for you if you are having a lot of trouble. There is no homework or assignments per se. A great lab to conclude your yale career with.",
    "Take it if you need a bio lab.",
    "Yes, definitely."
