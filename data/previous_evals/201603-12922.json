    "This course made me conversant with some of the seminal text and debates in analytic jurisprudence. Since the volume of texts we read was quite small, we were able to work through arguments in careful, premise-by-premise fashion. At times, we were also able to work out what consequences particular philosophical views would have on the actual practice of law. The final assignment for the coursewhether one wrote the paper or took the examrequired us to evaluate an argument or arguments that we encountered over the course of the readings.",

   "comments": [
    "The primary strength of the course was the deliberate pace with which we worked through the material. Since we only read a few texts, Professor Yaffe was able to devote several classes to each text so that we could really pore over the arguments carefully. At times, the pace of the course was too slow. I wish Professor Yaffe had made a more concerted effort to limit the amount of questions he fielded as he presented. Too many questions were of the form: \"Philosopher X's position reminds me of something I read outside of this class.\" These questions should have been relegated to the discussion board on Canvas, whose posts were accessible and could be replied to by everyone, or perhaps left to office hours. Stopping to answer these questions just meant that we had to rush through other material, especially towards the end of the course. I also got the sense sometimes from some of the clarifying questions that people were not doing the readings or not doing them with the care that they ought to have been; the expectations for a YLS courses should be higher.",
    "My only complaint is that we spent too much time in the beginning of the term on the Command Theory of Law.",
    "Interactive and very helpful when students approach him."

   "comments": [
    "This course is a limited, but thorough overview of some of the key attempts to answer the question of what law is. Given the nature of the question, the material works at a fairly high level of abstraction; those who are looking for a course on the practice of law should look elsewhere (though we did sometimes pause to consider the practical implications of the view we were evaluating). There is very little reading, which means we were able to work through arguments in careful, premise-by-premise fashion, which was hugely satisfying. For the most part, the pace was not any slower than it needed to be; at times, however, Professor Yaffe allowed the class to get bogged down by questions raised by students that were not entirely relevant to the material at hand. Note that the entire grade for the course is based on either a long paper or a three-hour exam.",
    "Assuming that I am only talking for philosophy undergrads the only reason that I would not recommend this class is that if you do not have lots of knowledge of the legal system in the U.S. (like me), then some of the contents covered in class would feel out of nowhere. (Who would no that Legal Realism is the opposite of what you would assume from its realism\" name? And how would I know that judges decisions are affected by what they ate?) Thats been said, the lectures were very enjoyable clear and informative. So consider taking it if you are interested in the material.",
