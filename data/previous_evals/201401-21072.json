   "comments": [
    "I do not recommend taking this course. Discussion in seminar were largely disconnected from the issues discussed in the readings. Most classes focus on case studies, which involves reading maybe 3 articles on a case study and then discussing it in-depth during seminar. Often discussions would center around the military feasibility of intervention in X Country even if no reading had touched on that point. Since clearly no one in the class was an expert in military tactics and which weapons work best in which situations, most times these discussions were fruitless. Prof. Howorth though well-meaning isn't effective at steering discussions into more productive threads of conversation. Maybe in future iterations of the course these problems will be fixed, but even so, I am hesitant to recommend it. At the end of the course I honestly have no better understanding of humanitarian intervention than at the beginning of the semester.",
    "I highly recommend this class to students with a very solid knowledge of international relations and conflicts. It is fast-paced, so it can be hard to keep up and keep facts straight, but it will teach you a lot about humanitarian intervention.",
    "Interesting course with a very good professor.",
    "Absolutely take it. You will learn an awful lot about military intervention. Professor Howorth is funny, kind, and fair, and the class vibe is relaxed. Do the reading--most of it is very good!",
    "Absolutely. Professor Howorth is great, the content is extremely interesting, and students tend to be well-informed and genuinely interested in the material. You will learn a lot.",
    "Phenomenal course. Taking a seminar with howorth cannot be missed.",
    "A really great class! Professor Howorth is great, and the material you learn is very interesting and current. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Definitely take this class - Howorth is great and the structure of the course will be much better going forward. Discussions are great, you learn a lot, and Howorth is one of the most approachable, knowledgable, kind professors at Yale.",
    "Take it if you can get in!!!",
    "Consider a survey course of the dozen most influential humanitarian crises of the 20th century. Professor Howorth is still new to teaching this course, so the format of the class may change for next year. I found the readings very interesting, and I considered it a worthwhile learning experience.",
    "Yes. The class was very good the first time Howorth taught it, and it will only get better in future iterations.",
    "Very good class that does a survey of humanitarian intervention case studies. You will walk away with a good factual basis.",
    "I would definitely recommend Humanitarian Intervention. It's a good introduction to the field by way of case studies, which I think was a very effective way to structure the course. Readings are interesting and not overwhelmingly long, and Professor Howorth is awesome: an effective discussion leader, extremely smart, and helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 122 as a fantastic opportunity to delve into a particular aspect of political science."
