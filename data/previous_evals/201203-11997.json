    "Fantastic course guided by a brilliant woman. Only if you are taking it with Linda Cole Taylor.",
    "The reading is light. It's either theory, journalism, or research and they align with the assignments for the week. You're required to observe a New Haven school at least 2 times. The bulk of the grade is your Unit. There is not much guidance and if you're like me and not a history major, you have to teach yourself a lot of history and look at the textbooks outside of class. There's not a lot of guidance for the Unit, and knowing whether your lesson plans are appropriate is also difficult without kids to test them on.",
    "The Teaching of History is an education studies class in which students examine the nature of history and how to best communicate that to younger thinkers. The culminating project is a full unit worth of lesson plans focusing on the time period and unit population of your choice. While it is looking like this class will not be offered again. I urge you to check out Education Studies classes (provided that the program is thoughtfully redesigned) in order to fully understand what it looks like the meld theory and practice in terms of education.",
    "The course is about everything you thought history teaching wasn't. It's truly a great course"
