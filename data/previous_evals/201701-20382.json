    "Practice writing lab reports and analyzing data. Some error propagation, curve fitting, dimensionless variables. Had to figure out how much confidence I had in a conclusion based on the estimated error in the data. Use of some theory (heat transfer, membranes, reaction rate controls, diffraction, complex fluids) to compare experimental results to what was expected based on theory."

   "comments": [
    "The weakest aspect of this class was the poor organization. Little direction was given for writing lab reports, and the manuals barely sufficed as thorough experimental guides. For some topics, the professors seemed just as clueless as the students in understanding the major concepts being covered.",
    "This course had several weaknesses. The lab experiments themselves were fairly engaging, however there was great confusion as to who would be leading the experiments and who would be doing the grading for the reports between the TFs and professors. Because of this confusion, practically no grading of reports was done during the semester. I personally received no grades back on lab reports even to this point. I received no feedback on whether I was doing something wrong and had no opportunity to correct for future reports. When asked about report grading, the response was that they were working on grading them, and no result actually occurred. This is fine if the lab reports were going well, however it is extremely unfair to the students if points were taken off and we had no chance to change for future reports.",
    "Some strengths are that the labs spanned a lot of the core concepts in chemical engineering. It was especially interesting to consider the differences between theoretical predictions and actual experimental data. Although with the limited time we couldn't repeat trials to help smooth out the data, the labs provided a good exercise in quantifying and explaining error and brainstorming future improvements. The two main weaknesses of the course are 1) the almost mindless data collection and 2) the execution of the course. Although the data analysis could be quite interesting, the actual lab work was extremely repetitive and mind-numbingly tedious. (Maybe this is just the nature of data collection?) What might have been more meaningful is to have fewer lab modules but to involve students in the design of the experiment\/data collection. This way students don't just have to think about what the data means, but what data is needed to answer some research question and how that information can be measured. And there would be less time spent on mindless data collection. Another option would be to choose lab modules where we actually learn some useful lab technique (like the MBE lab). The second area where the course can be improved is in its organization and execution. Of the 5 lab modules, I received feedback on only the first module. Consistent feedback would have helped us improve our lab reports over the semester. There was also very little guidance as to how to analyze the data and assess the results critically. The data analysis skills I used, figuring out which plots were most meaningful, Excel, Matlab, and error propagation I had learned in other courses such as Pchem Lab or my previous experience doing research. I don't know that I learned any new data analysis skills except maybe dimensionless variables (and I'm not sure if I did that correctly because there was no lecture on it and I didn't receive any feedback on how it should be used)."

    "If you like research and lab work, maybe this could be a useful course for you in that you can practice data analysis and writing lab reports. If you are ABET ChemE, it's required so my advice to you is focus on the parts of the course that are most interesting to you. This year there were 5 lab modules (membrane, kinetics, heat transfer, MBE, and complex fluids). Fairly interesting topics and data analysis (you get to calculate thermal conductivity, heat transfer and mass transfer coefficients, rate constants, etc.) but extremely boring, tedious, and repetitive data collection\/lab procedures. The pro to this is that you can chat with other students or take a nap while things heat up to the next temperature. The organization of the course is not great, but I think the instructor is changing for next year."
