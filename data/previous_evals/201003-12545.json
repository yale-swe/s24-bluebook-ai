   "comments": [
    "YES.Well structured, you learn a great deal about Chinese history and culture, and you get some really interesting assignments. Plus Su Wei's stories about his time growing up in Cultural Revolution China are amazing. I'm definitely taking his class next semester.",
    "If you are considering taking a Chinese class at this level, this is a great class to expand your understanding of contemporary texts.",
    "I would highly recommend it to anybody who is good at Chinese and wants to take a chill class with interesting contemporary readings and an engaging fun teacher!",
    "I took this course because I felt illegit for never having read any Chinese lit except in translation. Didn't learn much in terms of language-- in fact, I feel like my Chinese has decayed. But I'm definitely glad I got exposed to a lot of awesome modern writers.",
    "You will not learn very much. The midterm and final are relatively easy as long as you study. But class time is spent on listening to Su Wei's stories (over and over again), rather than learning vocabulary or the text. Su Wei also has the highest opinion of himself out of any professor I have ever had, so if you can handle stroking his ego for an entire semester, then go for the easy A. But Su Wei judges people strongly based on how much he likes them, so if you can't suck up, then you won't enjoy the class.",
    "Interesting but at times dry introduction to Chinese literature. The readings were actually very fun. Be warned that Su Laoshi seemed to grade the native speakers a lot harder than he graded non-native speakers. He has great stories. Not an immense workload, but be prepared to spend a fair amount of time every week on homework, quizzes, and the midterm and final.",
    "CHNS 158 is an advanced language course that samples eight short (3-8 page) passages from significant recent Chinese novels and appends grammar, vocabulary, and exercises. Essays, a midterm, final presentation, and a final are also part of the process. Altogether, I found this class reasonably helpful at exposing my Chinese to increased levels of sophistication, though the quantity of material is such that proper written or spoken practice is difficult. Also, there is an extreme variation in the starting levels of students. Some have completed the learning track at Yale, while others are already highly competent heritage or foreign students. Thus, one must be fairly self-focused with respect to expectations and goals for the course."
