I would recommend that you take the greatest amount of care in choosing your adviser and your project. It's very difficult to see how things will turn out in the months ahead of picking, but if you are left with a very demanding adviser and a difficult project, you will not be happy for much of your senior year. If you do your research about the projects going on in the department, talk to others who have already finished their projects, and are willing to speak frankly and honestly with your adviser, your project will go well."
