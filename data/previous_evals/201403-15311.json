There was one class that neither of the teachers prepared anything to do and made up a lesson somewhat on the spot and it was a bit frustrating and felt like a waste of time."

    "Both Jen and Schrader have extensive knowledge of the subjects they were lecturing and demonstrating on.",

Constantly competing for space and materials made the work frustrating a lot of the time and meant we got to cover fewer things in less depth. It seemed like a lot of class time was spent either wrestling with materials or waiting in line."
