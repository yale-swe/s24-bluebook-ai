    "I genuinely feel like my level of Italian has improved to the level where I can hold minutes long conversations with native speakers.",
    "I gained greater mastery over Italian grammar and speech, incorporating a few new grammatical structures into the corpus of knowledge established in L1 and L2.",
    "A review and more in-depth look at grammar from L2 Italian, but with more emphasis on culture, essay-writing, and Italian media."

   "comments": [
    "This is a very strong course.",
    "Strengths - format (6 exams, lowest dropped) - this is good because a lot of opportunity to pull up your grade if you need to (as compared to other languages which have 3 exams\/semester). Weakness - a lot of busy work at times",
    "I appreciate the straightforward structure and scheduling of this course, as well as the high level of direct engagement with students. That said, I believe the course can be improved in the following ways: 1) It would have been helpful to know the date of the final exam much earlier, for logistical purposes. 2) Longer oral examsmine was cut short as it was towards the end of the allotted period of time on a day in which orals were running late. It ended up feeling like my Italian speaking skills were not really being tested. Maybe we can assign a third day for orals and double the length so that people can really have a meaningful conversation. 3) More focus on new material and less on review. Old material doesn't have to be presented as though it's new; I would have preferred to see a quick review of structures from previous semesters followed by more time spent on advanced applications. 4) Different textbookVHL textbooks are incredibly expensive and not very well-formatted. Their online exercises were useful, but I feel that overall they're not worth the cost or the hassle of going through them. I also disagree with the requirement on the syllabus that we all get physical copies of the textbook. 5) I think it might be useful to have one essay-length writing assignment during L3.",
    "This is a great course, and has a similar layout to L1 and L2.",
    "There are lots of opportunity to practice conversations. Simona was a wonderful Professor that really cares about your progress.",
    "Strengths: I love Italian, and Simona is an amazing, caring teacher. I especially love when we have time just to converse with each other about the short films we watch in class or our lives, because that gives me an opportunity to become friends with my peers and also practice more. Weaknesses: I wish L3 was formatted with longer class time 3 times a week rather than 50 minutes per day--50 minutes often felt too short to be very productive, and I think I would learn more with a different structure. But the class itself is great."

    "Definitely, the Italian department is amazing and very fun to be a part of.",
    "Yes, definitely take this! Its a fun class and you learn a lot",
    "Yes! Italian is such a fun language, and Italian songs, art and films are honestly so beautiful and interesting. The workload too is much more manageable than for some other languages like French or Chinese, but we still learn a lot, and you walk away with enough skills to write film critiques (albeit very basic ones) and hold fluent conversations."
