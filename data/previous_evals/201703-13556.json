   "comments": [
    "How to facilitate a three hour discussion on something I know nothing about",
    "I learned that everything is problematic, and that there are no easy answers to environmental issues. I also learned a lot about western history, culture, and politics.",
    "It was great to get a first taste of what FES students and FES classes are like, in comparison to the liberal arts background I come from. I think I gained a sense of what types of questions are being asked by scientists with a professional bent to their work--who aren't afraid of statistics and data. Having already read some of the materials for the course, it also gave me a confidence in my literacy of history and other academic sources on the U.S. West.",
    "The course provided an intellectual framework and critical perspective by which to analyze the American West. It was a discussion based course, and relied on student input, allowing for the development of verbal communication skills when students participated.",
    "A much stronger understanding of the cultural history and identities of the American West. As a lifelong East coaster - albeit one who has spent a good amount of time out west - this course was instrumental in informing the work I do around natural resource management and policy on public lands.",
    "I gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of the cultural and socioeconomic forces at play in the American West. I also feel that by analyzing how these social factors influence environmental policy has been very beneficial to me as a developing professional with environmental management in the West.",
    "I learned how to thoughtfully engage complicated issues involving people of conflicting social, economic, and religious backgrounds. These skills will undoubtedly aid me in a career as I aim to serve marginalized and rural communities dependent upon natural resource economies.",
    "I gained a critical view of the West, from a moral, social and political lens.",
    "I was very pleased with the level of critical analysis this course provided me on cultural trends and assumptions about the American West. I thought it was an excellent introduction to the issues that underly this region, and the Native American history that often goes overlooked. I really gained a lot of perspective on the region from the material of this course.",
    "The course provided both breadth and depth in regards sociology in the North American West. It gave us both a theoretical background and practical knowledge of the social dynamics and environmental issues in the region.",
    "I learned so much in this course! Each week was a different topic relating to environmental, social, and political issues in the West (indigenous peoples, oil&gas, migration, etc.) The readings on each topic were always highly engaging and interesting, and I looked forward to them each week (which I can't say about readings in other courses I've taken!) Class discussions were also super interesting - my classmates brought so much to each week's session, and I really enjoyed learning from their perspectives and experiences.",
    "This course gave a complete introduction of American west knowledge."

   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "Didn't align very much. Spent most of the semester confused as to why the professor NEVER TAUGHT, never facilitated discussions, never lectured and the teaching fellow he had, Paul, was an absolute god send, doing the majority of the work.",
    "Pretty well. I thought there would be lecture at the beginning of every class, but we had to get all our background from the readings. As someone not from the west, that could be frustrating.",
    "They were about what I expected.",
    "Fairly well. The syllabus was consistent with the course.",
    "Very well, however, I did anticipate a bit more of a deep dive into how the sociological issues we examined play out in from a legal and political perspective.",
    "This largely met my expectations for the course, which was clearly explained by the syllabus.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations. I expected a more historical approach and was pleasantly surprised to engage on an anthropological and religious level.",
    "This course was below my expectations. The discussions never had a purpose--always at the whim of what other students want to talk about. This is okay, but not for an entire semester's worth of classes.",
    "I thought the readings for the class were exceptionally well curated. They highlighted new and different perspectives, built on one another, and used multiple formats to get the topics and themes across. I feel like I have a deeper and better understanding of the West after having gone through this course material.",
    "The class was exactly what I expected. Justin met the course expectations well.",
    "I didn't really know what to expect from this course, but I can say I'm really happy I took it. I came home from each class session really inspired and ready to keep learning about that topic. The class sessions were 3 hours long, but I never felt bored. Sometimes, the discussions were so lively I wished that the class wouldn't end.",
    "My expectations of students discussions is well reached."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- interesting subject matter and great group Improvement -- involvement from Justin, in any capacity!! Setting an accountability mechanism such as reading responses and then not showing up to class, not teaching, not commenting on the readings, was insanely annoying.",
    "Student discussion was really good and you learned a lot from that. But the class needed some sort of lecture component from the professor to give background to the topic.",
    "One great strength is the openness of the conversations. I really enjoyed the format of the class, where essentially students led the discussion and Prof. Farrell and Paul B interjected. The guest speakers were also incredibly informative and, I think, took up an appropriate amount of time in the syllabus. No big suggestions for improvement. I think the only thing might be to try and make better use of the weekly article responses. They felt a little bit like throwaway work since we never referenced them in class or got in-depth feedback. Something as simple as making them available for other students to read to get a sense of what other students are thinking, would be beneficial.",
    "This course provides a thorough insight into the American West and the reasons that make for so much tension between social, economic, and environmental concerns. Greater framing of discussions by the professor could have improved the use of class time. While many social science analytical frameworks and concepts were taught, a greater emphasis on real-world scenarios and case studies could have grounded some of that theory and given students a better understanding of real-world issues affecting policy, etc.",
    "Strengths: Lots of ground to cover, with really substantive discussion and good camaraderie among the class cohort. Weaknesses: The class could benefit from a bit more structure. Also, with the inclusion of a large-scale project at the end of the semester, the weekly readings ended up taking up quite a bit of time. I think trimming down the requirements for the weekly assignment would have helped me tremendously in putting more time towards my final project.",
    "I think overall this course presents an excellent overview of the underlying forces shaping Western environmental management, culture, and socioeconomies. I think students would have benefited by having a week dedicated at least somewhat more to Mormonism.",
    "Overall, I think the student led discussions and lectures are a great success, but I would have like to hear a little more lecturing from Professor Farrell on his current work.",
    "The homework (synthesis, summary) of the readings seemed pointless. We didn't discuss the responses in class, and there wasn't a discussion online. The readings were good, but the responses seemed like busy work. I would have liked to have more lectures from the professor and TA--when they did lecture, they were excellent. The students shouldn't have to lead a three hour class. It's good to have students present, but they shouldn't be expected to teach the class.",
    "The strength of this course is the well-selected readings and the questions they bring up in class discussion. I loved our class discussions and thought I gained a lot from my peers as well as Justin's insight. I liked the student-led class presentation and discussion format, but I also felt that it sometimes went on too long. I think in an ideal setting students would present for half the class, and Justin would facilitate discussion for the second half. Based on where students took the presentation, I sometimes felt we didn't get to the heart of the material, or get to hear Justin's perspective on the issues which I thought were useful.",
    "The course was absolutely strong in theory and practice. Justin also made himself extremely available and provided opportunities for our classmates to regularly meet and socialize. The weekly reading summaries seemed a little bit like undergraduate busy work. I would have rather simply provided the overall summary of weekly readings, rather than having to summarize each and every reading and then also synthesize the week's readings. I would have also liked it if Justin or Paul had lectured a bit more -- the class discussion is incredibly important, but more lectures would be appreciated.",
    "Strengths: class discussions. The class discussions each week were fascinating. I was totally engaged each week, and my classmates had so much perspective and knowledge to offer. I also really enjoyed the readings and working on my semester project (as well as seeing what each of my classmates worked on) Weakness: I wish we'd had a little more teaching from Justin. He is clearly an expert in his field and has so much insight to offer, but he usually sat back and let us students lead the class. This is okay because I learned a lot from my classmates, but I still felt like I was taking the class to benefit from Justin's expertise but I didn't get enough of that.",
    "The part of students discussions is great. The part of professor's analysis could be longer."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you intend to use it as a platform or incubator for another project and\/or idea.",
    "Start the readings early because they take forever.",
    "If you're an FES student, get ready to think critically about everything that you do. And if you're a student from outside of FES, look at this not only as an opportunity to learn about scholarly and professional approaches but also as an opportunity to get to know a body of students set on NOT entering academia--and learn from their pragmatism.",
    "The reading material is really interesting, so be sure to follow the recommended syllabus for the course work. Nail down your final project early on so that you can prioritize your workload for the semester.",
    "Come prepared with questions and well thought out comments for each class discussion. Showing up having only read and not thought about what you'd like to elucidate is less helpful to you and the class.",
    "Engage thoughtfully with the readings and come to class prepared to be intellectually vulnerable.",
    "Only take this course, if you are unfamiliar with the West.",
    "This class gives a great humanities-style introduction to issues of the American West. There is a lot of flexibility in the final project, and you're likely to be exposed to new ideas on the region.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is one of the very few social science courses at FES, and Justin's firsthand research knowledge and experience is an incredible asset. This class is at the intersection of history, sociology, geography, environmental studies, and environmental science.",
    "This is a great course - I highly recommend it. The readings and discussions are fascinating. It's a social science course, which is something a bit unique at FES and I think it's a real gem in the course offerings. It's great for anyone with an interest in the West or who plans to move out there after graduation.",
    "This is a valuable class."
