    "Not a requirement.",
    "This course reflected, yet again, how much the Architecture Department needs to bring the financial aspects of the development process into the curricula. The undergrads were running circles around most of the grad students when it came to structuring financing for the projects they were planning.",
    "Not a requirement, but an excellent experience for someone going into real estate development."

   "comments": [
    "the material was presented each week in clear coherent fashion, guest speakers were invited to address the students on alternate weeks and this gave students an insight into the real world outside of academia. assignments were never too heavy and the time given between each was sufficient.",
    "The body of material in this course was presented in a very logical and effective manner. Because the final product was a book containing both our analysis and proposal, there was a very natural course to follow during the semester, and Alex did a great job steering us along this route.",
    "The ordering of the syllabus was flawless.While I recognize the necessarily unique nature of the initial analytical assignment for the class, I believe the work load could have been distributed more evenly - some of those questions needed two people.",
    "I thought that this course was very well structured, from the sequence of assignments pushing the workload earlier in the semester to a mix of outside visitors lecturing and discussing in the small seminar format. I thought that is was very well thought through and relevant in every way. My only suggestion within the sequence would be to push the ideas of zoning earlier in the progression. I also think that the entire seminar group should be held to producing and presenting the base maps earlier, especially zoning which fell through the cracks and would have been very helpful at the end.",
    "The sequence of assignments was very clearly defined except for the final proposal. I would have appreciated a discussion on the first day of class what the proposal should entail.",
    "The intense neighborhood study is an incredibly tall order for a semester. While the time I invested in this course neared the amount of time I spent on my design studio, what should be done (and why) in the Ravenswood neighborhood was tough to pinpoint. If nothing else, the course demonstrates in full the enormous complexity and interconnectedness of planning and real estate development in New York."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "My expectations for this course were to further my understanding of the lessons and principles from intro to planning, to participate in a more rigorous planning project (Planning for Ravenswood), and to have the opportunity to see the guest lecturers speak. All of these expectations were met.",
    "I expected to come out with a more weathered eye for city planning both from the perspective of a developer and as a city planner. I was not disappointed. The game was not as life-possessing as the undergrad class. But I learned just as much.",
    "My expectations were to go deeper into the process of both planning and development and these were surpassed by the new set of skills, ways of documenting the city, ways of determining if your projections work and different ways of perceiving the result.",
    "This course exceeded my expectations. I found the most frustrating aspects of the class also the more educational and enjoyable.",
    "My expectations for the course were rooted in the beginning planning lecture which MArch I's are required to take in their 3rd semester. I felt that this course would very much emulate the structure of the other, while concentrating on a single neighborhood and allowing students to develop fuller and better-balanced proposals for its future.Those expectations were met, however the \"game\" itself was a frustrating one. Perhaps, that was the point all along: to gain a perspective on the often compromised position the real estate developer, planner, city official or architect faces in the implementation of long-term city development projects."

   "comments": [
    "the knowledge of how the world of building, outisde that of architectural academia, is invaluable to students of the profession. apart from giving one a knowledge of the stakeholders and the systems at work in the game, one attains a wider breadth of knowledge that would come in valuable during one's professional practice.my only reservation is the amount of focus on american cities this course gives, which overwhelms the amount of any attention given to cities elsewhere in the world. though new york may be the siting of the projects assigned, and are undoubtedly the subject of professor alex garvin's expertise, some focus on the rest of the world's developments and the planning that goes into achieving cities world wide, and not just at the local level, would be a welcome addition to the course.",
    "As somebody interested in planning and development as a professional career, this course was extremely valuable to me. The opportunities in this class, academically and professionally (meaning in terms of things like networking), are unparalleled at this school.",
    "I took this course to try to determine whether I was interested in pursuing either planning or development as a career. It helped a great deal.",
    "This course was very valuable for me and provided a great counterpoint project in the same semester as the urbanism core studio. I think the overlaps were beneficial and each developed stronger because of this parallel learning.",
    "I now have a much richer understanding of the complexities involved with planning and city government. The seemingly endless number of advocacy entities all appear to have drastically different agendas with few potential areas for compromise. The fact that there are professionals who accomplish anything is beyond impressive to me. After taking this course, I feel like I am far better equipped to analyze these issues and present solutions.",
    "Given my interest in real estate, and my continued study of it next year, this course could not have been offered at a better time."

    "alex garvin is extremely experienced, knowledgeable, and probably unparalleled in his field. although he has been in the field for a long time it is apparent that he has kept abreast of current developments and affairs and is by no means anywhere near being out of touch with the subject matter. not only is he able to harness his professional relationships to provide students with an enriching education in the realm of planning; he is able tobring the real world element right into the classroom with planned guest lectures and even the final presentation right at the end of the class which happens in manhattan itself.",
    "Alex is a great teacher and is passionate about his students' work. His understanding of the planning and development worlds is profound and inspiring, and working with him is a pleasure. Alex makes a tremendous effort to work with each team (and each student of each team) in developing their plans and proposals, and offers great guidance and support along the entire process. I recommend Alex enthusiastically as a teacher, and I wish there were more like him at Yale (those who emphasized the \"realities\" of architecture and urbanism in addition to design itself)",
    "This was my second course with Alex Garvin. It was a pleasure to be back in the classroom with him again. His capacity both to teach and inspire is quite impressive. Tomek endeavored to help whenever assistance was required, and performed his role well.",
    "I think that this course was very well run considering the high amount of coordination that had to take place to make all of these meetings and lectures possible.",
    "Tomek did an excellent job as a veteran TA. He enlightened many of us with just how much work the course would be!"

   "comments": [
    "maybe some intermediate, optional reviews in between assignments would be good so that the work can be better when it is finally produced at the deadline.",
    "I thought the course was extremely interesting and helpful and perhaps changed my course in architecture.",
    "An enhanced version of this course could be taught as true studio within the architecture department, but with roles for non-architecture students.",
    "None off the top of my head.",
    "course was a helpful addendum to introductory planning classspeakers were wonderful - and meeting in new york was excitingmaybe less structure with the week to week assignments would help teams focus more on how to build their own arguments",
    "The games\/assignments could have benefitted from a more competitive feel.Greater clarity on the objective of some of the later planning exercises would have been appreciated as well. My team was often confused over our target constituency (developers, residents, etc).",
    "I very much enjoyed the course!",
    "I may not actually believe this but I would have appreciated more of an editorial teaching approach from Professor Garvin. None of the students are professionals with any experience with these issues, and I would have liked a more hands on approach to the development of our proposals.",
    "Keep the book, but discuss the TOC from the very beginning.The editor should be strong-willed and quick on their feet...I feel this year's book lacked a clear voice.Invite the up and coming generation of architect-developers to present in the class. Tamarkin Co and the like."
