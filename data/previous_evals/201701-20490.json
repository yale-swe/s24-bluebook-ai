    "This was my favorite class I have taken thus far at Yale. Tolga is one of the best professors I have ever had. In the seminar format it is so much easier to really learn the concepts behind microeconomics. I learned how basic microeconomics relates to the real world. I loved loved loved this class and how everything I learned had a real practical application.",
    "Cost minimization, profit maximization, basic game theory, how firms should structure their production given a set of circumstances, and much much much more.",
    "I learned what it means to be a rational economic agent, and how individuals and firms can make better decisions to maximize on their returns. I also learned that economics is more Math than I thought.",
    "I learned that I probably won't be an econ major! But I really enjoyed this course, nonetheless!",
    "This course is a great, intensive introduction to economics. You start from the foundations, and by the end of the class, you have a good comfort level to move onto further courses.",
    "Was able to better understand how markets and individuals are able to deal with society's unlimited wants while dealing with the problem of scarcity in our world.",
    "Really well taught",
    "Every student should be encouraged to take an economic majopr despite their specific area of interest. Econ explains how the world works.",
    "I had never taken a microeconomics course so all the material about firm theory was totally new and very interesting.",
    "I learned a lot from taking this course. I took AP Economics in high school about microeconomics and did not learn a lot. It was refreshing to be taught well and at a high level about economics here at Yale with Tolga Koker.",
    "Microeconomics and critical thinking",
    "I learned the fundamentals of economics, allowing me to evaluate situations with the eye of an economist and execute basic economic tasks, such as utility optimization, supply-demand equilibrium, and short and long run costs.",
    "I learned what microeconomics is, how to apply it, and how to solve problems relating to microeconomics.",
    "Econ is a very interesting subject, but with Yale's fast-paced teaching style, it's hard to understand unless you just naturally get it.",
    "I learned how to perform basic microeconomic analysis and basic concepts about market structure.",
    "SO MUCH! We learned a lot of microeconomic theory, consumer side and production side. So I learned details about consumer decision-making, both psychological and financial, about how consumer demand affects prices. On the production side, I learned about how producers come up with their prices in different types of markets based on both the prices of input goods and labor and on consumer demand for the good."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was extremely well taught. I honestly would not change anything.",
    "Strengths: Professor Koker is an amazing teacher. His lectures are always informative, fun and memorable, which makes attending class a blast. He also has a very vast knowledge of economics in general, and it clearly shows when he lectures. Weaknesses: Sometimes, the pset material doesn't clearly correspond to course material, but not often.",
    "This course 's disadvantage is that there is a lot of material to cover in a very short time, so there is rarely enough time to discuss more examples for the concepts learned. However, the instructor is really good and gives examples that are relevant to understanding the material. The curve is not as generous as the lecture, but I think I do not regret the seminar because I was able to learn more and get a lot of help from the professor.",
    "One strength of this course is the amount of material covered. It is a great introduction to microeconomics. If you enjoy econ, I dont think that there are any specific weaknesses of the course.",
    "Incredibly strong, dedicated and intelligent professor who knows how to teach the material.",
    "Strengths: Tolga's entertaining and engaging teaching, many concepts were not only conceptually intriguing but applicable to everyday life, the safety net office hours (all answers to problem sets were provided as long as you showed up and made good faith attempts), how the class encouraged the formation of study groups, the pace for the first 3\/4 of the class Weaknesses: the last 1\/4 of the class felt rushed and overwhelmed me with terms and graphs to memorize (that being said, I was already behind in the reading, so...), certain lessons were less focused than others, the safety net office hours discouraged us from really giving our all to any of the problem sets, doesn't cover everything that's on the midterm\/final in class",
    "Although professor Tolga is a great professor, I have to admit that his accent does get in the way of understanding the material. For two months I had a key word wrong in my notes from misunderstanding him It wasn't until he wrote it down in the review session where I realized my grave mistake.",
    "I think the course does a good job of covering ground; we touched upon a lot of topics in a short amount of time. The first half, consumer theory, was easier as it was easier to relate to us personally, but the second half was significantly more esoteric conceptually. I think the course could benefit from going a little more in-depth. I feel like towards the end of each half, before the midterm and final, the course was distilled into formula and case memorization, which I'm not as big a fan of.",
    "The problem sets are a great length and very helpful to prepare for the exams. Tolga is straight forward and helps students a lot. He wants you to succeed and does not hide information or try to fool you for the exams. Sometimes he was a bit disorganized and went through areas very quickly.",
    "Strengths: Tolga is an incredible professor and the way he teaches you the material is simple to understand, he answers all questions and really is fair and willing to help if you are willing to learn. Everything is connected and it is easy to see that",
    "The strengths were Professor Tolga, without whom we would all be lost. He taught well and gave great models for understanding economic behavior. The weakness may have been that he is the only teacher and only has office hours once a week. Maybe a TA would help, since then students could seek help from a source and could then understand confusing topics in a different way.",
    "This seminar was taught very well, I am pleased I took it instead of the lecture.",
    "The required study groups were really helpful, especially to someone who struggled with the problem sets. However, I often times felt as though tests included information that was never discussed or taught.",
    "Strong course and well structured course overall, considering the many times that Tolga has taught the class. Enjoyed the stories -- even more would have been great!",
    "I think most information was covered. However, I think the course could be restructured so that more applications of the information was covered. It felt like all the problems were very similar in each chapter.",
    "Lectures were engaging and office hours were incredibly helpful. Overall, the course is well-organized with very few weaknesses, if any.",
    "I LOVED THIS COURSE! I have no suggestions whatsoever about improvements. Tolga, the professor, always kept class engaging with relevant examples and applications of the ideas we learned. I also loved how accessible the professor was, in office hours and directly after class. I really appreciated how he set us up into study groups at the beginning of the year, because that set me up to do the problem sets early, even though I am a procrastinator. I also appreciate how structured office hours were and how often Tolga had office hours around exam times."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Take this course instead of the lecture! You will not regret it!",
    "YES",
    "Yes, yes, the seminar with Tolga is really good especially if you do the reading and are interested in understanding broader economic concepts. Tolga is always wiilling to help students so go to office hours whenever you can.",
    "The seminar definitely has a worse grading curve than the lecture, but I really appreciated the small class size and Tolga's attention to each student in our class. Also, the final isn't cumulative, which is a huge plus at the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is at least somewhat sure that they have an interest in econ. However, if you are unsure that econ is one of your interests, or are just looking for a QR credit, I would recommend the lecture courseit is less work and covers roughly the same material.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The curve might be hard but the academic experience is unparalleled when compared to the lecture.",
    "If you, like 1 in 4 of your peers, want to take an Introductory Microeconomics course during your ~Yale career~, you'll have to choose between ECON 115 (a lecture) or ECON 110\/108 (both seminars, the latter intended for those needing more mathematical review). After talking to people in all 3 classes, I can confidently say that you should take one of the seminars. The material is presented in a much more entertaining way (Tolga's stories and tangents are legendary and cute), there are many more opportunities to ask questions and clarify topics, there are fewer tests, and students generally seem to care more about what they're learning. That being said, there is a slightly tougher curve--but if I remember correctly, only 5% fewer individuals in the seminar receive As than in the lecture. That disparity should not convince you to take the lecture--you're here to learn, and you'll do more of that in Tolga's class!",
    "Take this over lecture 100%. Really well taught and awesome to have a supportive teacher who WANTS you to learn",
    "Yes",
    "I think economics is a worthwhile concept to familiarize yourself with, regardless of your major. A lot of concepts about how the world works are explored in econ; it's something that's important to understand, not just so that you can \"play the game\" but also so that you can better make decisions and reflect on how certain biases or logical fallacies may underlie some of your assumptions. This isn't to to say that microeconomics is some amazing, eye-opening course; sometimes it really is just formula memorization. But Tolga provides a lot of help in the form of office hours or drop-in assistance, and is clear on what he expects, so the course is manageable even if at times challenging.",
    "Tolga is a fabulous teacher and made the course very enjoyable. The work is manageable and the exams are easy to prepare for. The reviews sessions before exams were great too.",
    "YES! This class was fun, interesting, and Tolga is amazing. If you pay attention and do your homework, you will learn while also having a blast. Tolga relates everything to real world concepts and things happening today, it's a great class. Would recommend",
    "Yes, this a good course for anyone, since the skills one learns here are not only enlightening, but useful and applicable.",
    "Yes, if someone is interested in microeconomics and truly wants to understand it the seminar is by far your best option.",
    "If you're interested, go ahead, but be prepared for a lot of studying. It's a good class to have under your belt, but don't be surprised if you don't end up at the top of the grading curve.",
    "Good intro micro course with a passionate professor in Tolga. Not the worst workload, and entertaining class to be in",
    "Yes, Tolga is a good teacher and will make sure you learn the information. You definitely come out with a strong understanding of the concept, probably better than what you would have gotten in the lecture. However, be prepared for a tougher grade curve.",
    "ECON 110, \"the seminar,\" is a great course for students looking for a higher level of engagement with course material. However, this comes with slightly more of a challenge and a slightly steeper curve than the lecture, 115. The course is organized into smaller lecture sections of about 20 to 30 students. Tolga's lectures are engaging and memorable, making it easy to think about and apply concepts to everyday life, much more than just reading off a PowerPoint. You will come away from the course with a better understanding of economics and how it relates to social behavior and even elements of psychology at times. Overall, ECON 110 is a great class, and Tolga is a great professor who really cares about students, wants to get to know them, and is invested in their understanding of the material. My best advice to future students is to go to office hours even when you feel like you understand the week's material; Tolga often explains more in depth and personalizes concepts in office hours to help you learn better.",
    "YES! Tolga is amazing, funny, and talented at teaching. You'll learn a bunch of interesting concepts that somehow Tolga applies to real life in such interesting and amazing ways. If you want to take microecon, take it with Tolga! People are scared away because the curve on tests isn't as good as the curve in the lecture, but if you're in a class to actually learn, Tolga will teach you and I actually hated missing class because it was so engaging. I doubt you'll have an experience like that in the lecture. I've never learned so much just by sitting and listening to someone. He doesn't publicize this, but for students who've had a great upward curve or who he knows have helped out other students tremendously, he awards them bonus points. Especially in office hours, where he'll go over every single problem on the problem set with the 10-20 students there, he tries to really get to know people. Also, some people say that he's quite problematic, so let me explain and clear that up a bit: for some concepts, Tolga uses standard textbook examples that perpetuate gender stereotypes or gender roles. I think someone in class may have pointed it out to him or he just forgot to do this in the first few classes, but about halfway through the semester, he began to acknowledge the sexism. He would say that the following example is sexist, but rather than throw away the example, he would use it and acknowledge its sexism. Otherwise, we might encounter the textbook\/standard example in another economics class and not address the sexism at all. We spend half a class talking about the gender pay gap (in a lesson about wage discrimination) and he encourages all his students to become cultured and accepting of many different types of people from all backgrounds because if nothing else, it gets us ready for the business world and makes us more marketable."
