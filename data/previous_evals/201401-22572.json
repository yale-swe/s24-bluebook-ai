    "Yes.",
    "This course is an introduction to the central issues and thinkers of the twentieth century who have shaped the way we think about literature and texts. It isn't so much a survey course as a chance to read the works of those thinkers closely and to engage with their ideas. I personally really enjoyed the course and would recommend it.",
    "In Professor Jacobs' version of Comp Lit 511, we studied several major texts by some of the most important authors for literary theory in the 20th century. Although we did not really study any broader history of literary theory, we were able to take time to read these texts well. I would recommend the course, especially for any graduate student studying literature who feels he or she is not well-versed in literary theory. Even if we did not touch on every author or theorist I would have liked to, I now feel much more comfortable reading those authors on my own, and I feel more confident in my own ability to interpret their texts."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very relevant for me -- it was a wonderful way to return to foundational texts that I hadn't read in a long time and to fill in the gaps with the many texts I hadn't read.",
    "I am a PhD student in French who had no prior background in literary theory. A basic knowledge of theory is essential to success in my field, so this course has already greatly contributed to my understanding of material in my other courses. I do not know how this will contribute to my research, but literacy in theory will be essential no matter what."
