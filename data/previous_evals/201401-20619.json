    "Tokyo is a great freshman seminar that you should definitely take if you have any interest in the history of Japan. The workload is substantial but manageable, with 5 papers ranging from 2-5 single spaced pages. Professor Drixler chooses a great array of topics for discussion that builds a comprehensive running narrative of the city. In addition to class there were trips to the Yale University Art Gallery and movie screening\/sushi party.",
    "Absolutely take it! Readings are interesting, the class discussion will make you question what you think you know about Tokyo and Edo, and it's just a really fun time overall. The readings aren't too hard, professor Drixler is super cool, the grading is very fair, and the essays aren't really as long as they seem at first glance, despite being single-spaced.",
    "This is the best course I have taken so far at Yale. Professor Drixler is amazing and the readings are interesting. I didn't just learn about Japan, I learned the skills necessary to take harder history classes in the future, and about what a life in academia is like. Professor Drixler was also kind enough to cut the final paper in half from 4000 to 2000 words a week before it was due, so that was great.",
    "Take this course it's a great seminar",
    "Do not be put off by the extreme amount of writing mentioned in the syllabus! Take this class if you have any interest in Japan -- or you don't! As a freshman seminar, Professor Drixler tries to use the class to educate you about the topic (obviously), but also to prepare you for the next three years at Yale. A research paper, talking about academia, correctly citing sources... basics that you are expected to be able to do, and probably can already, but at the same time, it was an excellent refresher. The conversations had in this class are awesome, but at the same time, I could listen to Professor Drixler talk about Japan all day because he loves the place! The readings are seldom dry, and are almost always more than worth your time. The papers seem extremely long, but are either fun to write or not as long as you think. Take this class, get to know one of the nicest professors at Yale.",
    "This was my favorite class this year. Professor Drixler is an amazing teacher, and the material is all very interesting. It's a lot of reading and writing, but totally doable and always worthwhile. While you learn a lot about Japan and especially Tokyo, you also learn valuable skills in terms of analysis and writing which apply to anything. I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "I would highly recommend Tokyo to everyone.",
    "I would thoroughly recommend this course."
