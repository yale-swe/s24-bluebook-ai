    "I learned important and useful laboratory protocols for genetics research.",
    "How to run simple genetic experiments with yeast, drosophilia, and arabidopsis. Provides a good background on more complicated genetic study methods currently employed in lab settings.",
    "typical genetics stuff, PCRs, different model organisms, seeing eye color pathways and mendelian genetics through your experiments",
    "Learned about the model systems (yeast, flies, and arabadopsis plants) that are central to genetics research. Learned how to plan, carry out, and evaluate the results of different genetic experiments, such as recombination mapping, using molecular markers, and mutagenesis, knock out, and rescue experiments.",
    "I learned a lot about model organisms, genetics techniques, and data analysis.",
    "Learned a lot of genetics.",
    "I learned the basics of genetics and genetic studies in yeast, flies, and arabidopsis. We also learned some aspects of molecular biology and utilized Crispr Cas9. I also learned how to analyze data using Chi-squared and contingency chi-squared tests.",
    "Learned a lot about applying genetics in a lab setting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Pre-lab lectures were helpful, and the concepts and protocols we used are very useful and applicable to real-world research!",
    "This class is a lot of work for a 0.5 credit class. Five lab reports were written, and four quizzes were given throughout the semester. Having one less lab report would have reduced the workload to an acceptable amount for the number of credits. Much more work than the lecture course.",
    "It's a great lab class. The labs are super short, averaging about 2 hours per week. The last couple of reports are brutal to write, but aside from 4 easy quizzes, the reports are the only work for the entire class, so that's fair. The only thing I would say that could be improved is the word count on some of the reports, namely the last 2-3. The word counts were so insanely low that you simply couldn't fit everything you need to say. So what everyone does to get around this is they make their figure legends full paragraphs that contain information that should really just be in the actual text of the report. This is dumb, because no one is actually being more concise, we're all just writing information in a part of the report that no one would ever put this information in actual scientific writing. Make the word counts 500 words longer for the last 2-3 reports and the class would be perfect.",
    "strengths: fun and cool experiments, not a crazy amount of work, usually get out of lab early",
    "Strengths: genuinely interesting experiments, super relevant stuff if you want to do genetics. REasonable workload. Weaknesses: lab reports were a bit tiresome and take a ton of time but in all honesty were pretty fair.",
    "Professor Dawson is the biggest strength of the course. He set up and cleaned up everything and always was happy to help with questions. He really made the class super enjoyable. Weakness is that most of the work of the course is done in the last few weeks, but that's natural for a class that builds so much upon things learned in the past week.",
    "No weaknesses",
    "The strengths are that you really learn how to apply genetics topics to a lab setting. However, the pre lab lectures can be long."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they need it to fulfill a requirement for their major.",
    "Yes - facilitates learning of lecture material, but a significant amount of work for a 0.5 credit course.",
    "Yes",
    "yes - that being said, I haven't taken other biology laboratories at yale, which I heard have a lighter work load and are more relaxed. Genetics lab is a lot more interesting and efficient than physics or chemistry labs, which I appreciated. Lab reports were long though, but there were only five per semester, which still might be more than other bio labs. I really enjoyed this class overall and never felt too stressed or confused by it!",
    "Yes, this is a pretty good lab to fulfill requirements and would be great for anyone interested in genetics. You will learn about the model systems (yeast, flies, and arabadopsis plants) that are central to genetics research, as well as how to plan, carry out, and evaluate the results of different genetic experiments, such as recombination mapping, using molecular markers, and mutagenesis, knock out, and rescue experiments. The workload isn't too bad. Most weeks the lab gets out early, and preparation takes maybe an hour to read and prepare for a possible quiz. The lab reports can take around 10 hours and there are five, so you do have to plan ahead for those or it'll be rough. There's not always a lot of help from the teacher or TAs, so you'll need to have a good group of students to work together with. The experiments are genuinely interesting and I learned a lot. It also complements the genetics lecture incredibly well, helping reinforce concepts from class.",
    "Yes, this is the best lab course at Yale. The work feels like a true lab credit (30 mins of prep for each week, 6 hour lab report every 2 weeks) yet I feel like I learned more in this class than most of my other full credit classes. Professor Dawson is an absolute gem and puts in more work to helping students than any other professors I know. If you need a lab class, you won't find a better one.",
    "Yes",
    "Only if you need it as a requirement."
