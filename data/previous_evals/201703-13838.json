    "I learned how the UN system is structure and the legal frameworks attached to these institutions.",
    "Understanding of UN, it's charters, the role and structure of the UNSC Understanding of Geo-politics and how it is a major factor in UNSC decision making Understanding a range of issues such as Women's rights, Terrorism etc and just how complicated they are to tackle Gaining insight on what happened behind the scenes on contentious votes",
    "This class is a great overview of the international community's greatest challenges today. Rather than just knowing of international issues, the seminar allows students to dive into the history and current status of war crimes, cyber attacks, terrorism, and more. And by studying these topics, I've come to realize the immense difficulties in changing the system of international politics. This class not only teaches you about the problems that the world faces, but it is rather an explanation of how the world's governments are approaching the issues that we are challenged by.",
    "Insights into the workings of the global multilateral system. Currently I have the foundations to keep learning throughout my lifetime.",
    "I learnt a lot about the problems in our world and how the multilateral institutions could help in this regard. It was a good course for practicing writing about these issues."

   "comments": [
    "Ambassador DiCarlo is a treasure at Yale. Her connections to the UN staff were especially rewarding. The course could maybe be improved with some sort of continuing theme that ties the weeks together.",
    "The strengths of this course: its expansive reach, Prof. DiCarlo's insights, and the trip to NYC. This class covers a new topic each week, which provides a broad oversight of the problems facing the international community and multilateral institutions. Yet, with Prof. DiCarlo's insights, one learns much more than the readings can provideher experience is a clear guide in detangling these complex issues. Lastly, the trip to NYC (we met actual UN ambassadors from Iran and China, along with high ranking mission members from Russia and the US) was such an amazing experience; it brought the topics we were discussing right in front of our faces. The course is reading heavy, and the issues we discuss are very complex, which makes getting through all of the readings\/facts needed for discussion a little difficult. There really isn't a simple solution to this, but it is a factor of dealing with a course that discusses such complicated topics.",
    "Having a former UN bureaucrat teach this course. The instructor's insights were excellent.",
    "Strengths: The course covered a wide variety of major topics of contemporary global affairs. The professor was so inclusive that she respected any opinions of students. The discussion with UN policymakers and several countries diplomats in NYC helped me deepen my understanding on the interests and concerns of various stakeholders. Weakness: Nothing"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if you wish to work at the UN.",
    "Excellent course if you'd like to learn about the UN\/UNSC! I knew very little when I came in about how the UN functioned. In a simple but effective way we cover all the main global issues from the lens of the UN\/UNSC and work through the challenges it faces and just how complicated reform is.",
    "Yes. The opportunities to learn from Prof. DiCarloand go to NYC with the classare phenomenal experiences. Great course on the UN primarily (not many other multilateral institutions covered). You will gain a broad overview of the problems that the international community faces, and the challenges that are faced when trying to address these issues. The trip to NYC is an excellent opportunity to visit some of the most pre-eminent UN officials! Once in a lifetime opportunity.",
    "Yes I would.",
    "Yes. This course is really helpful for students who want to work in International Organizations and foreign service."
