    "An AMAZING course. A must take if you want to learn about literature. I will always remember this course that made me think further.",
    "A lecture on Latin American short stories. Great, entertaining course. Would recommend highly if you're interested in literature and literary analysis in Spanish. Not too demanding. If you want this course to practice speaking Spanish look elsewhere. Great for reading, listening, and writing.",
    "15-20 page final paper; 3 short quizzes; one midterm; no final exam. Spanish 352 is a decent option if you're looking to get your language requirement out of the way, which was my motivation for taking it. If you're looking for a serious, interesting Spanish course, this might work for you as well, but I did not take the course particularly seriously, so look to another comment for that. To the not-bilingual student who is wondering if this class is really a gut: you have weekly readings, which you can get away with not doing. However, there are three quizzes and a midterm on these readings. For these, I suggest attending every class period and taking diligent notes on what the professor is saying. He gives interesting (even if you haven't read) lectures, although by the end of 1:50 you'll be more than ready to leave. He will mostly just quiz you on things he went over in class. If your auditory Spanish isn't great\/ if you can't understand the guy, look for another class. There is never a need to participate. The one thing the class really asks of you is the final paper. I had nothing written\/hadn't started thinking about the paper until two days beforehand. A mildly stressful time, and it was over. I think I did ok, but we'll see. If you want a true gut, take Spanish for medical professions.",
    "This class is really wonderful! There isn't that much class participation, as it's more lecture style. But, the readings were really great, and Professor Gonzlez is a joy to be taught by.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. The material was so engaging--if you're interested in modern Latin American literature, you should definitely take it. The course doesn't really focus on politics, but the role of ethics and language in Spanish American short-stories. The workload is not too intense, other than the final paper (15-20 pages in Spanish about a topic of your choice.) You should also be fluent or close to fluent to take this class. You also won't really speak that much--I don't think my conversational skills improved that much. The best part of the course is the material. Just make sure to do the readings and you'll get so much out of this class! I can't recommend it enough.",
    "The ethical\/political\/philosophical aspects to the course are what make the course great. You're getting a crash course in the modernist Spanish American short story alongside a crash course in ethical, political, and philosophical interpretations of the texts. It's a true literature seminar. The final paper truly is a beast - you need to start it ahead of time - but otherwise the course is straightforward. Nothing to freak out about, just stay on top of the reading and go to office hours for anything at all.",
    "This is an interesting course, but one that should only be taken if you're confident in your spanish ability. I liked to joke that reading philosophy in spanish (as a non-native speaker) is like trying to translate two languages at once. That being said, it's very interesting and has a very fair (light) workload. Prepare for the final essay, don't wait until the last minute!",
    "I highly recommend this class. I learned so much about politics and ethics in Latin America as well as writing techniques utilized by famous Latin American writers to convey these themes."
