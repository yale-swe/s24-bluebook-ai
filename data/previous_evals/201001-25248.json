   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in ever learning Russian. You will be sore pressed to find a better instructor or to learn from better material.",
    "The grammar gets interesting, and Constantine is really, really wonderful.",
    "Yes, absolutely. For those very interested in the nuances of grammar, anyhow.",
    "Take this class! Russian with Constantine is awesome. At times the workload can get a bit intense (2 chapter exams, a listening exam, a final, and an oral exam all in the last week of class-finals period), but in the end it's still manageable and fulfilling. Expect to do nightly homework. After all, it is a language course. Your Russian will get a lot better, and you'll have a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend, definitely. There's a lot of grammar and a lot of reading Russian short stories. It's fun and very helpful."
