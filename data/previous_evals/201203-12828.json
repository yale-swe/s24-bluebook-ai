    "I'm not even really sure what to say about this class. Most people who take Chem 119 need a lab for pre-med\/their major, and if that's the case for you, this is probably your best option (I've heard bad things about the other gen chem lab offerings at Yale). If you don't need a lab, my recommendation is that you don't take this. Compared to a lot of other Yale science classes, the grading for 119 is kind of harsh -- you need a 95% to get a solid A, so there's very little room for error. There are weekly quizzes that test your knowledge of the current and previous week's experiments, and the questions are not straightforward... they often require lengthy calculations or, worse, test minute details from the lab manual, and they are graded harshly. When I read the reviews for this class last year, a lot of people said this was a good complement to 118, but I have to disagree -- the lab was often ahead of the lecture, so we were doing experiments and taking quizzes on material we hadn't learned yet. Furthermore, whereas the lecture emphasizes overarching concepts of chemistry, 119 is much more like AP Chem, where you will be grilled on annoying concepts like units, sig figs, etc. The experiments themselves are generally interesting, so if you have to take this class, don't worry too much.... but know that it requires a lot of work and needs to be taken seriously.",
    "This lab is required for 118, and that's unfortunate. Nothing much more to say. It's one of those classes that you just have to take for the sake of getting through it.",
    "Take it to get the lab requirement out. It's not incredibly difficult but you do get the lab basis you need for future and more complex labs.",
    "This lab has to be taken with chemistry 118, so not really a choice. It's not a bad lab and you don't have to write full lab reports most of the time.",
    "I would recommend this Chemistry lab. It definitely supplements Chem 118 very nicely. The Professor Parr is a lively professor that will definitely make these 4 hour labs worthwhile.",
    "Though labs are long and tedious, Dr. Parr is a great instructor. If you are taking this class, it is because you have to, so overall its by no means a bad class, just a lot of work for half a credit.",
    "Not a lot of work, I've heard the lab is actually easier than the Chem 114 lab.",
    "This is the lab you have to take concurrently with Chem 118. It's not particularly interesting, but it's also not particularly difficult. Dr. Parr is very funny, if you understand sarcasm, but you always haveto be on your toes. If you enjoy working at your own pace and aren't too persnickety, this lab will run smoothly for you.",
    "If you've never been in a lab setting, this is a good introduction. This lab emphasized class concepts, which was helpful. However, I think this lab is a fairly large time commitment for a small gain.",
    "It's pretty much a course that gives a student a chance to become proficient in chemistry lab basics.If you want to do anything chemistry or science related, I recommend the class-it isn't too much work (other than the four hour block of time actually required by lab), and is very useful.",
    "great course to supplement the lecture; will learn a lot of experimental technique",
    "It's a really easy and fairly fun lab. It also does actually help you understand some of the things in 118. Dependingon your high school, you've done most of these things before. If you're set on getting out early, write out your lab notebook before hand and fill in just the data day-of. On the other hand you need to find a partner who has done the same, is really quick, or doesn't care to do that.",
    "CHEM 119L is the required lab for CHEM 118. Although you may have heard bad things about lab courses, CHEM 119Lis not bad at all (except the duration of the lab -- 4 hours -- but that's the same for all labs), and I found several of the labs very helpful for understanding concepts and formula studied in CHEM 118.",
    "Good, fairly easy lab class, suggested.",
    "This is the lab course that accompanies CHEM 118, in theory. The course is a good introductory chemistry lab course, but it doesn't always align very well with what happens in CHEM 118. From what I can tell, this course is more work than a half credit should be.",
    "What can I say? The lab was pretty interesting and not that difficult. Everything was more or less cookie cutter. The lab reports can sometimes be grueling and time-consuming to write, so start them early. It really, really helps to be able to ask fellow classmates for help as some instructions can be confusing. This lab is required for 118, so definitely make that a consideration.",
    "You're probably going to have to take it with 118. It's a pretty standard chemistry lab course. Don't expect to have the time of your life every week, but the workload and the expectations are pretty clear-cut.",
    "You pretty much have to take it if you're in chem 118, but it's pretty easy",
    "CHEM 119L is a good accompanying lab to CHEM 118. The experiments are straightforward and not too stressful, as are the lab reports. The lab reports are graded generously. The pre-lab quizzes are graded strictly, however, and students should definitely read experiments beforehand and know important reactions and formulas. Dr. Parr seems a bit condescending at first, but he is always willing to help out and answer questions. He gives good overviews of the experiments before class.",
    "If you're taking Chem 118, you have to take this class. The labs aren't hard, and we only had to do full write-ups for two labs, so the workload is very manageable. However, the quizzes before each class count for 40% of your grade, and I think that's too much. This was a lot like my high school chem lab. I recommend this class to anyone who absolutely has to take it.",
    "Other reviews complain about Dr. Parr, but I didn't have any problem with him or his teaching style. Even if you don'tunderstand what you should from the lab manual, or barely read it, he is still helpful; if you take this course and are put off by his personality, just get over it. With that out of the way, this is a generally well taught lab course and Jorge is a very friendly TA. The work load is right for a half credit. If you need to, don't fret too much about taking this.",
    "Yes, this course MUST be taken with Chemistry 118 as it is a good lab.",
    "This lab was mandatory this year if you took Chem 118. Be prepared for the time spent writing the reports to spike towards the last few experiments. At times I spent more hours in the week on lab than on the lecture course. Be ready for the weekly quizzes (which aren't too bad if you read through the lab the night before).",
    "I would recommend the class to other students who want to gain basic experience of working in a lab but only if he\/she has no experience prior to the class. If the student already has an experience of working in a lab I would recommend the person to take higher level lab course than Chemistry 119L.",
    "A basic lab class. Not extremely difficult, but not very exciting either. I would take it if you have to, but not if you don't need to.",
    "Chem Lab 119 is a good course. The experiments are all interesting and fairly different from one another. Dr. Parr is a good teacher, and all of the TAs are great. We only had to do a couple full lab reports, which was nice, and the typical lab reports we did required just enough analysis so that we fully understood our results. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Take it if you need to. Otherwise, I'm sure you can think of a better way to spend 4+ hours of your afternoon (and don't forget the amount of time to do the lab writeups).",
    "This is a fantastic class and I would recommend it to anyone as their first lab course in college! Professor Parr and the T.A's are great at explaining the labs and are always open to questions. Though the labs are sometimes a bit dull, they do use a variety of different equipment, so they are good preparation for other labs. Also, while preparing you for writing lab reports a couple of times, the course usually only requires you to do the results and discussion part of a lab.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "CHEM 119L gives you a chance to practice basic chem lab techniques and helps you with some of the major topics in CHEM 118. The workload is reasonable\/light and the class is very well-organized and straightforward. This class stresses accuracy more than some other labs, but in the end it's not as hard as it sounds and pushing yourself this way really makes you focus. Studying for lab quizzes is important - make sure you understand all the calculations you will be doing before you come to lab.",
    "It's a fun course, but it's a bit dreary. Lab reports are hard, but Professor Parr and Jorge both excellently introduce you to the concept of labs.",
    "I would recommend Chem 119 but you have to take it if you take 118. Parr is a nice guy and explains everything before the lab. Yes there are prelab quizzes but they are always so easy and most of the time I noticed he would explain the quiz answers in the prelecture before giving us the quiz. The labs mostly took less time than allotted. I was usually out of lab 1-2 hours early and the writeups were really short. We had two full length lab reports and the rest were just calculations. The TAs graded really nicely and the in lab notes didnt have to be extensive at all.",
    "Chem 119 is doable, especially with a great lab section leader. It merely requires you to invest chunks of time at certain times of the week, namely when you are in lab (4 hrs, but sometimes may be shorter depending on when you finish the experiment) and when you write the lab report. Jonathan Parr has an interesting personality that some may not be used to, but he does a good job of explaining the experiment process and what is required in the lab report. Try to sign up for lab days on Tuesday or Wednesday if you can. Choose reliable lab partners to work with.",
    "You have to take this along with 118 and it includes some fascinating (some not so fascinating) labs. Enjoy the experience- the labs deal with more interesting material than the typical general chemistry lab and establishes some familiarity with basic experimental techniques. Stay on top of the prelab quizzes and start your lab reports early, preferable a few days after lab or even sooner.",
    "If you're taking Chemistry 118, you should definitely take this lab because the material coincides and it will help you understand better.",
    "A tedious class. Makes for a good accompaniment with 118 but the workload can get annoying. However, you can't expect much more out of a gen. chem lab class.",
    "While I found this lab long and occasionally dull, it was not particularly hard.",
    "Good, basic lab course.",
    "While you're pretty much forced to take 119 if you're set on taking Chem 118, I wouldn't consider it a malus whatsoever. While it takes up a day a week, for only half a credit, and lab reports aren't everyone's cup of tea, I for one absolutely loved it. Anyone who's excited at the prospect of shopping for a lab coat, breaking a ton of glassware, building a solar cell from scratch and having a weekly dose of Doc. Parr's accent should be psyched for this course. The workload really isn't that bad (and I complained about math 112 psets) and either way both the T.A, prof. Parr other students arealways on the ball to help you. Enjoy the course, what more can I say?",
    "Nice lab. i took it because it was required. take it if you love learning the concepts behind actual labs.",
    "The actual experiments themselves do not teach much, but the write-ups and thinking about the labs does reenforce some important concepts.",
    "Chemistry lab takes a lot of time for a half-credit class. Dr. Parr makes many of the labs interesting and fun, but some remain boring and tedious. Lab reports generally don't take too long but I can't say the same for the lab itself. Four hours in a lab is a long time, but if you find the material interesting, it's not so bad.",
    "Chem 119L is a laboratory course designed for students with advanced general chemistry knowledge. It gives you practical opportunities to use this, and allows you to acclimatize to the college science lab environment, which with its fast pace can take some getting used to. Definitely take the time to review the requisite Gen Chem concepts before coming to do the lab, however, because the pre-lab quizes definitely require a thorough grasp of these skills.",
    "Chemistry 119 is like any other chem lab and required if you take chemistry 118.",
    "I would recommend it!",
    "A pretty easy, standard chemistry lab. Definitely recommended.",
    "It is a typical chem lab. It's definitely not too bad. I'd recommend it.",
    "Chemistry 119L is a pretty standard general chemistry lab. It is somewhat synchronized with the material from Chem 118, though you'll find yourself doing a lot of your standard titrations and whatnot. If you read the lab manual before class and figure out what you need to do, you should be fine. Some of the full lab reports can be very time-consuming, but the majority do not take a huge amount of time.",
    "good intro lab course without too much workload. Quizzes re big, so study for them.",
    "Chem 119L is not bad. Presumably you have to take it because you're taking chemistry, but don't fear the lab, it's pretty chill.",
    "One of my favorite classes! Not so difficult that you want to rip your hair out, but still made you think and was invaluable in understanding the material taught in 118.",
    "A useful supplement to chem 118.",
    "I liked this lab, to be honest. When I first came to Yale, everyone was moaning about the workload of labs, but I think it could have been a lot worse. The professor didn't bog us down with writing whole lab report each week, just the most important sections (which ended up being only the calculations most of the time). The only thing that worried me at the end was my quiz grades. Make sure to study for quizzes. They aren't too bad.",
    "This lab course was the perfect complement to the Chemistry 118 lecture course. The labs that we conducted were excellent in matching the topics covered in lecture either by investigating how certain constants were determined, or conducting the same experiments done in the past to develop today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accepted theories, or examining how certain chemistry concepts are applied in science. The workload is not too bad; you just have to read the lab procedure for the week before class and be prepared to take a short quiz on what you read before beginning the lab. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to write out too many full lab reports. Usually it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the results and calculations that you type up and submit. Also, if you work efficiently, you can finish early and leave before the full four hours are up. The grading is really fair, and overall, the lab is a fun class that can really help you understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in the 118 class.",
    "Very good course. Most of the time, full lab reports aren't required so mostly calculations and results (the important parts) are what you learn.",
    "I'd very much recommend the lab.",
    "I really enjoyed Chem 119L. True, there was a little too much titrating for my preference, but two of my suitemates were in the lab for Chem 115 (I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 117L?) and I definitely walked away with the better experience. Lab reports areusually only results and calculations for the course, so not bad at all, and Dr. Parr is absolutely fantastic. If you have a choice for chem lab, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d definitely go for 119."
