    "We studied the city from multiple points of view: historical, social, political, economic, artistic and how those different aspects interacted with and complicated each other.",
    "This class is a survey of Athenian culture, and the first part of the required survey for the Classics major. From what I've heard about the former literature survey requirement, this class seems like a much better alternative. The workload is really reasonable, with a handful of key passage readings for each topic, two papers, and a final of IDs and essay. The papers are the best part of the course\u00e2\u0080\u0094each topic includes a required bibliography which seems restrictive at first but really helps shape your paper into an interesting take on broad and complex topics. Professor Greenwood is a great lecturer and a really really nice woman.",
    "Classical Civilization is a wide ranging course based in primary source documents (in translation) that covers aspects of Classical life beyond just the sanitized ideals the concept normally brings to mind. This broad view really makes the past come to life. Though the course does spend time discussing the glories of the Acropolis and democratic institutions, it deals also with the complexities of the Athenian reality where only a small fraction of the population were enfranchised. Other topics include slavery, the role of women, homosexuality, ethnography, and many more. Each lecture introduces a new perspective on the ancient city. The workload is quite manageable: short readings every week and two essays. This was by far my favorite class of the semester and is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I would recommend it to anyone. Prospective Classics major or not, everyone can learn something from this class, whether about literature, human nature, or politics. Professor Greenwood is fantastic!",
    "This was an absolutely fantastic course. Professor Greenwood is incredibly knowledgable about anything pertaining to Athens, and is one of the most eloquent lecturers I've had at Yale. Bryant was also amazing- he made every section fascinating, and really showed how much he cared about the stuff we were doing. The workload is not bad- there are two pretty substantial papers and a fair bit of reading each week, and I wish I had started studying early for the exam, but everything was definitely doable.",
    "I would definitely without a doubt recommend this class to a fellow student, but with thecaveat that I mentioned in one of my other responses -- to some degree these lectures assume or require a basic familiarity with the framework of Ancient Athenian history. If you're looking for an introductory course to give you a foundational backing in dates and figures, this might not be it. But if you're excited about Athens and want to think deeply about its history in a really thorough and stimulating way, this class will offer that experience in spades.",
    "Very broad introduction to Athenian society and culture through an interdisciplinary study of literary sources and material culture. Lectures are wonderful - a treat to listen to!",
    "I'd recommend it only if you've previously taken courses in classical civilization, as it is not a comprehensive overview of areas you'd expect to cover\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don't know much about the major figures in ancient Athens, nor how a law was passed. The course deals primarily with issues of sex, gender, race, and the idea of the \"other\" in ancient Athens. It's almost a WGSS approach to the classics. That said, Professor Greenwood is a fantastic lecturer, as her voice sounds the way silk feels. But it's a weirdly organized course.",
    "I took this course as my first Classics course, and although it is a demanding course because of the breadth of knowledge it covers, it is amazing! The readings are all enjoyable, the essays also. I would take this course again without hesitation. The lectures are interactive, there is usually a discussion going on, and Prof. Greenwood is amazing.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. I am a Classics major, so obviously found this course very interesting and in depth. But I also have a friend who took the class, who isn't a Classics major, and she found the material dense, but manageable. The class is great, you cover loads of topic areas in Ancient Athenian life, and Professor Greenwood is a great instructor. The classes are very relaxed, and you can ask questions any time. There is very little outside reading, and just two papers, and a final. Take this class if you like Ancient Greece!",
    "A course that looks broadly at the subject of Ancient Athenian civilization, while simultaneously questioning certain aspects of our modern cultural perception of Athens as a political and social ideal. The course also touches on more philosophical topics like \"remembrance,\" and the \"classical ideal.\"",
    "Overall, CLCV 256 provided a complicated look into Ancient Athenian culture during the Golden Era (mostly 5th century BCE) and art relating to this era- ranging through marriage, sexuality, politics, law, and warfare. Overall, this course was very good, mostly because of the dynamic duo team of Professor Greenwood and Bryant Kirkland- the best professor-TF team I have experienced in my five semesters at Yale. Greenwood and Bryant did an incredible job at revealing the doubt and complexity inherent to the Classics discipline while at the same time also revealing the richness of Ancient Athens. I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning about Ancient Athens and in learning about the Classics discipline in general- I would especially recommend it if the Greenwood-Kirkland team is still intact!"
