    "This course is essentially just getting course credit for research in a lab. That said, don't underestimate the writing assignments that go along with it (1-page abstract, 5-page midterm report, 15-page final report). They take a good amount of time and can be difficult to meet the page minimums for.",
    "You work with an individual professor on a project over the course of the semester and submit updates to the DUS. It's a great course for teaching you about the research process and is highly self-motivated\/self-led.",
    "MENG 471 is an independent research project, carried out under the mentorship of faculty advisors. The course is a requirement for MechE ABET students, but, even if you are not required to take the course, I strongly suggest taking at least a semester to do research. It is a completely independent, self-driven setting through which students can gain a lot.",
    "I got an excellent insight into real engineering problems and problem solving. Something I would recommend every MechE student to do.",
    "Definitly work with a partner and split up the tasks! It's a lot more fun that way and not as intensive. Have a clear idea of what you want to do going in -- there are mentors everywhere, but you can't go to them with nothing and expect help!",
    "I would say that MENG 471 is an awesome opportunity to become involved in a great project and highly recommend it to any mechanical engineering student.",
    "It's pretty chill. There's a 1 page abstract, 5-6 page midterm, 15 page final paper, and a 10 minute presentation. Your experience depends almost completely on your PI."
