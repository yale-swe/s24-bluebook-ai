    "RUSS 145 is a course meant for people who are vary serious about learning Russian. It takes a lot of work, but in my opinion, not only does it pay off, but it's really the proper way to learn this language. I would recommend the course without any reservations.",
    "This is a fantastic course: language learning at the proper pace (or, if anything, a little slow). Take it and you'll never regret it. As long as you can keep up, you'll be fine."
