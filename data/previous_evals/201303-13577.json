   "comments": [
    "The supplemental classes on various aspects (lobbying, communications, etc) should be voluntary.",
    "Maybe some of the class periods could be used for group work where the professors could come around and check in on us while we are actually working (as opposed to just asking how we're doing in meetings).",
    "More sharing of experiences, already early on in the semester, of the groups and their clients.",
    "I would have personally been more interested in having an extra class on foundations of U.S. environmental law and policy rather than a longer focus on environmental campaigns. However, I know that there is another environmental law and policy course that students can take if it fits into their schedule. I would have also liked to have more of an interaction with the law school students, and to learn more about opportunities for future classes\/workshops at the law school.",
    "Materials covered in lecture were often unrelated to projects.",
    "I have no idea how to fix this, but it seems to me that some projects end up being much more than 120 hours, and others just squeak to that amount. Somehow, projects need to be better evaluated for the approximate amount of they will require, because it is difficult, as a student, to tell your client that you are going to do less than they have asked for (and often, you don't know this until 75% of the way through the term, when you are 50% done with your hours :) ).",
    "The Boot Camp seemed quite ambitious with how much information it was trying to pack into an hour or so. I ended up feeling like I didn't get a whole lot out of it because it was so compressed and the pace was so fast. I think covering less, but going at a slower speed where there's more time for questions, would have been better for me.I think the instructors could have maybe talked to us a little bit more about career\/professional development with clients. E.g. how\/when to talk about how the work could be conveyed on a resume, if\/how it's okay to ask for introductions to their colleagues or for career advice, etc. I think maybe spending 20-30 minutes in some class (at the beginning of the semester) talking about that would have been useful.",
    "One or two of the lectures didn't interest me very much, but it's such a diverse class that I think that is ok. There was something for everyone.",
    "It would be nice to work our projects into class lectures a little more often, and it would be nice to have some more in-person project check-ins from the instructors. They were offered, but it would be nice to have a little bit more research guidance in the future during class time. i found that I was learning on the fly and could have benefited from some more research advice from the instructors who surely have much more experience than I with client relationships and completing projects."

    "Advantages: never-ending support (and sometimes commiseration), getting to know new people, benefiting from others' expertiseDisadvantages: making sure everyone is on the same page can be time-consuming, and sometimes it is difficult to move ahead because it makes sense if everyone moves forward (with the stage of research, writing, etc.) at the same time. Otherwise, a super awesome group experience!",
    "We were able to get a lot done. We worked well together but there is no way to evaluate our group members, which I wish I could have done.",
    "It worked well and we struggled sometimes but overall it was great to improve my group work skills.",
    "Advantages - I really got to learn a lot from my peers and their existing knowledge. They really kept the project moving throughout the semester.Disadvantages - the small annoyances of working with people. For example, one group member was literally always late to every meeting or expert interview we had.And it was also just difficult to weave together different sections (that we had each written) and to go through multiple phases of editing as a group (taking turns with the document). Fortunately we gave ourselves enough time for that and I think it turned out well in the end.I think the guidance in class was mainly about relations between the students and client, but it might have also been interesting\/useful to talk about how to have a successful\/functioning group (just as students).",
    "my group was awesome. everyone was positive and enthusiastic, and we worked really well together. no real major problems.i appreciate the group work, as this is something i'll likely be encountering during my career.",
    "The advantage was learning how to coordinate logistics for a semester-long project with fellow students. However, that was one of the greatest challenges, as well. Our project's workload was easily divided among our group members, and we could each work relatively autonomously on our individual parts throughout the semester. It was hard to synthesize our work, however, one the writing was complete because we all have different writing styles, etc.",
    "Our group worked well together but focused on very different research areas.",
    "Having a team was a valuable part of the work experience and made working for a client more manageable (and likely more realistic). That said, it was occasionally hard to coordinate meeting times and ensure we were on the same page about progress."
