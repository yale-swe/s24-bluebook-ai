    "This class is incredible. Don't get discouraged if you see music majors who know a lot more than you and have a lot more professional singing experience. You will grow a lot.",
    "Better vocal technique and knowledge of composers.",
    "Coming from a background with very little formal vocal training, this class was a wonderful introduction to a music by number of different composers, French and German, and performing vocal music from memory. Coaching with Sara each week was immensely helpful as I was having trouble with just singing through long phrases. She also helped so much with pronunciation (French is hard!), breathing, and phrasing. Also, being able to see other singers in the class perform and grow throughout the semester was really edifying as we had in-class workshops. Probably my biggest take-away from the course was how to approach learning vocal music - how to learn the lyrics and pronunciation in the language, and learn the notes, and practice to the point where I have enough technical mastery over the piece that I can perform it musically.",
    "I had never sung in Italian, French, or German before this class, and the coachings were extremely helpful in gaining comfort with those languages. I also gained a lot of general insight about vocal performance.",
    "I developed my singing ability to a greater degree, working on singing technique, instruction in which I have not had access to until now.",
    "I learned new repertoire and improved diction and some vocal technique things that are helpful for Romantic music. Also learned a few more names of famous singers and some music history here and there.",
    "I learned a lot about the lives and times of the composers that we studied. Even better was the chance to just hear the new repertoire -- since each student learned individual songs by four different composers, I heard about 60 new art songs that are rarely performed. I plan on incorporating several into my personal bag of tricks in the future. I also learned a TREMENDOUS amount about diction, legato, and placing words in phrases from Sarah Kohane, the co-teacher of the course. She is a treasure of knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "Everything is perfect the way it is but if I were to change one thing, I'd hope that the concert isn't in reading week and is moved to the week before instead. we'd get a bigger audience and better student performance",
    "It's already perfect. Couldn't be changed.",
    "I thought the weekly coaching was immensely helpful, and the seminars when we learned about music history was also interesting. I'm not sure if I have any comments on the weaknesses of this course, as I've grown so much as a singer in this course. I do think that some of us were intimidated by the quizzes at first... haha",
    "This course is great! It's a godsend for singers in the department. There's nothing for us otherwise. Coaching and singing with Sara Kohane is an incredible opportunity. Professor Lalli is incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and committed to undergraduate performance.",
    "I think Prof. Lalli has got it down. It's a very well-designed course. Towards the end of the semester he had us on a regime of daily practice enforced by self-reporting emails, and I think that worked really well. It would be unsustainable over a whole semester, but maybe for a week each month? It would help inculcate good study habits. God knows it worked on me."

    "Absolutely. Mu sd Ic is incredibly important and lalli is a fantastic teacher. Vital that everyone takes this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend MUSI 222 with Professor Lalli. Coming from a background with very little formal vocal training, this class was a wonderful introduction to a music by number of different composers, French and German, and performing vocal music from memory. Coaching with Sara each week was immensely helpful as I was having trouble with just singing through long phrases.

Probably my biggest take-away from the course was how to approach learning vocal music - how to learn the lyrics and pronunciation in the language, and learn the notes, and practice to the point where I have enough technical mastery over the piece that I can perform it musically.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Lalli's class. Lalli is incredibly lovable, and also incredibly knowledgeable. The class period itself is an extremely fun way to spend two hours, and all of the skills you'll develop and people you'll meet will be worth it. A note - in the syllabus, it says you can expect to sing about every three weeks, which is not true. You'll sing every week. But that's not to say that you shouldn't take it! Just know what you're signing up for (singing up for, amirite?).",
    "If you're a singer, you should take this course at least once and probably a bunch of times. It's really good for you. Working with Sara Kohane is great, make the most of it.",
    "I would recommend it for sure. It's a great introduction or continuing study of art songs, and the great thing about it is that no matter how good of a musician you are, you will be able to push yourself. The one thing that I would say is that unlike most other courses, where major exams come around twice or three times per semester, in 222 you often have to sing your memorized song after just a week -- so you actually have to be performance-ready each week, a different atmosphere than having to slack off for a while and then put in a big effort for a midterm or paper. In many ways, this weekly readiness is harder."
