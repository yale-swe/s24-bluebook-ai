I get concrete advise when I present, which definitely improves the quality of my work. I also love to learn about other, related areas research when my peers are presenting."

    "This lab provides a level of feedback and constructive criticism that I can't get anywhere else. However, something I've noticed is that when I'm giving feedback on other people's work, I tend to assume that they know their work is great - and therefore focus on areas that could be improved. When *I'm* presenting and receive criticism, however, it's hard to remember that there are also aspects of my research that are interesting and important. I think our lab has started to focus more on what's great about each other's research, and I would love to continue this next year."
