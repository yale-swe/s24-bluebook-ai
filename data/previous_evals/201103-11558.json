   "comments": [
    "This is a really neat class that goes over a lot of cool stuff in cognitive science. Towards the end, it really becomes a guest speaker series, as Eric manages to invite a lot of bigwigs in cognitive science to come and talk. Lots of fun, not much work (two 6 page papers, very reasonable). Eric is a chill guy",
    "This seminar is great! We go over a gamut of cog sci, and Eric does a fabulous job of balancing philosophical and psychological perspectives! I would HIGHLY recommend it. best two hours of my week, every week.",
    "This class is a great survey of the cognitive science of mental architecture. The professor is great, funny, and engaging, and the handful of speakers brought in were extremely interesting. This class really covered cutting edge material, in an interesting and engaging way.",
    "I would definitely take it if you're into cognitive science, psych, or philosophy. It's a mostly stress-free class with an intimate and engaging discussion on a great set of topics.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who's interested in discussing philosophy of mind in a way that may seem sometimes fairly irrelevant to the practice of cognitive psychology.",
    "overarching question that this course seeks to answer is how the mind's structure influences our cognition. It's a matter glossed over by other CogSci courses, and given that very few Philosophy of Mind courses exist at Yale, this was an extremely valuable seminar for my understanding of Cognitive Science as a whole. The mix of philosophy grad students& CogSci undergrads made for a rather frustrating conversation at times, in that everyone was coming from a different place, and it was easy to feel lost as conversation jumped between topics. The course's structure was less clear to me than I would have liked, a problem that heightened near the end of the term with the prevalence of guest speakers. That being said, the works we read were as fundamental as you can get for such a dynamic field of study, and the quality\/fame of the visiting speakers was extremely impressive. It's essential to have some philosophy background. Eric (as he insists upon being called) is perhaps best in office hours, where - as opposed to class - you feel as though you understand everything. Take advantage of these. The readings were BULKY, sometimes confusing, and should have been considered together as a set - even though he tended to separate recommended from required (which meant that I only did the required readings, as they alone were usually 100+ pages), our conversation drifted among all of them, without any sort of gloss or summary. This became confusing on occasion and left me wishing I'd put more work into background research or additional readings. It was about impossible to avoid zoning out for at least a few minutes in our hot, overstuffed room during the two-hour long sessions with no apparent organization. But it was, overall, a good class. Most of all: we were treated like adults, not college students, and expected to commit a requisite level of work to participate in conversation. If you're ready for an advanced course in this field and look forward to the lack of hand-holding, definitely take this.",
    "The course covers some challenging material. I wouldn't recommend it for your first philosophy course, or even your first course on philosophy of the mind. That said, the format is great, basically two hours of discussion and, later in the semester, guest lectures. There's a fair amount of reading, but not too much work other than that and a huge amount of freedom about how to arrange your workload. I enjoyed the class.",
    "Very interesting class. Weekly seminar with tons of guest speakers in the second half. Essentially a philosophical approach to cog sci\/psychology issues, which was a unfamiliar but interesting area for me. In terms of workload, options for one, two, or three papers, which worked out, and lots and lots of reading (sometimes too much). We could essentially write about anything related to cog sci for the papers, and I ended up having a lot of fun with them. A little more time in between guest speakers would have helped, as they tended to get into very high-level conversations which would have between useful to pick apart later. Class could get a little disorganized sometimes, but it was always interesting. Eric was great: very chill, obviously really excited about the subject, and super accessible outside of class, much more so than most professors I've had."
