   "comments": [
    "This course contributed to my research by forcing me to think early on about how to plan my graduate school career and by exposing me to all the directions that my research may venture, including those I had not previously anticipated.",
    "It helped me understand how varied (and divided!) US sociology can be. It cast a light on the diverse attitudes of professors on \"public sociology\" broadly defined. The course would benefit from overtly addressing some of the history of the discipline in the US: closure of departments in the 1970s, controversies around \"public sociology\" in the late 90s \/ early 2000s, etc. Maybe a light syllabus (1-2 articles per week) on these matters would thicken the substance of the class."
