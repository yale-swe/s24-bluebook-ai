    "Great course for people interested in field work. This course helps you get over your own fears of what it might be like to go into the field. Of course it is going to be easier here than in some faraway places, but that transition is going to be easier to make if you have at least given it a shot once before in a more comfortable environment.",
    "This is a one-stop shop for learning the ins and outs of qualitative research from a political science, sociology or anthropology\/ethnography background. The reading list is long, but quite good and useful. I would recommend this course highly, with the caveat: it is what you make of it. I imagine some students probably phone in the research project, or hit dead ends, but those who are enterprising enough will get a lot out of the simple act of getting in the field, talking to people outside of Yale, and getting their hands dirty as it were.",
    "Very good grounding in fieldwork methods and quantitative methodology."

    "I honestly did not know really what qualitative research was before last fall, or how it fit into the discipline. So there was a steep learning curve. The readings were very useful. The project I felt could have used more structure, guidance and feedback at times but overall is as useful as the student makes it (much of qualitative research, by its very nature, is trial and error and making mistakes). I intend to use some of the skill sets I developed in this course for my eventual dissertation, so in that sense, it was extremely helpful.",
    "It gives me a solid grounding in fieldwork and ethnographic methods."
