    "Great insight into the history of the Jewish people",
    "I learned a lot about the subject, but I also learned to think about history and the forces that shape it in a new way.",
    "I learned about the history of Jews from the Creation up until the 15th century - their religious development and interactions with other cultures. I also learned how to engage with and analyze primary source documents.",
    "We learned so much about Jewish history, it was actually far more interesting than I thought it would be.",
    "An incredible appreciation and understanding of the Jews and their history.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about Jewish history and the importance of engaging with primary source texts",
    "I learned about the history of the Jews through medieval times. This class helped me learn how to study history and write historical papers.",
    "I gained a fair amount of knowledge about Jewish history, from Biblical Times to the Early Modern period. (This new question is probably of more value, or at least more propitious to interesting answers, in subjects other than History.)"

   "comments": [
    "Amazing lecturer",
    "The material is incredibly interesting, however, the lectures are a big disorganized.",
    "I liked how most of the readings were based in primary source documents, I thought that helped us to learn the history without having as much scholarly opinion added in. Overall I thought the course was interesting - good lectures and good additional readings.",
    "Ivan Marcus is a god. I love this professor. I am writing this evaluation less than 24 hours after taking the final. Not only can he grade tests and papers super fast, but he is a great lecturer. Always interesting and cares a lot about the students. Great guy.",
    "The strength of the course undoubtedly lies in Professor Marcus - he was a brilliant lecture, who managed to cover thousands of years of history, yet retain a clear sense of the key themes and trends throughout. There was not one point in the course where I felt confused or overwhelmed by the material. The course was superb, I struggle to think of any weaknesses!",
    "Ivan Marcus is an amazing professor. He made the class fly by.",
    "This course was great and should not be changed",
    "The professor really knows what he's talking about and tries to be engaging. The class only requires you to work as hard as you want to and to put whatever you want to in it (you won't be at a disadvantage if you don't have much time to devote to it). The prompt for the paper could have been more clearly explained in order to make the assignment more understandable.",
    "The course would, frankly, be difficult to improve. This is not because this class was the greatest academic experience of my life; it is simply because Professor Marcus does a very good job of telling the story of most of Jewish history, and a student's enjoyment of and level of intellectual fulfillment in the course will probably be more related to her or his relative proclivity to Jewish history than anything besides Professor Marcus's approach, which, as I stated above, is pretty well-tuned at this point."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class! Professor Marcus is the best lecturer I've had so far at Yale and the workload is very doable.",
    "I would certainly recommend History 219 to any student looking for a broad introduction to Jewish history. Professor Marcus is extremely knowledgable and a very engaging lecturer. The readings are well-chosen and interesting, and the workload (one essay based on primary sources plus two hour-long exams) is fair. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes--the course is an interesting survey of early Jewish history, and Prof. Marcus is hilarious and smart.",
    "This course is super interesting for anyone who is interested in Jewish history during this time period, that is, Biblical to around the time of the Spanish Inquisition and a little bit beyond. The work load is not bad, just a paper and two midterms, no final, and the readings are always reviewed in class. Just be cautioned: the lectures can be really disorganized and rambling, so part of studying is reorganizing the information yourself chronologically and by subject.",
    "If you are interested in Jewish history, definitely take this course. It isn't very difficult (it would make a good 5th class) and Professor Ivan has pretty interesting lectures.",
    "This course is awesome. Take it. Not too much work and you get to get to know one of the coolest yale professors.",
    "Definitely take this course - the content is fascinating and Professor Marcus is a brilliant lecturer and teacher.",
    "This course was amazing because Ivan Marcus is amazing.",
    "Yoooo take this, its super chill. Paper assignment is one of the most fun and valuable Ive had here.",
    "Yes, It was extremely interesting. You learn a lot about Jewish history which is a fascinating history.",
    "Definitely take this class! I'm a STEM major and was looking for a chill but interesting humanities class - this definitely was what I was looking for. It's very little work but I learned a lot!",
    "If you pay attention, you will learn a great deal about Jewish history in this course. If you are interested in the subject, take it; if you are not, don't. It probably won't change your life, but I am very happy that I took the course, and if you enjoy history in general, you may well be too."
