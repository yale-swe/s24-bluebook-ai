    "Take it. Especially if you want to learn more about important heroic figures. Lots of reading, but definitely manageable.",
    "An exploration of ancient Mesopotamian flood stories, the Odyssey, Oedipus and the Book of Job to see how the ancient definition of hero shifted. There was also some exploration into modern reinterpretations of these stories and heroes, but we didn't really get there until late in the course.I think a student would have to be genuinely interested in ancient flood myths, but if that's your cup of tea then absolutely, a really cool class--and we got to handle cuneiform tablets, which was amazing.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class! Even if you have already read much of the material, its all worth a second read and you really do gain a new perspective on it. You will have to do reading responses each week, but they are far from onerous and often rather fun. Prof Slanski is an awesome instructor - highly recommend!",
    "Take it, good reading, Slanski runs discussions well, and especially take it if Professor Greenwood is co-teaching like she did this year.",
    "If you are interested in reading incredible books from an interdisciplinary humanities perspective and want to take a true seminar, take this class."
