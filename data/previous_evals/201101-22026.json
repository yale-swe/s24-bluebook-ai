   "comments": [
    "Painful. Truly painful. This course focuses on romantic works and because romantic works use many chromatic chords that simply don't fit nicely into the roman numeral system, much of this course seems to be trying to fit a square peg into a circular hole. Partwriting assignments take forever and harmonic analysis of Chopin pieces are brutal. I love music, but this was awful.On one level, I can definitely agree that music analysis has some importance, but the level to which we dissected pieces in this class really just seemed a little silly. If staring at scores for hours on end is your idea of fun, you will have a blast in MUSI211. If you are interested in performance (or need to complete your theory requirement for lessons for credit), do not take this course. Complete the requirement with 205 and 210.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Music 211 to another student if they are interested in music theory like I am. I am not a music major, but have always found theory to be fascinating and you will be amazed with how much you learn in the course \u0096 you enter with some elementary knowledge and the ability to compose maybe a classical minuet from 210 and exit with knowledge of romanticism and the ability to compose in the style of Romantic greats like Chopin. Truly amazing! But it is a lot of work and not a class to breeze by in, so only take it if you're very interested or are a prospective major.",
    "A lot of work, but you will get a lot of this class. Take this class if you absolutely love music theory - a lot of the material is advanced and because of the huge workload, you must love this class in order to get the most out of it. Each assignment takes a minimum of 2 hours to complete, and the compositions will take days to complete.",
    "Music 211 is a solid course in 19th century theory. If you are not required to take it, you may find it to be too tedious, however.",
    "Music 211 is a great class, and opens up much broader avenues for understanding compositional techniques than 210. With the introduction of concepts of chromatic harmony, compositional choices that were formerly vague become much clearer. The work in this class can be a lot at times, with two major model composition projects and an analytical essay in additionto regular turned-in homework. Learning about the concepts 211 teaches, though, is invaluable for any serious student of music. Take the class!",
    "Music 211 is an advanced introductory course for music theory that focuses on 19th century music. I would definitely recommend the course to another student. Professor Brody is an excellent teacher that makes the class exciting and fun, and the class teaches material at a good and comfortable pace - the workload is manageable and great practice for composition.",
    "This class is great. It requires dedication and follow-through to do well (as does any foundational course), but if you put in the time, the results are great and satisfying. It picks up where MUSI 210 left off, with more emphasis on analysis, and covers a greater array of topics dealing with chromatic harmony. Chris Brody is a great teacher, very fair and helpful and clear in presenting different concepts in class."
