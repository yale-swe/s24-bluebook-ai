   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Ling 253 to a student if they had taken Intro to Linguistics and enjoyed it. Ling 253 is certainly not for everybody, just because many people would not find the content interesting. However, for people who are interested in linguistics and have a base level of knowledge about syntax, I would definitely recommend Ling 253 (especially if Professor Wood is still teaching it). The Psets are time consuming and not easy, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone as a first linguistics class or as something to take on a whim.",
    "Absolutely my favorite class this term. This is a general overview of the structure of language -- required if you're a ling major, interesting even if you're not. Professor Wood is awesome, fair, and keeps class fun. Take it!",
    "I would summarize the class as an introduction to the most fundamental ideas of syntactic theory. I would not recommend this class unless you are willing to put the effort in to learn the material.",
    "'Twas an excellent course! In it, Jim had us consider interesting questions about the language that I at least had never considered before: e.g., \"want\" and \"need\" seem pretty similar, so why can we say \"There needs to be a chaperone\" but not \"There wants to be a chaperone\"? Or why do we use \"him\" in some places but \"himself\" in others? Each time we finally figured out the solutions to these puzzles, new puzzles arose, which really gave me an appreciation of the complexity of the syntax of natural language. Jim also kept the course very entertaining. He started each class with a Simpsons Quote of the Day relating to that day's lesson, and he supplemented the core ideas with interesting side concepts and anecdotes. The problem sets were by no means trivial but never took to long to do. I would highly recommend this course to anyone wanting a deeper understanding of how sentences are formed.",
    "LING 253 is a great introductory syntax class! Each new concept was introduced logically and with convincing evidence to support it. I loved seeing the structure hidden in the sentences we say daily. I would recommend this class to any student who wants to learn about syntax! I took it as a linguistics major, but if you liked diagramming sentences as a child and want to learn an even more scientific and accurate way to represent sentences, take this class!",
    "Take this class! If you're a ling major, you'll have to take it anyway, but I especially recommend that you take it with Jim. He's a great instructor who cares about his students, and it's very obvious that he's excited about the material, which translates into a greater learning experience for us. Our TA was also excellent and very helpful. I wasn't a fan of syntax in Intro, but this was definitely enjoyable. Put in effort, go to class, learn the material, and you'll be fine!",
    "An excellent course. Over the course of the semester you will build up a theory of English syntax based on super interesting observations about what sorts of sentences are grammatical. The workload is reasonable, and the exams are not too difficult if you've been following the lectures and doing the problem sets.",
    "I'm not a linguistics major, and I enjoyed this course. It explores the computational side of language, in a way, learning to describe the way we process and understand and construct sentences according to a very rigid set of rules, so this class can appeal to anyone with a quantitatively-geared mind who wants to do something a little different. The work load was light, the readings always discussed thoroughly in class and never tested, and the quizzes and final were straightforward. The best part about this class, though, was its interactivity. Professor Wood lead a discussion toward the theories he eventually wanted us to develop and use, but based on our opinions and comments and judgments, and he always welcomed our objections and encouraged group practice. A very fun, low-stress, and interesting class."
