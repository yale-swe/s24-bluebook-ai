   "comments": [
    "Fantastic class. Tolga gives excellent examples and teaches you about life as much as he teaches you about economics. Ignore all the hype that this class is really hard, if you get in, take it over the lecture.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class if you are considering majoring in Econ or if you want to fulfill a QR credit. I think this is a much better option than Econ 115 because its simply more interesting (you never fall asleep in lecture). And it's very little math, so anyone can take this class to fulfill their QR requirement.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS. You won't regret it. Whether or not you want to be an Econ major, or even like Econ, Tolga is a wonderful professor whose class you should absolutely take if you can.",
    "Yes because it is important for an econ major and is interesting sometimes. Also, it helps you think in a more practical manner.",
    "You probably learn the material a little better than in Econ 115, and Tolga is great. But the midterm\/final are more challenging, and the curve is worse.",
    "The Intro Micro seminar has its tradeoffs. It's smaller (25 people or so), and you'll learn the material more thoroughly than in the lecture, partly because it's easier to hear Tolga and\/or ask questions. Tolga is great at explaining concepts and providing examples. The downside is that the curve will be tough: even if you aced Econ in high school, be prepared to be with people who are all motivated to study and a low margin of error on the midterm\/final.",
    "You learn about the economy... sort of",
    "Take it! Learn a lot and the workload isn't too bad. 5 psets, one midterm and one final.",
    "I would say it is an intro econ class without the boredoms that come with a large lecture. I would totally reccomend this seminar to my peers.",
    "I recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend Econ 110 only if you have a particular interest in the subject. The material was all right, Tolga is a funny guy who tries to keep the dry intricacies of the subject interesting with stories about dating, etc.The workload wasn't bad. Midterms were basically the problem sets with the numbers changed, final had some curveball essay questions.",
    "Better than lecture, so take it.",
    "Yes! Econ 110 with Tolga is amazing. He makes sure you get the topic, and made economics as enjoyable as possible with the dry material.",
    "I woud recommend it even to students who do not wish to use it for a requirement. It is a good course to gain general knowledge about the workings of the modern economy.",
    "I think every one should get the opportunity to take this class with Tolga. The experience you would gain from taking this class will change the way you look at things and think.",
    "Econ 110 is a basic introductory microeconomics course, but taught in a smaller environment. It's not as daunting as a large lecture, and its smaller size is helpful to promoting greater effort and understanding in its students. I would recommend the class over the Econ 115 lecture, just because I think that smaller learning environment is very valuable for this particular subject.",
    "I recommend Econ 110 only if you really need it. Otherwise, it really was too difficult. It helped me realize that I would never ever major in Economics."
