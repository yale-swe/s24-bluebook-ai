For future instances it could be productive to have students prepare a first draft and discuss it in the seminar. That way every student goes into the Winter holidays with a first draft of the prospectus. This would perhaps mean having the Lightning Talks on the (two) Friday(s) before Thanksgiving break. I think that should be feasible."
