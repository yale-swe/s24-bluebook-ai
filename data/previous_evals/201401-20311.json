   "comments": [
    "A highlight of my Yale career. Professor Bloom is compassionate and insightful. He structured the discussions carefully, and made sure to develop the transitions between Lear, Macbeth, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest with both concision and depth. Every class felt a little panicky because there were so many questions unanswered. I will cherish the notes that I took for this class because I imagine visiting them over and over throughout my life, remembering things that spoke so deeply to me during this semester, recalling things I simply didn't understand. Perhaps what makes this class most memorable is the way Professor Bloom allows the characters and themes to become so close to his personal life, as though he knows these characters personally, as though--and this is something he adamantly believes--they are richer humans than you or I. One thing: I would highly recommend you read the relevant chapters from The Invention of the Human before going to class, because some of his crazy, complicated thoughts are structured in that book, so reading about them beforehand will make them easier to follow.",
    "Learn how to think, and enjoy yourself",
    "Worth it just for the chance to spend six sessions on King Lear. Bloom is a true genius, and the course is in many ways better understood as a survey of him and his critical method than a class on Shakespeare. The class is basically not a class, but a weekly book-club in which one person does 75% of the talking - certainly very easy but also quite enlightening. It's well worth reading some of Bloom's theoretical writings - or taking a class with his apostle Leslie Brisman - to give you a bit of structure to compliment Bloom's extremely scattershot method. Take it if you can - not a chance you're likely to have the likes of again.",
    "IF YOU GET IN, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "There is little that can be said to add to the many accolades given to this course. Without a doubt, this has been one of the greatest experiences of my entire academic career, if not my life. If it we only gained Professor Bloom's incredible insight into the Shakespearean cannon, that alone would make it a treasured experience. However, my time with Professor Bloom has meant so much more than that. I can honestly say that I am astonished with the consideration with which he approaches all of his students. He has absolutely shaped the way I will confront the world both intellectually and personally.",
    "This is a pretty light class that you should take if you would like to listen to Bloom talk. You will get what you put into it."
