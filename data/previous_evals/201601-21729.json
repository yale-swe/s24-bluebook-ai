    "If you like any kind of books or english class or even things to do with kids, just TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I was drawn in by an exciting syllabus and the opportunities for creative work, but the conversations were utterly dissatisfying throughout the semester. We rarely engaged in literary discussions, and I found my own attempts to guide the conversation frustrated by the structure of the seminar. Reading fun books is not worth spending a course credit on a class that fails to engage with those fun books on a critical level. I did enjoy my own projects, both creative and critical, so I am happy to have had an opportunity to work on those, but I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "I definitely recommend this class for the syllabus. It was great to reexamine children's texts when older. It's more reading than you think - easy reading, but more reading nonetheless. Definitely recommend taking advantage of the creative projects, and don't put off the in class performance! It turned a little bit into book club by the end, but I did like the class.",
    "I would recommend this class! There is quite a bit of reading, but it's super fun. You read classics from your childhood and learn about new work that is truly mind-blowing. It's a shame that more adults don't read and value children's lit. What a valuable class.",
    "This is a great class to reminisce about the good old days reading kids' books, or even read some you didn't get a chance to when you were little. There is quite a bit of reading, though; you'll get through two whole novels and then some additional texts each week. But all in all, a fun class.",
    "This course is interesting if you would like to think about children and the place of media in their development. Be prepared to read multiple novels in a week and be able to pick out details that would strike a child rather than yourself as an adult.",
    "I'm very conflicted in reviewing this class. I want so badly for there to be a course for an English major in search of good critical discussion of children's lit, because good children's lit merits that level of discussion but I can't in good conscience say you'll find it here. The syllabus, while made up of brilliant material and some interesting critical work, is way too broad. Literature for 3 to 5 year olds and YA novels just do not belong in the same class. The most participation heavy discussions were honestly the ones where everyone reminisced about how much they liked a given book as a child, which was fun for about five minutes but does not constitute a good seminar discussion. Professor Stepto would often address open ended questions as though they had a single correct answer, which stifled a lot of the better discussions that came up. Like any seminar this one depends a lot on the other people taking it, so if you know that others with whom you'd enjoy talking about this material will be taking the class at the same time, you should still consider it. Otherwise, I would recommend tackling the syllabus the critical works and Wally's Stories in particular on your own."
