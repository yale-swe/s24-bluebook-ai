   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class, but only if you were very interested in the material.",
    "This class is a definite must-take for anyone interested in American political\/social\/cultural history. Even for those that aren't, Professor Hayden makes it an awesome class. The reading is super interesting and the lectures are awesome.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes is a wonderful class. I went into it thinking I would drop it if my 5.5 credit courseload got to be too much, but the workload for this class ended up never getting to be too much to manage. I would really recommend this class for everyone - Hayden covers so many facets of suburbanization and the development of America's \"landscape\" that it fundamentally changes the way you see the world around you. I came from a small rural town and I still found it interesting, so if you come from a suburb or a city (both of which are the focus of this course) I can see this being even more applicable to you. Plus, the way the course is structured means that you have the main term paper (around 12-15 pages, totally manageable) due before Thanksgiving and the final before reading week even begins. This really helps you out and decreases your stress level. So I would at least shop it if I were you. It at least warrants that. Also, Dolores Hayden is a legend in the field.",
    "Its a comprehensive course that outlines the growth of urban and rural America, with a focus on housing, highways, cars, and the growth of cities including skyscrapers and ethnic culture.I would recommend this course both for general interest as well as a good writing credit because I felt it it was an interesting way to engage with American history but still focus on intersectional issues involving women, poor people, and PoC.",
    "I would not recommend this class, which really should be renamed \"the crisis of american development\". I went to every lecture, which was like a dose of depression. If you are interested in the built environment from an objective view, you might get something out of class, but \" American Cultural Landscapes\" is a really misleading title. American developers have destroyed our communities, leaving citizens to pick up the pieces, but development is too permanent to easily fix the inherent problems of suburbia. I come from a rural community that is slowly being swallowed up into the conformity of development, so I am sensitive to the problems discussed. Detailing the cause and effect without even a hint about how to address the problems was irritating.",
    "I would recommend this class-- interesting survey course of american cultural landscapes.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes is a really engaging class with a manageable workload. I had no previous exposure to American Studies, but this course was still very accessible and I never felt at a disadvantage. The assignments hit early in the semester, but having the class wrapped up earlier makes finals week a lot easier. I found the essays to be really interesting, and I enjoyed writing them.",
    "Professor Hayden is very knowledgeable but she is quiet and her lectures are sometimes boring or scattered. However I really enjoyed writing the papers for this class, and I would recommend it if you're looking for a class with a manageable workload that gives you a comprehensive overview of this topic.",
    "We start the semester studying Native American Settlement and end with the present day. We analyze space and place for urban, suburban and rural landscapes. We study how culture affects development and vice versa.Yes, take this class. The reading is manageable, the material is interesting and relevant, and the assignments are actually worth your time.",
    "Great class if you're interested in post-automobile development of suburbia in America, especially sprawl, etc.",
    "Yes, absolutely. A great way to learn about why America looks the way it does.",
    "It's an interesting class, but the readings are somewhat boring. Pretty light workload-- ~100 pages\/week of reading, one short paper at the beginning, a final paper, and two hour exams (not cumulative). The final paper was due way back in November, which was a godsend come reading week.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a lot of reading, but all really interesting things - like reading about department stores in the early 1900s, the rise of AC in the South, what an \"edge node\" is, and the tension between the deteriorating downtown and suburban sprawl. Great class. Great lectures. Great readings. The class is a writing credit, but doesn't involve too much writing. You write one paper in the first two weeks about transportation in your hometown, and you write one term paper (about 20 pages) about anything you want. This class forces you to think critically about the landscapes that surround you and makes you appreciate cities, towns, strips along the highway and suburbia.",
    "This class discusses the formation of society. The main topics are architecture, transportation and cities. I would recommend this class, it is not a gut but it not difficult, it would definitely make a good fifth class.",
    "This class is an interdisciplinary look at the history of the American built environment, encompassing the role and implications of race, class, and gender on housing and living patterns within the country. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "If you like the history of suburbs and housing this is the class for you. That is really the best description of the class. I was pleased that a lot of the slides allowed me to explore an interest in architecture, but at the end of the day, testing is more of the historical, ID type. The lectures can be dry, but if you like the topics you will be more than satisfied. There is quite a lot of reading and deadlines are EXTREMELY early in comparison to other classes.",
    "Good, broad class on how suburbs became a thing, why cars have ruined the country to some extent, and the development of urban downtowns.",
    "Absolutely!!! You'll learn about how and why our country, and our culture, looks the way it does, and it's really quite fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this for anyone at Yale. Whatever your major, this class is totally interesting, and the material is really practically useful. Professor Hayden fills the lectures with all the kinds of things you will come to feel that more people should know about! It's also a great way to cover a writing credit because you get feedback on an initial short assignment, and your TA's read an entire draft of your final paper before turning it in, so there are ample opportunities to gauge your learning process as a writer. And you can choose just about any topic of interest to you.",
    "Definitely! I very much enjoyed the course. It was a very well put-together survey of the interaction between architecture, sociology, class, and culture over America's history. The class has really added a lot of texture and depth to the way in which I understand the built environments I encounter. Professor Hayden has very well constructed lectures and thoughts, though she occasionally teaches quite heavily from her books and articles which she assigns for reading. There was a fair amount of reading assigned, but it was mostly very interesting. There is a midterm and a final paper, but their far enough apart to not be overwhelming. I really enjoyed the class overall.",
    "A good class for discovering about the built environment's past in America. The TAs (or at least mine) grade things fairly tough though.",
    "Great course! Definitely take it, especially if you are interested in American history and visual culture.",
    "I LOVED this course. The lectures were very well done and interesting, and each week was interesting in a different way. The papers were a ton of fun to write if you pick topics that interest you, and the whole course is over before reading week, which is very helpful. On a practical and emotional level, this was a great course.",
    "Yes, i would.",
    "Yes, especially if you're interested in urban planning or architecture.",
    "I highly recommend this class to any student. The class is about suburban vs urban development in the United States, from 1820 onward. It focuses a lot on the relation between government policies and cultural\/societal values. It's a fun course with a moderate workload (easy if you start early). There are two one-hour tests (very easy though), a short first paper, and a final paper around 15 pages.",
    "I would recommend the course to students who are interested in the why and how of American development. If papers and a decent amount of reading per week soundunappealing, students should look elsewhere."
