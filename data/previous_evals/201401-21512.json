   "comments": [
    "I think Congress could be a really wonderful class if it focused less on theoretical frameworks for viewing congressional action and instead took a more practical approach and focused more on the contemporary issues in congress. The way it is, I wouldn't recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're potentially interested in political science. The work isn't too intensive and it serves as a good intro",
    "Take it if you need a political science credit for your major. If not, take it only if you enjoy re-learning about the things you already knew Congressmen did and thought.",
    "Very basic, very easy. Great gut class and well taught. The readings were OK--could have been better and less dense.",
    "Take the class if you are a Poli Sci major or you are very interested in Congress.",
    "Pretty easy and relaxed class. Recommend",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Congress and want to learn more about its workings.",
    "I would say that PLSC 209 is a really good course if you are interested in Congress, how it works, and why people's opinions on Congress are what they are. However, an introduction to the US Government course would be helpful before this.",
    "Yes if you want a class that isn't too challenging but during which you learn a great deal about an important topic in our society through the lens of contemporary issues.",
    "Easy class. Take it.",
    "This is a great class. Not too challenging, but you'll definitely learn a lot if you're interested in Congress. The readings really determine to what level you understand the material, so do them, and you'll learn immensely! The workload is not challenging at all, and Professor Powell has no designs to purposely make the class difficult. Also, Professor Powell is an engaging lecturer and does a fantastic job presenting the material. If Tom is TA-ing the class again next year, take your section with him, because he's amazing--knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and approachable!",
    "Boring, you learn basically nothing, and the midterm and final is just copying things out of the textbook, but it's graded harshly and you dont know what the graders are looking for in each answer.",
    "Solid intro to Congress, but I'd really only recommend it to Political Science majors who would need it for the major. Otherwise, there are better classes out there.",
    "To be honest, this is one of the few courses at Yale that I sort of regret taking. It wasn't a terrible class per se, but I didn't feel like I was getting a lot out of it. Part of that feeling may be my reaction to my first political science class; the vast majority of the readings were full of jargon that overcomplicated very intuitive concepts. While I understand the importance of statistical evidence and the need to treat some Congressional issues empirically, I don't think the research merits pedantic fetishization and memorization of the names of researchers who, for example, proved that politicians do things to get reelected (SURPRISE). On the exams, it seemed like namedropping was almost more important than understanding the concepts, in part because they're all so obvious. Lecture was rather dry and was based largely on the readings\/textbook (although Professor Powell is very friendly and knowledgeable). Honestly, you could probably learn the majority of the course content from a few wikipedia articles (or a book if you're ambitious) and use the credit for something more unique.",
    "Take this class, especially if you're interested in politics but don't much many details at all about the inner workings of Congress. Professor Powell is an incredible lecturer and will teach you so much about Congress if you go to class every time. The workload is completely manageable (you can skim the readings), and the tests are completely fair \u2013 just three essays for each, and it's essentially open book\/notes.",
    "U.S. Congress is a decent class. A lot of theories, some that are interesting, others not so much. Professor Powell is a good but not great lecturer. The workload seems like a lot even if it's not because the readings can be quite dry. If you can push through them, though, some theories are legitimately interesting and you'll come out with a better understanding of how Congress runs.",
    "Humongous gut. The assignments take 10-15 minutes and the tests are open book.",
    "This is a introductory political science class discussing the ins and outs of congress. I recommend this class to anyone interested in political science.",
    "Take it for basics - if you are looking for something more in depth, look elsewhere.",
    "Yes I would. How the Congress functions is important knowledge to have, and the class was well organized and fair.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It is boring and unfulfilling.",
    "Great overview of the entire US Congress system. Very informative, helpful to be familiar with current events but not necessary to do well in the class.",
    "Would recommend as a survey course, but expect dense readings and pretty toughly graded exams. It's not just a basic Congress 101 type of course, there is a lot of focus on theoretical models and research.",
    "Page of notes on test and textbook means you HAVE to take the class. Powell is very helpful and is one of the best poli sci lecturers around.",
    "If you've never read political science theory, this is a pretty good intro course to take for that. It's definitely a manageable fifth class, just take really good notes from lecture.",
    "PLSC 209 is a great introductory course on the American Congress \u2014 everything you could have ever wanted to know \u2014 and political science research relating to the topic. Take this course if you're interested in American government and looking for an opportunity to dig deeply into political science data and research.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about Congress and does not have much knowledge of the topic. I do not plan on using this class towards my major but I am glad that I took it because it is something that I wanted to understand as a voting citizen of the United States.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend! Professor Powell is such a great lecturer. I wasn't really interested in Poli Sci or Congress but I took this class because it had good reviews, and she was such a great lecturer that I really did become interested in the material. She makes it interesting and keeps the course topical by bringing up any new developments in Congress and tying it to actual campaigns and congressional activity happening now. Even if you think you're not interested in this topic, you could be surprised! The two legislative assignments are super easy and pretty interesting to track a single piece of legislation. You do need to do the readings, not to keep up in the lectures or sections really, but because they're important for the midterm and final and if you wait until the test comes to do them, it would be a ton of work. The midterm and final are open-book and you get a sheet of notes, so that's nice, but you do need to prepare and be somewhat familiar with the major topics beforehand. You don't really have time to use your books on the midterm (only 50 min) but they're very useful on the final when you do have time.",
    "You'll learn a lot from this class -- a lot of important stuff. At a place like Yale you need to be able to have an intelligent conversation about things like congress and american government. That being said, I wouldn't consider this an introductory level course. Before taking this class, I barely knew the difference between the Senate and the House (a bit of an exaggeration, but still). The people in this class were mostly poli sci majors\/those who were extremely passionate and knowledgeable about congress and government -- and this class was definitely geared towards this group."
