   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to other students since it covers fundamental authors and texts, and builds on these authors to provide a basis with which one can tackle modern political issues.",
    "The course examines issues of sovereignty and human rights under the emerging postnational constellation, in which state sovereignty is challenged by social, economic, and political globalization, including migration and the rise of global and transnational governance. The course considers historical, philosophical, sociological, and legal perspectives. Highly recommended. The material is highly timely, particularly the section on the European Union, and the opportunity to study these issues with Professor Benhabib is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend the course for a student who is interested in gaining a wide range of disciplinary perspectives on sovereigntyboth from the readings and from the students in the course, who come from a wide variety of methodological backgrounds."

    "I learned a great deal from the course, much of which will contribute directly to my research.",
    "Much of the material covered in the course is tangential to, but not strictly within, my subject area. Nevertheless, I found some ideas helpful for my own research.",
    "This course connected me with some relevant sources to which I was not previously aware. This helped me to broaden the base of my research, which was my precise hope. The class was perfect in this way."
