    "Overall, great survey course of Roman Art but extremely heavy on the memorizationabout 150 images per midterm (which, even for me as an art history major, was considerably difficult). No in-person section because of online discussion forum which can detract from learning and getting feedback from colleagues.",
    "A good class and strong overview of Roman art, but probably more in the \"take if you are interested in the subject\" category. I found it really interesting, but I can't speak for everybody. Expectations are very clear and there are tools available to help you memorize slides for the midterm and final.",
    "Great class, if only the lecture topics were a bit more interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class. Professor Kleiner is very passionate, but she is not a dynamic teacher. The first few lectures were great, but after that it becomes increasingly frustrating to go to class. We got out of class up to 10 minutes late each time, and Professor Kleiner never acknowledged this. We also fit many monuments into each session, which detracted from our overall understanding of themes and time periods. I certainly learned a lot form this class, but I would have learned more if we had sections (especially since the TFs are wonderful!) instead of the online forum. The forum was simply a chore and not an opportunity to learn from instructors or peers. If you take this class I recommend meeting with your TF and utilizing their knowledge and passion, as that was definitely the best part of this course.",
    "This class is a survey course of Roman art, from the Republican period through the emperor Constantine. Each 1hr 15 min lecture was structured around a monument list that Professor Kleiner compiled, although it was often too long to discuss all the works in depth. I would not recommend this class, especially to non-art history majors who are not looking to fulfill the ancient art requirement. It was not particularly engaging, and the online forum heavily detracted from the learning potential of the course. Professor Kleiner is clearly extremely knowledgable, accomplished, and passionate about the subject, but I feel that she did not translate this well into her lectures. The two midterms also required memorizing the names and dates of over 170 works each, which was not only very difficult, but felt unnecessary given that we barely discussed some of the objects in lecture. We also got out of class late every single day, so I would not recommend scheduling another course immediately afterward.",
    "Wonderful - lots of memorization, but it's not too difficult if you work at it a little every week. Clear expectations, and the works you study are beautiful and fascinating.",
    "good intro to Roman art history. take the class if youre interested in the subject. Make sure to study well before the exams because you'll have to memorize about 150 pieces of art per exam, including dates, locations, and trends.",
    "This course is wonderful for anyone who has the slightest interest in classical art. The 9am start was initially difficult, but after several classes, I was engaged from start to finish. In order to do well in the class, you need to be able to memorize a significant amount of pieces for each midterm (over 100), but there is a greater focus on the discussion of the works, and not hard facts on them. Professor Kleiner is a wonderful lecturer and a knowledgable individual. Her lectures are always polished and humorous. The only issue was that the discussion section was done online, however, there was a lot of discussion in the lecture as well, for those who were willing to contribute, more along the lines of a large seminar. I wouldn't recommend another class immediately afterwards as the class tended to run a bit late in ending.",
    "If you are interested in Roman art or roman history, consider taking this course. However, it is unlike other typical art history courses - a lot of rote memorization is required and instead of in person sections, there is an online forum that everyone must post on once a week. There are two midterms and one project - try the design your own monument project...very creative and interesting.",
    "An excellent class! Definitely take this one if you get the chance. Prof Kleiner is very organized and will give you everything you need to get an A. Plus, there's no final exam and the material is so relevant to anyone studying the classics, history of art, or just hoping to go to Europe, or any museum for that matter.",
    "I would still recommend the class - despite its annoying forum post requirements and the lectures running overtime. Once you get those out of the way, the class is really engaging and deals with a lot of really interesting aspects of Roman history and culture. I would recommend it as a fun history course rather than as an angle into art history though. The professor is an expert and is open to a lot of creative new ideas for the way a course can work. The exams are not easy, but if you're willing and able to memorize, it's worth it.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Difficult course but well worth the work. Kleiner is a wonderful and understanding professor. Definitely take a course with her. Consider starting this course Credit\/D and switching to a letter grade if you do well on the first midterm. Prepare to study a lot for the midterms - it'll come back to bite you if you don't. Even though it's a lot of work, it's a rewarding class and I would take it again in a heartbeat. Familiarize yourself with the web portal early on. It's crucial to the course and to staying caught up. Lectures are mandatory though it's okay if you miss a few. Recommend taking this course with a friend or two. And reach out to the TA's for help on the term paper early on!"
