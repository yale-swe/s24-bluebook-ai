   "comments": [
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class to anyone with even a passing interest in analytic philosophy. In my opinion, this course can serve as either (i) a good introduction to analytic philosophy (i.e. for freshmen and sophomores) or (ii) a good class to supplement other courses in analytic philosophy. I took Zoltan's philosophy of language class the previous semester and Stanley's class was a great complement: Zoltan was very focused on specific papers in the philosophy of language, while Stanley did a good job of giving a broad narrative for analytic philosophy since Frege.",
    "Maybe wait till you've taken some other philosophy classes first. Don't go into this as a first class in philosophy!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While challenging, it covers a huge amount of ground in analytic philosophy; upon finishing, one understands both the philosphy of Frege and many of the responses to his philosophy. This course, however, would be best suited for a philosophy major or anyone interested in philosophy: it would be quite difficult to get through if one does not enjoy philosophy.",
    "A strong course on a topic of great personal interest to Professor Stanley. Professor Stanley - though incredibly disorganized - is an excellent lecturer who encourages participation and takes student inquires and interests seriously. The topics emphasized were directed by student and prof interests. In my opinion (others might differ), class basically works without a syllabus (and Stanley never wrote one). Lectures were topical and were not constrained to arbitrary progression. The few minor assignments were surprisingly simple. This isn't a class to dabble in logic or philosophy of math, but if you're interested in the links between logic and mathematics (and not to mention natural language -- the class had a substantial philosophy of language component), there's probably no one better than Stanley to teach you.",
    "If you are interested in analytic philosophy, I would take this class. It brings together a lot of the material you will have learned in other philosophy classes (meta theory, logic, semantics etc) through Frege which is really neat.",
    "I loved this class. Granted, I was greatly intimidated at first (who wouldn't be, after first seeing Frege's notation?). However, this class evolves very quickly and soon enters all parts of philosophy and, more importantly, all parts of your life. This semester, the first class of the course was excellent--it was well structured, covered all the foundations, and went at a steady pace. The second half accelerated a lot (especially when talking about semantics), but also became infinitely more interesting. You'll likely finish by reading through parts of Frege's Basic Laws of Arithmetic, which looks like random gibberish at first. But by the end of it all, you'll find meaning and ingenuity in Frege's writings."
