    "Recommend",
    "Yes, if you want an interesting and relatively easy history course. I really enjoyed it.",
    "Interesting regardless of whether you've already had euro history, although the more modern history in the second half of the course was significantly more interesting, at least for me. Merriman is a really interesting lecturer and incredibly knowledgeable.",
    "If you need a class that you really can go at on your own pace, this was pretty easy. Also, if you have any desire on learning European history in an inch-deep-mile-wide manner, I'd recommend this.",
    "Good class. A nice coverage of European history without the specificity of a seminar.",
    "As a senior non-history major, I sat in on the first lecture on a whim but was instantly hooked. The benefit of this survey course is that it provides a fairly comprehensive view of nothing less than the history of modern European civilization, and with Professor Merriman, there is also a level of nuanced historical analysis that would ordinarily be reserved for more focused history seminars. Furthermore, he presents history in a refreshingly unpretentious manner, made all the better by his deadpan sense of humor.My only regret with this course is that I did not discover it sooner; had I done so, I may well have decided to become a history major. But I truly grateful to have had the opportunity to take it before graduating and would wholeheartedly recommend it to future students, regardless of their level of interest in European history.",
    "Interesting class. Professor Merriman is funny and complements the readings. That being said, you'll be doing most of the learning through the book.",
    "Take it if you want a relatively easy and interesting history lecture.",
    "I would recommend taking this",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to have a better understanding of European history and feels that s\/he does not currently have much of an understanding at all. If you already do have an understanding (e.g. you took AP European History in high school), you might get bored occasionally, although there is still plenty to be learned from the class. That is where I was, and the course certainly benefited me immensely!",
    "If interested in history I would definitely recommend this course. The workload was manageable and the class enjoyable.",
    "Don't take it. It's too broad and lectures can be very boring. I would recommend another history course with a narrower focus.",
    "Really good survey of this 300 year period of european history. Really important period to understand why Europe is the way it is today. Obviously there is a focus on the large powers at the expense of the smaller ones, but that is to be expected. I would definitely recommend it. The paper isn't too hard, you can write about whatever you want. The midterm and final were manageable, you just have to do ALL the reading and watch ALL the movies (especially for the final)",
    "I would definitely recommend someone to take this class.",
    "Yes! I took this class having not taken any European history in high school, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The work load it not unreasonable and the lectures are inspiring. Take it!",
    "I'd never taken European History of any sort (neither regular nor AP) before this, so it was very nice to finally put understanding to so many terms \/ people \/ concepts that I'd heard of many times before, but never actually new about. 300 years is a lot of ground to cover in one semester, though, so unless you're prepared to do a lot of reading \/ prepare for exams that cover all of it, I suggest you maybe consider taking this course Credit \/ D. It's definitely worth taking, though. Merriman AND the TAs are awesome.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in European History and don't need a strict structure to enjoy a class.",
    "Definitely recommend if you want a broad grasp o European history.",
    "Take it if you want a survey of European history. It's very straightforward."
