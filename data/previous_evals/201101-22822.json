But this is balanced by the fact that Professor Stepto is an incredible lecturer, who is intimately familiar with the subject.",
    "A superb class with a diverse, wide-ranging reading list (with a very reasonable one-book-per-week pace). Prof. Stepto is fantastic \u0097 an excellent discussion leader and a very nice guy.",
