    "I would definitely recommend it-I feel like I have learned so much and really could listen to someone speaking spanish and understand. It is hard having it everyday, but that is part of why you learn so much!",
    "Standard L3 class. Recommend for those who want to improve their spanish. Definitely take with Barbara Safille! She's a great professor.",
    "Out of class work focuses on grammatical concepts that are expected to be utilized during in-class discussion. I would recommend Spanish 130 to any student looking to improve both their written and conversational spanish.",
    "SPAN 130 focuses on maximizing one's skills in Spanish grammar. It employs new, mature vocabulary. It often utilizes very strange stories to incorporate said vocabulary. Take this class if you are on the Spanish track. If not, I think it merely depends on your initial love for the language. It utilizes an online textbook that can often be a pain."
