   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about so many things by taking this course - socially responsible investing, biomimicry, sustainability consulting, systems thinking. I thought the books for this class were incredibly interesting, pertinent, and well-chosen.",
    "I got a wonderful introduction into the different types of value investing as well as a great understanding of systems thinking and the influence of innovative products.",
    "I came into the class with very little knowledge about innovation and sustainability, and specifically about the field of socially responsible investing. By the end of the course, I can say that I understand these topics very well and am much more curious to study them further. The course even provoked me to apply for Yale's Energy Studies program.",
    "I came away with a much better sense of how to step back and face large problems in order to solve them. I had the opportunity to do some really cool research that has given me a lot of confidence in my ability to think outside the box and solve real world problems.",
    "Learned about the ESG factors that could help make the world more sustainable. The goals and guidelines that are set globally to mitigate the effects of our presence on Earth can be sought out by disruptive innovation.",
    "Great interdisciplinary course on building a business case for innovation and sustainability. Discussions and guest speakers were very enlightening and challenged me to think about ways to more widely integrated sustainability in business and finance.",
    "From this course I learned about different kinds of sustainable investing\/ investing with an impact\/socially responsible investing. We heard from a number of guest speakers at companies that pride themselves on sustainable practices and concern for their environmental footprint and social and governance practices. It was very illuminating to hear how they factor these considerations into their decision making. I also learned how to apply a concept called \"systems thinking\" to various ideas and business strategies. Additionally, via the innovation component, I learned how a company could use fewer resources or use resources differently to be more efficient, save money, or reduce its footprint.",
    "I learned about sustainable investment strategies, systems thinking, and corporate strategies that benefit both company profits and the environment simultaneously.",
    "How financial stability and sustainable development are intrinsically tied to systems thinking",
    "The subject of the course is very interesting and is going to become more prevalent in the future. Learning about what's going on the field let's you know what's out there other than traditional finance and buy side options.",
    "I think I learned a lot more about where innovation for a sustainable future is going to have to come from, and what ideas are necessary to get us there. I was also able to focus deeply on topics of personal interest and I learned a lot from those explorations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this was a very strong course that exposed to a myriad of topics that other classes have not. Also really enjoyed the guest visitors. I loved the exposure to a discussion of systems thinking.",
    "The whole class was essentially subject to change, which was a little stressful, but worth it in the end due to the great speakers we got. Being more explicit about the structure of the in class essays would also be a great improvement. Even though the point is that they don't really have a structure, it can be whatever we want whether that be stream of consciousness or analytical, it could help to state out loud that those are options. This course is particularly strong in introducing new concepts while allowing the students to really dig deep into a topic of their choosing. The final project definitely pushed me to explore something I had never done or studied before.",
    "The course is very interesting and the professors care about the students a lot. In addition, the diverse speakers we had were very insightful and allowed me to really learn what it means to have a career related to innovation and sustainability. The course could be improved by incorporating more in-class discussion; I felt like the first few week included a lot of lecture-style classes, but this did improve as the course went along.",
    "I think the actual class sessions could have been a bit more engaging, though I think a lot of the material was over the heads of some of the students in the room. It might be a good idea to assign a few short explanatory readings before each class so that the students in the room can be better prepared to discuss and engage with the material in class.",
    "Great course all around!",
    "This course is exceptionally rewarding in that it allows students to pursue a topic or topics of research that interest them. Each student is able to write two papers on a real-world business practice or strategy or an idea. The professors are both very knowledgable and have interesting and relevant backgrounds that made each class session fascinating. The selection of guest speakers was also great.",
    "This course was excellent at demonstrating how economic and environmental solutions are not mutually exclusive and often can be designed to benefit each other.",
    "the course provides a very realistic picture of the current scenario in the corporate sector, in terms of its focus on sustainable development. visits by members of these corporations provide first-hand details of the inner workings of companies. the course uses a lot of technical financial jargon, so it might help to assign a beginners book to provide the necessary background that some students might not have",
    "Access to interesting speakers from companies doing innovative things, which is always awesome.",
    "The course is very driven by student interest, which is great. And there were also amazing guest speakers that made for great learning experiences. Also, the feedback on papers was excellent and very detailed, helped me better explore my interests. I would say the one weakness is that there wasn't enough student discussion. There was a lot of room for student speaking, but most of the time it was directed at the class leader (professor or guest speaker), instead of the other students."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if it is offered again. Cary and Howard were great, the readings are incredibly interesting, and I think that it was a really valuable learning experience.",
    "This class is terrific if you get excited about new and innovative things and also like thinking about environmental systems applied to business. At first, I felt like every other student knew way more than me and I was in over my head. What's important to remember is that everyone contributes immensely to the seminar because the diversity of backgrounds and interests leads to great discoveries. The professors are also wonderful and great people to get to know if you can. I really would recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in the environment or business\/investing. I hope this class is offered again so that more people can benefit from it.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students, even if they don't think they are interested in the topics of innovation and sustainability, because the course teaches you how much these topics pervade our everyday life. In our modern world, innovation and sustainability are such important topics that everyone should be educated about, and this course is a great place to learn about them.",
    "Cary and Howard are great guys, I highly recommend taking classes with them. You'll be opened up to a lot of new ideas and information that'll help you start thinking in a new way.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in learning about sustainability and systems thinking. Class assignments provide great opportunities for students to deeply explore a topic of their choice. Quizzes help students to digest and reflect upon class material. The professors are excellent, extremely knowledgeable, and really generous with their time. Overall, this class provided students with a really valuable learning experience.",
    "I came into this class with a slight interest but not much previous knowledge. This class definitely helped me understand the problems the Earth faces and how to be more aware of what's going on. If there is any interest at all in the subject, my recommendation would be to take it.",
    "Absolutely, great class that's eye-opening and interesting! Made me think about ways to apply knowledge in real life to effect positive change in ways no other class has ever done.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professors were excellent and very knowledgeable, so of course, if they teach the course again I would highly recommend another student to take this seminar. The seminar allows students to pursue topics of research, with a pretty substantial degree of flexibility, that interest them. You will learn a lot about investment practices and business strategies, needs for green finance, changes that are needed for a more sustainable financial system and global economy, and innovative new thinking and practices in resource use for product design and business operation. I personally believe that all of the above are very important topics with which to engage, especially in an academic setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It provides a great perspective on the future of innovation with relation to investment and corporate strategy that is applicable to all students interested in working in a field relating to sustainability in the future.",
    "definitely! the course studies the intersection of the newly-developing concept of sustainability alongside what is important to most, if not all, i.e. financial stability",
    "The professors do a good job of setting up the framework and letting you explore any topics you're passionate about or interested in for your final paper.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student interested in private sector solutions to any social problem, though this class did have a particular focus on climate and the environment and energy."
