    "This class allowed me to understand aspects of social theory relevant to cultural sociology and to use this theory to understand current and past cultural phenomena. It made me question the social structures and cultural constructions that I had taken at face value in the past, and also be more critical of things that I considered purely factual.",
    "This was a fascinating course on the historical and theoretical movements in cultural sociology. Cultural sociology exists at the intersection of humanities and the social science. The term itself is difficult to define in a sentence, but one of its key elements is a humanities-style investigation into social events (I think of it as a close reading of political\/historical events). This course definitely changes the way that you perceive and interpret events, and reshapes the way that you engage with journalism and other media. After taking this class, I feel more aware of the different narratives that surround social events."

   "comments": [
    "Lecture was really interesting and there wasn't a ton of work aside from reading and the final paper. I always left class feeling that I had learned something or was now able to analyze aspects of my life in a different way. The course material was hard to understand initially, however, and I think I would have benefited from having a clearer understanding of the field as a a whole before diving into primary literature.",
    "The content is organized chronologically, but there is a lot of going back and forth in terms of ideas and arguments. It's a little difficult to keep track of all the sociological terms, especially at the beginning. I think that it's more accessible for people with a background in sociology already, but everyone will be able to get something out of the class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I found the material very interesting and applicable to other disciplines and everyday life.",
    "Yes! Professor Alexander is one of the leaders in the field of cultural sociology, and it's worth it for the experience of asking him questions and hearing his thoughts on contemporary events. If you like the humanities and want to try out a sociology course, I highly recommend this one. A lot of what you learn in humanities classes will be transferrable."
