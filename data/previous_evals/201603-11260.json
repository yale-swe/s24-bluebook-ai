   "comments": [
    "I have learnt how to analyze complex functions.",
    "Complex numbers are really useful. You can prove many surprising things about common functions and use them to evaluate difficult integrals, find roots, etc.",
    "I learned a lot!! This was a really exceptionally good class where I felt I learned a lot of complex analysis, but also gained a lot of insight into the mathematical thinking required for other courses and for research. Professor Oh is really good at communicating her excitement and logic to the class!",
    "A thorough understanding of complex analysis.",
    "While not the most difficult mathematics class I have taken, this was easily the most sophisticated. The class did much less handholding than the other classes of similar level I have taken. This was a good experience in learning independently, and hopefully a good bridge to higher level math classes.",
    "This is a standard introduction to basic methods of complex analysis; I learned a lot of the mechanics of contour integration and the properties of holomorphic functions.",
    "New ways to solve old things!! Complex analysis is pretty cool and very useful.",
    "Useful integration techniques; nice complex analysis theorems; very elegant analysis of holomorphic functions in complex planes etc.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses I've taken. I think I got significantly better at analysis, I learned how to do all kinds of crazy integrals, and I gained a real appreciation for higher level math. Prof. Oh is kind, patient, and an incredible teacher. She should be treasured by the Yale math department.",
    "Complex is a beautiful subject, and you learn a lot about the techniques of proofs. Everyone should know the material.",
    "I learned analysis techniques, contour integrals, cauchy integral formula and applications. Good introduction to the fundamentals of complex analysis",
    "None beyond the basic course material.",
    "I learned how to approach new problems I didn't know the answer to, and developed new mathematical intuition in an area I was not very confident in to start with.",
    "I learned various tools of complex analysis, such as complex integration and differentiation, the Cauchy Integral Formula, and the residue theorem. It was quite interesting to see the generalizations of familiar calculus to the complex numbers and it's really neat how the math works out so nicely.",
    "I learnt a little more about complex analysis, and how to use it to evaluate integrals that cannot be evaluated using only elementary calculus.",
    "I gained practice applying various theorems of complex analysis, especially the residue theorem.",
    "New methods of integration.",
    "In this course, I gained a very solid grasp of fundamentals of Complex Analysis. Also from watching professor Oh reason through problems in class, I think I learned how to approach a problem with diligence and creativity to better reach a solution.",
    "I practiced a lot of contour integration and proof writing.",
    "I felt like I learned a lot about complex!",
    "I learned basic contour integration, homotopies, Cauchy\/Residue theorems and corollaries, and a little about the prime number theorem.",
    "This course taught me a lot about complex analysis. I felt like I developed similar skills as my previous math courses, but on a new subject matter."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "At the beginning, the class was too fast. But overall the pace is Okay.",
    "The class was very proof based but often the homework and tests were purely computational. It would have been more in keeping with the tone of lectures if the assessed work had more of a proof element (even if that meant take home midterms and finals)",
    "The problem sets and exams were totally manageable. Lectures were well motivated and entertaining. No weaknesses.",
    "The course was really good!! Perhaps the only weakness (if it is one) is that the first problem set was VERY difficult (that one question about l_p metric spaces) and I know that scared a few people into dropping the course who I think could have thrived and enjoyed it had they stuck it out. But really, I went in not thinking I liked analysis at all and came out feeling very excited by the thought of taking more classes in the area! Hee Oh's teaching is definitely the biggest strength of the course. The peer tutor, Luke Peilen, was also fantastic!",
    "Great class",
    "This class has a relatively small core of material to cover. Towards the end of the course, it somewhat lost focus. It seems that more theoretical material would be a more interesting focus than the Zeta function for the last few weeks -- topics like the infinite factorization theorem, or more exploration of the Riemann sphere.",
    "This course is very good as far as it goes, but I suspect could benefit from being split into \"Complex analysis for applications\" and \"complex analysis for mathematicians\" sections. (Along the lines of MATH 222 and MATH 225.) In particular, we had to cover much of the material of MATH 300\/301 in class, when a number of the students had already taken similar courses.",
    "More examples maybe? Overall it was taught very well!!!!",
    "It is a very well taught introductory course on complex analysis, and professor Oh is a very good lecturer.",
    "I wish we had spent less time evaluating indefinite integrals. It's cool that we can evaluate integrals using complex analysis that are hopeless with elementary techniques, but still.",
    "Strengths: Complex Analysis is a beautiful subject. Hee Oh's lecture is very structured and clear. Weakness: The lecture is not always the most engaging.",
    "The course was excellent. Would not change a lot. The final was incredibly hard though, and I'm kind of in the twilight zone right now hoping it ended up being curved a lot :\/",
    "Lectures are very fast and geared towards only the smartest in the class. Other students get left behind and have to work very hard to catch up.",
    "The strengths is the content, and that Hee Oh really knows her stuff and how to communicate it to the students. As a physics major, I didn't enjoy spending the last part on the prime number theorem, but that may note be viewed as a bad part of the course by a math major, perhaps. One major weakness: this course needs a TA. It is TOUGH without a TA.",
    "It would be helpful to be told the pages in the textbooks that correspond to the lectures.",
    "The material was presented at a reasonable pace, and the homework was graded fairly. Hee Oh has a charismatic style and is a good professor. More support before exams could be given to improve the course.",
    "The course material was very interesting, but it seems like we didn't actually cover that much; we only went through a few chapters in the textbook, and the last couple weeks of class were devoted to one application that, although interesting, didn't add a lot for my understanding of the material. I would also have appreciated more resources during the class; homework and midterm solutions were never posted online, and as a result it felt hard to study for the midterms and final since there wasn't a lot to study off of.",
    "The content is interesting, useful, and relates well to other fields of mathematics. However, there could have been better materials to facilitate learning (more practice problems, solutions to homework and exams, etc).",
    "I wish the course had covered things like power series manipulations more, since, though residues were introduced, few tools were given to actually calculate them for non-simple poles. I liked that we did proved the prime number theorem at the end of the course. It would be nice if some of the smaller pieces of that proof had been left to students, for instance on problem sets, which is a technique I've had other instructors use and which I enjoy. I thought too much time was spent on simple matters of arithmetic on the complex numbers.",
    "Very interesting material.",
    "The biggest strength of the course was the pace. In my experience most math classes go at too quick a pace for the students to really grasp all of what they are learning, but in this course the material came at a slower pace, with a number of examples per theorem to reinforce the knowledge learned. There were no real weakness is the course. Perhaps the course could use a few more difficult homework problems such as the problem about the \"l-squared\" metric space though to keep the stronger students more experienced students engaged. The class has a range of students from Sophmores to Seniors, as someone who went through many proof based math courses already, I did not find the homework problems for this course challenging, and as a result the course often floated to the back of my priorities.",
    "It was very fair and challenging. Final exam was very long though.",
    "I thought that the quality of teaching was very high and specific to the teacher.",
    "Strengths: Lots of contour integration. Weaknesses: Poorly taught, moves slowly, tests not reflective of ability.",
    "This course had a very interesting subject matter and some absolutely beautiful proofs. I felt engaged in almost every lecture. One of the problems I would say is the lack of organization of the concepts. Some things that we learned felt out of place or didn't exactly fit together.",
    "maybe more time on application of integration?"

   "comments": [
    "A very interesting course for introduction of complex analysis. Take it if you are Math major.",
    "Highly recommend. The material is not difficult and there are many unexpectedly strong results (e.g. differentiable + bounded => constant function). Complex analysis is useful for finding roots, integrating difficult real integrals, and getting a broader perspective on functions. Exams and problem sets were manageable; Hee Oh is nice and lectures are interesting.",
    "Yes! Especially if Hee Oh is teaching it, complex analysis is a fantastic course that teaches you a lot about an awesome subject. Especially, Hee Oh teaches in a way that gives you a lot of mathematical insight into things beyond the class as well. It was awesome and well worth the work, though it was very difficult!",
    "Yes. Hee Oh is great.",
    "Take any class Hee Oh offers.",
    "Yes, it's very useful and probably required for your major.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course: the material is very interesting and inspiring, and professor Oh is a great lecturer.",
    "We had a new professor this year and she was fantastic! Not the best math professor you will ever have in your life, but she certainly was able to illuminate many of the very interesting topics present in Complex Analysis, which is an immensely fascinating topic. If you ever want to learn how to evaluate real integrals that seem impossible take this class!",
    "I liked this class a lot, Professor Oh moved quickly, but that allowed us to cover more material.",
    "Yes! Complex Analysis is elegant and beautiful. Hee Oh's exams are fair but not easy.",
    "Absolutely. Definitely take this course, maybe start it Cr\/D\/F if you're unsure. Especially take this course if Hee Oh is teaching again - she is incredible.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a good intro to Complex Analysis. I took it without any analysis background (I took 120, 225, 235, 246) and I admit it was really hard, but doable. You have to love math to get through this course though.",
    "I would recommend learning the material but not taking the course. This has been my feeling about most math (and other STEM) courses that I've taken here. I don't think that I achieved anything by taking this course that I would not have by reading a textbook. There was little to no feedback on the work, and the graders made mistakes more often than they gave helpful feedback. The only reason I went to lectures was that no syllabus was provided, so it was difficult to know what we were doing in class even though it was almost all coming straight from one of our textbooks.",
    "If you're looking for a course with challenging applications of complex analysis, that's what you'll get. The course is hard but stretches you to approach problems in many different ways.",
    "I would recommend this class to all math majors, but maybe not to non-math majors. The material is interesting and important for those who will continue studying math, but the course is difficult conceptually and takes a fair amount of work, so I'm not sure if it's worth it just as a math class \"for fun\".",
    "Yes. Complex analysis is an interesting and beautiful field, and anyone interested in mathematics would do well to be acquainted with it.",
    "Yes, but it's a lot of work.",
    "I recommend talking this course to any Math major. In my opinion Complex Analysis is the most intuitive, interesting and easy understand of the three core math topics (Abstract Algebra, Complex Analysis and Real Analysis). The workload is lower than a Abstract Algebra and Real Analysis. Professor Oh is truly an inspiring lecturer especially when her personality shines through as she goes off topic to talk about the Mathematician world, her research, or the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function.",
    "Yes, this course is basically required for the math major. It is a good course.",
    "If you're interested in math then it is almost necessary, but I felt like it was a phenomenal class anyways.",
    "No. I felt that the class was capriciously graded and unsupported. I needed the content, but I am sorry that I ever had to take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course but caution that it gives a lot of work. Prof. Oh is very helpful and brilliant, but she teaches a little too quickly sometimes.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with a strong interest in mathematics.",
    "TAKE IT. It's a good intro to complex analysis. By the end you'll be able to calculate some nifty integrals, both complex- and real-valued. The workload consists of weekly psets of average difficulty (not too hard, but not plain either), plus two midterms and one final exam. Beware the final is worth 50%. However, most of the class got A's and A-'s, and the midterms and final were graded very generously.",
    "it's a pretty standard course. Complex analysis is a cool topic. The book was very helpful in this case. Pset graders, at least this year, were not helpful"
