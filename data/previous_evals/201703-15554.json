    "Very time-consuming",
    "In relation to the activities we did in this course, how to organize presentations was the most helpful to me. I have used those rules and skills in my presentations in Graduate School. On the other hand, I think we might spend less time on class to practice rhythm of the sentence. It could be difficult to change the long-term developed habit of speaking English sentences in such a short time. It might be more effective to teach the rules in class and ask us practice by ourselves. By this way, we may have more time in class to learn other things.",
    "Strengths: everyone has a chance to practice English. Weaknesses: too many students in one class result in low efficiency."
