   "comments": [
    "Great way to gain some practical musical skills, make some friends, and have a great time! Low-stress. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student for sure. It is a great and pretty easy way to become a better musician.",
    "I really enjoyed 218. In hindsight, I wish that I had taken it concurrently with 210, instead of not taking a theory class at the same time, but ahh well. It's mad chill.",
    "If you sometimes hear melodies in your head but can't figure out what they are to write them down, this is a good class for you. Also, the more time you spend on this class, the more you'll learn from it. I got by basically without ever practicing, but I wish I'd had time to practice more because I would have improved my ear a lot more.",
    "Musicianship is a fun and not too difficult introduction to dictations and sight-singing (although the focus is definitely on dictations). No need to take it with music theory, as long as you have the basics down.",
    "I would recommend it - it's lots of fun, you get to learn interesting and musically important skills, and it's a great 5th (whatever, 4th and a half) class. Grades aren't a problem, and if you have a chill TA (Loren was amazing!) it's a great experience."
