    "Wow. This class is unlike anything I've ever taken at Yale. It's seriously flipped my world upside down - Paul's ideas are applicable to literally everything in the world; he really teaches you a whole new way of thinking. I talk about those ideas to everyone, and I think about them constantly. The class is centered around really huge, semester-long projects. Some people worked with governors, some with the IPCC, some with the UNFCCC, some with Wall Street Journal and Fenton Communications, etc. The connections Paul has are ridiculous and I am so honored to have been given this opportunity. That said, the class was also really stressful and disorganized. We didn't follow the syllabus a single week, and extra assignments were often given a day or two before the deadline with very little instruction. Paul really plays favorites, and sometimes it feels like you spend hours upon hours on the projects and someone else gets credit for your work (whichever group member he likes best). Nevertheless, I think this material is something EVERYONE should know and use. It's really kind of a psych class - how do we communicate climate change in a way that is relevant and digestible to people? You'll leave this class really inspired and energized. I almost didn't take it because I was afraid of the heavy heavy workload and was turned off by the disorganization, but that would have been the worst decision. What you get out of this class is SO WORTH the extra time and effort and confusion. If you're unsure, at least shop it - even one lecture with Paul will change your life.",
    "Whirlwind of information you will not always agree with and not always have the chance to speak out against. Still one of the most useful classes for ANYONE interested in working in ANY aspect of the environmental movement (science, advocacy, policy, etc). Strongly encourage science majors to take it. Lot's of fanfare about the projects which end up being super stressful and frustrating at times but they do open the door to cool opportunities, too.",
    "Take this class. Paul Lussier is brilliant. He will inspire you to think much more deeply about the narratives we use to talk about climate change, and will challenge you to try to figure out the best way forward. This is one of the most important classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class because it's an incredible way to learn new and effective methods for communication (and not just climate communication). But I must warn that Paul is disorganized and the class can be stressful simply because of the fact that you don't know what the expectations are of you \/ what your assignments are. It's a balance, but overall worth it to learn about this new communications framework.",
    "This is a fantastic course! It is the most unique and the most important course that I took at Yale. It provided the opportunity for us to work with an industry expert (Paul) on the application of theory in class to real world projects that will actually make a difference. No other class does this, and it worked phenomenally. The communication theory was revolutionary, and the projects will hopefully enact real change. Paul is also fantastically helpful and approachable and a great communicator. Please bring it back!",
    "INCREDIBLE course. Definitely recommend taking the first half of the series in the fall. The theory you learn in the fall is pretty necessary to make the most of this class. Paul is charismatic, caring, and absurdly intelligent. The project opportunities with real outside organizations like the NRDC, the UNFCC, IPCC, Fenton Communications, Edelman Advertising, etc. are unparalleled. Choose wisely, though. Not all project stakeholders are created equal, and some are pretty unresponsive. Overall, a must for anyone interested in environmental issues. The communication strategies and principles you learn in the fall course and exercise in the spring are applicable way outside just climate.",
    "Important subject. Somewhat all over the place approach at times, but you will learn a lot. Absolutely worth taking if you don't have much background in climate communications and are interested in the field (and you should be interested.)",
    "A really unique opportunity to tackle a vital issue in the world! You'll receive amazing support and a chance to pick up on the vibrance of Paul's commitment to his cause. Climate change is something everyone should know more about, so I'd recommend this class to any Yale student. You'll definitely pick up a lot of new perspectives and find yourself bringing it up to your friends outside of class all the time.",
    "This is a great course that helps students look at climate change and environmentalism from a different perspective. It's a new way of thinking about a global problem and I think it is essential for anyone interested in the topic.",
    "A in-depth analysis on theories of communicating climate change in context of a variey of different audiences beyond science.",
    "Not a traditional class. You use what you learn immediately through a project that you work on throughout the semester. Some people love this, others do not. I did!",
    "This course has provided immense insight into my understanding of how we should approach climate communications. We normally think that science and facts have all the answers to making people see that climate change is a problem. However, that is not so. There is so much more to uncover when trying to communicate to people that climate change is an urgent and important issue to tackle today. This class really opens that door and gives students an opportunity to apply the knowledge from the class to their own projects.",
    "Yes- this class will give you the theoretical foundation to engage climate change communications",
    "This was a highly unusual course compared to the others I have taken here at Yale, but I thought it was fantastic. Paul Lussier has some pretty breakthrough ideas, and lectures were incredibly interesting, but the more exciting opportunity came from the opportunity to apply knowledge through projects with outside stakeholders. This applied learning was highly rewarding because it required the real understanding of the communication theories and practices while creating real concrete change. I highly recommend others to take this course.",
    "Absolutely take it. The most transformative, thrilling, and important course I took at Yale. Totally re-energize me towards climate work, and reshaped how I think about it. These are the most important, exciting, and original ideas I was exposed to at Yale. Paul is amazing, and you will really get to know him. Be warned that the class is a wild ride, and mildly dis-organized. But it's 200% worth it. The class is truly on the cutting edge of how to effectively communicate climate, and you'll get to apply your ideas to very real projects (for the likes of the NRDC and IPCC). TLDR: TAKE IT"
