I also learned about important technological innovations like the Blockchain, Bitcoin and Crowdfunding.",

   "comments": [
    "too much credit for participation while assignments are not given proper credit",
    "strengths- broad-based, covered a lot of material weaknesses- classes could have been more structured",
    "I really enjoyed our homework assignments. I got to read and listen to incredibly interesting people and positions in a variety of important areas of global finance. I enjoyed the class discussions a lot and hope that they can be slightly more interactive in the future.",
    "The strength of the course was the assigned material and interviews, which were very interesting and mind expanding. The weakness was perhaps in the structure of the class discussion. The assignments provoked deeper understanding, and I thoroughly enjoyed thinking about points made by Professor Garten in his lectures. However, the design of class discussion seemed less effective. Students seemed to have incentive to speak before thinking, based on pressure for the participation requirement and the size of the class. Discussion points tended (not always) to resemble the form of \"what are your thoughts on ___.\" It seemed that students had more incentive to say anything than to take time to form though-provoking responses, as waiting to do so meant you were less likely to be called on. However, this might be unavoidable in larger SOM classes."
