    "This is a class that focuses on the materiality of objects in the world. It is a great way to bridge anthropological and archaeological theory and think about them at the same time- which a lot of classes do not have you do. I would recommend this class if you are either an archaeology or anthropology major looking to get some new perspective while having interesting discussions. Also if you are interested in material culture and how you can express what it represents."
