   "comments": [
    "I attained a solid understanding of advanced Russian grammar, improved my reading and writing skills, and gained further knowledge of and appreciation for 19th century Russian history.",
    "This class greatly increased my comprehension and confidence speaking Russian.",
    "Your speaking skills will be engaged a LOT more than in previous levels because a lot of the classes are dedicated to discussing the readings from the textbook. There are 2 exams, one at the end of each Unit (There are 2 units total: participles and gerunds, and numerals. These units are designed to get you into the range of crossing over into fluency. You will not be anywhere near fluent after this class, but it helps tremendously with useful turns of phrase. You certainly will have many of the tools available to have complex-ish conversations on certain topics, and will have some of the fundamentals of grammar down. You'll mostly just find yourself needing more vocabulary, as there are so many words.",
    "I got a lot better at Russian and gained the ability to talk about politics\/history at a pretty advanced level.",
    "I am so happy that Professor Muravnik's class was my introduction to the language in a classroom context. As such, the class honed my ability to write proficiently in Russian as well as grasp grammatical concepts that I have never thoughtfully considered speaking Russian at home. I leave this class with a heightened understanding of Russian language and history. I was also able to hone my reading comprehension skills and regularly converse with my classmates, giving me a firmer grasp on the language.",
    "We learned about imperial Russia in the first quarter of the 19th century, and we improved our speaking, reading, and writing skills. We also built a stronger understanding of complex grammar.",
    "I developed a better understanding of Russian language, history, and culture with an emphasis on usable vocabulary and discussion skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very organized, very clear expectations, and very interesting topics covered in class. Could be greater emphasis on the oral component, specifically on honing conversational skills.",
    "I would say the strengths and the weaknesses are the same thing depending on how you approach the course. You need to be self-motivated to get the most out of the course, but I believe that is on the student, so I don't really see it as a weakness.",
    "There is a lot of work that goes into preparing for oral exams, and giving us less topics to have to memorize for them would be a lot more helpful for our sleep schedules. Other than that, I have nothing but praise.",
    "The class environment, thanks to Professor Muravnik, was one in which students felt comfortable making mistakes. This was one of the biggest strengths of the course, along with its seminar-style, which made each class feel like a process of collective growth, rather than a passive lecture. The class could benefit from a bit more structure; an explicit definition of the professor's expectations from his students and descriptions of upcoming projects could go a long way in making students feel prepared. Additionally, I feel that students could gain a lot from conversations with each other in Russian, although there were a few projects that facilitated that kind of group work. Overall, an excellent course.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! I thought that Professor Muravnik taught the grammar in a really understandable, easy to grasp way, and the history readings were exactly the right level of difficulty (challenging enough that you learned from them, but not so complex that they were incomprehensible). Overall, I think I learned a lot and came away with a much stronger grasp of the language. The one area that I think could use improvement was the amount of speaking we were able to do; obviously it was a larger class so it's difficult to have a super high level of participation, but if there was any way to practice speaking more I think that would be really beneficial. And even the small amount of speaking we were able to consistently do tended to be more reading answers to questions than actually being forced to speak on the spot; I think if there was more of a focus on having natural conversations and discussions than simply answering comprehension questions that would help me, at least, improve my Russian a lot.",
    "Language is a heavy subject, but this course was able to augment language studies with learning about history and culture which made the content more engaging and offered us the feeling that what were studying was relevant beyond niche grammar rules."

    "This class is a great intersection of Russian history and Russian language. I highly recommend it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend RUSS 150 to another student who has completed the prerequisite classes. It's a fair amount of work, but Constantine makes it manageable, and my ability to speak the language has definitely improved. We also talked a lot more about etymology of words in this course than in L1-L4 courses, which helped a lot in increasing vocabulary.",
    "Definitely. If you have ambitions to improve your Russian language skills, then you should absolutely take this course.",
    "Absolutely! Constantine Muravnik is an incredible Russian instructor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is seriously interested in continuing with Russian. You really get to understand more as to why it's such a beautiful language and fluency is much improved by this course. Be prepared to work hard, but be astounded by everything you're learning.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course.",
    "Yes! This was a really fun, engaging course that helps you improve your Russian a TON. Professor Muravnik is a great teacher who is really good at helping you through the insanity that is Russian grammar, and you'll learn a surprising amount about Imperial Russian history.",
    "Russian is a difficult language and I would tell another student to be sure that they're serious about studying it before enrolling but if they are serious, I would absolutely recommend this course. This course is designed to build your language skills through using them to practically analyze history, current events, news, etc... Though the subject is difficult, I enjoyed this course this course and I feel that I learned a lot from it."
