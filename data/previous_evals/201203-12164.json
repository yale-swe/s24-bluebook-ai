   "comments": [
    "-A historical arc of consumerism in the United States from the 1920s - modern day-Read everything from NYT articles to Sci-Fi to an ethnography that was very specific to consumer culture in New Haven-Very topical, very interesting",
    "American Consumer Culture in the 20th Century was a good introduction to fields like ethnography and anthropology. At one ~250 page book a week and a two-page essay every other week, the workload is fairly heavy, but I found quite a few of the readings to be enjoyable. While I expected this class to be more focused on marketing than it was (it offered more of a historical background), I enjoyed it nonetheless, and it showed me an example of the workload required for more difficult college level classes.",
    "Interdisciplinary, heavy readings, biweekly essays and a final paper. Very open discussions; the course can be interesting if you are interested in the material and people do the readings, but this is often not the case.",
    "This class is a very thorough walk-through that explores the way consumer culture affects our way of life by attacking it at different angles and disciplines. It shows how consumer culture is integrated with our lives in ways that aren't obvious at first.I would definitely recommend taking this course. This is a class that everyone should take, and I would take it again if I could.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. From taking this class I've gained an understanding of why and how are economy works the way it does today.",
    "This is an excellent freshman seminar--it really teaches you how to read and write A LOT and the material is interesting. Take it if you want to learn more about consumer culture and about the American Studies approach. Professor Agnew is very nice and clearly extremely intelligent. Don't take it if you're not looking for a challenging workload or if you don't enjoy seminar-style courses--while Professor Agnew often tries to guide the discussions toward particular themes, the classes are really driven by students' ideas and responses. Overall, great for building important skills and a really interesting subject through which to do so!",
    "Great class, with mostly interesting though sometimes dense readings. Five 2-page papers, one paper every two weeks, and one final 12-page paper. There's a lot of reading - a book per week, and it is impossible to do it all, but reading and skimming selected chapters will still make discussion possible and worthwhile. I would recommend it if you are interested in the development of consumer culture and how it affects our lives and looking at it from an academic viewpoint, but if you're not, it can be a struggle.",
    "The course is really interesting and in every class I learned something new. I liked the interdisciplinary aspect to the course and loved that there was a myriad of topics covered. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this course, but I would tell people to be aware that you are reading about a book a week (around 200-300 pages a week).",
    "It's a lot of reading and writing. You read around 150-300 pages a week and discuss during class sessions. I thought that the class was going to be better than it actually was, but it wasn't bad. I'd recommend it. It's a decent class, but confusing at times.",
    "I would recommend this course if you like or want to more about anthropology\/social patterns.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in the humanities and ready to take on lots of reading. If you want a class that will introduce you to many different disciplines in the context of consumer culture, this is a great class to take.",
    "I would recommend this class to those interested in American history and who enjoy reading. Do not take this class if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford the time to read a new book each week.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It is a large investment of time, but it is applicable to anyone wishing to understand the culture we live in..",
    "I had high hopes for this course and, to be honest, the course fell a little short of my expectations. It was a solid course, and we explored interesting themes and questions, but I was disappointed because I felt like we rarely came to definitive conclusions--in other words, sometimes discussions rambled aimlessly. But most of the books are pretty interesting.",
    "AMST 002 is a great introduction to American Studies. Consumer Culture is not necessarily a consistent theme, but tends to serve as a backdrop to most of the course. The primary strength of the course is that it acts as an introduction to all of the different disciplines involved in American Studies, including history, anthropology, literature, architecture, and more. While the reading can often be overwhelming (a book a week), it's not necessary to read every page in depth.",
    "It is a class worth taking if interested in questions of \"authenticity\" and consumer dynamics. You will have to put effort into the class. I felt that i had to work harder in keeping up with readings and the writing assignments. Overall i felt this class was more difficult than an average Yale class."
