   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of information, and the way it is taught is not conducive to learning it in a semester. This class is extremely important for policy, regulatory affairs, and environmental studies, but the amount of information was overwhelming. Additionally, throughout the semester we were given vocabulary quizzes (I understand the importance, but I wish the quizzes would have been more encompassing) and presentations in which all 6 groups would present on the same readings. While I understand this class is about forming our own opinions based on the readings, I did not like how the class was structured.",
    "A very good introductory course for Risk Assessment.",
    "It was a good course to learn basics and application of risk assessment.",
    "Because I do not have any chemical or biological backgrounds, this course is really a little bit difficult for me. Honestly, I learned a lot in this class but it was really a tough process.",
    "I wanted this class to be good, but I did not enjoy it. We spent the first 3\/4 of the class learning terms to memorize with no real knowledge of application or engaging lessons. The first risk assessment we did was 2 weeks before the end of the course.",
    "It should have introduced the assessment part earlier.",
    "Not sure if this course evaluation does anything since I've heard that this course has still been taught the same exact way year after year but here it goes...I truly dreaded going to this class every week. We are given like 400-500 PowerPoint slides on day 1, which is completely overwhelming and outrageous. We are given two vocab quizzes during the semester, which seems fair until you get your grades back and realize that you had to write out each vocab definition verbatim in order to get a 100%. There are like 50 vocab terms that we have to study for the quizzes and the definitions are so meaty, which makes it unrealistic to memorize each definition word for word. On top of all this, we had a huge debate scheduled during reading week of finals, which comprises 30% of our overall grade...the same amount as our final exam. It was so stressful to have two of our biggest assignments back to back. I feel like the debate should have been our final exam since it was so involved and complex.",
    "A little complicated, important to keep up with the readings and understand the bigger picture along with details. Difficult but once you understand things, becomes interesting.",
    "mostly self taught. no feedback given on group projects or presentations.",
    "An useful course for students devoted in the field of risk assessment.",
    "Strengths: Prof Borak brought us interesting activities to class, which is more interesting than the course itself. However, for these activities, e.g. debate and presentation, we need learn the terms before.",
    "This class was an exercise in reading comprehension and the basics of group presentations rather than an introduction to to applied risk and analysis. Groups were assigned rather than formed which meant that approaches to group presentations clashed, and resulted in poorly presenting groups. The criteria for what makes an effective presentation were not ever explained, nor was any feedback ever given at any time about our past group presentations presented to us. This meant that future presentations never improved. We were urged to be persuasive and behave as advocates in our presentations, but this was not clearly communicated enough because most groups simply rote memorized word after word on the slide. The class was slow to begin, and at the end there was a massive assignment do each week to catch up."

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is clearly very knowledgable, but his teaching style is not for everyone and definitely not for me. It is a very antiquated memorization-focused, terminology for the sake of terminology with no real focus on application, technology, and the changing world of data learning.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Most classes did not encourage student participation or feedback. The class felt rigid, with slides read word for word as teaching."

   "comments": [
    "Unfortunately, whether or not I would recommend this course is not relevant, as it is required for certain tracks. The work feels sparse throughout the course and very back heavy throughout reading week (debate) and finals week (the only exam grade for this class). I do not like the structure for this class, and I feel stress about the last two pending grades despite having not completed either yet. If it were up to me, I would recommend the course content (taught in a different way with a different structure) but not this particular class unfortunately.",
    "This is a comparatively intense course. You'll have 2 presentations, 2 quiz, 1 debate, and a final exam. But at the meantime, you'll learn a lot about risk assessment. Overall, it is a course worth taking.",
    "If you're into toxicology and risk assessment, this is a must-take course.",
    "Even though this course is really challenging, I will recommend it to other students. You can really learned a lot of things about risk assessment in this class. The two presentation of basics in this field and one debate of real case are very helpful for us to understand the key points in this course.",
    "I want risk assessment to be a strong class because I believe it is very important for all disciplines of public health. As it stands right now, though, it is disorganized, there is not a clear path for learning, very outdated style of teaching involving a lot of memorization, and very odd setup of group projects, which are either very unclear and easy, but boring, or extraordinary complex and also unclear.",
    "A valuable course.",
    "I would tell a fellow student to steer clear from this class and only to take this course if it was required as part of their curriculum.",
    "A little complicated with loads of information. Requires time and effort but a great learning experience.",
    "A great course!",
    "too many group projects where teams members do NOT participate equally. self taught from outside resources",
    "I would recommend this course to those who wish to work in the field of risk assessment or health policy making.",
    "Recmmended for student who need real-case risk assessment experience.",
    "I would recommend a different course. While I think I learned about risk assessment, I honestly dreaded this class each week because the material felt dull and lifeless, was presented in such a manner, and most students didn't seem to understand or make any effort to understand the material."
