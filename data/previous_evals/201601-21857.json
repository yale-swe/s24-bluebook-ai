    "An okay class, with hard midterms but pretty easy to get a good grade if you're not an idiot.",
    "I did not enjoy this class at all. I am a junior MCDB major at Yale and found it to be badly taught. Slides were not descriptive enough and sections were spent towards discussing papers that didn't necessarily contribute to class discussion (sections could have been spent reviewing material since there was so much to process). I know a lot of students that dropped this class and I regret not doing so. Definitely don't waste your time with the course. Would NOT recommend.",
    "I would recommend this couse because it is one of the fundamental classes on MCDB. It is much smaller than the other lecture courses, and the testing schedule is nice because the tests are noncumulative.",
    "If you are thinking of incorporating molecular biology at a significant level in your professional life, whether it be research, evaluating clinical use of gene therapy, or keeping really up to date on the latest technology and the advances in the field of genetics take it-it will provide a solid foundation. If, on the other hand, you are simply interested in the beauty of molecular biology but are coming in from a distant field of study (like the social sciences, bioethics, etc.) or think it would be an interesting way to fulfill a Sc creditDO NOT TAKE IT. You will have to work very hard to continue waxing poetic about the molecular dust that life is made out of, when you're digging through the alphabet soup of enzymes, and cofactors, and lab-scientist shorthand.RUN, and make some spare time to read up on what you're interested in or what is most germane to your other professional pursuits. Don't take this course lightly, even if you're thinking of Cr\/D'ing it. And make sure you're able to do some hardcore rote memorizationmolecule drawing skills required. Also, the recommended prerequisites are absolutely necessary.",
    "I liked this course more than cell bio.",
    "Literally no reason to take this course. It's like a poorly run version of biochem. Super disorganized class with mediocre teaching.",
    "A very interesting class that requires a lot of time and effort to memorize detailed processes, but worth it. The class has one amazing professor and one lack luster one, but overall the course material will probably be fascinating for anyone interested in biology. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good intro bio course. It will provide you with a good foundation for understanding how cells regulate their function - a critical step in order to comprehend disease states.",
    "I went into this course wondering how much I would learn after the intro bio modules and many other biology classes. However, I found myself learning a great deal and also filling in gaps that had bothered me for ages. I would definitely recommend the material in this course, and I hope it is taught in a more accessible fashion. I would go so far as to recommend this course over some of the intro bio modules relating to molecular biology if they weren't required or if you can get out of them."
