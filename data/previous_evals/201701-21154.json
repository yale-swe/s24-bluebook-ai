    "I learned about the rich culture of the Caribbean and the influence of music in all parts of life, although narrative was the main focus.",
    "This course was such an interesting seminar-style course on a topic that I had not been exposed to before. I learned so much about Caribbean music along with how to analyze music's representation in Latin American literature.",
    "I learned a lot about Caribbean literature and music which was fun! I also learned more about Caribbean politics and history.",
    "I got better at reading old school Spanish literature after almost 10 years without a Spanish class.",
    "I feel like I greatly deepened my Spanish reading skills as well as my general writing with this course. It was the first time I have ever read a full novel in Spanish (as opposed to short stories or excerpts) and the final paper was the longest one I have ever written in any language. So this course was incredibly rewarding."

   "comments": [
    "At times, the reading was very difficult or long. Although the topic interests me greatly, I would sometimes get frustrated and give up. Maybe in the future if there is a way to make the poetry unit have fewer poems, that would be amazing because that is some complex stuff that I believe one could spend a whole class on. Other than the readings, I felt like at times the class felt like a lecture in a seminar room. I would complain about this, but Anibal is just so full of knowledge that I was just so excited to hear everything he said.",
    "I really enjoyed the teaching approach--Prof Gonzalez incorporated readings, videos, music and many other cultural elements. The class was seminar-style and very interactive which I also appreciated.",
    "I really liked this course. I thought the readings were pretty well balanced but perhaps would be easier if we were given more context before doing them - like maybe a summary. I did not feel that section was at all necessary.",
    "Not enough discussion, more like a lecture of less than ten.",
    "I thought this course was incredibly interesting and I really enjoyed it. I loved the readings, and Professor's lectures were very insightful. Overall, loved the class. One suggestion might be to have more opportunities for students to speak in class, but then again, section did a pretty good job of covering that."

    "If you are Spanish major or just looking to take a fun L5, take this course with Anibal! He knows so much and talking about and listening to music is really fun. Although we mostly read and discussed, we did listen to a few clips throughout the semester. If you don't want to do any work, there are quite a few readings with quizzes, so you may want to take another course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course (and any other course taught by Professor Gonzalez)--he is such an inspiring professor and loves to share his broad knowledge on all subjects surrounding Latin American literature!",
    "This is one of my favorite Yale Spanish courses.",
    "Yeah!",
    "Professor Gonzalez is wonderful! I would recommend taking the class just because he is so knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. Just be conscious of the fact that there isn't much room for discussion unless you assert yourself.",
    "Would absolutely recommend to any student already confident in Spanish. Would be difficult if Spanish were a little shaky, just purely in terms of the readings (but it is 300-level Spanish course, so I can't imagine anyone would be surprised at that)."
