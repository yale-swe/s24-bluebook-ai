    "If you are interested in syntax, or semantics to a lesser extent, then this class will be interesting to you. Students of non-English languages or even of English may find this class interesting in that it investigated ways in which imperative force and politeness can be encoded in language. I would recommend it to any student interested in such fine details of language.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, specifically for the fact that it covers an area of syntax that the student may not otherwise consider, and affords the opportunity to form new questions about his or her own research."

   "comments": [
    "As mentioned above, the course introduced me to an area of syntax that I had not previously considered, and it gave me a chance to look at my data in new an interesting ways. In terms of contribution to my own research, it provided the chance to ask new and interesting questions about my research language, so it was definitely worthwhile in this regard.",
    "The amount of attention given to the syntax-semantics interface in our reading (and discussion) for this course gave it a real edge in terms of preparing students for the reality of literature in either of these fields, alone. Although some of us were unpracticed in the formalisms of one of these subfields (semantics, for me), to come terms with their influence over one another is a major prerequisite for research in either area."
