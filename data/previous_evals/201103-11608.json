   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Take it if you can - that is if you can actually get in, this class is in great demand.",
    "It's very micro econ. The title makes it sound like you stick only to topics of social security and medicare and benefit plans. But, really you dig into the micro economic question of why humans make decisions like they do. You model and test and evaluate the decision-making process ABOUT the above macro topic using MOSTLY economics papers. The research proposal at the end is intensive but fascinating (if you can find a topic that really interests you and that you really want to learn more about, b\/c Prof. McKee will help you learn to dig into it.)",
    "Don't let yourself be scared off by the mathematical focus of the first two classes--you don't need to love econometrics to do well in and enjoy this class (although it helps)if you're interested in understanding what motivates decisions such as retirement, saving patterns, bequests in a satisfyingly rigorous way then you should definitely take this class. if you want to learn how to create an economic model and set up empirical analysis, take this class. if you want to learn random factoids to impress you more nerdy friends, take this class.Professor Mckee is great: knowledgeable, enthusiastic, amusing and extremely helpful throughout the process of writing the research proposal.it's hard to come away from this class not having learned a lot, not just facts, but how to approach economic\/business\/political arguments and proposals with a critical eye that will serve you well in any area of business.caveats: the articles you read are difficult and sometimes pretty mathy but you are not expected to understand everythingWorkload: 2 research papers to read each week (hard but doable) with ungraded worksheets to help you understand the papers, a research proposal that you complete in stages throughout the semester",
    "Take this seminar",
    "It's a class on the economics of growing old. It's a well taught course but this semester it had too many students in it which ruined it for me. If there are going to be 20+ students in it again, you're better off finding another seminar.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interest in the subject, the teacher is great!",
    "YES",
    "Yes! Best way to learn how to write an academic research paper. The material that Professor McKee chooses are quite interesting, accessible and he definitely makes the subject fun to study. Normally the things you learn in Econ classes are pretty much not applicable to anything outside of school, but the topics here are actually interesting and definitely keeps you thinking.",
    "Each week you read econometric papers and the grades consist of the parts of a research proposal. Yes I would recommend this class. The professor is great and the papers are a good introduction to what grad school would be like.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course. When I preregistered for this course, I wasn't too excited about the subject matter, but I signed up anyways because last year's evaluation said Prof.McKee is a great seminar teacher. Indeed, he did a really great job in this class and made the materials more interesting and relevant because he is so excited about it himself. He is very knowledgeable, but at the same time approachable and laid-back. He clearly cares a lot about the students and how to improve his teachings. The work load is light, just a paper or two for each class. The midterm and final papers are also not hard, because you can get feedback and help from the professor along the way.",
    "Take this class!!! It really is fantastic. Professor McKee is the best, the subject matter is interesting, you learn how structural models work, and it's VERY VERY little work.Each week, you go through two papers. You have to fill out a \"worksheet\" on each paper before class, but these are really easy and you only have to read the intro\/conclusion to get through it. That's the only weekly homework.You also have to lead one class in the semester, but this is really easy and kind of fun.Other than that, the ONLY work is a 15-page paper, half of which is due at midterm and half of which is due during reading week.Awesome class. Take it. You'll learn a lot without doing much.",
    "This is a good economics class - the material is interesting and relevant. It's not a lot of work at all - you can get by just skimming the papers, and you don't need to spend much time on the paper assignment. It can get boring at times because you don't really need to pay attention in class, but overall very good class and great teacher.Students become a lot more proficient at reading economics papers and you emerge with a solid understanding of various microeconomic issues surrounding aging.",
    "If you're willing to put in a couple of hours a week on these papers and are at all interested in the course material, you'll get a lot out of this. I also suppose if you're a more grad school-bound Econ student with better math chops than me you can get some really great exposure to methodology and labor Econ research."
