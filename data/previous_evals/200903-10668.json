A comparative cosmology of the planets. A selective investigation of the Earth and its unique place in the universe.",
    "I feel that this class is a very general overview. While the material towards the end of the semester was new to me, the beginning of the semester was more of a review. I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who is looking for an in depth\/detailed course on Earth and space science."
