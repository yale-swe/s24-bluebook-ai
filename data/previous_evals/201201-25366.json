    "I would say Italian 120 is a good course, but I would probably recommend that students apply to take it in Siena because they would get more speaking practice and have it concentrated within 8 weeks instead of every day.",

    "Yes, it's great!",
    "You have to take L2 if you took L1 - simple as that. Just shop around for a good section!",
    "It's just part two of L1: exactly what you'd expect. There are a couple of movies in class. Be prepared to work on more complex grammar concepts than in L1."
