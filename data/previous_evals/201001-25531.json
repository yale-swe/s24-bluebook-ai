    "This course helped me to clarify my own thinking about summer research abroad, and each of the instructors brought rich experience in field research and their own areas of expertise to it. At the same time, the course lacked focus - covering so much ground for several students' research interest, I'm not sure what we were supposed to take away from the semester as a whole. I would recommend that this course be taught for a grade spring semester in future, asit was difficult to prioritize work I found interesting and challenging in this class above work I knew I had to complete for another class.Although I think the course could also benefit from more clarity and communication between professors and students, I am grateful that all three professors were very generous with their time and feedback, particularly as we were developing fundraising proposals.",
    "Social Transformation and Political Consolidation: the Middle East in Comparative Perspective is a topical and methodological survey of politics and society in the Middle East. It is not a substantive fact-based class, but a class that provides a sample of topics, a variety of theoretical frameworks from which to view such topics, and a discussion of the methodologies employed by such theories. If that's what you want, go for it - but don't take it if you don't have a solid background in the area - take it afterwards.The support system for senior-essay research, however, was very helpful. The financial guarantee of summer funding is useful, but you are still required to apply for other fellowships, and if you're writing a senior essay in international studies that requires original research overseas, you'll be able to find money for that anyway, so the guarantee of funding isn't really a reason to take the course.",
    "This class is pretty valuable if you plan on using it as the spring-fall IS seminar, and have some background in Middle East studies and political science. Discussions tend to be less inclusive of the entire class, and tend to involve two or three students and the professors at a time, but the topic shifts around over the course of the class.",
    "Unless given compelling evidence that it's gotten better, don't do it. This was a poorly organized, poorly run class."
