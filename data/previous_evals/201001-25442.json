    "If you want to learn how to take digital photos, take this class. It's definitely the type of class that you only get out of what what you put in, but if you're earnest, you'll see huge payoffs. Ben is a great professor and the resources of the DMCA are incredible.",
    "If you want a basic introduction to digital photography - to understand how to adjust camera settings and use Photoshop in order to be able to make photos that look the way you want them to - then I would recommend this course to you. I can't comment on the other professors, but I really enjoyed Ben Donaldson. He has a bit of a caustic sense of humor, but he's actually very friendly and clearly deeply passionate about taking photographs. His comments were almost always very constructive even when critical. I've heard some horror stories about asshole photography instructors who failed to grasp the fact that they were teaching introductory photography courses and were brutally critical of students' work in a totally unwarranted way, but I thought Ben did a great job of encouraging everyone to improve their work over the course of the semester while bearing in mind that not everyone in the class was aiming to become a professional art photographer. That said, he was very willing to meet outside of class time and work with people who were more serious about their work. I took the class Cr\/D because I had no idea how art classes are graded and I didn't want it to screw up my GPA, which I think was a good idea.",
    "Its a great class you should definitely take it",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students passionate about photography, but would not recommend it to students who think it would be a fun way to spend time. It was much more work than doing photography as a hobby."
