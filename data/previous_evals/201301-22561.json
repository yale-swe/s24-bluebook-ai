    "Favorite class of the year. Really took the cover off the Iraq conflict. Course material starts in the early twentieth century and works its way through the 1980 Iran-Iraq War, the 1990-1991 Kuwait invasion and Desert Storm, the sanctions regime during the 1990s, the 2003 American invasion and ensuing occupation, and finally the current state of Iraq since the US pullout.Your grade comes from participation, a short presentation on a reading to the seminar and a short paper, and a final paper.I came out of this class having learned so much. Howorth really knows his stuff and the guest session we had with Emma Sky was brilliant. Highly recommended if you can get in.",
    "ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES AT YALE - the Iraq war will come to define our generation and yet people don't have a deep enough understanding of it. A must-take class with a manageable workload and a fantastic set of readings. Not to mention that Professor Howorth is the absolute best seminar leader and class discussion is always dynamic.",
    "Take this class. This may be the last year he's teaching it. So take something with Howorth. You won't regret it.",
    "Fantastic course! Must take even if only marginally interested in Iraq, the conflict has defined an entire generation and is incredibly important to know about.",
    "Overview of US\/western engagement with Iraq from 1920s to the present, with a focus on the 2003 invasion and its aftermath. Enjoyable, informative course. One presentation coupled with a 2,000 word paper, and a 5,000-6,000 word research paper. Reasonable amounts of reading each week. Professor Howorth is fun to take a seminar with - he is witty, relaxed, and flexible with deadlines. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the topic (which is more relevant than you might think).",
    "overview of the history of iraq since british colonization, but the focus is on the 2003 war. howorth is brilliant and steers class discussions in a productive, focused way. i knew little about the war before the class and left with a solid grasp of how to approach studies of it in the future. one of my favorite classes in my time at yale.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Best seminar at Yale. If you can manage to get in, take it for sure.",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar to a fellow student. Take this course!"
