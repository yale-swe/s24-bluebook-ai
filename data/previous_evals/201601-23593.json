    "ANTH 223 is a really interesting class. I particularly enjoyed getting three different perspectives on every subject. The workload is relatively light, but you really need to at least skim the readings, which can be somewhat lengthy, but usually interesting. The course brings up interesting points to discuss in section. Definitely take this course, regardless of your major, if you're interested!",
    "100% would recommend this class to a fellow student. Interesting readings, interesting lectures, a good amount of work and three different approaches to a broad topic. Fun guest lectures, excellent sections and knowledgeable TAs. The three teachers were excellent, definitely worked cohesively together. Excellent introduction to multiple disciplines of Anthropology.",
    "Take it! it's so much fun!",
    "I would definitely recommend ANTH 223 to other students. It is a course that combines three sub-fields of anthropology in a very interesting way to answer big questions.",
    "ANTH 223 is a class that has interesting subject matter that is not very well executed. It needs a stronger theoretical backbone to guide the course and a syllabus that reflects this. The three professors had different styles which meant that things were haphazard and not always consistent - readings were uploaded at various times and changed at the last minute. If these are supplementary that's fine, but it was the core readings that were not reliable. Also, much of the later course and writing assignments focused on genocide, and we only had one lecture on the topic. I think that if much of the writing and thinking is to reflect on genocide, there needs to be more class time spent covering it. I would recommend this class to another student only if it was significantly reconstructed. But it's great material and important questions to be asking! So it's definitely worthwhile to reorganize it.",
    "TLDR: I am going to tentatively recommend this fascinating and promising course, knowing that I took it in its first year, and that many logistical issues and syllabus issues will be changed in the future. On paper, The Anthropology of War is a promising premise of a class -- bringing together three amazing professors and their respective fields of expertise (cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and archeology) to develop an understanding of humanitys most compelling phenomenon. In practice, the class was full of many interesting and eye-opening components, but I struggled in thinking that the components added up to make a coherent understanding of war. The biggest downfall for the course was the lack of syllabus organization and seeing lack of communication between the professors. The way we studied topics, I sort of like a little kid who picks up one toy and plays with it briefly -- only to find another next toy, and completely forget about the first one. We had a lecture about intergroup aggression in animals followed by a lecture about sports and war followed by the screening of a film about the Dugum Dani followed by a lecture about osteology.... followed by a lecture about paleoarchaeology and hominins followed by a lecture about Native Americans followed by a lecture about Chariots. (Reader, are you as lost reading that sentence as we were experiencing those lectures?) The topics discussed were, of course, for the most part fascinating, but there was almost zero attempt at all -- except through in section, where very thoughtful TAs who picked up on our exasperation -- to connect themes from week to week, or even lecture to lecture. You got the sense that lectures topics were planned when it was most convenient for someone to give a lectureeither that, or the order of topics was decided through putting all of the topics into a hat and then drawing them at random. This lack of organization also manifested itself logistically. Despite the syllabus mention of two papers, by mid-February, five weeks into the course, the professors had yet to bring up when any of the papers were due. In essence, when the finally told us that there was an assignment, it was basically a pop-paper smack in the middle of midterms season. While the assignment was manageable and ultimately not impossible, this lack of forethought (My professor just assigned me a paper that I had never heard about during midterm season!) just shows another level of organization amongst all of the professors. The future promise of the course lies in engaging variety of pedagogical instruction from Academic Titans: Professor Lombard gives riveting, even life-changing lectures, tackling broad, meaty themes, and grounding them with compelling, attention-grabbing stories and case studies. Professor Honeychurch brings archeology to lifemoving around the room with a such dynamic, engaging vivacity, that he probably deserves an Oscar over Leo. Professor Watts is a veritable encyclopedia of knowledgehis lectures are incredibly informative, if dry, and full of too many unnecessary details which dont contribute to (even distract from) his central message. (Being more succinct and being able to identify broad themes are two things he should work on: You get the impression that if Professor Watts were to build a sand castle, he would do so by picking up and putting down each individual grain of sand.) Guest lectures about sports, osteology, and various case studies were for the large part compelling. And again, its not the content of the course or the professors that need tempering; its the courses organization. (DOWN WITH POP QUIZZES. UP WITH SHORT PAPERS.) With some large modifications to the syllabus, this class has the ability to be amazing. I hope they teach it again -- but for now, its less than the sum of its parts.",
    "This course presents an extremely fascinating topic in a multidisciplinary way, which allows for nuanced understandings. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. In fact, all students should be required to take it (I'm only slightly joking).",
    "A really fascinating course that introduces you to a variety of different fields. Would definitely recommend this, even to non-anthro majors (I am not one). The workload is very reasonable and the lack of exams takes away a lot of the stress.",
    "Only take this if you're very interested in the subject. There were a lot of very dense, boring readings. I wouldn't recommend unless you talk to someone who took it first. Really know what you're getting into",
    "This is a great credit d class.",
    "Interesting, but disorganized my year. It should be a really great class in the future, as its potential was quite high.",
    "I would recommend even though it had its ups and downs. I am also sure it will improve as a course as it was the first time the class existed."
