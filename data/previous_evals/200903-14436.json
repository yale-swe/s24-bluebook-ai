    "Good class. Very interesting and Fun. Great in-class discussions. DO THE READING. It's worth it.",
    "This course seems very interesting, but it is taught in a very disorganized way. The class would often get of on tangents that were somehow not related even remotely to what we were discussing. Both Brad and Elizabeth seem to know what they are doing, and I imagine that in future years the class will get better, this year it was not good. It seemed like they did not know what they wanted from the class, which makes it very difficult for the students. The work load is very light though, with just 5 reading responses throughout the semester and one blog post. The take home midterm and final and not extremely time consuming either. Shop the class and see if it is still disorganized, or how you fit in. Also, if you are not a computer science major you may be lost at certain points when discussions become more technical than about legal issues.",
    "Yes, would recommend - it's a great class with very interesting subject material.",
    "A broad intro into the interactions between computer technology and the law. It explores many IP, rights, and other criminal and civil legal issues that have developed due to computers, the internet, and especially new technologies such as twitter or facebook. The class had the most AMAZING guest speakers and the two professors makes the class INCREDIBLE!DO THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!! PERIOD",
    "Quite an enjoyable course, if a bit unstructured and dominated by Comp Sci majors and people who know far more than me about this stuff. If you're interested in internet law, though, and willing to participate in class, it's very worthwhile. Brad and Elizabeth are a lot more fun than most professors.",
    "This is a good course for those interested in technological issues and the way in which they can affect the law. Even though the syllabus says that no previous knowledge of computers is necessary, it is hard to follow the discussions if you do not have a solid knowledge of computer science. However, the topics are very interesting. There is a considerable amount of reading, but the written requirements are pretty flexible: 4 or 5 reading responses, 1 or 2 blog posts, a take-home midterm or a group project, and a take-home final exam or a 15-20-page final paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It offers an engaging look at the application of US law to the changing digital world with a totally manageable workload. Anybody who has a remote interest in law would find this class interesting.",
    "Take it if you're a tech n00b and interested in the legal landscape of the Internet; you'll get to read up on all the pertinent issues and related articles and talk to some of the finest minds in the tech world (Brad, Elizabeth, and the wide range of awesome guest speakers they invite). Take it if you're a tech geek-- you'll get plenty of opportunity to spew on in class about how much you know about this and that and you can fanboy\/fangirl over the coolest people in the industry.Don't take it if you can't stand tech geeks who think that droning on about the technical workings behind this-and-that means that they're also well-versed in the social and political issues related to the Internet.",
    "Most people who took the class will say they loved it. That's because most people who took this class already knew the professors and are technology-oriented types (read: CS majors). I thought this class had a cult-like feel to it. A lot of kids knew the professors already and had these ins with them. Also, the professors claimed you didn't need to know anything about CS to do the class, but a lot of the jargon and general assumptions about knowledge base DID assume knowledge of CS-type material. I felt hugely disadvantaged by having no background in technological sciences. Also, the professors were too intent on seeming young and funny and cool. Like I felt like showing up wasn't really worth it cause it was just one big inside joke between the professors and their friends in the class and I didn't understand it.",
    "Great class. You learn lots about law and about 15 or so issues with technology and the law. It's all relevant and interesting. My best class this semester.",
    "It is a neat course that covers a lot, and the chance to hear guest speakers is unparalleled in the subject. Probably best for someone new to the subject - students more familiar with the current issues of the day might be better served reading the blogs and course documents on the course website.",
    "Definitely take this if you have any interest in law or technology.",
    "Great lecture class. Not a lot of work, but interesting.",
    "If you're legitimately into the subject matter, don't mind wading through some thick readings pretty regularly, and do some real work, then yes. (Having some background in the department and\/or the subject matter helps, despite it being an Intro class.) If only some or none of that applies to you, proceed with some caution.",
    "Yes. But I will say that even though it's an introductory course, there is a lot of assumed knowledge. I might have had trouble in it if I didn't have a computer science background.",
    "If you know nothing about computer science culture, it can be a little frustrating trying to understand everything that is going on in class discussions, but the work is doable. The readings can also be tedious if you know nothing about computer science. However, if you are interested in learning a little bit about computer science culture - for example, the name of the program people use to go sit outside your house and discover the password to your Facebook account - and some of the legal issues surrounding technology and the internet, you will be fine in the course. I took the course because I was interested in copyright and sharing\/selling music. We touched on copyright a bit, and I found some of it useful.",
    "I was one of the only, if not the only, freshmen in the class. Sometimes I was lost during discussions becauseI did not have a strong computer science background going into the course. I think that you will get the most out of this course if: a) you have a strong interest in technology law, b) you have a decent background in comp sci (general knowledge about computers and the Internet, and maybe an intro to programming class or something), and c) you're not a freshman. The reason for (c) is because I think most people need a semester or possibly a year to become comfortable in real Yale discussion settings (that's at least true for me). Most of the other students in the class were upperclassmen and had a good background in comp sci, which caused the discussions to move toward complex technological concepts to which I at times simply had nothing to contribute.",
