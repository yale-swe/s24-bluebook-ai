    "The class is a great survey of Mediterranean history in the 20th century. By learning about the dictatorships in countries such as Spain, Greece and Yugoslavia, you develop a much better understanding of South European history.Prof. Maragkou is a great professor, the reading workload is manageable and class discussion is intellectually stimulating.",
    "Good class. You will learn a lot about the specific dictatorships as well as the theory of dictatorship."
