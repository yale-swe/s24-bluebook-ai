    "G&G 491 is guaranteed to be time consuming, challenging, and even frustrating at times; however, by the end of the second semester, when one's senior thesis is complete, one feels as if he or she has truly experienced and understood the scientific method in full, which is, in my opinion, the most rewarding educational experience I have had at Yale. Seeing a long-term and complex project through from start to finish - that is, from field work to lab work to data analysis to writing - is the foundation of the senior thesis in Geology and Geophysics, and I think this course allows for one to do just that.",
    "Great research program - be willing to put in a lot of time, especially at the end. I would definitely recommend this."
