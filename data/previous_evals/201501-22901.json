    "You better be willing to devote a lot of time to this course. There aren't really any prerequisites other than that, but you probably would benefit from at least a passing knowledge of multivariable calculus. Make sure you like writing proofs. (If you have never done this before or are unsure then I would probably run away from this course unless you are willing to spend doubly extra amount of time on this course)",
    "As I said above, it really depends on the student's interests. If they are really interested in abstract math and are willing to spend a lot of time and effort struggling through hard problems, then the material can actually be very interesting and the professor and TA's all know what they're talking about. But if that doesn't sound appealing to you then it is really not an ideal course to take.",
    "Essentially, if you think about it, Giulio is a Greek God, perhaps Dionysus, due to his curly hair, lecturing among mere mortals. When Giulio talks about volumes of manifolds, differential forms, De Rahm Cohomology, oscillation, multinomials, graph theory, dual spaces, and optimistic mountain climbers, he illuminates the material. You will chuckle, much like Giulio with colored chalk and hyper volume, when you think of the incredible long but rewarding problem sets he assigns. His tests are eminently fair if you have a pulse between 60 and 120, and have properly firing neurons. Its nice. Its really nice. It's math. It's math in its purest form. It's rigorous proofs. Its cool sh*t. Its Giulio. Its... life. Take this class iff you want to be a math major.",
    "Continuation of 230, you know the deal, Giulio is the best. The class is fair and interesting, problem sets are good. And Giulio.",
    "Difficult, challenging, abstract, but rewarding.",
    "This class covers (more advanced) linear algebra and calculus. It is taught similarly to 230, with an emphasis on proofs and rigor. Compared to 230, this semester follows the Hubbard textbook much more closely. It also is less abstract (though not applied). If you are looking to challenge yourself mathematically, especially if you have a strong background, this is a good course to take. It certainly is a challenge, but it is not killer, and most people find it worth it. If you're unsure whether to take this, talk to those in 230 from last semester, as it will be a similar course.",
    "Take it. It's worth it",
    "Math 231 is a continuation of Math 230, but in a lot of ways it challenges you to more challenging and unfamiliar material. I am sure most people have seen how to take a derivative or check if a function is continuous at some point in time, but I believe very few people have proved Gelfand's Formula and explored Spectral Graph Theory. It is all the excursions into other areas of math that we have never seen before that made this class so worth it. If you took math 230 you have a pretty good idea what you are in for.",
    "Math 231 is an excellent introduction to proof-based math. It does a good job of bridging the gap between good mathematicians with a plug-and-chug background and kids who have done olympiads and what not. Also, if you are thinking of doing theoretical physics, you MUST take this class.",
    "A much better class than MATH 230. I cannot tell whether or not Giulios teaching has improved, the topics were more interesting, Lam was the best TA on earth, or a combination of all of these factors lead to second semester being a much much better experience for me. I finally feel like my understanding of math has reached greater depths and perspectives. I still think there are serious organizational problems with the class that place unnecessary burdens on students, but would overall recommend the class to other students and would take it again if I could do Freshmen year over (though I am so happy those Psets are finally over!). Formulation of integration in terms of measure theory, permutations, forms, and orientation was the most exciting part both semesters of MATH 230\/231. Grading: difficult and with large variation; Workload: moderate to heavy (my largest time commitment); Knowledge: decent introduction to important topics to prepare you for further proofing and math classes. HWSNBN",
    "This was a great, engaging course that I would recommend anyone seriously interested in learning what real mathematics is like. If you took 230, you really need to take this course as it completes and contextualizes a lot of what you learn in 230. Giulio is an excellent professor and really cares about his students. Be forewarned, however, that the problem sets take between 10-15 hours a week. There aren't ones every week, however, when there are, they are very difficult. They are cool (we cover everything from graph theory to representation theory) but they don't always reinforce what we learn in class and require a lot of communal work\/ going to office hours. Be aware that because the material is harder this semester of 230\/231 is much more difficult and takes a lot more time, at least to do the homework. Really glad I took this course after the fact, and with giulio saying he will teach it next year everyone who took 230 and was able to stick with it should really take this course.",
    "MATH 231 is a rigorous introduction to important techniques in vector calculus and linear algebra that are important for higher mathematics. The problem sets are a lot of work, but are both interesting and useful! I'd definitely recommend the course.",
    "231 is harder than 230, but even more fun. Giulio is good at motivating and explaining each topic. More than in 230 he tends to give the intuition behind complex proofs like integration over a parameterized manifold, and he skipped the proof of Stoke's theorem altogether, but I think that was a good call.",
    "Math 230 functions as a hazing process for freshmen who think they want to be math majors. The curve is relatively kind (though I'm not sure about this semesterhaven't gotten my grade back yet), but material is difficult and the pace is very quick. Expect to need to know how to learn well on your own from a book.",
    "Take it",
    "Course that exposes students to basics of proof-based mathematics in the form of linear and multivariable calc.",
    "Excellent class. Even better than the first semester. The problem sets had more interesting material and were slightly more challenging, all the interesting theorems are in this half of the class such as Stokes' Theorem. We covered multi in a day! All in all, fun interesting class, well worth it.",
    "While this class covers some topics familiar to the student who has taken multivariable calculus and\/or linear algebra, it treats them with a much greater depth. This is a great tool in thinking about proofs and proof-writing, and also in appreciating the origins of some theorems and methods taken for granted in standard math and science courses.",
    "This class was definitely my hardest class during my freshman year but I really enjoyed it and learned so much by being challenged. Professor Tiozzo is an amazing teacher and really puts a lot of effort into teaching. The homework takes a lot of time but it does not consume your whole life at Yale. The math you learn is so beautiful (my favorite problem was calculating the volume of an n-dimensional ball!!!!) and rewarding. By taking this class you really feel like you are getting a lot smarter. The class really teaches you how to think like a mathematician. If you are good at math and want to pursue a very quantitative track I would highly recommend this course. Math 231 is slightly more difficult than Math 230 material wise; however, the tests are graded on a more generous curve for Math 231.",
    "Very abstract, a class of pure math. If you like skipping to the useful parts of a topic, this is not the class for you. Math 231 is concerned with proofs and the underlying concepts of mathematics, rather than the ability to utilize them for computation. For those who love such a path, this is a fantastic class that opens your eyes to what math has to offer."
