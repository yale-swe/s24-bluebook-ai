   "comments": [
    "brief overview of the formation of the islamic state, I wish it related more to modern day",
    "I learned a lot about the finer details of the early caliphate and the men who maintained it.",
    "I learned a great deal about the formation and spread of Islam during the 600's and 700's. For those wishing to develop a good understanding about the formation of the Caliphate, and about the way it has shaped the modern Middle East, this course is vital.",
    "I learned much more about not only Islam and the Qur'an, but also about the history of the early Islamic Empire and its culture and society in depth.",
    "Through this course, I gained fascinating insight on the formation of the Islamic State through an examination of the Qur'an and other primary source material (secondary as well). A study of the beginning of the Islamic faith provided to not only be fascinating, but also incredibly relevant given the state of the Middle East today. It entirely changed my perspective of present day conflict in the middle east, of religion and faith and of the preservation and applicability of historic texts.",
    "I learned a lot about early Islam and the course of the religion's development. On a historical level, I now better understand the near east in late antiquity and its relationship to neighboring territories. I also have a better sense of Islam's traditions and the internal logic guiding them, which is quite useful given the modern political situation globally. In terms of skills, I honed my paper-writing similar to any history class with a term paper. Definitely I got a boost in research ability with Yale tools. Prof. Allouche helps every student with research and that's really useful. It's be great if more history professors did that, especially in courses with lots of freshmen. Personally, I loved all the little insights that came with the course, like learning that Gibraltar is Jabal Tariq, named for the Muslim conqueror of al-Andalus, or knowing that Saudi Arabia changed from the Islamic to the Western calendar to make people work an extra 11 days a year for the same pay. When we got to Shiism and Iran, there were little nuggets in every corner. The bit about Obama potentially being the Mahdi was hilarious."

   "comments": [
    "good history but not enough relevance to modern day",
    "I greatly enjoyed the class, and have no criticisms. Professor Allouche is extremely knowledgable, and is always sure to engage with the class. I learned a great deal, and had a good time doing so.",
    "The course is a wonderful way to be introduced to Islam and Islamic history for a student with little background knowledge of the subject. The readings and lectures were engaging and informative, and overall I have no complaints about the course.",
    "Very interactive",
    "The course provided the opportunity to delve deeply into a fascinating and somewhat obscure history through primary and secondary source material. Students could fully engage and interact with the material by virtue of the nature of the class: Though it was a lecture, students were encouraged to ask questions throughout each session (it was truly a hybrid of a lecture and seminar). This facilitated deeper understanding of the material and its connection to modern day Arabia. I appreciated the weekly reflection assignments, which allowed me to internalize and respond to what I had learned (through class and reading assignments) in a personal way. At times the lectures were dry but overall, I would characterize them as engaging and insightful.",
    "I thought it was quite a strong course, though the lecturing style is not for everyone. Personally, I like straight lectures from knowledgeable professors, and there was a fair amount of that in this course. I also liked the textbooks, especially the Saunders. These may not be best for all students, but they can self-select during shopping period. I liked it a lot and feel I learned a great deal in the current format. In terms of lecturing style, cadence, mannerisms, and clarity of speech, I found Prof. Allouche to be one of my favorite lecturers from my time at Yale, simple as that."

   "comments": [
    "Good easy history credit",
    "This is a great history course for people interested in the history of the early Middle East.",
    "For those interested in studying Islam or the Middle East, this course is vital. It provides great background on the formation and spread of Islam, and the foundation of the Caliphate.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone else. Clearly, you don't need to have an extensive background to do well in the course, and the level of knowledge you get out of it is really outstanding.",
    "Yes, it was very enjoyable and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes. I loved the professor and the material. Great beginner course if you are interested",
    "I would recommend this course to any student-- history major and nonhistory major alike. The topic is entirely relevant and in my opinion it is important to have an understanding of it or at least be familiar with it. Furthermore, students were given opportunities to engage with the topic on a personal level, by virtue of the weekly reflection assignments (where students were to provide their reactions\/reflections to the week's material) and the final paper, the topic of which students had complete freedom to choose. Take this course!",
    "I would recommend this course. Islam has a rich history and this is a great opportunity to understand it. The Middle East and its divisions will make so much more sense to you. It's also really neat to read ancient texts from different civilizations. You can tell when you read the Qur'an, or ibn-Ishaq, and so on, that you're hearing from people with a whole different way of thinking than we have today. That kind of exposure helps you think about your own ways of thinking at the same time as you study others'. Prof. Allouche is really caring and a lot of fun."
