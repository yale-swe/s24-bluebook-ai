   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Great understanding of formative political and social texts in the Western Tradition.",
    "This course really pushed my writing ability to the limit, which helped me improve my analysis and presentation of ideas. Beyond that, DS covers a huge range of topics (it gets very heavy at the end with DuBois and Arendt), so it was a struggle to keep up sometimes.",
    "I learned to write accurate essays and understand the political philosophers in larger context.",
    "I learned how to write better and to read difficult texts.",
    "My criticial reading, writing, and thinking improved dramatically. I feel much better equipped (now than when I started) to read and distill complex arguments and ideas. But, most importantly, I gained a tremendous amount of enjoyment from the texts we read. I'm sure that these works will stick with me for the rest of my life.",
    "My sense of the progression of Western thought (from Luther to Arendt) has deepened and I feel as though I have a grasp on some of the most influential ideas and arguments made by important thinkers of that period.",
    "I learned the thoughts of European and American political theorists, from the 16th century to the modern day.",
    "I learned so so much in HP. Firstly, my writing has improved tremendously. Secondly, I have learned to understand another's argument. Thirdly, I have learned to become a more effective reader. TAKE THIS COURSE, STAY IN DS -- IT'S WORTH IT",
    "I feel like I learned a lot about the opinions held by each of the authors we read this semester. I think I have an understanding of how they ideas connect and overlap as well as the similarities and differences between their main points, writing styles, and the contexts in which they were writing. I think my short essay writing improved, and I also got better at clearly and succinctly presenting my argument.",
    "I developed my ability to construct deliberately organized papers, understand intricate arguments, and form personal interpretations of texts."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Only strengths.",
    "Ds H&P is obviously the course where all the readings that don't fit into the Phil and Lit tracks are put. Don't get me wrongthey're greatbut sometimes H&P feels a bit less organized reading-wise than the other courses. Despite this feeling I get, DS was still one of the best parts of my Freshman year.",
    "Fall semester DS H\/P gives too much reading. And because it is impossible to finish them, you sometimes skip the important parts that you should not skip. Be prepared to engage in class discussion where no one seems to have read the text.",
    "The course is great, dont change it.",
    "DS H&P has few weaknesses. I really enjoyed it. The workload was hefty but manageable. All the works we read were relevant, intellectually stimulating, and enjoyable. Papers were well spaced out. All in all, I wouldn't change anything. DS was great.",
    "The HP thread of DS is perhaps more incoherent than the other threads, and often (especially earlier in the semester) feels strangely abstract despite the fact that the thinking is political. To that extent, it can feel relatively piecemeal. That being said, it offers a solid introduction to political philosophy.",
    "The syllabus includes works by many notable, important historical and political figures. Readings were sometimes too long, but their importance was nevertheless appreciated.",
    "The Historical and Political Thought track of DS has always confused me a little bit. I never was completely sure what kind of writing was expected of us and how the items on the syllabus really cohered. Many of them--especially the social contract theorists--were clearly connected; but the mix of historical analysis, philosophy, and political science always left me slightly at a loss when I went to write my paper as to whether it should be an argument or just an advanced, focused book report. That being said, some of my favorite texts were part of the HP track and overall it is a very strong syllabus. I'm glad I've read the works on it, and my only suggestion is perhaps to think about and communicate better what kind paper an HP paper is, especially in relation to the other two tracks which are much clearer (philosophical analysis, literary criticism).",
    "The strengths are the many readings, and informative lectures. Some of the readings are rather fragmented, and I think understanding of the author's works could be improved by giving more consolidated assignments.",
    "I think this course does a good job of selecting works that all relate to each other in some way. I do think, however, that not enough time is devoted to each of these works to do them justice. If fewer works were chosen and more time was spent on each of them, the class would feel less rushed. That being said, I really enjoyed all of the books we read this semester and it would be difficult to cut anything out.",
    "Strengths include the interconnected nature of the covered texts, the intimate seminar setting, and the opportunities to closely examine and evaluate texts in papers."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, especially if you can take it with Professor Kronman.",
    "Yes! Take DS, but only if you're down with a lot of writing and A LOT of reading!",
    "Fall semester HP has some of the most eloquent and highly-minded thinkers of all times. You wouldn't want to miss it.",
    "By all means, especially if you are so fortunate as to have Professor Kronman as your teacher.",
    "DS H&P is great. Sometimes the reading is too much but you learn how to skim. Other than that, you will love it.",
    "Absolutely. 100%. DS was awesome. I learned so much and am a much better reader, writer, and thinker thanks to DS. If you are interested in the humanities and\/or receiving a foundational liberal arts education, DS is for you. I highly, highly recommend it.",
    "Only with a lot of disclaimers -- i.e. that DS despite the way it markets itself is effectively six introductory-level\/survey type courses, and that experience depends to a great extent on professors, and that you can get away with not doing a lot of the reading and so ought to be disciplined with yourself.",
    "I would. HP contains some of the most influential works of the Western canon, and the teaching was incredible. DS isn't for everyone, but I loved it because I got to experience a steady series of truly great works, curated for me by leading experts in the fields.",
    "Yes, it is an informative and rigorous class worthy of the DS curriculum.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Stay in DS and take Spring HP, it's incredible!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in the thinking of the authors we read and the time period those authors lived in.",
    "I would recommend this course as an introduction to the history of political theory."
