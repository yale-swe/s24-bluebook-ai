   "comments": [
    "It was fascinating to get an insight into the thinking and decisionmaking process of one of the foremost foreign policy leaders of our area.",
    "Taking this course gave everyone insights on leadership in politics that cannot be learned from a textbook.",
    "This is a class like no other! Each seminar focuses on an American foreign policy issue that is highly topical and that is developing in real-time. Professor Kerry touches on not only the history of various issues, but also provides incredible insight into the diplomacy process (while sharing many personal stories along the way).",
    "tools of diplomacy and just how difgicult balancing the trade offs can be",
    "We talked a lot about the tools of diplomacy in this course. More than that, though, we learned from one of the most stellar and accomplished political leaders of our time. Furthermore, we benefitted from his incomparable network who also lent their insights to the class.",
    "Knowledge learned centered around the various countries and topics that we examined. Skills: Opt-ed writing, developing sound policy arguments Insights: The importance of relationship building, problem identification, diplomatic skills, global policy affects domestic policy and vice- versa.",
    "This class was absolutely phenomenal, I am so grateful to have participated. I learned so much from the Secretary, our guests and our peers. The conversations were incredible engaging and challenging.",
    "I think we developed a better sense of the challenge of statesmen to balance details and strategy. I had incredible exposure to both content (some of which were confidential details that shed light on the issues at hand) as well as thinking (through Secretary Kerry and guest lecturers strategic talks).",
    "All I will say is that the real wisdom came from the little anecdotes Sec. Kerry told, rather than the high-level theoretical conversations, because the former reveal actual cases, tactics, and fears, while theoretical conversationswhile great fodder for dinner party conversations laterdon't contribute much to the knowledge of students who, in all likelihood, already know the theoretical side of international relations and live and breathe it every day in the Jackson Institute."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course got better as the term went on. At first it was a lot of storytelling which could be fun, but I think the Secretary didn't realize that we were all starting from a similar baseline, so it felt like a lot of preaching to the choir. This aspect of the course, combined with the fact that we often had hours of discussion that felt like drum beating, meant that we didn't often get to the very controversial heart of whatever material we were covering that day.",
    "It would have been nice to have a little more dialogue amongst students, with Sec. Kerry facilitating. When he did that, the class was at its best.",
    "Secretary Kerry brings a lifetime of incredible experiences parallel to none. I think the class could have been improved by having a greater diversity of voices heard. The same students dominated the conversation, and this was not because other students did not want to speak. This was frustrating to many.",
    "I loved learning from such a revered diplomat--however, there was little time for discussion, or ways in which the policymaking tools mentioned could be applied in various contexts. Additionally, since we only touched on topics for one class, it was hard to get in-depth on any one issue.",
    "In spite of Sec Kerry's incredibly busy schedule, it was crystal clear to all of us that he still really prioritized the course and the students. In terms of weaknesses, I think it took a while for us students to get comfortable challenging the Sec Kerry on some of his assumptions. I don't know if that's avoidable in the future without the Secretary being very direct about this (which I think he was, but we were still reluctant). In terms of strengths, you get insights and stories that you simply cannot get anywhere else. No one else in the US possesses this kind of front line experience at all the highest levels of government and international institutions. I think it's impossible to strike the perfect balance between all of us learning from Sec Kerry's experience AND all of us participating to an optimal extent. I think it was rare that we as students managed to engage with one another and hear from him to a sufficient extent. Regardless, Sec Kerry brought together some of the best & brightest in the university (present company excluded) and thus facilitated great new, interdisciplinary relationships. I'm also really grateful for the feedback that I received from Sec Kerry on my Op-Ed -- any reflections or compliments from him are truly inspiring. I hope we do indeed get a few minutes to sit down with Sec Kerry one-on-one as promised to get a shred of personalized feedback and interaction with him.",
    "Strengths: Being able to hear from policy practitioners. Weaknesses: It would have been nice to engage with my classmates more during discussions. It also would have been nice to engage with Sec. Kerry, Frank, Katie, and Sona more throughout the course.",
    "I think the strengths are evident -- the chance to debate the most pressing issues of our time with a statesman like Kerry. The class was great, especially for an inaugural course. Some weaknesses might be that materials were sent out late on occasion and sometimes we didn't manage to dig into the depths as much as we would like to because we were balancing hearing lots of voices with the limited time.",
    "Strengths: great insights and stories from Sec. Kerry, incomparable access to the very people who influenced and continue to influence world events Weaknesses: needs office hours, more face time...otherwise, feels too 'detached'",
    "Strengths: The course covered not only analyses of current global issues but also methods of usage of diplomatic tools. The professors explanation about how he made decisions in diplomatic policymaking he had confronted in his career was thought-provoking. Weakness: The logistics of the course was not perfectly organized. The topic was changed two hours before a class, and the criteria of scoring of mid-term paper was explained after the submission. However, these weaknesses were tiny compared to the strengths. (Thats why Im scoring \"excellent\" to the course.)"

    "I think there is a learning curve to teaching, especially when a course takes students from so many different levels and schools at the university. The course has the potential to be a really good one in future.",
    "Yes. I am very glad I took this course.",
    "I would recommend this course, but I would also caution students to be prepared to talk and challenge the conversation.",
    "Absolutely! If you get in, you have to take it. The class is very diverse, which greatly enriches class discussions. You learn just as much from the other students in the class as you do from Professor Kerry.",
    "It's a great class if you are interested in hearing John Kerry speak about his experiences! It's a bit of a challenge if you are looking to learn about a specific skill or topic--the course is much more an overview.",
    "do take this class if you can get in This class really teaches you to think in a way most classes at Yale don't",
    "This course is unmissable.",

    "YES",
    "Yes, if they are interested in global affairs or see themselves wanting to work in diplomacy."
