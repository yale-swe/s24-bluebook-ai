    "I've never taken a language course before, so this class showed me new ways of using my brain and learning material.",

   "comments": [
    "This course was great. Learning Biblical Hebrew is super interesting and not that difficult. The hard part is remembering vocab and endings, but the endings are the same basically everything.",
    "The pace of this course was fast, especially considering that it uses a foreign alphabet. If the class consisted purely of inexperienced students, that would have been fine. However, in a class of seven there were multiple speakers of modern Hebrew and a graduate student in ancient languages who made it very hard to keep up with the curve.",
    "This class was great, but struggles because of the differing levels of experience coming in. It makes the class too slow for students wth some background in Hebrew or other similar languages, and makes it too fast for complete beginners. The teaching of this class, however, was excellent. Frequent testing was good and the homework was mostly manageable. Overall, an enjoyable class.",
    "I thought the organization, both in terms of how individual classes were run and the semester as a whole, was very well done. We got through a lot of material, but it never felt like we were moving too quickly. No particular weaknesses come to mind, I thought the course went very well overall."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you are willing to learn all the vocab. It's a little time consuming but it's not intensive work or anything.",
    "Be careful about speakers of modern Hebrew in the class. The vocabulary has not shifted enough for them to really belong in an L1 course",
    "If a student is interested in learning a new language, and is willing to dig fairly deeply in the grammar of a Semitic language, I would recommend this course. It would not be the right class for someone who is more interested in history or in simply reading the Bible in translation, because those are not the primary goals of the class. But for someone who was genuinely interested in learning Biblical Hebrew I would happily recommend this course."
