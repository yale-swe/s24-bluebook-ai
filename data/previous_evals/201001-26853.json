    "Take it, provided it's offered and Ian makes some changes to his teaching style and the course plan (i.e. less discussion of advance tonal theory and more teaching on the research METHODS involved in music research).",
    "This is a fun seminar. If you want to read a mixture of music cognition studies and articles about music theory, this is a good course for you. One of the highlights was being able to design and then run experiments, which is not something you get to do in many classes. I also especially liked being in a class with music theory graduate students.",
    "It's a fledgling class with a TON of potential. Start thinking about a research project ASAP, because you'll be more prepared and get more awesome data. Overall, it's a fairly light workload and figures to be an increasingly cool class.",
    "This course offered a lot of information on reading and understanding music cognition studies, understanding the current state of research on key-finding theories, and gave students an opportunity to run their own pilot studies."
