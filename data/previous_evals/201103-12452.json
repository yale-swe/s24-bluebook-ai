    "PHIL 178 is an introduction to the theory of a political society. I would absolute recommend this course as these are ideas that every educated person should be familiar with.",
    "if you want to continually hear people bring up \"babies in africa\" in any argument over morals then go ahead. and if you really want to read pretty dense philosophy, this is also the course for you. i'm kindof kidding, i did actually enjoy the class. if you get into the readings and really think about things the class can be really interesting, but if not you're just sitting there in lecture..wooohoo.",
    "I really enjoyed this course as an introduction to philosophy in general and political philosophy in particular. Discussion aspect of the lecture can be unproductive and frustrating at times, but overall this was a great way to learn how to talk\/write about philosophy.",
    "If you are taking this course to fulfill EPE requirements, then I would recommend the intro political philosophy courses in the following order:Ian Shapiro MoFoo=>Matthew Smith's intro=>Steven Smith introWhy this recommendation?These courses run a continuum from concentrating on particular authors to general classes of theories. Shapiro's course gives a good sense of how different theories interlock and respond to each other using particular authors as examples of the theories. Matthew Smith's course concentrates on particular authors, but tries to take an abstract argument out of them and Steven Smith's course goes waaay too deep into what particular authors think which is damaging to getting a sense of the wider theoretical field in which they write.That's my view.",
    "A wonderful class for *any* major. We covered a huge amount of material in a short semester- from Hobbes through Rawls.The grading can be tough, so it might be a good Credit\/D\/F.",
    "Take it. It's a good introduction to philosophical ideas regarding politics and societal structure and will teach you to think in syllogisms.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about a lot of political philosophers really quickly without too much depth. The reading is hard to keep up with, but you will get more out of the class if you do it.",
    "I am conflicted about Introductory Political Philosophy. On the one hand, it provided a valuable survey of a range of political philosophers. Yet the way \"lecture\" was conducted was, at times, painful. The class is an awkwardly sized ~35 kids, which means that it should be lecture format. While Professor Smith did lecture, he often engaged the class is discussion. This involved about 7 of the students BS'ing for large parts of class when all of the limited class time (50 mins\/2 times a week) should have been a lecture, a surprising class design given that students have both a required online forum and section to discuss the content. Given that this course in the philosophy department, the papers required formal argument reconstruction and discussion. I am definitely grateful for this skill, because if not for that I would definitely recommend taking basically the equivalent of this course in the political science department (PLSC 114). The grading is pretty brutal, and it seems they expect us all to know how to write a philosophy paper from the get go. Another frustrating part was that my TA graded my assignments, and it was hard to tell if one TA was more difficult than another or what.",
    "I would take it if you are interested in it. The reading is not too much and they aren't bad. Only 4 papers during the term and Smith is great.",
    "This class is great ! Its specifically better than the PLSC one because you have a) No final b) Better readings. Matthew Smith is truly phenomenal, he is engaging, strikes a good balance between discussion and summary of the text. Can't recommend this class enough.",
    "This class provides you with a comprehensive introduction to political philosophy. I found the ideas that we studied to be important and interesting and I think that, if you want to take a philosophy class for the first time (like I did), this is a good class to take. If you have already studied philosophy then this class may be a little bit repetitive. Professor Matthew Smith is also a great lecturer, so class will usually be interesting and fun.",
    "I signed up for this class by chance because I wanted to take a philosophy course, even though I have little interest in politics, and I loved it! Professor Smith knows a ton and is an engaging lecturer. I enjoyed that the class involved participation even though it was a [small]lecture. This was a fabulous course, the readings discussed topics that are really important to our understanding of ourselves as political beings, and the TF's were good too (better than most TFs are!).The workload is also good - manageable and fair - and it eases you into philosophical thinking with two 1-2 papers, then a 5-7 page paper, then a final 10+ page paper, with a consistent amount of readings throughout (not an insane amount, and more required on the weekends than during the week, which was SO nice).",
    "The material covered in this class is both awesome in and of itself and awesomely important. You will also grow as a philosopher and writer. That said, the class is dry; no one I know enjoyed the lecture after the first few days. Professor Smith is snarky. I believe he enjoys thinking of himself as a teacher, but he doesn't really enjoy teaching. This same class is offered in the political science department -- take that one.",
    "Yes; take it! You'll have to put in the work, but it's worth it.",
    "A good introductory philosophy class. The first paper is intimidating if you've never written a philosophy paper before, though. However, the TAs were quite helpful in this respect. I would recommend this class a lot because, all in all, it was very enjoyable. Professor Smith is such a good lecturer--very alive, very engaged with the text. Even if you don't do the reading, you should still go to lecture because of how interesting it is.",
    "Definitely take this course! Professor Smith is a fantastic lecturer, and also encourages discussion during lecture, which allows you to really engage with the texts. The course is a nice overview of many different philosophers. There are only four papers throughout the term (the first two of which are only 2 pages each), and reading load is also pretty light. My only complaint was that, while we were expected to write philosophical papers, not much emphasis was placed on philosophical writing, so you had to figure it out on your own or meet with your TA for guidance. Other than that, though, the course was really well taught.",
    "Overall this was a fantastic MUST TAKE course. I would encourage everyone to take it. And this is coming from a Junior who has never taken a philosophy course before. I loved every lecture. Professor Smith was incredibly well prepared and the lectures were always on point. Although it is technically a lecture course, the course was taught as a seminar. It was incredibly discussion based: class participation was greatly encouraged such that by the end of the semester I think mostly everyone spoke up multiple times. The debates in class were fascinating. It seemed like either everyone did the reading or his lectures were sufficient such that people were well informed and could think critically and intelligently on all the topics. Moreover, the syllabus was very reasonable. The reading was usually very reasonable and always interesting. The assignments were also great. Fun to do and I learned a lot from the reconstruction assignments in particular. This class really taught me how to think. As a non-philosophy major, this class has inspired me to take as many other philosophy courses as my schedule permits. Moreover, the sections were great. We had great discussions and my (Esther) was fantastic.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class; the course material is of course important\/relevant to anyone with some interest in politics or philosophy, and the professor makes lecture fascinating\/interactive\/accessible. My TA, Esther, was exceptionally friendly and helpful during meetings outside of class and in section. The teaching and opportunities for discussion will definitely make sitting through some of yourclassmates ramblings worthwhile (most people do have concise, relevant points. just not everyone)",
    "Yes. For philosophy majors.",
    "Political Philosopheris a great introductory class to explore politics and philosophy to a greater extent. Professor Matthew Smith bring enthusiasm and allows discussion in the class, though it's a lecture. The forum on classes v2 enables further exploration of concepts not thoroughly discussed in class.Though only consisting of four essays (two short, one midterm and one final) and 10 posts on the forum, there is much to be derived from this class. I was exposed to old philosophers such as Aristotle to new ones such as Rawls that I would never have followed or read the works of if not for this class.In addition, this works as a great interdisciplinary class, helping my writing as well as an exploration of Politics and Philosopher.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
    "It's a good class is you are interested enough to read everything on your own. You'll probably be one of a very few, though, which might dampen your spirit. As everything is essay based, you don't have to do all the readings. Matthew Smith is a good lecturer but shop Stephen as well- that class gets a writing credit.",
    "Interesting intro to political philosophy that emphasizes understanding and thinking critically about the text over grunt work.",
    "This class nearly killed me. Lectures were engaging but administrative work was pretty messy. Online readings often came out just one or two nights before the lectures they were supposed to be for. Papers overwhelmingly emphasized skills (argument reconstruction, objections, responses) rather than ideas. The workload and readings became much heavier towards the end. The final paper topic came out after Thanksgiving, so we had just over 2 weeks (the last week of class + reading week + part of finals week) to write it - much less time than we were led to believe we would have. If you want to learn about political philosophy rather than how to do philosophy, try MoFoPo or intro political philosophy in the political science department instead; otherwise, consider taking it credit\/D.",
    "This is definitely a great course taught by a phenomenal teacher. If you're at all interested in philosophy, you should probably take this since you get introduced to philosophers like Locke, Hobbes, Aristotle, Plato,, Rousseau, etc. The material gets a little dull at times but that's only if you aren't really into philosophy in the first place.",
    "PHIL 178 provides a good overview of the various political theorists and their theories. However, given the breadth of the syllabus, no one theory is discussed in any appreciable detail. We essentially spent about a week on each theory. This meant that I came out of the course familiar with many political theories, but not fully comfortable with any of them.",
    "I definitely definitely recommend this class.",
    "Philosophy 178 is an introduction to major political philosophies. It provides a taste of a lot of different texts, and involves a lot of discussion. It was a great course, Dr. Smith was fantastic, and while it doesn't have the time to provide a lot of depth or comparison between thinkers, it's a great intro."
