    "There is actually a lot of work. You will be assigned a paper and while you work on that, there will be other assignments.",

    "It is not an easy class and its a lot of work. But if you do it conscientiously you will definitely feel an improvement.",
    "It is a good class for what it tries to do, but I would recommend taking 120 instead if your goal is to become a better writer. I learned some about researching, but not much else",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. Not only did I improve immensly as a writer, but also enjoyed my time in class each day. Although it was a lot of work I liked doing it.",
    "If you'r taking 114 take it with Mr. Gibbons. He is one of the best english teachers i have ever had. I grew tremendously over the semester as a writer. This was defiantly my favorite class all semester because class was most of the time funny and interesting",
    "I would recommend it. It is necessary to learn how to be a college writer. There is a lot of writing and reading, but it is all worth it in the end.",
    "The class is a lot of work, especially towards the beginning, but the topics are interesting and you improve as a writer.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in improving their writing skills.",
    "Definitely recommend taking this course, it helped a lot with my writing"
