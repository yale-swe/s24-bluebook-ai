    "Yes, this class is a must for anyone willing to familiarize themselves with the current state of affairs of poverrty alleviation and policy design.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Absolutely! Must take if you luckily get a spot!",
    "This class is demanded, but worthwhile. The material that you learn is so applicable to so many careers. Be prepared to work and engage hard (this is not a class where you can just idly sit by and coast through without really engaging with the readings.) You will be held accountable for the material and if you work, you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "Great class to learn about the main principles in the field of poverty alleviation with a focus on middle and low income countries. Take it if interested in development economics and political aspect of poverty alleviation.",
    "I highly recommend! A lot of reading, but all of the reading is worth it. This class opened my mind to poverty in the developing world and the role that politics plays in everything over economics. The group projects were fun and really made you stay on top of researching and understanding the situation in your country. The final paper is very difficult but manageable if you plan it ahead of time with Prof. De La O - trust me, plan it ahead of time. Overall, take this course if you can. It's very much worth the time.",
    "Yes, you should absolutely take this class.",
    "Professor De La O is marvelous. She is simply the best. Brilliant, insightful, and--most importantly--expert at leading class discussion. This is an excellent class.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a great seminar and you'll learn a lot. I think that out of all of the classes that I've taken at Yale so far, this is my favorite."
