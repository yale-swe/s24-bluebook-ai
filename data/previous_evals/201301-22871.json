   "comments": [
    "This course is a great, but challenging way to begin the study of philosophy. It is ideal for a student who enjoys discussion-based learning and critical thinking. I would recommend it.",
    "I'm glad I did DS, but i think it's a bad program. It doesn't give you enough time to think seriously about anything.",
    "Spring Philosophy is an incredible narrative. The centerpiece of the course is three weeks on Kant, which (at least, in 2013) entailed Scott Edgar's two mind-blowing lectures on the Critique of Pure Reason. The reading list is reasonable (compared to H&P and Lit, anyway), the ideas gripping, and the lectures excellent. This is a seriously great course.As for the classes themselves: Professor North is a masterful pedagogue. He sometimes starts class with a ten minute mini-lecture, which really lays the groundwork for a focused and efficient conversation. He also likes to stop the discussion if he senses that people are a little tired, and split the class into small groups to discuss specific questions on the text - a great way to get reenergized and refocused. His two classes on Nietzsche were particularly good, so look forward to that.",
    "I liked this semester of philosophy a lot better than first semester, but that may have been just personal tastes. Paul North is a great section leader - genuinely thoughtful and intelligent, very friendly. He gives space for introspection. Definitely keep him.",
    "Second semester philosophy is really, really cool. The reading list is superb (if, like me, you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a huge fan of philosophy first semester, the spring authors will go a long way towards fixing that). You get to tackle some of the big problems in modern philosophy from all angles--it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot tougher than first semester but it absolutely pays off by the end. Professor North is a great section leader--very helpful and insightful.",
    "DS Philosophy seems predicated on the idea that by throwing an obscene volume of material at the student, at least some bits will stick. I think it's successful in that regard, and I think that the breadth of DS Philosophy is unlike anything else at Yale. You should, therefore, take it."
