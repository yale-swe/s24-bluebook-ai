    "Pretty interesting course. Got to see and do stuff like welding\/making brick walls that we don't get to do in studio. Wish I had taken it as earlier (sophomore\/freshman year) because it's easy, fun, and useful.Coursework is pretty light.",
    "A good opportunity to get your hands dirty. I'd recommend it to architecture students (not really anyone else)",
    "A solid course with emphasis on shop tools and processes. Core units include steel, wood, concrete, glass and insulation. Time was spent working with the first three in the shop; last two were restricted to lectures. Great field trips - materials database in NYC and an awesome foundry in NY state. This was Newton\/Rowley\/Dansby's first year teaching it. It can definitely be improved, and I think it will be, but overall I would recommend to anyone who plans to work in a woodshop or metalshop and wants to familiarize themselves with those spaces. The instructors are fantastic resources, so take advantage of your time with them!",
    "Do it, it'll learn ya, and the projects are much more enjoyable and low-stress than studio.",
    "This course focuses on a type of material each week, accompanied with a hands-on weekly assignment. The assignments typically aren't too time consuming (excluding the metal working assignment) and are a fun break from the strenuous studio work in the architecture major. There is a semester long precedent study assignment, where each student is asked to analyze a project and build models and drawings of it. The students focused on various things within their projects, such as strictly materials, parts of the building, or analysis of the project as a whole. I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in building\/construction materials and how they affect architectural designs. I would also recommend this course because of the hands-on nature of the assignments, which I found much more enjoyable than papers and tests. The professors were extremely helpful, and I felt more comfortable working in the architecture workshop while taking this course.",
    "Materials is a good course overall. You learn the basics of timber, brick and mortar, concrete, steel,and glass construction. There is an accompanying activity for each of the materials except glass. An example is making a steel beam by cutting a sheet in to pieces and welding them together. All the activities allow for creativity. In addition to the Friday lectures and lab, we took two field trips, one to a steel foundry and one to a materials library. They were both really cool and unique experiences. The main work load of the course is a precedent study which is due at the end of the course and consists of a model, any diagrams and drawings you want, and a brief presentation."
