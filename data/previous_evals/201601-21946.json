   "comments": [
    "An interesting course with a bunch of super cool guest lectures and a lot of cool readings and lectures. The grading is a tad subjective, but in terms of the quality of the course itself I would still recommend taking it.",
    "A course on genius...or...rather a course on genius figures. You'll learn a lot about really cool people! But concerning the actual nature of genius, you'll be left with more questions than answers",
    "The Nature of Genius is a socratic large seminar. It is very discussion based and participation is what makes the class what it is. Professor Wright does a great job at facilitating debates and asks insightful questions which make you think about geniuses in a whole new way. There are daily quizzes.",
    "Take this course depending on who your TA is. If you have Craig as your TA, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE, SERIOUSLY.",
    "Good survey class. I feel like I now know a lot of random trivia about Mozart, Beethoven, Newton etc. that might be nice at the dinner table. Work was moderate but very regular (probably why this class appeals to STEM majors and is mostly STEM majors). Professor Wright really cares about students and gets to know them all by name\/interests, which is what makes this class what it is. Grading is very fair compared to other writing classes.",
    "This class has some great things about it, but honestly is probably not worth the hit to your GPA (probably going to get a B range or A- grade). It's one of those courses where no matter how hard you work and how much you improve, the instructors will find small faults in your papers and dock off large amounts of points for it. For instance, the professor had fault with one sentence in my friend's paper (and no other negative comments!) and thereby gave him an 88. This whole semester I've been unable to understand what the TAs want from my papers because they don't give adequate feedback and simply take off large amounts of points. Not knowing what to expect in grading is honestly very frustrating. Aside from the problems in grading, the course is fine. Craig Wright is a very nice man and all the TA's are very pleasant\/engaging. We had some incredibly guest speakers come and speak with us (David Swensen, David Epstein, Susan Choi, Robert Hess). The Chess Grandmaster, Robert Hess, was the coolest! He played 3 of our students simultaneously, blind folded. Workload wise, there is a quiz every day on the readings (but you have the questions in advance, and he only asks a subset of 10 of them). The readings were interesting\/great but the quizzes were very annoying because the questions were so poorly formed for the most part. There are also 5 papers (4 2-3 page papers and one 2000 word final paper). Despite the length, you will spend a lot of time on the papers because the class is graded very harshly. It was definitely not a stress-free class at all for me and a lot of people I knew. Not sure if it was worth it in the end. I personally wish that the papers had better feedback, as some of the comments are ludicrous and almost all of them are matters of semantics or personal preference of the professor. What bothered me the most was that Craig literally slammed another one of my friends' papers (which was a good paper based on when I read it) for not being exactly the way Craig would have written it. His prompts are also horribly constructed (we had one 500-word paper where the prompt was 600 words...). Overall, the guest lectures\/class lectures are cool, but the academic-work component of the course is horribly broken.",
    "Great course. A very engaging lecture that operates more like a seminar. Work is manageable: weekly readings and daily quizzes, but the readings are interesting, not too long, and he gives you the quiz questions ahead of time. Craig Wright is a boss, and I highly suggest taking a course with him while he's still around.",
    "A great survey course! The course explores the lives of many individuals we consider geniuses. There were only 5 papers, which got progressively longer (but you get progressively more time to spend on them). The TAs are awesome, Professor Wright always brings in interesting guest speakers who provide insights into genius from their different fields. While you don't come to a nice, clean conclusion about what qualities all geniuses possess, the discussions are interesting and you'll definitely walk away with more information than you started the course with. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "I loved learning about historical geniuses and reading about different theories and ideas through the ages about genius, value, and success. Although this class doesn't require a lot of time, it was by no means easy for me. Although there are only about 5 short papers (all except the last are shorter than 1000 words) to write during the course, they are graded rather harshly! If you are a STEM major, that may make them very stressful and make it difficult to get good grades in this class. It found it more difficult than my other four STEM classes!",
    "I probably would not recommend this class to other students--the material can be interesting but it is mostly useless and not very relevant to life. The writing portion of the class seems a little bit arbitrarily graded without too much guidance. There are other classes that are writing credits that are probably more interesting, useful, and more helpful in terms of improving writing skills.",
    "Absolute scam of a class. More work than some of the hardest classes at Yale. With daily quizzes and assignments, it is reminiscent of an AP course in high school in which engagement is artificially breeded through a massive load of unnecessary busy work that distracts from the material at hand. While the class is on the study of genius, divergent thinking, and creativity, shockingly enough, it operates in such a confined, restricted, and convergent manner that doesn't allow students to deviate but rather stay on a tight schedule. Extremely hypocritical.The answers to subjective material are already decided ahead of time and if your opinions don't agree with the professor's, you are by default, wrong and will fail. It's a writing course but the TA's have absolutely no idea what writing is. The one thing excellent though are the guest speakers - some of them are brilliant and will make for an exciting lecture or two. Other than that, this is a waste of time, energy, and breathe. This class was designed as a joke class - you will come out with nothing but knowing some bad generalizations that were forced down your throat. One would find watching paint dry more productive. If you take this class you are the opposite of a genius.",
    "The grading for the essays might be harsher than you expect. I would look for other WR classes if you aren't really into the topic matter and just want the credit. The guest speakers are great though.",
    "Definitely. Professor Wright is engaging, entertaining and a pleasure to be in class with. All the guest speakers were wonderful and presented a wide range of highly interesting material. This is a straightforward WR with a low workload and a great professor. Must take.",
    "I thought this was an excellent course. I looked forward to going to class each day. The guest speakers were all quite interesting and Craig is a hoot. The quizzes sound annoying but they are pretty rudimentary.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is a very subject. As a WR, the amount of writing is very doable. It is mostly a discussion-based class, rather than a lecture, and we got to have some very good discussions about the subject of genius and the genius' role in society and why we idolize certain people and not others. The course was not especially difficult, and as long as you keep up with the reading the daily quizzes will be very manageable.",
    "This class was definitely interesting. Through exploring the different aspects of genius, many different subjects were brought up and various guests were brought in to talk about their field. The class was small enough to allow for class discussions but also big enough to allow for access to various perspectives, so the class was not only based on the curriculum the professor prepared but really flowed with the stream of thoughts from the students. Weekly quizzes and essays were not too hard to complete and was a nice class to complete the Hu\/Wr credit."
