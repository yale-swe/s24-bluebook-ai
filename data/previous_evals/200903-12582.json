    "Take it if you're alinguistics major who plans on graduating.",

    "For those linguistics majors looking to graduate, I would highly recommend LING 490 (it is a required course, after all). But beyond that, I have found the work I did this semester to be extremely valuable as we gradually narrowed the focus of our senior essays from the extremely broad to the extraordinarily specific.",
    "Obviously, you'll only be taking this class if you're required to do so. My perception is that the way the class is organized and run and what its goals are depend heavily on who is teaching it. If you take it with Raffaella Zanuttini, the work will, for the most part, be geared towards getting you a topic for you essay and moving you forward in the process of writing it, so the assignments are in your best interest and, therefore, the workload is not that bad."
