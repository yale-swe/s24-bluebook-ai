   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Miller is an incredibly passionate and engaging lecturer, and a caring professor, who was quick to learn all our names even though it is a lecture. He personal investment in the subject, and her deep experience in the subject, provided us insights that we otherwise never would have access to. The course covered a broad expanse of history and culture, and completely changed my understanding of humanity when learning about their architecture and society, and particularly their sacred rites.",
    "This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Well-organized, fascinating, fun, this course had it all. Professor Miller is a stellar lecturer and sincerely cares about the intellectual growth of her students. She even taught one of the course's sections. I've learned a ton of information about Precolumbian cultures, to the point where this might be one of the Yale courses I remember the most material from in a decade. However, if you're looking for an easy humanities credit, look elsewhere. Grading on the two essays is tough, and even though the quizzes are short, they require intensive studying.",
    "The class is a fantastic overview of cultures and civilizations that we rarely get the ability to interact with. Professor Miller is absolutely amazing and the material if done in conjunction with her readings will allow you to learn so many incredible and fascinating things about the cultures of the Americas.",
    "I summarize the class as a very interesting look into ancient architecture in the Americas. I have already recommended it to multiple people.",
    "Prof. Miller is a masterful lecturer (this is what got me to class at 9:25am twice a week). Take this class if only to hear her talk about a subject that she knows so much about. The course is a mixture of architecture and art history, with bits of urban studies, history and archeoastronomy thrown in. It's an amazing introduction to a region and period in time that most students don't have an opportunity to explore in their time at Yale. The readings are quite interesting (and not very long), and all of the sites covered in the survey are fascinating. By the end of the semester you have quite the travel itinerary of places you desperately want to see.",
    "I would definitely recommend a fellow student to take this course. Even if you think this subject is not of particular interest to you, the passion and interest that Professor Miller has for it is truly contagious. You come to find that pre-Columbian architecture is made up of much more than you thought, and you gain some real knowledge.",
    "Take this course! Whether you are a seasoned art history or architecture student, or a complete novice in either field, you'll enjoy it. Prof. Miller knows so much and her enthusiasm for the subject comes through in every lecture. It's also a great opportunity to learn about the history of the Americas, something I hadn't studied since my IB classes in high school. It is an \"early\" lecture, but I never missed a class because it was that interesting. Workload is manageable: weekly readings, two short papers, and three quizzes. The quizzes are extremely helpful in preparing for the final and very, very fair. You won't be blindsided. Our course was a fairly small lecture (~15 people) so we often had discussions during lecture (Prof. Miller definitely makes it interactive). Overall, a fantastic course -- highly recommended!",
    "I enjoyed learning more about the art, architecture, and cultures of the pre-Columbian Americas. The workload consisted of three quizzes, two short papers, and a final exam. The quizzes were often difficult to study for because they required memorizing a lot of facts that were often not presented in the handouts and lectures. If you take this, I would suggest giving yourself an extra day before the quiz to retrieve all the information before you start studying.",
    "If you are interested in Pre-Columbian Architecture in the slightest, you should take HSAR 202. This course provides a detailed introduction to the architecture of the peoples of South America and Mesoamerica. Professor Miller is a world-renown expert on the subject and her expertise and passion are conveyed in the lectures and sections. She will definitely keep you engaged, and you will come away from the course with quite a bit of knowledge on architecture and art history from this place and era. Even if you haven't taken an art history or architecture course before, everything is very accessible and Professor Miller provides a lot of help and support."
