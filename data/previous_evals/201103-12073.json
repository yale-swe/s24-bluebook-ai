   "comments": [
    "This class is basically like every other French literature class at Yale. Lots of reading with only brief discussions on the text. The amount of reading assigned was similar to the amount of reading that I had for my English classes and really took a long time to do. Prof Semk, however, is a great professor. It's easy to see that he really cares about the material and facilitates discussions really well.",
    "Take this class if you like French literature and theatre of the absurd. We analyze the plays as a class and talk about the ideas behind them. It's a laid-back atmosphere.",
    "It is not so much a literature class as a conversational class. Many students this semester had shockingly sub-par language skills to the detriment of class discussion. We tried to cram in far too many plays and thus only discussed each of them with the utmost superficiality. The \"short papers\" in the class were helpful, but the purpose of the final research paper is still not clear to me. The potential for the course is there. It just needs a massive amount of tweaking.",
    "This course takes you on a satisfying tour of 20th century French theatre, with a consistently engaging syllabus and writing assignments well-designed to let the student work independently with whatever from the course really interests him or her. Professor Semk is wonderful -- a nurturing and intelligent discussion leader, and an exacting but accessible paper grader. I'd gladly take any course taught by him.",
    "Don't take this class!",
    "This class is great for anyone interested in keeping up a high level of french, in more modern strains of philosophy, and in theater. There are lots of chances to think creatively.",
    "Yes, absolutely. For any theatre-minded Francophones, this course offers an opportunity to study theatre at Yale. The opportunity to read celebrated and oft-performed such as Anouilh's \"Antigone\" in the original French, supplemented by an in-depth classroom discussion, is an example of one opportunity. For the most part, students who take this class are all interested and\/or involved in all aspects theatre - this provides for a harmony of different voices contributing to different aspects of the literature.",
    "Absolutely. A great way to keep up and improve your French, and the plays on the syllabus are all fantastic. Plus, it is a pleasure to interact with and talk to Professor Semk.",
    "If you have a reasonable grasp on French, you should take it. The plays are complex but reading them is a quite rewarding experience.",
    "This is a thorough introduction to the main movements of early to mid 20th-century French theater (which happens to concentrate around World War II, as well as pre- and post-war). It covers neoclassicism, existentialism, and absurdism. If you want tobe familiar with Sartre, Ionesco, and Beckett, this is a good option. Be sure to note, though, that the emphasis is on theater of the absurd (which is closely related to theater of cruelty and existentialism). This is not a class on existentialism (Professor Semk makes this pretty clear on the first day). The class is not too difficult, but it's not an easy A either. Note that the class is composed mainly of theater majors and people with excellent French skills.",
    "This is a great course, especially given its wonderful curriculum. I loved the plays that we read, even when they went outside of my comfort zone. The reading is manageable and the size of each reading assignment really let me engage with the text to my satisfaction; I didn't feel like I needed to rush through it and therefore got much more out of it. The schedule for handing in essays did not work as well for me as a normal schedule does, however. Like most kids at Yale, I need an impending deadline to get myself to do an assignment, and so the system where essays where handed in on our own scheduled deadlines actually hurt me in the end, because I kept prioritizing them under other work that I had. In the end, I was still happy with my essays, but I put myself in a situation where Thanksgiving break was filled with essay writing (and I had to delay work on my final paper, too, because of this). This isn't Prof. Semk's fault by any means, but perhaps the course could give the student the option, at the beginning of the semester, of whether to hand in essays on a fixed schedule of deadlines or whether to hand them in whenever they want, and then hold the student to that decision. Even if this option seems redundant, having evenly spaced deadlines created by the instructor himself would have definitely helped me better get on the ball about writing them in time.",
    "This course is an introduction to French playwrights, plays, and theatrical movements of the 20th Century. I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in theatre and French literature. Class was always engaging, and class discussions were definitely a highlight of my week."
