    "A good class to take for neuro majors to fulfill the requirement if you are interested in genetics or statistics at all. If you want to do more hands-on research this won't help you that much, but it is pretty easy to stay on top of the material, and interesting.",
    "PSYC 260 is a great way to fulfill the research methods requirement for the Psych major, and I would recommend it for any Psych major or student who is interested in how psychology research works.",
    "I found this class really enjoyable! Although I took it for the psychology major requirement, I was quite surprised about how fascinating the material was and how much I learned throughout the class. Work load is reasonable, but make sure that everyone in your group for the final project contributes to group work--it can be really frustrating to work with people who don't really do anything.",
    "For a research methods course, pretty interesting, well-organized, and easy.",
    "Yes, I recommend this class. This is a pretty straightforward research methods class. The labs were fairly easy. Midterms were a bit tricky, and the final paper was long (around 20 pages) but very edifying experience. This class made me more interested into looking at the genetic basis of behavior and mental disorders.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "Relatively low course load. Sort of behavioral genetics focused so might've been a little more difficult than normal research methods. A decent amount of technical language used which got confusing sometimes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It isn't hard if you put in the work, and the work isn't bad.",
    "Yes if required for psych major, genetics is a pretty interesting topic but be prepared to keep yourself engaged in class, as the lectures themselves can be a bit boring."
