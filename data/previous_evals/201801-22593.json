   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot of cool things about how the adolescent brain is different from childhood and adulthood.",
    "I learned the basics of how adolescents differ from kids and adults, with a slight focus on neural differences.",
    "Comprehensive knowledge about the adolescent brain and it's development. Professor Casey is the leading scholar in this area, and her command of the literature is impeccable.",
    "Overview of the adolescent brain!",
    "I learned a lot about how the adolescent brain works, given certain environmental pressures.",
    "An understanding of adolescent development from a neurobiological, behavioral, social, and legal perspective",
    "I learned about the differences that distinguish the adolescent brain from a preadolescent's brain, a young adult brain, and an adult brain, and how these differences can inform our treatment of adolescents in the law and through clinical applications. I learned the neurobiology and neurocircuitry behind these differences. I found the specialized aspect of this course rewarding because we focused on one section of development of the human brain that all individuals undergo throughout their lifetimes.",
    "The adolescent brain is a fascintating concept!!",
    "Knowledge about specifics of adolescent brain.",
    "I learned a great deal about the adolescent brain, especially how it is distinct and different from both the child and adult brain.",
    "This course was a concise overview on the adolescent brain and key regions of the brain involved in decision making and self-control where adolescents are concerned. It was also great for understanding the generalizations of brain research when exploring the differences of the brain and maturity across childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood and adulthood. Dr. Casey also made sure to expose us to the practical applications for this line of work."

   "comments": [
    "This class is AWESOME! I think it has the perfect amount of workload and it super interesting.",
    "Slides were not very clear and Professor Casey's lectures are all over the place! However, she is really warm and welcoming and really tries to ensure that every student understands.",
    "all we did in class was review the assigned papers, and i don't think the debate was actually very helpful in contrast to the amount of preparation time we put into it",
    "Strengths: Relatively light workload, short lectures. Weaknesses: Same as the strengths. I felt like we could have covered a lot more material in this course, but instead we focused only on a small number of themes. I will note that this class is great as a fifth class.",
    "The foremost strength of the course is Professor Casey herself. Few professors in my four years at Yale have embodied her expertise and enthusiasm with commitment to get to know everyone in the class. I cannot recommend her strongly enough.",
    "One strength is that every class starts with a review of the last class and kind of ends with a summary of that days lecture. There are also two full length reviews to facilitate learning of the material.",
    "This course was wonderful! The debate was engaging and a great way for us to get more comfortable with each other and really take ownership of the material. BJ Casey is a compelling and authentic lecturer, not to mention a brilliant scientist and scholar.",
    "Great lecture, Prof. Casey is so knowledgeable and speaks very fluently about the subject material.",
    "Strengths: It was an engaging course in that Professor Casey encouraged us to ask questions and clarify on confusing topics, and I really liked how each class began with a review of the previous class's main ideas, and ended with a review of the main takeaways from the current class. Weaknesses: I would have appreciated more assignments throughout the semester to ensure that we're staying on top of the material. In addition, the course was too back-loaded--most of our assignments and exams all occurred toward the end of the course.",
    "The course dealt directly with primary literature and I really liked this. However, the lack of the availability of office hours directly with the professor (aside from right after class), the reliance on nearly exclusively the professor's published work, and the extremely short length of the exam were all pitfalls.",
    "I loved this course. I think its strengths are how much material we covered and how all the material ties together. I think the exams should have been longer, because so many points were at stake with each question. But I would definitely recommend this to my friends!",
    "The course is great.",
    "Strengths: interesting content, engaging lecturer, reasonable readings, interesting assignments (debate and paper). Weaknesses: lectures often moved very quickly and were sometimes confusing, no set office hours so it was difficult to get personalized help.",
    "The course has a very detailed outline and trajectory of what we are to learn over the course of the semester. The readings very well supplement the research and provide more depth to the topics which we learn mostly in conjunction with previous knowledge we are taught. I do think the debate could be better structured in terms of how we initially structure it. It can be difficult to perform such an organized functions with so many people without distinct roles."

   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! If you get in, you would have so much fun, even though the class meets at 9am. Professor Casey is so engaging and she actually cares about her students and their learning.",
    "yes for an easy science credit",
    "Maybe. If you are looking for a relatively easy neuroscience course, then yes.",
    "Yes! The material in this class is so interesting and its applications are compelling. Professor Casey is so good that she makes you excited for a 9 AM class, every time. One of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. The workload was manageable, subject matter interesting, and instruction dynamic.",
    "Yes! As a neuroscience major, this was a great course to fulfill one of the systems requirements. It was enjoyable and not a ton of work.",
    "Would highly recommend this class! BJ Casey is truly a giant in her field and this course gives a great overview of developmental neuroscience research on adolescence.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in the intersections between neuroscience and society\/law",
    "I would recommend this course to those who are interested in the neuroscience behind certain behaviors and trends that are characteristic of adolescents. It's a mixture between a lecture and seminar-style class in that it's big enough so the classes are taught in more of a lecture-based manner, but it's small enough so that we as students are willing to interject and ask questions throughout, which I appreciated.",
    "I would recommend this class to a neuroscience major or someone interested in juvenile justice. The course was relatively little work compared to my other NCSI courses but I felt like I did learn a significant amount about current adolescent neuroscience. However, prepare to be frustrated. Little feedback on the paper and exams was provided, and although the course is advertised to meet twice a week for 75 minute sessions, very little quality time was spent in the classroom.",
    "Yes, very interesting course!!",
    "Yes if they need a science credit.",
    "I would recommend this course, as BJ Casey is a great, friendly professors and the content is really interesting. Students should be aware though that readings and contents are often difficult to understand, so it can be a little stressful.",
    "This is a great course to have some kind of involvement with neuroscience if you are not super clinical neuroscience oriented. Having the base knowledge of The Human Brain is actually really helpful so I would recommend that you do actually take 160 first. Sometimes you can get in without it. BJ is awesome and definitely knows what she is talking about."
