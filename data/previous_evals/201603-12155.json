    "Learnt conversational Kiswahili Improved language\/ vocabulary memorisation skills",
    "I learned the basics of a new language in a way that was exponentially more naturally than the introductory spanish classes. While those spanish classes felt like I was one of many students going into a machine, Swahili was based so much on just talking with each other in the class and addressing grammatical issues and vocabulary as they arise. It was so much more fun that way as well.",
    "I learned about the language and the cultures from which the language comes. I reallly enjoyed learning the words and then using them so readily in our own lives and in understanding more about east Africa.",
    "I developed basic conversational skills in Swahili, and also a grasp of vocabulary and insight into East African culture."

    "Kiarie makes the class fun, exciting and natural. The only improvement I can suggest is making the exams a little less specific.. There were a few things we were tested on that we barely brushed on in class (such as the names of some really specific body parts).",
    "The course was strong in the way that our learning was encouraged and the amount that we tackled each day. I felt encouraged by my teacher and learned a lot from the fellow students. Each class ran a little bit long which sometimes made it hard to get to my next class.",
    "A strength of the course was the class time. It was very effective, and helpful in learning a lot of material in a short time. The question worksheets from the textbook were less helpful to me."
