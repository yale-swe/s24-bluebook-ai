    "As someone who dislikes math and is only taking this course to fulfill a major prerequisite, I did not enjoy this course and had a lot of difficulty with it. I would not recommend this course to another student who does not enjoy learning math, and I would recommend getting a QR tutor as soon as you discover that you are struggling.",
    "Hard course. You will have people who have just gotten 5's on the AP Calc AB test, so beware those of you new to calculus.",
    "Not really. I was in a different class at first and I would have failed if I had stayed in it. Having to play spin the wheel for the type of class you get isn't very comforting. Either I won't learn anything because I can't understand the teacher, or he\/she has a different agenda then others, or the 3\/4 finds its way to the only good teacher and wrecks the curve. If you don't know math like me you have to take it, but be prepared for the horror. You'll be face palming all day at the inability of the system to function properly.",
    "It is a very difficult class, do not take it unless you HAVE to.",
    "take it if you need to take other math classes...but for fun. i don't think so.",
    "No, it's a scam. It's hard, the problem sets suck, and it's stuff everyone has already learned. Unless you need Math 112 for your major, get a Qr elsewhere.",
    "Unless you have to, don't take this class.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but if you're pre-med and you have to start taking calculus, this would be your best bet.",
    "Math 112 deals with the fundamentals of derivatives and ingtegrals, which are essential building blocks for other courses.",
    "Mathematics 112 is a dull course that I would only recommend to someone who needs to take this class to fulfill a requirement."
