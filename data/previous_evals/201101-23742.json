    "I wouldn't take this class. There are better Spanish classes out there. I would take a class with Professor Barbara Safille though.",
    "Conversational Spanish did not really help my conversation skills. I feel like I was honestly better before I took this class. The way the class is structure is you do a reading for homework and then come in and discuss the reading, but it was very confining because our teacher seemed to feel pressured to have us understand\/get through lots of plot details\/facts, when in reality it would've been much more beneficial to just let conversation flow, even if we strayed from the actual article. We had 6 homeworks to turn in over the whole semester and 3 or 4 quizzes, and while they were very easy, we also got graded pretty harshly for grammatical errors, which is a little unfair because we weren't being instructed on grammar. The rest of our assignments were graded discussion panels, which were easy as long as you said 3 or 4 things during the discussion, overall participation grades, and two oral examinations. Barbara Safille is a good teacher to get, she gets really worked up if no one is talking or if people are late, but for the most part she's understanding and an easy grader. She gives A-'s on most things, and she'll also let you hand in homeworks a day or so late without repercussions.",
    "i'd recommend it as a nice spanish credit but not if they want something really exciting",
    "Light workload but still very rewarding!"
