    "Yes, if you want to learn about Italian operas and film with an awesome professor. You can expect your writing to improve because you will be practicing often with short 2 page responses due every week. However, don't expect your conversation to get much better, especially if the class is big. But that's a problem in almost every L5 class- not specific to this one. Definitely take it though! I'm really glad I did!",
    "Yes, a great way to keep up your Italian while exposing yourself to really fantastic works of opera and film. Not too demanding, and a lot of fun. A reasonable 5th class.",
    "I enjoyed the course; it's a fun\/interesting\/laid back way to keep up your Italian. It may not go deep enough for someone who wants to do really deep analysis of the films\/operas, but for me, it was a great way to be exposed to a crucial element of Italian culture. The final project at the end was fun. The workload is fine with about one movie and a 1-2 page paper per movie; there were exercises which never take long, but you could probably get away with not doing them.",
    "Take this class! It is a lovely romp through opera and popular film. And Risa will help you to improve your language to sound more naturally Italian.",
    "A great class if you like Italian and want to continue praticing the langauge while also getting to know Italian opera and film! The class is very easy-going, and works perfectly as a 5th class.",
    "Fun to see all the operas and films, although discussion rarely goes into more detail than character and plot analysis. Short writing assignments every week, you must give at least one presentation (on a topic of your choosing), and a final group project in which you make a short film.",
    "Take it if you want an easy class to keep connected to Italian and are interested in the topic. But not to advance your language skills thoroughly.",
    "Workload is manageable. It's pretty much just watching movies at writing an essay a week. You can't blowoff these essays though. Risa expects a lot from these. So you really need to put time into these."
