    "interesting stuff.",
    "This class was very interesting, well-structured and informative. Professor Girard's feedback was always very timely and helpful, and the assignments were enriching and thought-provoking. One thing that could further improve the class would be more occasions for student participation in class discussions.",
    "Yes. It is a good course for the French Major in particular. It isn't that much work, except for the essays and the final. You don't even have to prepare for each class, because we talk about topics unrelated to the course syllabus.",
    "YES.It was a great way to practice writing in French, since the professor allows you to submit drafts before submitting a final (for the first two papers).Also, it's not that much work; so it's a great class if you want to improve writing in French and get some cultural background of France in the 19th century.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 366 to a curious French student interested in exploring a different, graphic facet of French culture. Mme. Girard is knowledgeable, an incredible resource, and truly a joy to take class with.",
    "The material is great but class is quite boring. Just a heads up that at some points you'll want to pull your hair out counting the minutes left."
