    "WOW! Definitely take this course, especially with Daniel Abadi. Prof. Abadi is charismatic, funny, helpful, and super-smart, absolutely the best teacher I have ever had. On the last day of class he joked that this should be a required course for all Yalies, and I agree. The course is definitely not just intended for majors. In fact, if you want to major in CS you should probably skip this course and take 201 instead since 112 is a little too easy (and I didn't have any prior programming experience). The workload is VERY light, only eight problem sets, and all but one were pretty short. I probably would have appreciated more problem sets for more practice with Java. An excellent course, easy to get a good grade.",
    "A really good introductory course to Java and programming in general. Interesting material and problem sets, although they can be difficult to implement at times.",
    "If you've had programming, this class will either be really helpful or really easy, depending on your degree of previous exposure. If you haven't, it can be really hard...I found it quite difficult, personally, with absolutely no programming experience.",
    "Good and goos for you!",
    "I highly recommend this course if you want to learn how to think like a programmer and are interested in solving puzzles, because the psets are like little puzzles.",
    "The class is a lot of work. As the programming assignments become more complex it can be easy to fall behind. Make sure you have a genuine interest in learning code otherwise it is difficult to go far in this course.",
    "My best class this semester! Abadi is hilarious and a great professor, though be warned that he speaks pretty fast. I went to all the lectures not because I needed to, but because they were so entertaining. The workload was manageable, as long as you didn't start the problem sets the night before. There were 8 of them, and they got harder as the semester went by, but not necessarily longer. The midterm was fair.",
    "CPSCI112 is a very good class. I have done some calculator programming in the class, and I got lazy some times and didn't go to class and fell behind. Class could get boring sometimes but Professor Abadi does an amazing job at speaking a language that \"poets\" can understand and that doesn't bore prospective computer scientists, which is in my opinion the hardest part of his job. The TAs are excellent and cool :)",
    "It is a very interesting class which gives you useful knowledge for any career path. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "I took it because I thought I ought to know a bit about computers and it looks good on a resume. Beware: this class is full of nerds who have been doing this for the last four years of high school. They were constantly asking about using matrices and crap that we hadn't learned yet. The midterm was way harder than last years, and judging by last year's comments, midterm, and final, I think it used to be a bit gutty. Now it's harder. The first problem set takes about 10 minutes. The fifth one takes about 5 or 6 hours, the last one takes about 10 hours. They're given every week. It really sucks if you have a major project or test in another class, because you simply cannot devote your time to these long problem sets, which make up 50% of your grade. The professor is as good as you'll get for a computer course, but the subject matter is really boring. You won't learn much that you can actually use. Take it if you have to, but if you're just curious - this is a perfect time to use the credit\/D option.",
    "CPSC 112 is a decent course. The material is presented at a very slow pace, but that may be good for some students. I took it with no prior programming experience and found it to be pretty easy.You'll learn a decent amount of Java if you take this course. I haven't taken any other computer science courses, but I would recommend this course for anyone who would like to learn a little programming without a huge time commitment.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Very enjoyable",
    "CPSC 112 is a great introduction to programming for anyone with little to no knowledge of the subject. While the class is populated by lots of AP Comp Sci-ers seeking an easy A, it's not impossible to do well as a novice, and it's an incredibly useful and versatile subject to which to be exposed.",
    "An Awesome Class. I would highly recommend this class to someone new to programming and likes logical reasoning. The problem sets (worth half the grade) are like puzzles to solve and can be very fun (when you don't wait until the last minute). The tests were straight forward. It's the only class that I liked doing homework for. And Daniel Abadi is a great professor.",
    "Fantastic class, awesome professor\/TAs. I'd definitely recommend this course as a fun and useful way of satisfying a QR (much better than Econ which is easy but boring). Even if you're not planning on being a compsci major or have never studied compsci before, don't pass up the chance to take the class, it's so worth it (plus you might end up at Slifka's bagel brunch with Professor Abadi...best experience ever)!!!",
    "Yes. This course is very informative, a lot of fun, and not too much work. Knowing how to program is a very good skill to have. Seriously? No downsides at all to taking this course.",
    "I think the class is a successful introductory programming class, either for potential majors or for people looking for QR credit. I think the type of learning this class teaches you, and a basic familiarity with computers, is essential in almost any field. The class is also a lot of fun and the problem sets are fun and puzzle-like. Prof. Abadi is great and the TF's are really helpful. I definitely recommend.",
    "Take it! It's a fantastic course and you learn a good deal about programming in general. It also helps you hone your logic skills and teaches you about problem solving. I'm actually upset that this class is over, especially since Professor Abadi is fantastic. If Abadi teaches it, you MUST take it! Abadi is extremely intelligent, funny, personable, helpful, and just a fantastic teacher. The problem sets start off easy but get to be challenging. Read the book before you go to class; the schedule is on Classes v2 so follow it carefully. Overall this is a fantastic course, especially with Abadi, and I'd highly recommend it!",
    "As a freshman with barely any background in programming, this was a great class because it taught me the principles of logical reasoning. The concepts themselves weren't hard--the challenge was in figuring out how to apply old information in new ways. Being a lecture class , it is up to the students to find motivation. Luckily, Professor Abadi fun and quirky problem sets provided plenty incentive to do the work and learn.",
    "This course gives an overview of the basics of programming with Java, and each problem set builds on what we've learned in previous classes. Problem sets count for half of the grade, and there were only eight problem sets in the course. Problem sets took six to seven hours to complete, on average. Also, the exams were somewhat difficult and did not emphasize problem solving as heavily as the problem sets. In class, Professor Abadi came up with interesting examples and incorporated class participation to liven up the lectures, but the classes were only fairly interesting. The fun and satisfaction of doing the problem sets is by far the most enjoyable part of this course. Also, when I wrote code I felt instantly that I was learning a practical skill. I would definitely recommend this course because of the problem solving.",
    "This was a really great course, and I'd recommend it to everyone. I am not going to be a computer science major, but I still really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. Not only did I learn the bsics of programming, but I feel that this course has really sharpenned my logic and reasoning skills. For anyone who likes problem-solving and logic, this is a really great course.",
    "This is a great class! If you are at all interested in learning about programming, you should take this class. Professor Abadi teaches very well and uses fun examples. Even if you go into this class knowing nothing about programming, you'll be able to follow what's going on. By the end, you'll be able to do basic Java programming.",
    "If you like computers and have time to spend on problem set than I would recommend it",
    "Absolutely take this class, but only with Professor Abadi, the other professor who teaches this class is really boring. The programming in this class doesn't get too complicated, but the programs you write can do cool stuff despite their simplicity.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. If you like solving puzzles, then this course is perfect for you. Unlike other courses, when you are doing one of Prof Abadi's problem sets, you are having so much fun that it doesn't feel like work. If you decide to take this course, start on the problem sets early, because if you wait for the last minute, they might not be as enjoyable. Prof Abadi is adorable, clear, and really amusing. If you have any interest in programming, take this course!",
    "The class is a really good one. Professor Abadi is VERY excited about teaching programming, and his love for the subject is apparent. He always tries to use interesting examples to make the material stick and to keep everyone engaged. The TAs tend to be extremely helpful too, especially when you run into hurdles on problem sets.It's a well taught class considering the varied population who will take the class. People more sciency might find lectures a little boring\/slow on occasion, while people who are less sciency might find it hard to learn a totally new language like this. Still, I think Professor Abadi tends to keep the majority pretty happy. The class is worth a try, or a shop at the very least.My only complaints lie in the problem sets and the extra sessions that he has. The problem sets are sometimes rather varied in their difficulty level, and sometimes you will find that the time given for the assignment does not correlate well with the difficulty of the assignment. (You should try to give yourself two days to approach a problem set--one for trying to set the big ideas up, and one to work out all the bugs.)As for extra sessions, the sessions on outside topics are sometimes a little boring, and the reviews are sometimes rather unhelpful. My suggestion would be to go to the classes definitely (it helps in understanding, even if you feel bored sometimes), though the extra sessions, unless they change in style, can be skipped. (Unless you're reaaally into programming, or missed a class and need a quick catchup.)",
    "The problem sets were challenging, but not unreasonably hard. Some of the logic is tricky, especially if you don't think that way in the first place, but once you solve a problem set, it's one of the best feelings in the world. Take it if you want to challenge yourself in a fun way.",
    "This is a very challenging course if you are not a computer science\/programming\/QR person. I am not, but I am still glad I took the course. When everything is working, programming is a very satisfying experience, and it focuses on problem-solving more than theory unlike some logic QRs. However, there was at least one moment during each problem set when things got particularly difficult I thought about throwing my computer at a wall. Fortunately, I didn't and I think I survived the class with a solid grade and I learned a lot. This isn't an easy class; don't let the first problem set fool you. You will have to work hard. But I still think it is a worthwhile QR for non-math types such as myself.",
    "I would definitely recommend CPSC 112 to anyone. I think everyone should take this class to learn about programming. The problem sets are fun and not too difficulty, yet they certainly challenge you. Dr. Abadi is nice and an enjoyable lecturer, and the TAs are accessible.The class did a very thorough job teaching me about Java programming. Dr. Abadi is a great lecturer and brings interesting examples (such as sudokus, dating websites, or pizza delivery programs) to teach programming concepts. The textbook is extremely complementary to Dr. Abadi and does a great job explaining in detail some of the concepts that we go over in class. The problem sets start off easy and grow harder as the semester goes on, but they are extremely rewarding to finish. The class could have gone a little faster at points, but I still feel that I learned how to program well. The tests were also fair assessments of what we learned.Professor Abadi is a great lecturer. As noted above, he brings real examples to demonstrate concepts, which is helpful when trying to conceptualize how you can use a programming tool for something useful. He always reviews the previous class's material at the beginning of the new class which is helpful for the students to really learn the material. He is extremely nice and accessible throughout the semester, and it was really kind of him to bring Claire's cake at the end.The TAs are extremely helpful for this course. First of all, they run both great review and special sessions. More importantly, they are all extremely accessible by e-mail. If you e-mail a TA, you could expect an email back within the hour which was extremely helpful. Also, they all coordinate office hours really well so there was always plenty of office hours during weeks with problem sets.",
    "i would recommend this to anyone who wants a basic grasp of intro computer programming.",
    "I definitely recommend Comp Sci 112 to another student. For someone who doesn't know a thing about computers (referring to myself), I sure learned a lot. I mean, computers and I aren't the best of friends, but we're getting there. A warning: the problem sets get more and more difficult. So don't get too excited when you finish the first one in an hour or so (guilty). The last few took me over ten hours... But it was worth it.",
    "Learn the Java programming language pretty much by reading the book. The lectures aren't too useful. 2 exams and 8 long, sometimes incredibly frustrating problem sets. I actually really hated this class, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Also, do not take this class just for the QR credit, as there are much less painful alternatives.",
    "CPSC 112 is excellent class for those who have not had any prior experience with programming. The class starts from the very basics and eventually works up to more fundamental concepts. Professor Abadi is an excellent lecturer, and if you pay attention in class, you won't even need to touch your textbook, though I would recommend against that since the textbook itself is a very thorough resource. The problem sets can be very difficult and extremely frustrating at times. You will most likely suffer painfully through the problem sets, but they are satisfying experiences that will force you to think in a totally different way. Overall I would recommend this class, but beware, you will have to put in the work and suffer through excruciating problem sets. It is worth it though. I walked away learning so much in this class.",
    "A fascinating course, ultimately rewarding, but far from a gut-- expect to spend an hour or so on early problem sets, 4 or 5 hours on the ones in the middle of the term, and up to 6 or 7 on the last of the term. Won't be true for everyone, but not unrealistic.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. It's a must-take if you know nothing about programming. It teaches you a new way of thinking, it presents fun problem-solving tasks in problem sets, and the teaching is great if you take it with Professor Abadi.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. The class was amazing! Professor Abadi is awesome. He explains everything very well and makes the class a lot of fun. Programming is also just really fun. Basically the problem sets are just puzzles to do at home every week, so if you like puzzles then you'll love it.",
    "Make no mistake, this is a course all about JAVA. If you already know the concepts of arrays, inheritance, etc., and you know just a little bit of Java, I would recommend taking the next level instead.",
    "Absolutely worth taking no matter who you are. Professor Abadi is funny, entertaining, very bright, and very good at teaching. It will not take much time and you will learn all the basics of java. Practical and enjoyable. TAKE IT!",
    "This class was pretty manageable, and didn't move at too fast a pace. A good introduction to someone with no programming experience. Just be careful to stay on top of your homework assignments as some of the later ones are actually quite challenging and will need a lot more time to work on.",
    "The course is truly an introduction to basic programming questions. HOWEVER, it is also heavily centered on problem sets, which take a huge amount of time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it wholly.",
    "This is an excellent course to teach you basic programming and I would recommend it to everyone because of the importance of basic programming skills today. However, be warned that the problem sets are time consuming and frustrating at times, because this is the nature of programming.",
    "Absolutely-- take it. It requires a certain way of thinking, but once you get the hang of it the course is interesting and fun.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want a solid foundation in programming. It moves quickly for an intro course, so if you start out learning the fundamentals solidly then by the end you will feel like you have a solid grasp of the concepts you need to continue learning more advanced programming. It takes time, but it's worth it.",
    "Yes! First, you learn programming, which is an important skill in many disciplines. But also, it was straight up fun. It's the only class that actually got me wishing there were more problem sets. No joke. They can take a while, but if you're into logic puzzles they won't feel like work at all. They're not too hard, but challenging enough that you get a pleasurable little rush of satisfaction whenever you finish one. (just get started early so you don't have to stress about it - that really ruins the fun).Plus, Prof. Abadi is a wonderful teacher. He explains things clearly, and he always takes time to answer everyone's questions (and he has an adorable British accent, so that's a clear bonus).",
    "I seriously loved this course -- it may be my favorite course I've taken at Yale (and I'm a senior). The later problem sets take a while, but they're so fun that it doesn't feel like work. Also, definitely take it with Abadi -- he's absolutely great.",
    "No matter your major, CompSci 112 offers something for everyone. This course will teach you to think in an orderly, logical manner.You are probably saying to yourself, \"I go to Yale...I'm pretty sure I already think in an orderly, logical manner!\" You would of course be wrong.Take this class and discover why CompSci majors have the uncanny ability to use their unique knowledge base to make any other major scratch their head in baffled confusion.",
    "A very good class for anyone who wants to learn very basic programming.",
    "The class will provide an interesting survey of basic programming techniques. It is good for people with little or no programming experience, so long as they like to think logically. Take it with Professor Abadi \u0096 he makes lectures interesting and understandable.",
    "I would recommend it as an intro course. It's not too hard, the psets are pretty fun, a good break from other types of homework. There are alot of people who are more advanced programmers, which is kind of a drawback to the class.",
    "I would, but only if they are prepared to put in time and effort.",
    "Yeah, if you're interested in learning a but of programming, it's a fun class. Professor Abadi always manages to make it pretty interesting and relevant even if you're not a comp sci major. The problem sets to get quite a bit harder towards the end, which can be frustrating, so you might want to do it credit\/d if you're a non-major.",
    "Yes but i would warn them that it is a challenging class.",
    "Take this course. As a freshman, it's the only class I consistently looked forward to going to every morning.",
    "Yes!",
    "This class is a great introduction to programming and it is best suited to those completely new to it as one would be bored for most of the class if one has any programming experience. I would recommend this class to anyone interested because it is a lot of fun as well as stimulating.",
    "Worthwhile class.Outstanding professor.Interesting material.TAKE IT!",
    "A really well taught course. The TA's were extremely helpful as were the lectures. The textbook was easy to read so it was not hard to get a good background on the material; however, it is hard to stay on track in the class without going to lectures. It is not a hard course if you stay on top of your work. Problem sets get much harder at the end.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest but no experience in programming. It's not a time-sink or particularly difficult, but it doesn't feel trivial or boring the way that some easy courses can. Problem sets have a fun, quirky sense of humor and you're told the requirements and expectations for them clearly. Professor Abadi is an excellent lecturer, the TA's are approachable and helpful, and for a lecture course, class is lively and engaging.",
    "A wonderful class. If you enjoy doing logic puzzles and aren't too worried about learning anything practical, you should give this a serious look.",
    "If you're a humanities guy like me, take it credit-D. The curve is unforgiving and the assignments take way too long to finish them all.",
    "Great class, take it, if you don't plan on majoring in EE or ComSci",
    "If you have any interest in puzzles or problem solving, you'll probably like this course. I'm not a computer whiz by any means- I hadn't written a line of code before taking this course- but it's really interesting. You learn a language and try to figure out how to communicate with it by typing in different sentences until the computer does what you want, but you have to solve the mystery of how to use the different words to get the right outcome. Problem sets during the second half of the course can take many hours because you need to think very creatively to solve the problems, but it's so rewarding to finish. Since computers are basically omnipresent in today's society, knowing some aspects of programming is probably an essential skill, so I'd recommend the course because of that as well. Daniel Abadi is a great lecturer who writes fun programs and tells pretty good jokes. You might not go to lecture 3 times a week, but when you do end up going it's not an ordeal."
