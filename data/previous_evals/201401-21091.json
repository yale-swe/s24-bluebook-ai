    "Take this class. German is a great language and this a great class. There is a decent amount of work and you meet everyday but it is still great. Use it to fulfill your language requirement or just for fun. Definitely take this class, also Annika is great.",
    "If you took L1 German, you will obviously be looking into German L2. I would recommend the class because you will surprise yourself with how much you will learn, and the workload is quite manageable.",
    "As for the professor: Annika is a great teacher. She is rigorous, but I do believe I learned a lot with her, which is the sole purpose of taking a language in my opinion. She is very dedicated and a really nice person. I loved taking the class with her! Well, if you want credit for L1, you'll have to take it. So I don't think it matters too much if I recommend it or not. German L2 is a lot harder than L1 and, sometimes, it's really overwhelming. It's very time consuming and all of the weird constructions you're going to learn is going to be on the top of your head. The course is good, but I believe the tons of small little projects we have are not helpful in learning the material, because we usually have to use a lot of vocabulary that are above our level and don't practice the ones we're supposed to know. Also, we lack a lot of oral practice. I know that classes for other languages have a lot more practice with speaking the language than we have in German classes.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. Annika is a fabulous teacher and a wonderful person. She is also young, highly energetic, and quite funny. Annika made learning German enjoyable and fun, and she was incredibly good at teaching the language. If you have any choice of teacher for German 120, I cannot recommend Annika enough. I also cannot say enough good about our textbook, which had fantastic and clear explanations of grammar concepts and was a helpful reference all semester. Most of the material covered in German 120 is standard for a language class: you'll learn more vocabulary and more advanced grammar constructions. The content really pays off, though. By the end of the course, I felt like I knew the grammar for just about any sentence that might come up in a casual conversation. We also had units on German culture, which were especially enjoyable, and often included listening to German music and occasionally watching German movies. Grading for the class was fair and quite reasonable: just be sure to make a sincere effort on every assignment and double check any words or grammar you are uncertain about. The class has frequent online homework, which could be tedious at times, but was definitely helpful in hindsight. We were also required to post in an online discussion forum, where we conversed about various topics with each other and with students from a German high school. Posting three times every week could be a lot of work, but you'll get a ton of practice expressing yourself in German. The course's tests are quite reasonable as long as you study the material. One tip: most tests had a short essay section at the end (usually ten sentences), and I highly recommend practicing a ten sentence essay before the test, as it will make writing the actual essay *much* easier."
