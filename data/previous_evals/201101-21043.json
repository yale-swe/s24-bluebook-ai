   "comments": [
    "It was a great course for someone who already has a strong background in art or art history. You should be familiar with the jargon, so I would only recommend it to someone who is comfortable thinking and talking about art. I think it is especially good for art history students who have taken little to no studio classes-- for students with a studio art background it also gave good insights into art historical themes and contexts, but maybe was not quite so valuable as it was for the art history students.",
    "HSAR 577 is a great course to take if you want to understand \"sculpture\" and its historical, formal, and material formations.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It gives an excellent overview to a number of the themes and issues related to sculpture, particularly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The readings and discussion provide a useful set of tools with which to approach the study of sculpture in many contexts, and gives a good sense of areas scholarship has yet to address.I would recommend this course to art historians in many areas. It drew my attention to works I had never considered looking at before, and inspired me to continue to study works of sculpture. The course was heavily object based, and there were several field trips, which enriched our study."

   "comments": [
    "I took this course as a way of breaking into an understanding of a medium besides sculpture and I believe that it has prepared me to engage in conversations dealing with this medium.",
    "This course opened my eyes to a field of study I knew little about. I've only recently become interested in sculpture, but I think that it will form an important part of my work moving forward. There are a number of topics introduced by the readings and objects that I am eager to pursue further. I felt that the course gave me the tools to discuss and talk about sculpture in a number of contexts."
