   "comments": [
    "The material is the same as you might have covered in high school, but it's presented much more conceptually. You have to put work in to get a good grade.",
    "Lot of psets... keeps you busy. Take it with Lake Bookman if you can",
    "I would not personally recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend math 112 to another student unless they feel they do not need instruction in class to be able to succeed.",
    "Math 112 is definitely a challenge, however I would recommend math 112 to another student but I would not recommend taking Lake's class. I believe that the class would have been manageable with another instructor.",
    "Good intro calc course. Best for anyone looking for a simple calc course.",
    "MATH 112 is not as \"easy\" of a course as one might think but I definitely recommend taking it before MATH 115.",
    "The class has no lectures, and class time is filled with activity booklets\/discoveries to see how the topic being covered works. You work together in groups and get guidance from the teacher when needed. It's sort of a flipped classroom as you're expected to read the chapter before class and then come to class and apply what you learned. If you don't learn best this way then this class is not for you.",
    "I enjoyed the class, but it was quite difficult for me. I needed to put in a lot more effort in this course compared to my other ones.",
    "Math 112 is an excellent entry point to the way math is taught at Yale.",
    "Math 112 is a solid introduction to calculus. If, like me, you took a semester of calculus in high school, it can be tedious, especially in the first few weeks of class. The problem sets were usually not graded until right before the exams, so they weren't a great study aid. Fortunately all the grading was fair. It's a gateway class. If you're confident in your calculus level, move ahead, but the class gives a nice conceptual foundation for why calculus works.",
    "Basically the same as AP Calc AB but with harder problems and a little integration.",
    "Yes",
    "Be prepared to teach yourself most of the material.",
    "A very solid intro calculus course. It has a very good pace, manageable amount of work, deep and thorough explanation of every concept, and fair midterms (with good preparation practice tests). Can't think of any major weaknesses. Beware that you need a strong foundations in Algebra and Pre-Calculus, otherwise the course will be hard to you.",
    "Great course.",
    "Difficult for those without any knowledge of calculus. Very do-able for those who have it. Good way to fulfill a QR without too much stess."
