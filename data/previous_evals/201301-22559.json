   "comments": [
    "Yes Take it! You'll learn a lot and the class is very enjoyable. Had some very interesting discussions and Professor Hanson is awesome!",
    "This is a really great class--definitely recommended. Professor Hanson is great and the workload is very manageable; she helps a lot with the final paper and the reading responses are quick. The reading is also fairly light and in general interesting and not too laborious.",
    "Brilliant course! If you don't have previous knowledge of the region, then the reading is definitely necessary to be able to fully understand and participate in the discussion. The readings are thoughtful and well-chosen, but only the tip of the iceberg. South Asia is huge, but we spent most of the course on India and Pakistan. Which were fascinating! But you should know that you won't necessarily emerge from the course with a comprehensive knowledge of other countries in the region. However, Hanson knows a lot - go talk to her! She'll direct you to more resources.You'll get out of the course what you put into it. If you want to participate in discussion, do the readings, and go to office hours, you will learn an unbelievable amount and be a better thinker and writer. Or you can sit in class on Facebook and not really do the readings and participate intermittently. But that would be a waste of your time and your Yale education.",
    "If you can get in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 take this class. To be truthful, Professor Hanson is the best professor I have had the pleasure of taking a class with here so far. She is so very dedicated to her students and really just wants us to learn. And you will!",
    "I really liked this course, it's a great survey of India\/Pakistan with a touch of Afghanistan. If you're interested in South Asia more broadly, you won't get that here. Prof. Hanson is adorable and quite knowledgeable, she wasn't the most charismatic or incisive professor I've ever had, but she's a good lecturer (when she does lecture) and fantastic one-on-one. Really great readings throughout the semester, I would have done most of it for pleasure. Definitely recommend this class!",
    "We covered key issues and topics relating to South Asia, with a primary focus on Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. Each seminar meeting was dedicated to the discussion of a different topic. Professor Hanson is unbelievably sweet and friendly and runs the class in a laid back manner. She encourages discussion and everyone talks a lot! Definitely a fun and enjoyable time.",
    "RECOMMEND ABSOLUTELY.",
    "Definitely recommend it for those interested in south Asia, and contemporary political events in the region.",
    "take it if you wanna learn about south asia or are interested in it. work is manageable if youre smart about readings.",
    "Great class if you're interested in South Asia, even (or particularly!) if you don't have much of a background going in.",
    "Definitely, especially if you don't know much about the region and are ready to put in the work necessary to learn.",
    "It is one of the only classes I found that addresses regional dynamics and politics in South Asia.Yes I would recommend.",
    "Yes! Helps you better understand not only South Asia but also world politics in general! Professor Hanson is a really really good teacher who cares a lot about her students! Take it if you get in!",
    "I strongly recommend this class to both undergraduates as well as graduate students across any of the schools at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it! South Asia in World Politics provides a really interesting overview of a variety of issues in South Asia and their historical, political, and economic contexts. The class discussions were quite good and this is an increasingly important region of the world to understand."
