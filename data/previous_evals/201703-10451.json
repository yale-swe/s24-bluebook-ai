    "A little too broad, a few too many assignments and the class was a bit too long. I would rather have worked on fewer more \"real world\" assignments and then really pushed them to see how far they could go.",
    "I felt like this course was too similar to the prerequisite, Introductory Graphic Design. In addition, the time of this class (4 hours on a Friday afternoon), made it difficult to get many critiques per project. Also, as it is on a Friday, it is difficult to commit time to work on projects the few days before. If the class was during a Monday or Tuesday, or even twice a week, I feel like students would be more motivated to work on projects. Even though our class was small, it still felt like we fell behind schedule by the end of the semester.",
    "I really liked this course and was able to find ways to incorporate it into the creative process of my other courses. I think that there were a few too many projects. I would have liked longer time to get more in depth with the design. I liked all the mini in class assignments, it was a nice way of breaking up an otherwise really long class period each week. I think it could have been helpful to use a class period as a work session for a project in a similar way to get immediate feedback especially in the beginning."
