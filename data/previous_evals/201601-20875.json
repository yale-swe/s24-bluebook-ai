   "comments": [
    "Really excellent class is you are looking to read broadly on urbanism globally. The objective of the course - to read writing on cities and learn about functions of cities - is broad enough that the syllabus includes a diverse range of writers and topics, which makes for interesting class discussions. The workload is not unreasonable and generally interesting - allows you to focus on a topic of your choosing and explore it throughout the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The readings are super interesting and Prof. Reisz is an incredible seminar leader. It's a great time!",
    "YES I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in cities, literature, and is looking for a diverse and cool reading list.",
    "Would recommend for students with an intersection of interests in literature, writing, and city. Particularly enjoyed the weekly student presentations.",
    "The structure is something like, a long period of reading many vastly different sources, followed by a long period of researching and writing something of one's own. Reviewing the literature and then adding to it, so-to-speak, is a really rewarding way to learn. Great readings, and the assignments and class discussions are intuitive (it's all just things you're naturally thinking about anyway, put out on the table) so the workload feels very manageable. A great architecture elective, a great writing credit, and a great class in general.",
    "A survey of contemporary writers on urban spaces with an eye towards understanding the assumptions and ideologies that underpin writers' views. If you have little urbanism experience, especially if you're not familiar with the great Jane Jacobs \/ Lewis Mumford vs Robert Moses-type debates, I highly recommend."
