    "I'd recommend it if you want a class that feels a lot like high school, with a light but interesting reading load, and if you will enjoy writing a weekly essay. It's really not very much work to write a 4-6 page essay every week, so I wouldn't be concerned about the workload. Don't expect to be a fabulous writer by the end.",
    "I would 100% recommend English 120, especially with Professor Hopper. The readings are interesting, you are forced to write and edit a ton, and your writing will improve over the course of a semester. A fair warning, though: the grading is pretty strict (although your grade will probably improve over time). The in-class critiques and feedback you receive from Hopper are incredibly helpful.To sum it up: you get out of this class what you put into it.",
    "English 120 was definitely one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale (this coming from a science major). All of the essays are really enjoyable to write and give you an excuse to explore and write about topics that interest you. I much preferred writing these essays over extensive research papers. The readings are mostly interesting and fun to read as well. I improved my writing a lot. The weekly assignments are less daunting than they sound, as long as you give yourself enough time to spend on each essay. It's also a really nice change to write a full draft and then revise it based on feedback rather than simply submit an essay and never look at it again like in many other classes. I can't speak for any of the other teachers, but I think Professor Hopper was very good. She really lets you work with your own style voice, trying to guide you towards clearer and more powerful writing. She was also just incredibly sweet and fun to be in class with",
    "Yes. It is a lot of work but it makes your writing a lot better. Plus you become good friends with the kids in your class.",
    "I loved this class. I would definitely recommend it with Professor Hopper.",
    "Take this class! There's readings for every class, short essays (New Yorker-esque) that are interesting reads. Each week, 3 students have their essay drafts workshopped. The draft-revision process makes a huge difference because each version really counts, so you end up writing a great essay since you're forced to spend much time on each. Workshopping is extremely useful as your classmates give great feedback and it's good to see how others interpreted your work.",
    "Yes, especially if you need a writing credit!",
    "Yes, if you want to learn how to write well. Not only does this course teach you how to write, it also teaches you how to think and how to organize your thoughts\/emotions into something people actually want to read.",
    "Yes! Take this course, with Hopper or otherwise. It's a Yale classic and it lives up to the hype. Plan to spend a good amount of time writing and especially revising your work if you want to get the most out of this class. Hopper provides a 24-hour extension to students who see the writing tutors or partners, and since they're so helpful to begin with, this is really a win-win.",
    "Yes! It will develop you as a writer and is an excellent opportunity to dive into a kind of writing you may not have explored much before.",
    "A really great course that forces you to write and find your own voice while doing so. The readings vary by professor, but are extremely engaging (and short!), and it's a great opportunity to practice nonacademic writing. There is one paper (a draft or a revision) due each week, and pieces are workshopped and critiqued in and out of class. I was in Briallen Hopper's section and really enjoyed it-- we had a lot of enlightening in-class discussion and really interesting and varied readings. I would definitely recommend this course for any student who is interested in writing for a general audience or someone who wants to improve his or her writing skills.",
    "I would certainly not recommend this class. Class was boring and frequently pointless."
