    "This course is meant to be an introduction to the discipline of African American Studies. The readings on the syllabus are certainly great, but one should enter this class knowing that it is designed to give the student more questions than answers. It certainly did that for me. It can be difficult to put the disparate pieces of the syllabus together into a coherent whole. If you are really interested in African American Studies, and are not easily frustrated by lack of historical context or a syllabus with no real main themes, this would be a good class to take.",
    "Af-Am 110 is an introduction to the discipline of African American studies. It provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the works of African American writers, filmmakers, historians, academics, poets, musicians, and politicians (Obama). I would recommend this class to a student who would like to learn some snapshots of African American culture, though this will not provide a comprehensive examination of one particular area. The reading is extensive though the workload (two essays, midterm, and final paper) is manageable. Professor Alexander is not the most engaging lecturer though she provides a unique perspective based on her background."
