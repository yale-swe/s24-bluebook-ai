    "Great course. You learn a lot. It's not as hard as you think. Work load is only moderately high. Just make sure you don't fall behind as we covered a lot of tenses and other grammatical stuff every class!Tomalo! (take it)",
    "Spanish125 was great! I learned SO much Spanish but it was completely manageable as long as you stay on top of your work. Due to frequent assignments, quizzes, homework etc it is important that you work consistently. Homework doesn't take too long, about an hour every night. The class is graded fair but you do have to learn a lot for exams since there is a lot of material. Class is fun and time flies by really fast. Try and take the course with Maripaz Garcia - she is what makes the class so fantastic! She makes class fun and is very encouraging. If you are serious about learning Spanish you should take this class!",
    "The class is very work intensive but the amount you will learn will be ridiculous. You need to stay on top of your work but if you do it is manageable.",
    "I would recommend it, if you realize the HUGE time commitment and feel confident in your ability to learn languages quickly."
