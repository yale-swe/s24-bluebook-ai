   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class, whether or not you have a background in African American literature! It's a greatcollection of books that everyone should read at least once in their life, and Professor Stepto is so knowledgeable about the subject matter.",
    "take this course",
    "Really gives you a great sense of the themes of African American literature. Prof. Stepto's discussions are so much fun that even books I disliked while reading them became interesting. Prof. Stepto is a gem and this class is a must-take. The three papers are a very doable workload.",
    "This course is a look at major black authors and seminal works. Professor Stepto is an incredible teacher and a wellspring of knowledge.",
    "Take this class! So much good stuff without a ton of work - three six to eight page papers. Prof Stepto is amazing and cares about each student so much, it's really remarkable. A really memorable class. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You read some wonderful works in a variety of genres, and Professor Stepto is a very good person to become acquainted with. Not as rigorous as many other English classes, but a very positive atmosphere.",
    "I really enjoyed and learned a lot from this course \u0096 the first half especially not only exposed me to new literature but showed how that literature was connected to visual arts and music. Stepto is an insightful lecturer and shows you plenty of ways to dig into a perhaps unfamiliar tradition and into new works of literature, and the class was very engaged as well. Two cautions, though. One is that the class spends a lot of time reading aloud passages to be discussed. I thought this was enjoyable and helped us focus on passages before discussing them (especially when reading dramas), but others may differ. Second is that while Stepto certainly gives students opportunities to comment on passages, after about five comments he will always move the discussion on. If you are the sort of person who wants to dig in and spend twenty or thirty minutes in seminar debating an author\u0092s choice of words or theme, or untangling a passage, you may feel frustrated by this. If neither of these cautions applies to you, though, definitely consider this course.",
    "I loved this course. I learned a great deal, and Stepto has an unbelievable passion for the material. If the subject matter interests you, do not hesitate to take it.",
    "Very good English class taught by a good professor. Dont need to be an English\/AFAM major to take it. Workload is very manageable."
