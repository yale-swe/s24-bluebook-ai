    "History of Sexuality was not what I expected, but in the best way possible. I thought it was going to be solely around the idea of homosexuality versus heterosexuality. However, it was so much more than that. This course is very dynamic, and covers a large basis of topics in depth. You even get to choose (as a class) what you study for the last two weeks of class. If you have any interest in the topic, I'd highly recommend it.",
    "This is a solid introductory course which demonstrates what WGSS is really about. The topics were interesting and definitely different than most of us, as recent high school grads, have experienced. However, the discussions started out very interesting, but gradually became more dry and seemed to drag. Maybe this was because a good amount of the students were pretty introverted, which isn't great for a small-ish seminar. All of that being said, am I glad that I took the course? Eh, I could take it or leave it. I think that I was let down because the previous evaluations were so laudatory.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in a nice, thought-provoking discussion based seminar",
    "History of Sexuality is an amazing course! I definitely recommend that a fellow student take this class. The readings are amazing. It is a freshman seminar, and it consists of about twenty freshman and the professor sitting around a roundtable discussing our thoughts about the reading. It is a very intuitive and student-driven environment and I really loved it! Take this class!",
    "I definitely would!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Most of the readings are very fascinating. This is the class for those looking for an easy writing credit. You write three 5-8 page papers in this class. The professor is very helpful if you want to meet with her to talk about your paper at any stage in the writing.",
    "Highly recommend! Take this class! It basically goes through the scientific literature on sexuality. It made me want to major in WGSS. The readings and discussions are great. It's more reading than I was expecting, but almost all of it is interesting.",
    "Interesting readings, thoughtful professor, but be careful of who else is in your class-- if the people seem reticent to talk\/awkward, this may not be worth taking. This class had potential to be amazing, but unfortunately turned out to be just average, largely due to the lack of participation in discussions.",
    "A great class with interesting topics every week and a very manageable workload. Trumpler is a great professor and always willing to look at drafts and outlines and give feedback.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. I feel quite lucky to have taken it as a freshman, since now I feel that I have a background in WGSS and I might be able to explore certain topics in depth now."
