    "A great class! Fun assignments, a great field trip to the met, and very interesting discussions.",
    "A comprehensive overview of the history of the art museum--its inception, political ideologies, and various implementations around the world. I would definitely recommend this course to History of Art majors, and anyone remotely interested in the museum field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar to anyone interested in art history and in the politics and theories behind cultural institutions and practices. It was fascinating-- hands down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely recommended for art and art history majors. Probably recommended to other humanities majors with an interest in how institutions reflect and shape social and cultural behavior.",
    "This class was really fun and very relevant to art history majors or anyone interested in art. It examines the different ways museums evolved from cabinets of curiosity to structured institutions. The readings are really interesting and the discussions are great. After discussing museums and critiquing the many ways museums shape knowledge, the final project of creating an exhibit plan is an incredible exercise in trying to figure out how to do things right, which is really effective.",
    "The premise for the class sounds amazing -- an anthropological study of the art museum. However, I was disappointed. The class was disjointed in curriculum, and the assignments were not related to our readings. The professor was not accessible to students and seemed to grade arbitrarily.",
    "If you are interested in the great museums of the world, how artwork should be displayed, and anything related to history of public institutions, you should take this class. Do not feel like it is exclusively for art history students; it\u0092s not. I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience, from the paper topics to the final project (you get to design your own exhibition!) to our field trips (we went to the MET!) to Professor Barringer and his incredible dedication to us as students. I give this class my highest recommendation.",
    "Everyone should take this class. It offers a great framework for understanding how culture and cultural history have been presented and filtered through the ages.",
    "Yes and No. It was easy, which was nice, and Barringer is a cool guy, but it was not an especially rewarding class. It was a lovely senior seminar, but make it your fifth class, not something you should expect to get THAT much out of. There are a lot a lot of readings, but you can skim. Unfortunately what makes the class so good is Barringer, and because he does do most of the talking, you don't really need the readings because he will make sure you know his opinions on the matter. I would have liked to see more debate, but it was a very calm course in regards to most anything. I am happy enough I took it, but I probably wouldn't do it again. It also taints museum visiting even more than a normal art history course...frightening."
