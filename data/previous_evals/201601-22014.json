    "This class was fun to go to, but was the type of class more interesting to listen to than to study for.",
    "Strongly recommend. This course won't fundamentally change your understanding of the Revolution, but it's a really interesting way to review early American history, particularly if you've never studied it or barely remember what you did study in middle\/high school. Overall a really interesting course that, despite its shortcomings (seldom discussing non-white narratives in lecture), very well presented the Founding generation. Very solid course.",
    "If you have any interest in early American history, take this class! Professor Freeman is amazing. She makes history interesting and engaging. The assignments are definitely manageable. All around a great history lecture.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. I would summarize it as a fun, not-too-challenging course with incredible lectures. You can really get as much out of it as you want. It's the kind of course that you can take Credit\/D and just enjoy the ride, or you can give it your best work and really interact closely with the time period, historiography, and the primary documents.",
    "This class is great! You learn much more about the American Revolution and early American politics than you did in high school. Also, the readings are great and Professor Freeman is FANTASTIC! Would recommend highly, especially good way to get your preindustrial history credit.",
    "This class was really amazing, it was like watching a History Channel documentary every Tuesday and Thursday. I found the midterm pretty tricky, though, and I wish I had studied specific names from the readings more carefully. If you plan to take this class, you need to get the gist of EVERY reading (it's not that bad, just make sure you know the people, events, historical significance). The first \"creative essay\" was graded harder than I had expected, but after I got into more contact with my TA the next essay was much more straightforward. So go to office hours for papers! Also, this class has a TON of reading, which got to be very stressful along with my other reading-heavy classes. Even though the course is fun and rewarding, and Professor Freeman and the TA's were excellent, the class isn't necessarily easy and I'd recommend taking it seriously and studying the readings\/lectures thoroughly.",
    "This is not just the same old story about Lexington and Concord, Crossing the Delaware, and signing the Constitution, as Professor Freeman makes clear in her first lecture. You will learn how people thought and what struggles and mistakes the founders faced or made (because they are people just like us), and it will be supplemented with some fun off-topic trivia. In short, you will get a deeper and more intimate understanding of the Revolution and how it affected all involved. Professor Freeman is a great lecturer, and while the reading could be a lot for someone not used to 150\/200+ pages a week, the workload is actually not too heavy. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "American Revolution is a wonderful class made even more wonderful by Professor Freeman. She's an incredibly animated professor and loves to tell quirky (yet relevant) stories about everyday life back in the age of the revolution. It's a pretty standard history course otherwise, with no big surprises or deviations from the typical run of things. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone even marginally interested in the subject!",
    "I would recommend this class to any Yale student.",
    "Good course, not too hard, some interesting reading. The lectures posted online are extremely useful for studying.",
    "Good fourth class",
    "A really in-depth look at the themes and ideas of the Revolution.",
    "An incredible history course that is a good fit for non-history majors as as well as history majors. It goes beyond AP US history by examining the role that women, Native Americans and African Americans played in the revolution and focusing on the actions of \"ordinary people\" rather than just the political elite.",
    "I would definitely recommend HIST 116 - Professor Freeman is awesome. It will really change how you think about the revolutionary era, and Professor Freeman has both amazing anecdotes and stories, and a huge amount of knowledge. I'd recommend taking it!",
    "TAKE IT. (Esp if you love Hamilton... so many Hamilton jokes.) But for real Prof Freeman is incredible and the lectures are so much fun and the readings are manageable. Take it!!!",
    "Take it, take it, take it.",
    "History 116 gave an effective overview of the revolutionary period through the end of the Constitutional Convention. Professor Freeman's lectures were entertaining and informative and are characterized especially by regular use of primary source documentation. The reading list provided enjoyable material that reinforced and expanded upon in-class subjects, and section meetings were always productive in addressing historical events and analyzing the historiographical interpretations of second source documents from the reading list. I would certainly recommend this course to other Yalies concerned with developing a factual and critical understanding of the revolutionary period.",
    "HIST 116 01 is basically like listening to a series of American Revolution stories that revolve around larger themes. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested because the entire class (lecture and section) has a friendly vibe, and there are a lot of funny anecdotes to be heard.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! As someone who only attends class when attendance is taken (and it is not in this lecture), it means a lot coming from me to say that the ONLY time I missed this class was when I passed out after giving blood---and I was SO upset! Professor Freeman is AMAZING, she is so inspirational, charming, and witty. The TA's are great and I just LOVED this class. The workload is low, and in general I just want to stress how much I LOVE this class!",
    "Yes, I would! I would add the caveat though that you probably should be pretty interested in the Revolution too, which seems like an obvious thing, but I guess I didn't think too much about. I took it mostly because I liked Professor Freeman, but I was a little less interested in the revolution which made the paper kind of hard to get motivated for.",
    "Yes yes yes! Professor Freeman is an absolute gem, and she makes class so interesting. Don't think that this class will just be a repeat of AP US (like I did during shopping period) because it's so much more than that. If you have an interest in cultural history, early modern America, the relationship between Americans and the British, or of course the American Revolution itself, then this is the course for you. It can sometimes be somewhat heavy on reading, but I never found the assessments to be unreasonable. Professor Freeman knows what students want out of a class, and she provides it incredibly well!",
    "Everyone should take this course even if they are not history majors! It is a great course with a great professor!",
    "The American Revolution was an amazing classone of the best I have taken at Yale. While I had studied the American Revolution in high school, this course added depth, color, and nuance to my understanding of our countrys founding period. The lectures were terrific, the reading was engaging, and the written assignments\/exams (2 papers, 2 exams) were enjoyable and fair. In addition, Professor Freeman was a magnificent lecturer. Her command of the material, genuine humor and enthusiasm, and gifts as a communicator made for a winning combination. Her passion for the subject was simply infectious. In sum, a highly, highly recommended course!"
