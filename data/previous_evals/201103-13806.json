    "yes.",

    "At times we desperately needed a digital storage space that could be accessed from the forestry school and architecture school (not to mention public health, law and undergrad). There are free storage options online but the capapcity is too limited for graphic work. Perhaps classes V2 could be expanded to provide shared storage for students?"
