    "english 114 starts off as censorship of porn and continues that way for quite a bit and then goes off into more of just issues with censorship. its a really fun class because it is such a current and relevant topic. the papers are graded more than fairly and robinson makes the class funny",
    "This is a good course with moderate workload (4 papers no final exam). The theme of my English 114 class was Censorship and the Arts. This is a good topic, but it can and does get dry and dull by the end of the semester. Timothy Robinson is a chill teacher and doesn't call you out of you don't do the reading\/homework. There are 4 papers. The first paper is an analysis of 2 supreme court cases. This paper is a tough and reading the supreme court cases isn't easy. The second paper is to write about an example of censorship that you've witnessed or been subjected to in your lifetime. I wrote about being in China and not being able to use Facebook for example. The third paper is a research paper about a historical case of censorship. And the last paper is an Op-Ed style paper about your opinion on a case of censorship...The topic does get stretched a lot and can be repetitive. The papers are about 1,500 words. This is a good class, but if you are confidant in your writing before coming to Yale, you should be completely fine not taking this class. On the other hand, I felt that my writing improved by taking this class, especially developing an original and contestable thesis.",
    "English 114 with Dr. Robinson (Censorship and the Arts) was an excellent way to transition from the restricted high school writing to the freer college writing. Dr. Robinson is a really nice person with an amazing life story if you get to know him. Talk to him after class and make sure to correct your rough draft after he's looked at it and ask for his opinion before turning in your final draft. It'll help your grade and your writing a lot. Try to keep your section talking, because if you're a silent group, Dr. Robinson feels forced to fill up the silence, and he will definitely do so. The topic of censorship is very interesting. Some people said it was only a 2-paper topic, but there's definitely a ton of material on censorship. I found that while I had never really thought about censorship, I had found my opinion on the subject by the end of the course. The readings are all interesting, though some are rather long. Dr. Robinson hits you hard with cour case readings in the beginning, but the other texts are easier.",
    "Interesting topic. Good teacher. Lots of freedom to choose paper topics.",
    "I would recommend this class. You usually read and article or Supreme Court case for class and then we discuss it. Timothy Robinson talks a lot but he welcomes all discussion. You write 4 papers but they aren't too bad and the grading is fair. He also goes over writing skills which is very helpful. My writing greatly improved through this classI would definitely recommend this section.",
    "Yes if you want to learn how to write practically. If you want to write for enjoyment don't do it, but if you want to be a good communicator of ideas, do it."
