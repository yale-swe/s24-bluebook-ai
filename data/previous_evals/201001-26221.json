   "comments": [
    "This course requires participation during every class. While it is nice to encourage students to get involved it results in many students simply restating other student's comments and only superficially addressing topics.",
    "This was a good course. Possibly too large of a number of students for the discussion style of the class (perhaps seperate discussion sections would help?)",
    "Good course, but much too similar to Ickovics' class in the fall. Also, the participation component was not conducive to the size of the class and it inhibited learning (because topics jumped around so much and prevented the instructor from completing the lecture) rather than enhancing it. If she wants to have a discussion component, she should follow Ickovics' format of lecture on one day and then smaller discussion groups at another time. However, if that were done, lectures should only be an hour or an hour and twenty minutes.",
    "I could understand how this course design would be appropriate for a class of 10 people (especially the heavy reliance on discussion), but with more students in the class the format was a disaster. There was too much pressure to speak about the first thing that came to mind, and no opportunity for direct response and engaged discussion because everyone was scrambling to get a word in. As this is one of the required core courses, I think that the format of this class needs to drastically be rethought. I felt like I didn't learn anything because there was too much irrelevant discussion, mainly because we felt like we had to say something to get points.",
    "I really like the class, but didnt like the fact that there were so many students in a discussion based class. If discussion is the focus, there should be smaller groups. If class size cannot be capped to make it smaller, there should be less focus on participation (40% of grade) and discussion. Everyone was scrambline to participate and it make for a poorer experience in the class if it were smaller.",
    "Overall assessment:The structure of the class was difficult given the number of students. Although full participation was required and expected, it was difficult to actively participate in a valuable discussion. Instead the class seemed a bit disorganized and disjointed. The topics jumped around and random opinions and thoughts were shared. It made it hard to focus and pay attention in class.Strengths:- TopicsWeaknesses:- Lack of organization- Quality of discussion in some classes- Disorganization of topics*** Assignments!!The assignments were viewed as \"busy work\" for most students, including myself.",
    "Please read the evaluation of the instructor.",
    "Weaknesses:- Dr. Lewis does not provide ANY feedback for ANY of the assignments.- The assignments themselves are 8th-grade level reading comprehension assignments, not graduate-level analytical assignments (name the independent variable, name the dependent variable, what was their research question)- Class discussions are not discussions; students just raise their hands for participation points, which are allocated in an elementary school way (1 point for every comment you make, 2 points for every good one, with the total summed)- Dr. Lewis stopped preparing lectures for the final classesStrengths:- Met once a week",
    "The course was interesting and added value to my public health experience. I just wish we got a little more guidance on our assignments (all other professors provide a written description of the assignment for good reason) and feedback on what we hand in.",
    "See below.",
    "class participation much too heavily weighted for a course with 40+ students. Impossible to participate in every lecture.",
    "I found that the class was too big for the participation style that was required. During the discussion period everyone was expected to speak at least once and it felt like people were throwing up their hands to get participation points but were not engaging with each other comments. In addition to the large numbers, the set up of the room was a hinderance that was pretty much out of the professors control. However, I would have still recommended pushing the tables around so that at least some people were looking at each other.Would have preferred more open ended response papers, the weeks that there were prompts they felt rather elementary and would have preferred to go deeper with the readings. The weekly assignments from the intro SBS class would provide a good example.I would recommend breaking into discussion sections following the lecture if there is a group this big again in the future.Would have liked to have had weekly response papers returned.",
    "This course could have been so interesting, but it really fell short. The forced participation made the class into mad house of the same people trying to put in their two cents. Although so class participation is good, I don't care what my classmates think about the subject, I want the instructor to conduct the class and then the class to discuss what they think of the subject. The way to course was made only works in small classes, which this was not.",
    "Strengths: it covers a wide spectrum of topics.Main weakness is too much emphasis on class participation. The instructor explained that students will not get any point(s) for participation even though they were present in class but did not speak up. Does that mean that there is no difference between students who were absent and students who were present? Surely, students who were present learned from listening to lecture, taking notes and contributions from other students. This is totally missing for students who were absent. Thus, giving the same score to both absent and silently present students sounds very flabbergasting to the point of absurdity.Given the 3-point scoring for every session. Award 1 point for attendance, 2 points for contributing, 3 points for outstanding contribution. It is crucial to reward attendance and more importantly distinguish those present and not.Overall points awarded to class participation is also over done. In the beginning there was a whopping 40% awarded to just speaking up in class. That was toned down to 20% that I still think is too much. First this is a large class with many more over-zealous students than there are opportunities to contribute. I remember raising my hands on 2 separate sessions but never get called upon to speak. Given my presence in class and eagerness to speak, I can't imagine myself scoring zero for participation and being lumped together with those who were blatantly absent.More emphasis should be placed on the weekly writing assignments instead, with 30% given to it and 10% given to class participation. I argue that writing is more effortful and the scoring should reflect that.I also wished that we were given feedback for our weekly assignment. Tremendous efforts were made to write them. Shouldn't some effort be made to give us feedback?Another suggestion is to include a more international perspective, at least to mirror the international make-up of the class. Little or no knowledge as confessed by the instructor, while empathized, is not a good reason for not doing so.If the content of the course focused predominantly on the American Context, this information could be made known in the title (e.g. Psychosocial and Behav Epi in North America) or at least made known in the course description. Had I known that the international perspective was lacking I may have re-considered taking this course.",
    "The class was too big for participation and discussion.",
    "Very informative and interactive. 40% of grade based on participation seemed high for a large class.",
    "I really appreciated learning about the various scales. So many times we read epi articles and never really consider the importance of the scales, their validities, and pro's and con's of various measurements. This more than any other aspect of the class will be useful in informing my own future research projects.I was very frustrated by the mandated participation. I felt that in a class that size it was very difficult to contribute a meaningful comment that followed the flow of discussion and was relevant to the week's reading. This would work in a smaller course but not in one with 40 students!",
    "Weakness--too much emphasis on participation.Strengths--good number of weekly readings.",
    "The class requires students to speak every class which, in a class of 40 students, is not really conducive to good discussion. Modifying the participation requirement (i.e. place limits on how many times people can speak, better moderation) would really improve the quality of discussion.",
    "I thought this was a good course.",
    "strengths: good topicsweaknesses: having to talk in class is one of the worst ideas. people said things that were totally irrelevant just to say something. it gave me anxiety to come up with something to say because our grade was so focused on in class conversation. the class was too large for that format.",
    "The class was good in providing an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding psychosocial factors and health. The workload was quite a bit with weekly assignments. It would be good if we had gotten feedback on the weekly assignments (at least the first few) just to make sure that we are submitting what is required. The participation grade was substantial and as the class was relatively large, it was sometimes hard to participate as much as one would like to. The need to speak out in class also seem to put additional pressure on some of the \"quieter\" students to do so.",
    "the course material was great, but the format of the class (discussion) is a bit difficult because it was a large class and everyone is trying to 'say something'",
    "Strengths: The instructor did a great job answering questions.Weaknesses: Never got any writing assignments back, would have been nice to get some feedback. The emphasis on class participation was a nice concept but poorly executed. If 20% of our grade is based on class participation, there should be a better way to get that grade. Several students will be called on over and over again in one class while others will wait the entire time with their hands raised. If we aren't called on there should be an option to write a question or comment in and turn it in at the end of class.",
    "A good survey of psychosocial exposures and health outcomes, very discussion\/participation based; however, with such a large class size, the assessment of participation was not the most appropriate. I would suggest to split the class time into two sections - the first hour (or more) for Tene's lecture\/group presentations and a second hour (or less) for breakout into smaller group discussion in two classrooms, led either by the TA or by instructor.",
    "strengths - good focus, continuityweaknesses -",
    "The course discussed many interesting topics, but the class format made it difficult to engage in a thorough discussion of the topics, since people spent more time worrying about participation credit than gaining an understanding of psychosocial epidemiology. The course would be greatly improved by either having a more lecture-based format or by having a discussion section. Also it would have been nice to submit assignments via class v2."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0The instructor didn't stay after class to provide support to the students. Sometimes she didn't pay attention to student presentations and other times she would single out students by asking very specific questions about the text.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Dr. Lewis was fine",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Wonderful instructor and very knowledgeable! Very accessible both in and out of class and fair in grading. I would have liked to have more lectures by her rather than the discussion leading the class.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0See above. Structure of class needs to be rethought. If you want educated, well-thought-out discussion, you need to provide us with the environment to make that happen.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0I really like Prof Lewis and she is a great lecturer and good discussion leader. I wish I got my weekly papers back though. Thanks for not having a midterm! Having a paper every week is enough work! I liked presenting in class",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Professor Lewis showed great expertise in the area; however, she did not guide the class discussion in an effective manner.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Dr. Lewis is amazing!!!! What an incredible person she is. She is among my most favorite, and most impressive, professors\/lecturers that I have had in a long time.She's smart, funny, creative in her teaching style, and took the course material very seriously. I really do think that this is one of the best courses taught in this program.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0More in depth teaching by the instructor would be appreciated. The majority of the class is based on our class discussion about the readings. Most of the time, at the end of the class, many of us feel that we did not get much more out of the class than what we have read on our own based on the reading assignments.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Please see above.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0The professor was strong. She chose interesting topics\/readings and structured the class so learning was participatory.A major weakness in the class was the lack of set expectations and feedback. Assignments were described orally and with examples (once we asked for them)- but there were no written descriptions of what each assignment was and what she wanted to see of them. This made it difficult to understand what she wanted.Also, we did not get any feedback on any of our assignments- not the two-page papers each week, not the proposal for our final paper, and I'm assuming not our final paper. Only those who didn't understand the assignments got feedback. The professor missed an important opportunity to communicate on a one-on-one basis with students and to give individual guidance.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0I admired Professor Lewis\u0092s gumption to push me and my fellow students out of our comfort zone, for example:1. no computers allowed during class (yes, lots of printing of the many papers we were assigned);2. you had to come prepared to deliver a synopsis of any assigned article \u0085 and with at least 2 relevant questions pertaining to the article;3. you had to speak in class as part of your participation grade, which, with your handed-in weekly homework, accounted for 40% of your class grade.There is no doubt that Dr Lewis is a very bright and up-and-coming researcher in important psychosocial-epi areas. Her expertise is something we students could have benefited from more \u0085 had she done more of the talking than the students to earn their class-participation grade.This class is a core requirement course, with 35 to 45 students in it. And so, the must-speak-during-class requirement to ensure we were \u0093doing the reading\u0094 was incompatible with a class of this size, meeting for 1-and-a-half hours each week.Perhaps next year, to monitor whether students are completing the readings, Professor Lewis might consider giving a 5-minute quiz at the start of class \u0085 and return the quizzes corrected. We never received any of our 12 handed-in homework assignments back; at the midterm time, we were informed that while pretty much everyone earned the full credit for their homeworks to date, that there were clear levels of grading for class (oral) participation, with many failing. This led to much needless gnashing of teeth \u0085 did that lead to better learning?Lewis is experimenting and that is good. Ideally, she would deliver a 30-45 minute lecture from her expert level to the class (note: psychosocial epi is completely new territory for many of the students), and then open it up to discussions and\/or group presentations on psychosocial gold standard measurements\/psychometrics. Otherwise, the current approach leaves too much of the important stuff to commentary by students, who are just getting a handle on the complexity and depth of this important discipline.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Did not take the time to understand the student's level of knowledge of the topic. Frequently covered basic concepts when students were more advanced.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0See class comments above",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0She was a very nice woman who didn't know how to lead a discussion. If she was going to demand participation, she should have been a better moderator. Although she seemed knowledgeable in the field, she didn't ever show that knowledge. Either the class needs to be split up into three different sections (to make it smaller) or the way it is taught needs to change.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Lewis was really passionate about the subject and she is really smart women but I think she should manage the class in a more effeicient way. I dont think that she expected this year class would have about 30 students.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0She knows her material well.It would be useful to upload her slides for her lectures so that students can refer to them again?Feedback on the weekly assignments would be very helpful. Even comments from the TA will be helpful. Or even comments from other students in the class. Such peer comments will be so much more helpful than just slavish adherence to class participation.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0The professor was knowledgeable and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Knowledgeable, sensitive and respective to students needs, and engaged with the students and the content.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Tene was an engaging and clear lecturer. I enjoyed taking class with her, and felt that she made psychosocial epidemiology an interesting and pertinent subject, even for those students for whom this may be their only SBS class. I also felt she did a good job of covering a fair number of psychosocial topics in detail, rather than the course content being too broad (one complaint having taken SBS influences in the fall) or being too specific.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Great instructor. Very personable and knowledgeable.",

    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0I thought Tene was a good professor",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0she is super bright, but she was too transparent about how she felt about different people in the class. she needs to remember that a lot of us are from a hard science background, so it would be awesome if she could slightly cater to our interests. you can't just dismiss the science part of the article because you don't understand it.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Dr Lewis is very knowledgeable and approachable, and I have learned a lot from her this semester and she has also piqued my interest in this area of epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Very knowledgeable and interesting.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Dr. Lewis is a great lecturer and clearly knows her psychosocial epi, so I would have enjoyed hearing more from her. She did provide immediate feedback when we contacted her directly, but we received little feedback in terms of our weekly assignments.The manner in which participation was graded made the classtime quite disjointed, since students were eager to say SOMETHING to get their points for the day - it would have been helpful to have betterflow and transition by the instructor, instead of just pointing down a line of students.I appreciate Tene's expertise and passion for psychosocial epi, and do believe she facilitates a classroom that opens up new concepts and ideas for students.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Poor communication skills.",
    "Instructor: Tene Lewis \u00a0Prof. Lewis was helpful when students asked questions, but sometimes during lecture her body language showed dismay in student's opinions, even though there are no right or wrong answers to many lecture questions. Overall she is well informed about psychosocial epidemiology topics but the class format does not leave one feeling as though they are well-informed about psychosocial topics."
