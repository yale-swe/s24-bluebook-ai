   "comments": [
    "If you're comfortable with integration then go for it. Don't take it if you're just looking for a QR, there are easier classes for that. The curve in this class is pretty nasty, so you better know your stuff!",
    "MATH 120 is a good class if you don't plan on studying anything too quantitatively rigorous at Yale (Econ, Engineering, etc.).",
    "Math 120 is deff a good class to take if you are interested in math\/need to fill distributional requirements, Oanh is straight fire dogg.",
    "Math 120 is fairly boring and disappointing to someone who finds the conceptual side of math interesting. If you're taking it as background for future courses, don't worry about the workload or the tests if you study you're fine. But I don't recommend taking it for fun. Additionally, it is my understanding that class quality varies considerably from teacher to teacher, some teachers only graduating from TA status recently and most still in grad school.",
    "Tests are generally very fair and reflective of the material in the class. Would not discourage anyone who has taken BC Calc.",
    "Math 120 can be very intimidating because many of the students in the class took classes similar to it in high school. The material is not that challenging but it can be intimidating and it is hard to \"beat the curve\"",
    "Math 120 is a multi-variable calculus course which builds on the single variable knowledge. This course has some interesting concepts, but make sure that your integral evaluation is rock solid before taking it.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend the course; it's a great intro course for multivariable calculus, covering topics in thorough detail, at a reasonable pace, & in a logical order."
