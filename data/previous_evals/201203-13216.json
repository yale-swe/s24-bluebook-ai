   "comments": [
    "Probably not because it was a ton of work and I didn't get that much out of it",
    "I would say this class is a fascinating blend of dance and film studies that allows you to push your visual\/linguistic capabilities and apply your lessons to actual practice. I would definitely recommend this class to any student, whether he or she has any dance or film background or not.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student with an interest in dance or film. There is a lot of reading involved, and the class is discussion based, so it's important to keep up with the work, but it's worth it!",
    "Didn't expect to take this class, but I'm glad I did; I am now \"movement literate.\" It's surprising how much films and life in general relates to dance. The professor is great, the reading was not too overwhelming, and I liked meeting professional artists near the end of the semester.",
    "At times you may be frustrated by the fact that this class seems inapplicable and does not contain much concrete knowledge, but if you come to accept the discussions and material for what they are, a specific form of art that we are exploring, you will get more out of it. This is a class I consider to be a \"selfish\" class, because it changes your interpretation of art and movement and expands the way you look at both dance and film.",
    "I enjoyed this class, but I'd mostly recommend it to people with a preexisting interest in dance and\/or film. The class is a lot more interesting when you can bring in things beyond what's on the syllabus to the discussion, because after awhile a lot of the readings begin to sound the same.Prof. Coates is amazing and she brings in practicing artists which was by far my favorite part of the course.",
    "I would recommend Dance on Film to other students because it is an interesting exploration of art in academics. With or without dance or film background, it is a great experience."
