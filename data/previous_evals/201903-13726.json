   "comments": [
    "Very much.",
    "this course has deepened my understanding of linear regression however, I think more materials on non-linear regression could have been covered",
    "I did not align well with my expectations. For much of the course, I was told of different approaches and shown the code, but I learnt little about what exactly those approaches entail. Granted they are all present in the reference material but extensive classnotes had very little information density. Moreover, an inordinate amount of time in class was spent on trying to write code, which could have instead been used to focus on nuances of regression or theory.",
    "It's what I expected.",
    "Almost the same.",
    "It aligned quite well with my expectation.",
    "Well",
    "They were less. I expected to gain more and a full understanding of how to program."

   "comments": [
    "The course is well-designed and organized. The lecture notes and R code examples are very well-organized and helpful. Professor and TA are very available and always ready to help. The location could be changed, as we usually have to leave the room 10 minutes before the scheduled class time to allow time for the preparation of seminars in that room.",
    "could be more interactive in class some of the homework\/final project seemed a little repetitive",
    "Last two lectures, probably most important, had no homework associated with it while the first few lectures were extremely basic. Better restructuring would help Learning R programming is not a part of the course, and is best kept separate, either through students taking a companion introduction to R course of the TA helping out through tutorials outside class hours (which the TA did).",
    "Everything is perfect.",
    "This course covers useful regression theory and techniques, but sometimes it is presented in a confusing mix of very abstract and highly detailed, presumably because there are few math pre-requisites for the course. I think it would be helpful to have more explicit learning objectives related to the theoretical coursework. The homeworks were useful for understanding the actual applications of regression techniques.",
    "The instructor and TF provided really detailed materials to help students. But I hope more good samples of homework or final project could be provided for us to understand how to write a good report, in Rmarkdown or word document.",
    "This is a very selective course and very important to some of us.",
    "Only weakness is that the material is read straight off the lecture slides. This makes it easy to go back and review material that didn't make sense, but it makes it difficult to justify attending class.",
    "The strengths are the help that the Tim and Henry give you and the overall feasibility of the assignments. However, the weaknesses are the overall unintelligible lectures and aspects of the class that just dont make any sense."
