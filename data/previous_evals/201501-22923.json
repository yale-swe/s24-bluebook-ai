    "The course is really rewarding if you are willing to put the effort. It definitely requires work but it is fun to do. Towards the end you really see a lot of improvement on your technique.",
    "find a different professor. or you will regret it.",
    "The course was enjoyable but the workload was extremely time-consuming. Also, the course is not quite a basic drawing course for almost-beginners; going in with some artistic talent and background is probably essential unless you're prepared to do badly for the class. Perhaps this could have been made clearer because the course title seems to suggest otherwise.",
    "You really need the time and the right instructor. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague.",
    "Only take this class if you are an art major or are VERY VERY committed to the idea of this class. I took this class seriously and was willing to work, but it was still an elective. But, just because of the insane amount of time required it became the main source of my stress. There were so many nights where I was up until 3 or 4 working on drawings when I should have been focusing on coursework within my major. Be careful about what you're getting into.",
    "I loved it. If you want to learn how to draw, and to do it well, this is the place for you. At the same time, be ready to work really hard.",
    "It's a lot of work, especially with Serrano. I honestly don't think it's worth it, even if you want to do Cr\/D. The only way you improve is by practicing, and this course expects a lot of you. I went into it expecting this, but in the end I wish I had used this credit on something else. If you choose to take it, shop a few sections and make sure to get an instructor whose expectations align with what you want from the class. That being said, my skills definitely saw a lot of improvement."
