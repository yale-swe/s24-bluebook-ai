    "Very solid lecture course that I would recommend to someone looking to fulfill their upper-level MCDB requirement. The material is generally quite interesting -- there are many moments where you will be in awe of just how cool the technology that you're studying is. The workload is reasonable, with a quiz every other week and weekly reading responses on scientific papers. The midterm and final are both non-cumulative.",
    "good overview course; a mixed bag of topics\/lecturers, but interesting overall; a bit disorganized b\/c of so many different lecturers",
    "Learned a ton from this class! I'm really glad I took this course because I was also interviewing for biotech companies the same semester. The material I learned in this course was very helpful for the whole process and significantly increased my chances of getting the internship. If you're at all interested in biotechnology as a potential career path, this is a must take at Yale. The sections didn't necessarily enhance the class too much, but the content was worth it. The exams were challenging, but doable.",
    "A very current review of biotechnology, with an emphasis on pharmaceutical and emerging therapies. Not easy, but not too hard. If you are not planning on going into industry, however, you may wish that there was less focus on the business side of things.",
    "I would recommend 370 to another student in so far that the Biotech field is always changing so new material is always being presented in this class. However, due to the class being disorganized by the many swapping out of professors, this class was somewhat tedious at times. Additionally, some of the material had been previously discussed in lower level bio classes.",
    "I definitely do, just be prepared for a lot of work but it's a very interesting class.",
    "Biotech is very informative and you will learn a lot! Lectures are organized and the papers are interesting!",
    "Not a bad way to fulfill the upper level bio requirement for mcdb but it's not an exciting class and the exams are unnecessarily difficult."
