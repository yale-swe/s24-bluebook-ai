   "comments": [
    "Strengths: You get to be at the law school. They have significantly more money than us, it's fancy, and you get out of LEPH for once. You get 2 units. Weaknesses: It depends on your project, but I have walked away from my project exhausted and disillusioned with Yale. The amount of stress and time just wasn't worth it. If I could go back, I would have rather taken two classes and saved myself the draining experience than get two credits for this course. It just simply wasn't worth it.",
    "I thought this was a great course. iT really opened my eyes up to a different world of policy and advocacy combined with research. i think that it had a good mix of in class reading but also allowed us time to work on our projects since they were all very involved. The only thing that i would say is that the project put many different people together which sometimes caused tension. This class was a lesson in personally controlling your own ego and allowing peace ot prevail for the good of the group atmosphere. The only thing i would change is that at the beginning of the projects we are told to read all the background on our topic and then go searching for more. it would have been really helpful for the first group meeting to have a short lecture (super short like 10-15 minutes) that summarized the main points that you were supposed to get and build upon. i felt at the beginning that i was just reading and i didn't exactly know where it all fit together until towards the middle.",
    "Better preparation on clinic projects before students begin semester so that work can begin right away.",
    "I have submitted my answer to this question in a separate course evaluation.",
    "I was really looking forward to this course, but it proved to required a lot of input for very little output. I would not recommend it.",
    "I loved the course. It was a fantastic learning experience as a future public health practitioner.",
    "Very interesting and pertinent discussions and reading. Seminars entail really rich conversations. The professors are extremely knowledgeable and passionate, it is truly and amazing class. Gives student the opportunity to be exposed to relevant issues and the actual work in global health. Weaknesses: The quality of the experience in this class really depends on the group you have for the project and the supervisor. Something that could be improved is that projects could be better organized in terms of time frame and work plan."

    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali is very knowledgable and passionate. However, she can sometimes dominate the conversation without realizing that students have been sitting the room for 2 hours and listening to professors talk all day.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Could be more receptive to student concerns as well as being present for more clinic meetings",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali was essential to guiding the thought processes of our clinical cohort. She posed challenging questions that were pivotal to our project's development.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Professor Miller is extremely passionate with an amazing experience which really comes through in her lectures which are very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Amy Nicole Kapczynski \u00a0Amy is very knowledgable; however, you could tell that the Drug Pricing group were her babies.",
    "Instructor: Amy Nicole Kapczynski \u00a0Great instructor. Really good at giving well-placed positive feedback as well as criticism if necessary. Always made sure to be positive and inclusive.",
    "Instructor: Amy Nicole Kapczynski \u00a0Amy was respectful of student opinions and openly gauged student's feelings about projects and topics. I would be interested to know what ideas are incorporated into next year's course model based on her response to the community organizer lecture.",
    "Instructor: Amy Nicole Kapczynski \u00a0Professor Kapcynsky has a very unique way of prompting the right but unexpected discussions and trails of thought.",
    "Instructor: Christine M Ricardo \u00a0Christine is a fantastic clinical fellow. She was a very approachable, helpful supervisor. Yay Christine!!!!!",
    "Instructor: Christine M Ricardo \u00a0Great! Responsive and organized!",

    "Instructor: Gregg Steven Gonsalves \u00a0Many students noted that Gregg was not particularly friendly to students outside of the classroom when seen around campus. We see you in class every week, you could be slightly more cordial when we see you out and ask how your day is going. We're all adults here.",
    "Instructor: Gregg Steven Gonsalves \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Gregg Steven Gonsalves \u00a0Gregg was observant, kind, and helpful. I was excited by his open mindedness towards the community organizers' lecture."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "I know that it's tempting: the law school allure, the 2 units, the plead to your inner activist... however, I would personally not choose to take this class if I could do it all over again. It was simply not worth the stress, the never-ending grouwork, and demanding workload. Prepare to work nights and weekends.",
    "Yes i would recommend it to another student because the skills and knowledge i gained was undeniably invaluable. i would also say that working with different professional school students can be challenging at times but sometimes the best thing to do would be to always rethink why certain things bother you and if it can be let go..then the best thing to do would be to let it go.",
    "As as student who did not know what a law school clinic class was until this semester, I would tell my former self that this class is an opportunity to gain professional legal and health advocacy experience in the field of global health, under the guidance of expert faculty. The class is more collaborative than instructional, as the seminar portion is discussion-based. However, you will learn a lot. The opportunity to gain professional oversight from experienced and brilliant faculty from the law and public health schools is unparalleled. The clinical expectations of workload are very great, and in some ways I felt as though the client's expectations of my work was that which one would expect of a full-time employee. The faculty and student fellows were supportive and helped to negotiate the stresses that accompanied client's expectations. Overall, the experience was rewarding as I developed a deeper ethical awareness of the nature of global work, and applied it.",
    "I was really looking forward to this course, but it proved to required a lot of input for very little output. I would not recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone seeking a broad exposure to the concept of justice as it applies to public health. Through a combination of theoretical readings and seminar discussions and high-impact practicum work, the course is a fantastic, though work-intensive, glimpse into the world of health activism.",
    "This is a really interesting course, definitely worth the effort for those looking to be inspired, learn and professional experience."
