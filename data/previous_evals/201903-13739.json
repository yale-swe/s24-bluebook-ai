    "I gained a good overview of key concepts in urban planning",
    "I really appreciated the practical and professional knowledge that Professor Kooris brought to the class. I really appreciated when he drew on the board and explained various zoning issues, development rights, and opportunity zones. The assignments were refreshing in that they really let you address a variety of urban issues affecting a neighborhood.",
    "By taking this course, I have a better sense of how regional planning practice develops and responds to current issues at different scales. For the case study assignment, I learnt about both the historical urban planning of a certain neighborhood and the larger socioeconomic network that induced and enhanced the planning itself.",
    "I learned how local politics and planning affect city planning. Most of my classes are much wider in nature (global or national) so this was an entirely different perspective.",
    "I learned a lot about urban planning and what it takes to shape development in cities and suburbs."

   "comments": [
    "Pretty much exactly what I expected\/wanted",
    "I expected this course to be a little bit more rigorous than it was, and I expected the assignments to have a bit more structure. However, the course did meet my expectation that it would be a very practical approach to the profession of urban planning and all that it entails.",
    "The knowledge, research skills and insights gained are very well aligned with my expectations.",
    "I sometimes struggled to connected lectures to each other, though many of the anecdotes were really helpful in putting things into perspective.",
    "Well."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "My main piece of feedback is to have more clarity and organization. The syllabus was outdated, the dates for assignments were wrong and there were no written explanations of assignments. It would be easy to improve this aspect and improve the quality of the class a lot.",
    "I thought this was a great broad overview of planning and covered a lot of interesting material with a professor who has a lot of applied knowledge in the field",
    "This course is very loosely structured, especially with the readings being very loosely required. I think it could be improved by assigning one required reading per week so students come into the class with more shared background knowledge. More clear instructions for the assignments are also necessary. The primary strength of the course is Professor Kooris' knowledge and ability to answer questions.",
    "Strengths include accessibility to the professor, who has deep knowledge. I loved the field trips. I also thought many of the sections, especially on transportation, were awesome. I loved the case studies and would like more of them. Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures felt too long and unorganized. I would have loved more unity amongst the course. There were so many slides that it was difficult to follow at times. The group assignments felt tangential and didnt add too much to my learnings.",
    "The classes are quite long, which isn't always necessary. We spent a lot of time talking about stuff that was not super relevant to the course, though it was usually still interesting. There also could have been more feedback on assignments after they were turned in. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot and gained a good understanding of the urban planning world."

   "comments": [
    "This is a fun, interesting overview of urban\/suburban planning with a bit of a focus in the North East because of the professor's experience in CT and NY.",
    "Its a good class with low workload. Youll learn a lot but at times feel lost. Ask lots of questions to orient Professor Kooriss lecture to your interests.",
    "Enjoy!"
