    "A fantastic course - one of the best I've ever taken! We had the opportunity to write and speak about topics we care about, learn from the brilliant, supportive and always-eloquent Professor Roach, and be part of a really special class community. We all improved as speakers throughout the semester and had the opportunity to delve into fascinating topics in our speeches and discussions. Fun and rewarding - an amazing class overall!",
    "An excellent class for any English or Theatre Studies major! Professor Roach is an amazing teacher who cares about each of his students and their experiences in the class. Definitely take this class if you are not only interested in the history of rhetoric but the future of speeches as well.",
    "If you're looking for a class on speechwriting and speech delivery, this is it. Professor Roach is excellent, and this is one of those classes where the students become very close. You write a few speeches and deliver them, get critiqued by your classmates, get to listen to their words, and you learn some great, long-lasting skills. Grading is a bit arbitrary, but still highly recommend!",
    "Absolutely recommended. Amazing. Really one of those courses where you learn lifelong practical skills about relating to other human beings. Roach is also a god.",
    "Great class. Fun and instructive.",
    "I would recommend this class only if the student is looking for an easy class that might lead to a little bit of improvement in public speaking and only if taken Credit\/D. Otherwise, it might not be worth it.",
    "Definitely take this class!! It's a wonderful opportunity to learn the art of public speaking from an incredible professor and mentor. This is one of the few classes at Yale where you actually get a ton of practice mixed in with the theory: you start out with three short speeches that are ungraded, then a declamation, a five-minute speech, and an eight minute speech. The final exam was a pizza party where we all got together and made toasts! By the end of the semester, everyone's writing and speaking skills (as well as confidence) had improved tremendously. Our class was a great mixture of theater\/English people and more political science people, all of whom brought really interesting experiences and ideas to the table.",
    "This is the best place at Yale to learn how to public speak. Roach is a genius, but likes theory more than practical tips on how to speak better. The reading for this class alone makes it worth it, and then real experience delivering speeches is invaluable. Overall, this is the sort of intimate seminar experience that you dream of at a liberal arts university like Yale. Definitely worth taking, even if grading is largely unclear.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class 100% whether or not you think yourself a seasoned or shy public speaker. There's a range of people taking the class, but by the end of it, everyone will have grown tremendously.",
    "This class is a must-take for students who want to hone their speech-writing and public speaking skills (or really for anyone who wants to grow as an articulate human being). Professor Roach weaves several elements together to create the course, including discussion of technique, analysis of speeches throughout history, and critique of speeches given by fellow students in class."
