    "I developed an increased familiarity with anthropology, and specifically anthropological approaches to studying Africa.",
    "I learned how to synthesize anthropologist materials with current events",
    "I study global affairs and have worked in equatorial Africa and this course was a really great way to frame my experiences and the ways I study issues of politics, gender, and intervention. While it was much more of an academic course than those at the professional schools (SOM, Jackson, Forestry), it was extremely useful for my professional work -- and also generally really interesting.",
    "I learned more about what an anthropological perspective might look like, and how to think more like an anthropologist in looking at African political issues.",
    "Not having any anthropology coursework background prior to this course, my ability to analyze texts through an anthropological perspective expanded greatly. This will also inform my future work in political science and public policy by reminding me to look at the issues I'm working on from multiple angles.",
    "Learned a lot about Africa, especially what anthropologists have written about this vast continent."

   "comments": [
    "For the most part, this was a very well-designed and well-taught course. I think the selection of readings made quite a bit of sense and helped us progress intellectually over the course of the class. I think the only complaint I have is that sometimes class conversations were slightly disjointed, which may have been done to the diverse background of the students in the class. It would also have been nice to have been in a classroom with windows.",
    "The readings were phenomenal. I think it would have been more helpful for the weekly responses to be a personal response or writing about how we related to the material",
    "Prof. Lombard is really wonderful. Makes you feel like your insights both in class and in response papers are interesting and useful, but without it feeling like she is pandering to you. The readings were also great. I would say the only weakness was perhaps that we as a class could sometimes take a little while to warm up. Not sure if there is a way to make that happen more quickly but...",
    "Strengths included the selected readings, the art analysis, and the interesting discussions (coming from someone who usually strongly dislikes the discussion format). A weakness was possibly the presentations, which while interesting, seemed to crowd out time for mind expanding discussion of assigned readings.",
    "I enjoyed being able to learn from other students' personal projects throughout the semester - I think this was a huge strength of the course.",
    "strength: readings very friendly for students who are unfamiliar with Africa, effective and lively discussion"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This class is worth checking out for students interested in the study of African politics as seen through an anthropological lens.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "Yes!",
    "Definitely. If you are interested in humanitarian aid, democratic interventions ('peace building' etc), or Sub-Saharan Africa, it is extremely valuable for being aware and critical of our own biases and perspectives.",
    "Definitely, in hindsight it seems essential if you are in any way interested in Africa.",
    "Yes - I think this was a fantastic, fascinating course for anyone interested in working on the African continent or anyone interested in working cross-culturally more generally.",
    "Yes. Great introductory course to Anthropology of Africa"
