    "This course proved very insightful in thinking through some of the major theoretical issues facing anyone studying social movements- especially religious ones. It was very helpful in giving me ideas for future study. I also have benefited from each of the case studies looked at each week.",
    "It gave me completely new and insiring approaches on how to treat many *terrorist* groups in today's world. If merely a fractrion off policymakers could have had the opportunity to participate in such a class, I am sure that the world would have been much more capable in deeling with such groups."
