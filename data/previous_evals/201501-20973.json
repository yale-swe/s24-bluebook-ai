   "comments": [
    "Students are introduced to a set of guiding parameters for design and are taught methods that can be used to implement green thinking into the design process. We are also shown examples of why this is important and examples of when good intention goes bad. I would recommend the class for a specific type of student. Those who do not like or shy away from group work should not take the class. Those who have a heavy work load with research or classes should not take the class. I would encourage those with an interest in design and in getting to know the different tools and machines in the CEID to take the class.",
    "Beginning of the course can be a bit hellish, but pays off later.",
    "Interesting, but occasionally frustrating. I would only recommend it to someone who was REALLY interested in the idea behind the course. It requires \"personal investment\"."

   "comments": [
    "The integration of green thinking into product design was the most helpful portion of the course and likely had the biggest impact in terms of my knowledge development. This course will likely have some help (I'll say a help of 4 on a 1 to 5 scale) in my dissertation research, as it will focus to some degree on green design and green chemistry."
