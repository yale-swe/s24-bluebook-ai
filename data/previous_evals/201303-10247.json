   "comments": [
    "It's MV calc. If you want to take higher math, take it. Not much more to be said about it.",
    "It is multivariable calculus plain and simple. I would recommend it to another student only if they need to take it or are just into math.",
    "Yes; even if one does not wish to pursue mathmatics as a potential major, the class was both fun and challenging.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless this person seriously enjoyed math or needed it as a prerequisite for a different class. If you are good at math this class should pose very few problems for you. If you struggle with math, it could be much, much more difficult than any other class you are taking. Far too much of the grade depends on the final and midterms while not enough is weighed on the homework. I probably spent 30-40 hours on homework over the course of the semester yet it is worth ten percent of the grade??",
    "The difficulty level of this class will vary widely for different people, or even different units, but the class is very consistent and if you're willing to study, you'll be fine.",
    "Really clarifies a lot of the ideas from single variable and calculus in general as they are generalized to further dimensions. Very interesting conclusion to the story of basic calculus. The class's curves on the midterms is almost negative though, and sometimes understanding how to do homework problems and the practice exams doesn't feel like enough.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who took single variable and wants to continue their math education in a general way. While the course is challenging, it's doable with some effort put in. I found that peers are also an excellent resource for homework help.",
    "Standard course, really. You should know what to expect.",
    "It's a good class with weekly psets, two midterms, and a final.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class for fun. Most everyone takes it for a major requirement. The problem sets aren't bad but certainly aren't entertaining. If you get a good section, you should be fine. If you're looking for background or applications to do the math, then take ENAS 151 instead. This course is great if you're only interested in the theoretical parts of the theorems.",
    "Good class. Even though I felt like I was struggling at times, my prayers to the curve and grade inflation have been heard. Take this class if you need to.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 for all who are interested in mathematics and are looking for a rigorous continuation of their mathematics education, in preparation for a math-related field (engineering, physics, math, perhaps economics)... courses like 118 would be better for people not totally passionate about Math and who just need the knowledge for a social science major.Whilst hard to master, lectures were efficient and informative, and the book is great. I wish the class had formal review sections as opposed to TA availability to answer questions, but alas.",
    "An unpleasant experience.",
    "Math 120 is a great course for learning Multivariable Calculus -- it provides a pretty in-depth look at everything from vectors, lines and planes to Multiple Integrals, Greens, Stokes and the Divergence Theorem. The book is quite helpful and the lectures work through the material and related example problems. The problem sets can be tough (not too long though) and the exams are pretty hard. That being said, there's a pretty reasonable curve. On the whole, I would certainly recommend the class -- then again, I love math..",
    "no",
    "Math 120 is a fast paced introduction to a large variety of topics. The connections between them only become clear towards the end, and the examples you are presented with in class and in problem sets are not comparable in difficulty to those which appear on exams. The course expects you to be able to analyze information in forms you have not yet experienced and be able to apply what you learned to solve it: this is hard to do, especially if you aren't used to that sort of work from high school. Taking this course is a big jump from BC calculus or below, and those who came in with multivariable experience in my class often found 120 exponentially easier than those lacking it. It's also hard to do if you get an instructor who is difficult to understand: fortunately Kaplan is clear and engaging, though he was a bit disorganized because he was new. In short: it's really easy to have an understanding of the concepts and be able to breeze through the homework while earning a terrible grade in the course because you fail to grasp the exam problems. Definitely a lot of randomness involved there.",
    "Only take this class if it's required for your major. It's challenging and extremely fast paced, so if you're not absolutely determined to learn the material it's easy to get lost.",
    "Math 120 was a fast paced course that introduced some of the more advanced topics in math. Overall, it was a well taught course but really required the students to learn and solidify much of the material by themselves.",
    "Math 120 is a fairly dry course on Multivariable Calc Take it if you need Math 120 as a prereq, but I think there are more interesting QRs if you just need the distributional credit."
