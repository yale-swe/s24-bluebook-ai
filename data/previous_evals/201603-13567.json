    "It was a fantastic introduction to the Spanish language. I felt like the pace was reasonable, and that the instruction was good.",
    "I learned the basics of Spanish, including grammar, vocal, how to form full sentences to have a conversation with someone, and how to listen and answer questions in Spanish.",
    "I learned how to speak, read, and write basic Spanish.",
    "Spanish skills. I can now understand the language and speak with limited ability.",

   "comments": [
    "The book that this course uses is a great one. The activities online are always straightforward and conducive to the learning. It would be great if the DUS could offer past tests from the previous years to assist future students in preparing for the tests if that could be a possibility.",
    "It's a great course, easy to stay on top of, especially if you do work ahead of time, which is very doable.",
    "Strengths: Daily engagement ensures practice for students",
    "It was very useful that it was held everyday. It allowed the lessons to stick to our memories through daily practice. I also like a that the class was conducted in pure Spanish which really necessitated us to learn it as well as get us used to hearing the language. All the materials used were very helpful and my professor was the best. I cant think of any weakness except maybe it's too short (50 minutes only).",
    "Early on, having class entirely in Spanish was less helpful than it would have been with some English. It was initially very difficult to keep up with what was being said in class.",
    "I felt the pace was good. However, I thought that sometimes the homework was arduous.",
    "The strengths of this course are the small classroom setting and the fact that the professor and students alike are all so engaged for the fifty five minutes. One of the weaknesses was that our classroom was quite filled and very far away from Old Campus.",
    "The strengths of the course are the variety of activities used to teach the material. Specifically, the listening activities, in-class discussion, and role playing were all helpful for me. I did not think that the online homework was incredibly effective at cementing concepts, as its orientation could be confusing. An initial weakness of the course is that it is taught completely in Spanish - this is understandable for people that have background knowledge in the language, but as someone that did not know any Spanish at the beginning of the semester, I found it difficult to learn and ask questions.",
    "The organization is the strength of the course. I was able to do my homework many days in advance thanks to the syllabus. Sometimes, I found that the oral exam expected too much out of a level one student. Speaking seems to come later in the Yale Spanish curriculum."
