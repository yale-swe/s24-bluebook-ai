   "comments": [
    "Summary: class is graded harshly, and you will only hear from Professor Zedillo for a grand total of 8-10% of your time in the course. The rest will be spent listening to presentations from others, and writing reading responses that are graded harshly. I really don't recommend this, you'll hear more\/learn more from Zedillo at one of those talks rather than this class, avoid it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. It was one of the most rewarding class experiences I've had, and in a very different way than most of my other \"best\" classes. I definitely enjoyed the experience of learning from such an amazing man.",
    "Read a lot, class is a little more presentation than discussion but unbelievable amount learned",
    "A lot of reading that isn't essential to succeed in the course. Two page reading responses every week can get tired. Still, take it because Zedillo is awesome to hear from. He is the man.",
    "The issues are interesting, and it's great to hear Zedillo's insights. Zedillo allows most of the time to be taken up by student presentations though, which is silly. I wished there was more discussion and that Zedillo talked more. Quite a bit of reading, and a two page reading response each week.",
    "Amazing class but just a ton of weekly reading. Expect 300-400 pages every class. Midterm is hard and the final paper is long. Nevertheless, very worth it to take this class.",
    "Take it if you are prepared to do a lot of reading and weekly two page responses without the satisfaction of a seminar style discussion.",
    "The class gives you a broad understanding of the different perspectives and opinions surrounding some of the most critical global challenges and opportunities facing the world.There's a ton of reading, but it's interesting stuff.I would recommend the class to any student interested in the subject.",
    "I think it's a good course but a ton of reading and the professor schedules presentations each week so he doesn't really have to prepare for the class himself. Take it if you're interested in globalization - Zedillo is great but beware of the work. A two page reading response due every week, midterm and 20 page final paper with weekly reading.",
    "Great overview of important issues in modern politics and economics. Lots of readings (300 pages\/wk), reading responses every week, and presentations. Not really that much work at the end of the day, but it sometimes felt difficult to get good marks on it, given that Zedillo instructs his assistant to grade down. It's a pleasure to learn from Zedillo, but most of the time he assigns students to prepare the material and saves his own remarks for ten to fifteen minutes at the end.It is what it is. Take it for the great amount you will learn, but be prepared to work hard all semester.",
    "This has been one of the hardest courses I have ever taken, but it was worth every second of it. The class is VERY heavy on readings, so if you're looking for an easy course this will not be it. If you are already enrolling into it, it is because you have true interest in the topic and the professor, so make your effort worthwhile and try to get as much out of the class as possible. It is a privilege to learn with Dr.Zedillo.He is not just a former president, but he is also an amazing economist, and public server. Despite having a very opinionated voice and being very critical , he has a very warm character that makes the classes really enjoyable. Take advantage of his experience. Do the readings and ask questions. The people in the class have very interesting profiles, make the most of them and their commentaries too.The class will be as dynamic as the group makes it, so do your part.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Having an opportunity to take a course with Professor Zedillo is one that should not be passed up. Although there are some drawbacks to the course--it's a lot of reading (and thus a lot of work) and the presentations, as I'm sure many of the other reviews will mention, take away something form the course--it was definitely worth it. You'll learn an incredible amount and have an opportunity to engage with an excellent professor and incredibly knowledgeable individual with what has become his primary area of expertise.",
    "You will do a lot of readings, but you will also learn A LOT. That being said, everyone should take the class just to experience learning under a former president of Mexico.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the subject material you really do get a great overview."
