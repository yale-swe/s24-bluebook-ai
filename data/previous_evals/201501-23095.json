   "comments": [
    "You're probably taking this class because you have to. I'll be quite honest: I don't like ecology but have to take biol 104 as a premed. However, I love Professor Donoghue! I really love that he tried to make it a bearable course. And I am leaving with a good understanding of ecology\/evolution. I also enjoyed our trip to the Peabody because it helped tie together a lot of the otherwise-obscure concepts we learned in lecture. Workload: there isn't a lot. Go to lecture, take good notes, go to section. There were two PSETs that I found pretty easy, one midterm (that I didn't do well on), a one-pager, a five-pager, and a final exam. It was all very doable.",
    "probably taking it because you need to, if you're not interesting in ecology its so so boring (but easy)",
    "Really cool intro class to the methods of thinking\/types of research going on in natural biology. If you are nature-y, like plants and animals, or used to collect toads as a kid (I don't judge), TAKE IT! You never know, you might just become an E&EB major.",
    "I recommend it for students taking Bio just to finish the sequence but truthfully I didnt enjoy this course. Mainly because I am not as interested in this topic.",
    "Wonderful class with a wonderful professor. I thought E&EB was hella boring before I took this class, and I think a lot of my peers shared the same mentality. Like who gives a f* about phylogenies right? Except wow, the ideas we went through were actually super cool and intricate. The tours and videos he showed us were actually awesome, and I loved how this class not only taught us the material, but made it interesting as well. Also, Donoghue was a boss. He has a great sense of humor and was great at explaining things and making them relevant to us as students. The stretch breaks were also so, so welcomed in a such a long lecture.",
    "Midterm is sneaky difficult. Problem sets are pretty easy, and the paper is kind of annoying. Overall a lot easier than the other bio modules, and I'd say it's the second most interesting after 101.",
    "Fantastic introduction to evolutionary biology. This course had a bad reputation, but they changed the professor and removed the writing credit (so no more of that horrendous simulation work that everyone used to complain about). Dr. Donoghue is awesome. I cannot say enough about how passionate, knowledgable, and fun he is. Had I had him as a teacher as a kid I really might have gone into botany. Seriously.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student, although I would tell them that the exams take a lot of preparation, and the 1\/2 of a writing credit is completely useless. Otherwise, a great class.",
    "Biol 104 is a fun class, most definitely one of the best out of the 101-104 sequence. The structure, while different from the rest of the modules, offers you a different way to approach the material. I strongly recommend it!",
    "BIOL 104 was, for me, the best of the modules. The material is pretty interesting. There were many assignments, which could be hard to stay on top of, and exams were a little bit tricky to study for, but in general I thought it was a solid class.",
    "I had a fun time in BIOL 104. While the material was not necessarily my favorite in the realm of biology, the class was well taught. The diversity of organisms is awe-inspiring and I think this was a good introductory course to ecology and evolutionary-bio. I am glad that I took it.",
    "Biol 104 is a good introductory course to ecology and evolutionary biology. It is a moderate amount of work but was maybe the best taught of the biology modules.",
    "The definition of a gut. The material is interesting, but you can get through the course with less than an hour of work a week average. A good break after the pain in the ass that was bio 103.",
    "This course is an introduction to the disciplines of ecology and evolution and tries to give you a feel for the topics that are discussed in greater depth in upper level courses. It is well taught and I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student who is considering majoring in biology or just wants to know more about this specific topic.",
    "I think BIOL 104 was structured and taught much better than BIOL 103, so in that sense, I would recommend it over the previous module. It was very informative and the lecture slides were much easier to follow.",
    "Bio 104 is probably the best\/easiest of the intro bio sequence. It's about evolution which is cool. Odds are you're probably taking it for pre-med\/bio major as opposed to for personal enjoyment, but really don't worry it's a pretty good module. Professor Donaghue is awesome and really cute, and the work is very manageable. Overall, if you need to take it do so because it's really not that bad.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 104 because learning about evolution is something that everyone should do and this course is apt for that.",
    "104 is by far the best of the intro bio modules. Professor Donoghue, if he is teaching the course again, did a lovely job of going over the material, which in itself is fascinating. Some of the information from other modules is seamlessly incorporated into the curriculum, and it shows how much you really have learned over the course of this year of biology. I felt like the class really glossed over a large part of EEB by not really incorporating any of the mathematical methods involved, but nonetheless, I felt that i had a good understanding of the field after I had finished the course. The half-WR credit seems pretty useless, but the writing in the class consists of a one-page reading response and a five-page research paper, both of which are extremely manageable and not particularly difficult. I definitely enjoyed the course, and I feel that many people generally interested in biology, nature, or science more generally will have a great appreciation for Donoghue's interpretation of this course.",
    "Biol 104 was by far definitely the best of the bio modules. The workload is very manageable and the lectures are great. The slides incorporate many cool videos and examples that are surprisingly very relevant to the material. It is a class that I would have taken even if it was not a requirement.",
    "Biol 104 was a good basic introduction to evolution and ecology, covering many of the broad concepts in these fields. I would not recommend unless you need to take it for your major or are pre-med. Also would not recommend if you've taken AP Bio as much of the material covered was taught in AP Bio.",
    "If you don't have to take this class then don't. But if you love biology then definitely take it.",
    "I nearly died from BIOL 103, but BIOL 104 was one of the best classes I have ever taken, and I loved it so much that I would take it again if I could. The material is amazingly cool and Professor Donoghue is probably one of the most engaging, funny professors I've had at Yale. You'll probably have to take this class anyway, but if you care even remotely about plants and the environment and the origins of life and dinosaurs, you will probably have a great time in this class.",
    "Great class. Great way to end the 4 Bio modules. The final was super difficult and more specific than I was expecting form the midterm but I feel that the amount of material I learned, enjoyed (and hopefully the curve) will make up for this.",
    "Bio 104 was an improvement over 103 just by the mere fact that I could actually understand what the professor was saying. Prof. Donoghue is an expert in his field and the class was overall pretty interesting. The workload is less not too bad with 2 exams and one 6 page paper.",
    "The best module by far. No quizzes, but the midterm and final count for more. There are also two very small papers which threw some people off but they were fine. The lectures are interesting and not tedious, although there are many facts to remember.",
    "This will probably be a required module so it doesn't matter, but it is by far one of the better modules, if not the best. It is much more relaxed: no nonsensical, time-restricted weekly quizzes and only 2 psets. There are 2 relative short essays that must be done. Overall, I would recommend the course to someone interested in having an introduction to EEB, which is much more than can be said about the other modules.",
    "BIOL 104 is a great course. It is the last module of the Introductory Biology sequence. I found it to be one of the more interesting modules. Professor Donoghue is a great lecturer. Section for the class was fantastic!",
    "If you are into ecology, evolution, or biology in general, this should quite a fun class. Since most people taking this class are doing it for prereqs, there isn't much of a choice, but rest assured that this class should be fine. A lot of memorizing, but doable.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, mostly due to Professor Donoghue. If you have the opportunity, definitely try to take it with Donoghue, he's incredibly interesting and animated, and includes a lot of really cool, relevant information. He also incorporated some fun videos. Needless to say, this class was very entertaining and I learned a ton.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 104 to anyone, if you didn't have to take 101-103 first to get there. Since you do need to take the first three modules first, I would just encourage people to avoid the intro bio sequence unless they have to take it for their major because it's sometimes poorly taught and unnecessarily difficult. 104 was my favorite part, though.",
    "An interesting bio course if you get a good professor, but it involves pretty challenging material if you aren't a big fan\/have a good background of bio already. Be aware of the fact that you'll have to write 2 papers and do 2 p-sets!",
    "104 is a course that every student at Yale should take, science major or not, premed or not. It teaches you more about the nature of life than a philosophy course does in that it equips you with the scientific backing behind it all. The grading is a bit harsh especially when you're competing with a room of premeds, but this course is genuinely interesting and is definitely worth half a semester of your Yale career. Donoghue is also a great lecturer, very easy to understand. Take it.",
    "Good introductory class to bio",
    "Take this course if you want a nice intro to E&EB. best of the four bio modules. Just be prepared for lots of detail if you're taking it with Donoghue.",
    "BIOL 104 was an interesting class that I would recommend because the material was taught at a reasonable level and the teaching and support system was excellent.",
    "Interesting class",
    "A decent course, although I would only recommend it to those who need it for their requirements.",
    "The material isn't very engaging (I don't like evolutionary biology) but the professor makes it bearable. One of the top two in the module.",
    "I mean, take it if you have to. It's not a drudge of a course, but not fun if you're not interested in the material",
    "BIOL 104: Take it, it's WAY better than the other three modules. You'll learn about REAL LIFE science. It's big-scale science and it's INSPIRING in a way that learning about proteins and molecules will never be. The class is less stressful than the others and its setup- two problem sets, two papers, a midterm, and a final, is MUCH more relaxing and MUCH less work than the other modules (weekly quizzes and problem sets). Well-run, interesting. Recommended.",
    "Of all the modules, BIOL 104 (taught by Donoghue) was my favorite, and according to many of my classmates, also their favorite. Professor Donoghue is fantastic, and both he and Surjit really go out of their way to make this course engaging and fun to go to. There are no weekly quizzes, and the midterm & final exams are very fair. Understanding the major themes in this course is crucial, especially since this module covers so much in such a short time.",
    "This is a great introductory course on evolution and I would recommend it to anyone even though evolution might not be their favorite component of biology. The material is definitely interesting and it overall is one of the best bio modules.",
    "The easiest of the four bio modules, but the tests are still difficult.",
    "A solid intro science course with better course steucture than many of the other intro sciences required for premed",
    "The material is incredibly interesting, but the content is also very broad, and it can be difficult to know what to focus on when studying for the exams. The final paper was very open-ended; students were asked to write about anything related to evolution. This made it somewhat difficult to know what to write about, but it gave students the opportunity to explore the primary literature to see how evolution affects specific topics (ex: I wrote about the evolution of human laughter). This class will be what you make of it; bring a good attitude and a desire to learn and it will be rewarding.",
    "Much more fun, engaging and interesting, and which a much better professor than any of the other three introductory bio modules. I should note that I plan on majoring in E&EB, but I think many people interested in other fields would find this class very enjoyable and informative.",
    "This class was pretty terrible. Professor Donoghue was great but there was a lot of information compressed into a short amount of time.",
    "Talk about plants and animals. Plants and animals are cool.",
    "Professor Donoghue is very enthusiastic, and the class is a lot of fun. It's not too much work - if you go to all the lectures, pay attention, take notes, and study a little before the exams, you should do well. The lectures are interesting, and aren't as hard to sit through as some classes with hour-and-a-quarter lectures. Professor Donoghue even gave us \"stretch time\" to take a two minute break partway through each lecture. The final paper isn't too bad either. If you pick a topic you're interested in, it can even be fun. I wasn't smart enough to do this, but I would recommend that you do it before reading period, as it will make the paper more fun and less stressful. Overall, this was probably the best intro bio module - I really recommend it!",
    "Worst module\/hardest module there is. Do not take unless you're pre med or have to for major.",
    "BIOL 104 is an in-depth survey of evolution and ecology that is interesting even for someone for whom this might not be his or her favorite field of biology.",
    "Biology 104 was the best class out of the entire intro bio series, and also one of the better classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Donoghue is a great lecturer and there was never a dull moment in class. The workload was manageable and the final paper was interesting and enjoyable to write. Overall this was a great class and fitting conclusion to the bio series.",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone who is not necessarily very interested in evolution like myself, but I know many students have to take it anyway. I think there are significant improvements that can be made in the teaching and testing style of the course for it to be more enjoyable.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you absolutely need it for your major\/pre med requirements.",
    "The best of the bio sections and by far the one that felt the most worthwhile to go through.",
    "I would recommend it to other students. It is an introduction to evolutionary biology and ecology as well as a brief history of our evolution as humans. It did not feel as \"hard science-y\" as the other bio modules partially because a portion of it felt like a cross between biology and history, but it is good to have that context and perspective when approaching smaller scale science such as cellular biology or genetics.",
    "Most students take Biology 104 because they have to. However, it is an amazing class and should not be treated as a hoop to jump through. The class is fun and I highly recommend it! The exams are challenging but the workload is doable and Professor Donoghue is an amazing professor. Get to know him if you can!",
    "BIOL 104 01 is a good comprehensive course covering the topics of evolution and ecology. It presents a large quantity of information, and thus requires a significant amount of memorization. I would recommend BIOL 104 01 to other students along with a notification of the quantity of information that has to be memorized."
