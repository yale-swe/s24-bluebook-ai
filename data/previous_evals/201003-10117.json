   "comments": [
    "Take it. You read great plans with interesting people.",
    "It is a class where you read a ton of great plays and discuss them with other smart people and hear real people discuss their process. And it is so fun to see everyone else perform -- I've never taken a performance class. I would recommend it, absolutely.",
    "If you're into one-person plays and are willing to put the work in, take the class. If not, then don't. It's niche, you know?",
    "I would most certainly recommend this class to another student. The class teaches you the fundamentals of one-person playwriting as well as forces you to explore writing and performance in a new way. If you've ever had an interest in theater, this class is definitely worth it.",
    "the description of the class describes exactly how the class is so if that's what you want take it.",
    "Take this course. I think it has a greater chance of appealing to people who like writing and\/or performing, but I think it can be a good class for theater and non-theater people alike. Of course, in general, the class will attract people who have had some or significant experience in the theater. The class can be tough--you've got to write for 30 minutes every day, and read plays every week, and usually make a 5-7 minute performance (not full play) every week. So it can feel like a significant amount of work at times. But it's a great course, and Hal is totally down to earth and wants to get to know each of the students. He's a young director who's active in New York, so he's also a great person to get to know if you're thinking about going into some theatrical field.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you are not particularly interested (or don't think you are interested in) solo performance, YOU WILL BE. This class will make you a better actor, performer, critic, and person. You will really explore yourself and your ability as an artist.",
    "A cool and different type of theater class. Hal is great - though he does ask a lot of you and you have to be on top of your work. But definitely worth it - even if one man shows aren't your cup of tea, it's great to have a go at it!",
    "A good way to introduce yourself to a unique form of performance. There is a fairly high amount of coursework, but it's worth it to explore a verdant art form and meet exciting people,"
