    "Pretty dull lectures but the workload isn't bad",
    "A pretty easy and interesting class, especially if you take it with a friend so you can discuss the topics together after classes.",
    "I would recommend PLSC to students who want to learn briefly on international topics. It is a very good 5th class option considering the workload is very lax.",
    "It's a great class if you attend every lecture like I did. If you register for the class and don't often show up, that's really stupid. The topics are interesting and the materials are eye-opening. Highly recommended!",
    "Yes. The topics were all very interesting and relevant. It was nice to learn about important current events and count it as homework. One midterm and a final essay. Take it.",
    "An overview of the major world challenges of today. Essentially a current events class that provides the necessary historical background to understand current challenges and conflicts. Overall very low work load and an over all very enjoyable and worthwhile course.",
    "As a STEM major I found this class invigorating. I enjoyed the sections, readings, and discussions we had but not the lecture. The class is pretty straightforward: a midterm w\/ IDs, short answers (1-2 paragraphs), and an essay; participation in section; a final paper (3000-4000 words). I attended a total of 4 lectures this whole semester due to medical conflicts and still got a lot out of the class because I did the readings and was active in section (I probably got an A or A-, so I suppose it qualifies as a gut). I would recommend this class to any and all students, regardless of major or credit number for your semester. If you can choose your TA, go w\/ Shashank!",
    "Yes, if you'd like to take a relatively easy survey course. Just watch out for that final paper, though.",
    "Yes, I would for sure recommend this class to other students.",
    "Good overview, not too much work, some of the lectures are interesting.",
    "Pretty good class to take if you want to learn about some of the most important political topics globally",
    "This class offers a broad overview of a lot of different topics in political science. Its a great class for freshman who are trying to find new topics to investigate.",
    "Very low stress. Would recommend it to gain important worldly knowledge in a pleasant way.",
    "This class is pretty rough. Professor Howorth is clearly brilliant, passionate, and thoughtful, but the course structure fell short. Individual lectures were disorganized, and the lecture series as a whole felt really incoherent. The theme - \"international challenges of the 21st Century\" - felt too broad to hold together the course and dive into any information in a meaningful way. And the class swung from far too basic and surface-level (e.g. \"climate change is bad and complex\") to too weighed down by excessive and esoteric details (e.g. slides listing dozens of dates of U.N. resolutions that aren't fully explained). If you take International Challenges with the intention of engaging with the material in a meaningful way - i.e., actually learning - it won't necessarily be a waste of your time. But if you plan on skipping the readings and lecture because you can get away with it, do yourself a favor and take a class that you'll get something out of instead.",
    "Interesting class, but definitely a GUT. Because there's no final, after the midterm the majority of people do not even go to class and instead focus on writing their final paper. If you go to class and do a few of the readings here and there (particularly before the midterm), you will do fine in the class. Definitely a very easy 5th class. Good lecturer with interesting topics, but TAs can range in how good they are and how they grade.",
    "Would recommend to anyone who wants to study current events in a more structured way that clicking through Wiki trying to figure everything out. I loved this course immensely and looked forward to lecture each Monday and Wednesday.",
    "Take this course if you want a broad overview of challenges facing the 21st century, but don't expect to go in-depth on anything. Mid-term was not easy, but it wasnt impossible either. Final paper was tedious but also doable .",
    "This was a great class. The workload was very light and the material was berg interesting.",
    "If you're someone who doesn't watch the news or keep up with current events, this is a great class to take to learn about a variety of topics that are making up today's headlines. Relatively easy workload and interesting subject matter. It was my first class in the Political Science department, and it makes me want to shop more classes in the area.",
    "To me it is interesting that the class is called International \"Challenges\" of the 21st Century",
    "PLSC 143 01 is a class summarizing and analyzing the current challenges the international community faces. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because understanding the current problems is so relevant.",
    "Discussion was a pain and wasn't run effectively. Conversations weren't fluid, and Samantha tended to over analyze each students comments so no one participated unless they had a well thought out thesis.",
    "Take it. Basically the same as intro IR though.",
    "This is a great class for staying up-to-date on current events and global challenges. I would definitely recommend this class to students who are more scientifically inclined because this class is a refreshing opposite.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who has no prior knowledge to global events. For someone who keeps up with the international challenges around the world, I would not recommend the class, since the class gives a very basic overview of the subject.",
    "A gem of a class. Simply go to the lectures for fun after the midterm (which was easy) or don't if you're busy.",
    "I would recommend this course as a 5th class, especially if you want to gain some understanding of the events happening around the world. No need for any substantial background knowledge, but you leave with an awareness of what's going on in the world and a basis of understanding when reading about current events. Good class.",
    "Yes, definitely take it! You will explore interesting, relevant topics that will make you more prepared to understand and discuss the world out there: problems, conflicts, tensions and dependencies between nations etc.",
    "Take it while you can.",
    "The class is very easy to coast in as long as you take the midterm and final very seriously, but if you do the readings and are attentive, you can get a lot out of the class. Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it provides a great general overall of political issues going on across the globe.",
    "Little that you couldn't get from reading the news.",
    "This class provides a very good overview of international relations topics that everyone should have a basic understanding of.",
    "I would 100% recommend this to another student. All of the material is useful in modern day society and very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - a great \"big ideas\" class.",
    "It is a super brief over view of so many different topics. You also don't need to go to class after the midterm because the final paper is on separate topics. Also, it's called a gut but grading depends on your TA. It's not just a walk in the park for everyone.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this class. I definitely learned a lot about current events and feel like I came out of the class with a better understanding of the nuances of the issues facing the international community than when I came in. It is not an outstanding class, but it requires little formal work and you can learn a lot from it if you put a bit of effort in. I would recommend this class, but only take it if you are interested in political science\/international relations, and not simply because it seems easy.",
    "I would say that International Challenges is an introduction, survey course of different issues throughout the world. I would recommend this class to another student because the topics were interesting and important to learn about. It was also a manageable work load and there wasn't even too much reading for each lecture--a lot of it was just shorter articles.",
    "Take it! It's fun and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Interesting course but very vague, not too difficult, but be warned: my TA was the worst I've had at Yale and all my friends (with different TAs) said the same thing.",
    "Take this course!",
    "Good 5th class to take. super light workload but still interesting enough to make you want to go to class even after the midterm. Enjoyed class every week, and the assessments are fair and allow you to dive into a subject most interesting to you.",
    "If you're a self-starter and will make the best of a class that doesn't require much of you (except for a midterm and final paper), take this class. Otherwise, there's just too much incentive to really not learn all that much... and just \"coast\" until the final paper. For that, I didn't really lovei t.",
    "Yes. Absolutely take this course. Howorth does the best job possible of outlining every issue facing our world today. This is, of course, a daunting task, and there were some regions and issues that he touched on less than others, but overall he did a spectacular job. Howorth is one of my favorite lecturers. Very knowledgeable and very interesting.",
    "PLSC 143 is a brief overview of international challenges, covering one challenge per day. One concern is that very few of the challenges involved developing and non-Western countries. The final class covered \"Africa,\" and discussed the continent vaguely and as if it were monolithic.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes, but only if you're interested in learning about the current global issues that we face and will face in the coming decades. If you're not interested, I wouldn't take it.",
    "An unfulfilling overview of current events. Do not take, especially if you are an upperclassmen as you will have zero motivation to go to classes and section.",
    "Great \"gut\"",
    "Almost zero work, yet one of the most fascinating classes I've ever taken. Would recommend to every single student.",
    "I would recommend the course to people who want to learn about current affairs on a broader spectrum. It might be good for people who want a great intro to the political science department, but I could see where it could be frustrated with someone who is deep into the major, hence its status as an intro class. I found my TF's grading fair and exams decent, so I believe the class would be good for many from a variety of majors, especially STEM looking for a non-STEM credit.",
    "I would recommend the class, saying its a good first semester course for a freshman because it's not too intense and is a good way to get acclimated to learning at Yale. Also, the subject matter was typically interesting.",
    "Very interesting course! Would recommend.",
    "",
    "This a must-take for freshmen and sophomores who are searching for an \"issue\" to study in more depth as upperclassmen at Yale. If you're looking for a quick and wide survey that exposes you to what's happening in the world and how it all connects, this is for you.",
    "Take it if you need an easy fifth class and want to learn about major global challenges that are occurring during our lifetime.",
    "loved this class... very well taught, not a lot of work yet you learn a lot especially from section. topics are super interesting, basically a current events course. MUST TAKE!!",
    "It is like a news show, such as CNN. It is very interesting and relevant to today's issues. I would recommend it!",
    "Great class. Loved it!",
    "This course is very interesting, but you really only get out what you put in. Doing the readings and going to lecture will help you stay engaged with the material, but if not it would be easy to lose track of what is going on as there is only a midterm and final paper.",
    "A big lecture with not much work. The midterm was fairly easy if you studied the lectures or went to class, and the end of term paper is very flexible.",
    "An interesting, low-homework level class for students genuinely interested in current issues.",
    "Very similar to International Relations but with a more updated material. Sometimes too broad and not that interesting.",
    "For me, this class was a survey course in political science which is a really good taste test for going forward in the major. I really enjoyed it and felt I got a lot out of it. There was always something new to learn and discuss, which was exciting. However, it is not a very specific or intense class. It's very much an introduction.",
    "I reccommend this class for its interesting material and easy courseload. The format of midterm and final paper allows you to not attend lecture anytime after the midterm with almost no consequences, making this an excellent 5th class.",
    "Great",
    "This class is really interesting and awesome to take if you want to have a greater understanding of what is happening in the world today. I would definitely recommend this class to others- the workload is very slight and besides going to section every week, it is a very low commitment class.",
    "This is not the most stimulating course. The guest lecturers are interesting, however, the normal lectures are very boring. There is not a heavy work load and the final essay can be very interesting if you chose a topic that you wish to explore further.",
    "A great class if you want an intro to a lot of interesting and very relevant current issues. Prof. Howorth is a very engaging lecturer, but even if you happen to not pay attention, the slides (which usually contain most of the important info) are always posted online after lecture too. There is a fair amount of reading, but you could probably get away without doing all of it (even though you probably should, and they're pretty interesting anyway). The final paper is definitely the \"hardest\" part of the course, but you can also basically pick your own topic so long as it's relevant, so it shouldn't be too difficult to pick a topic you're interested in.",
    "Whoever has the slightest interest in international politics should do nothing but take this class. It is a great introduction to the most pressing issues of our time, but will never be boring to anyone. Even if you have preexisting knowledge on the topics discussed, you will find Professor Howorth's insights enlightening or the assigned readings as valuable sources of deeper understanding. No matter your level of studies, do take this course.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student because it made me more aware of current event and helped me stay more up to date on what was going on in the world around me.",
    "Some interesting topics. Not very demanding workload. Solid fifth class. Enjoyable overall",
    "Good class. Definitely something to take if you want a mildly interesting and easy extra course.",
    "Great class if you want to gain a better understanding of world news",
    "It's a great class and very interesting. i would definitely recommend taking it.",
    "A broad overview of the issues in our present day international society.",
    "I highly recommend for both those seeking anPolitical science major or just want to learn more about the struggles we face on the global stage",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. A lot of people don't come to lecture (especially after the midterm because there is no final exam), but if you do come and pay attention you will come away with useful information about the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - it's very interesting and Professor Howorth is a wonderful lecturer. It's very relevant to real life, and teaches you valuable information about very important problems.",
    "Take it. One midterm, one final paper. New topics every lecture.",
    "If you want to get a thorough understanding of current events, this is a good class for you. I would definitely recommend it to another student, as you learn a lot without a lot of stressful class work.",
    "Great introductory political science course.",
    "An interesting course on relevant political, financial, social, and environmental issues. Reading is not necessary but certainly enhances one's understanding of concepts greatly. Mid-term and final are both fair opportunities. A very enjoyable course overall",
    "This is a solid class. You will get what you put in. I missed one lecture all year and I really tried to pay attention during lecture because I wanted to become more informed on the issues we covered in class. However, there was a big chunk of the class that did not show up to lecture (especially after the first midterm). It really comes down to what you want to get out of it. You have a take home final essay so you do not necessarily need to know EVERY topic covered post-midterm.",
    "Take it for a lighter courseload.",
    "I would recommend PLSC143 to anyone interested in learning more about current affairs.",
    "I would recommend this class because it provides current issues that we as future leaders might need to help solve.",
    "Good 5th class, or if you need a poli sci credit",
    "I would summarize the class as an interesting, but not exhaustive, overview of the challenges that the world faces in the 21st century. I would recommend the class strongly to any prospective poly sci majors or people trying to satisfy distributional requirements, but not someone who's already well versed in most of these topics.",
    "Decent class on current events. Good SO credit. The final paper is a little long (4000 words) but otherwise it's a low workload.",
    "If anyone wants to learn more about the current events happening around the world, even if they're not a polysci major, I would recommend this class.",
    "I would. There is not a huge amount of work, the readings are very interesting, and you learn a lot. Ive become more knowledgeable of a lot of topics which are pressing in todays global order.",
    "This course is a pretty easy basic poli sci class that doesn't have much weekly work beyond reading. You will learn about a number of different and topical issues around the globe but not go in depth on any of them. Overall a decent course if you're looking to fill your schedule.",
    "It's a gut\/ survey course, don't expect to learn anything in depth. Readings were pretty good though, in the form of articles\/ book excerpts.",
    "A good fifth class or for requirements",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to a fellow student, poly sci or not. It was an interesting class with minimal work and proved to be fairly interesting as well.",
    "Really interesting class but the no final hurt class attendance",
    "Great class if you want to learn about what is going on in the world today.",
    "Great class to take if you need a fascinating class with a light workload. Unfortunately your experience depends largely on your TA, but this class will undoubtedly make you a more informed citizen and voter, which is a huge plus.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. I feel like a much better global citizen after taking this course and was able to learn about such a broad range of topics that I now want to take more specific courses regarding things like climate change and terrorism.",
    "Great course",
    "Yes, great intro to important topics. Professor Howorth is so smart and interesting, and the lectures provide a broad overview of the major problems we face today.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. It provides essential knowledge about current topics that any student needs in order to become an engaged citizen of the world.",
    "Current events class, broad but learn details in sections homewroks and lectures.",
    "I would recommend the class only if you want a very superficial understanding of the current issues covered.",
    "Yes",
    "The course is a must for anyone who wants to consider him\/herself a global citizen.",
    "Its a poly sic class that covers a new world topic everyday and it will make you pay closer attention to current world events.",
    "The course was an excellent survey about the issues that confront us in the modern era. I have gained a much greater appreciation for foreign affairs and the intricacies of diplomacy. The professor is an excellent teacher; I enjoyed the guest lecturers (often high profile figures); the final paper was a good way to explore an area of interest in depth. I would recommend this course to those who are (1) new to poli sci, (2) looking for a modern course, or (3) looking for a course that is not too much work.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It is absolutely awesome. The readings could sometimes be a lot, but it didn't usually seem like it because they were all so interesting. It didn't seem like you were doing too much work because you enjoyed it all. howorth ran lecture really well and picked balanced readings that showed many different POVs I think this is one of my favorite classes that I've ever had at yale. If you can, definitely pick Lucas to be your TA. He's the best.",
    "This course goes over various regions of the world and explains how resources and politics function to make the world how it is today.",
    "A very nice broad survey of the world's problems, in case you're totally lost when it comes to current events and feel awkward about your lack of knowledge during parties and discussions but you know you should learn about all this at some point. Lectures are fine, they move very quick, and the section is pretty well-run. A gut poli sci.",
    "Broad survey of 21st century issues. Definitely a 5th gut. Final paper is a good way to explore something that you're really interested in. Not that difficult. Don't have to do the reading if you have a general idea of what is going on in the world."
