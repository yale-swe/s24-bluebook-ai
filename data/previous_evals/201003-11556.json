    "The subject area was fascinating but we went off too many times into Tibetan culture. I'm not sure we ever got to the lectures on sacred mountains or trees b\/c Paul focused so much on the Tibetan experiences.",
    "There was a lot of material on the syllabus that we never covered. Too much focus on Tibet. If the class focuses on Tibet that should be stated on the syllabus or at the opening class when students are making decisions on what courses they are going take. Class needs more structure and more clearly defined research questions and goals.",
    "11. We didn't stick to the syllabus at all, but we were warned that this would happen, and we talked about a lot of other interesting things that weren't in the syllabus. It was wonderful.9. LOVED the trips to the Beineke1. There were no readings for this class. I appreciated this very much. I am very excited to read the Joe Campbell books we got, though!",
    "If you are looking for marketable skills, this is not the class for you. It is a rare humanities-oriented class. The class discusses man's interaction with the world as expressed in mythology, art, religion, etc.",
    "1. Course readings were few and not very rich in fundamental depth3. Out of class assignments should be more engaging than was carried out this semester!4. I think the work load should remain light because it is a one credit course and occurs mi-semester10. I really think that all FES students should take this course because if taught well, it can build skills needed for everyone's career"

   "comments": [
    "I would have liked to have seen more things along the lines of the Alchemist drawings and tarot cards. We could have spent time on the Rachel Carson papers.",
    "Some of the topics on the syllabus looked really interesting, and I wish we had gotten to them.",
    "I would have appreciated a little more focus on the main subject matter presented in the syllabus, although I enjoyed the material discussed in class.",
    "The discussion in class got a little too tangential at times, it would have been nice to stay focused on the main course content.",
    "1. THE STRUCTURE OF THE LECTURES SHOULD BE REVIEWED TO IMBIBE A STRONGER COMBINATION OF ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL CONTENT.2. Though the instructor has a great personality and high facilitation skills and I like her very much, I think she either needs a support instructor or someone else should take teach this course from a perspective that incorporates academic reasoning, practical conflict management experience and professional ethics; in a bid to optimize the 5 weeks of this course.3. This course should also take numerous practical scenarios into consideration during discussions - such as conflict management in - tough security situations, difficult physical terrain, language barriers, situations with inherent limitations such as political bias and other biases, humans versus ecosystems; etc.",
    "The flow of the lectures. Each lecture should be unique and follow the syllabus."

    "I wanted to begin to think about how cultures understand their relationship with the natural world and how that understanding leads them to ritualistic responses.",
    "It is the only class that has anything to do with the arts as they relate to the environment (outside of independent studies). As this is my main interest, this class is the most relevant one offered at FES. However, it has been great fun applying what I have learned in this class to other classes in order to develop a great understanding of my own interests.",
    "This course provided insight into topics that underlie much of the philosophy of FES and the environmental movement -and how the human-nature relationship is addressed in both western and eastern cultures. I found it very relevant and a wonderful compliment to other FES courses that are often presented from a single worldview.",
    "I am looking to develop skills that will enable me to be a solution manager in the field of society, environment and development. I already have about 3 years experience in Conflict Management for government, civil society and private sector and looked forward to obtaining grad depth of conflict management. This course perfectly fits into my MEM degree in Social Ecology of Conservation and Development.",
