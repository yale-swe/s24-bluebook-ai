    "Well, if you want to take French you kind of have to take this class. Annabel's a great teacher though! She's dramatic, fun, and pushed us to be our best...",
    "Yes. This is a great continuation of L1- if you are serious about learing French then you should take it.",
    "Yes. The Yale french program is wonderful and I can passably speak french after less than a year.",
    "Don't take this class unless you are unusually good at reading people minds and picking up a language in context. While the French language is really fun, French in Action is NOT the way to learn it.",
    "Annabel was very good but I have mixed feeling about French in Action. French in Action was effective for me in L1 but by L2, the length of the homework gets ridiculously long even though I feel like we covered about the same amount of new material as L1 so in the end, everyone gave up and just copied the answers in the back. Also, the weekly quizzes, tests, and videos can get very tedious. Still, I was able to enjoy it because Annabel was such an enthusiastic, personable instructor. She made French fun and we learned a lot about current French culture through music videos and food. Our exercises during class were also goofy and often, French with Annabel let me kick off my early morning to a good start.",
    "You have to take it to get credit for L1. So take it. It's a lot of verb tenses. If Anabel's still teaching and you think really logically and\/or grammatically you should try to get her. She's superb. Otherwise Graves is awesome!",
    "Take French 120 because otherwise you won't get credit for French110. That being said, you should really take both, because with the one-year sequence, you'll learn a lot. I didn't know a word of French before this class, and now I feel as if I understand so much. The weekly afternoon tests are kind of annoying, but I see how they make you learn and study.",
    "Annabel is an excellent instructor and I urge anyone interested in learning French for the first time to take her class. She is very knowledgeable of the language and dedicates herself completely to the class. With interactive classroom exercises and online detailed explanations, all of your questions will be answered. She makes sure to prep us well for the weekly tests\/quizzes, without ever speaking English... I would say her and Ngame are the best instructors in the L1\/L2 French department. AAs with all other L2 sections, expect a lot of time dedicated to homework and test prep. It's definitely the course that took up most of my time this semester, but I enjoyed it immensely and my French has improved a lot..."
