   "comments": [
    "You learn a lot of birds and have to study a lot of birds a lot. I would recommend it, but only if you have a serious interest in the topic.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Science has come a long, long way since the days of committing dead specimens to memory (in latin, nonetheless) and modern evo bio courses should reflect this.",
    "Fun but a lot of memorization. After taking the class I am proud of what I learned.",
    "This class involves listening to lectures about bird phylogenetics, and looking at amazing specimens to learn how to memorize them. I didn't mind the necessary memorization, and I would recommend the class, but be warned that Rick Prum is quite difficult to be around.",
    "Prum described the lab as \"intellectual hazing\" at the beginning of the year. This is accurate in a certain sense\u2014you just have to learn a whole lot of latin names. But you'll also feel accomplished at the end of the semester. Birds are pretty cool, and it's great to get to work with specimens from the Peabody! I'd recommend this lab to another student.",
    "Like all EEB organismal classes at Yale, I recommend the class, and I STRONGLY recommend taking the lab with it. The small number of students in it always form a great community around the field trips, difficulties of learning so many taxa, and generally informal environment.",
    "This lab was pretty good, but not one of the best EEB labs. It entailed a LOT of memorization that didn't seem ultimately that useful. I was hoping to learn more field identification of North American birds, but ended up learning how to identify dead specimens and memorizing the family names of random birds that I'll probably never see. And while the lecture is really interdisciplinary and draws and a wealth of information, the lab is almost entirely based on examining and identifying specimens from the Peabody. And although Prum is an awesome lecturer (probably the best I've had), he's not super personable and can be somewhat frustrating in a one-on-one context. Overall, good course, though. I definitely know a lot more avian families than I did before.",
    "The lab for ornithology is a great class that surveys the diversity of birds throughout the world. You get to spend lots of time with amazing specimens that are often rare and one unique thing about taking this course at Yale (the first time you see a shoebill, believe me, you will be impressed). The class consists of a large amount of memorization which is really too bad. For such an interesting and dynamic field I found it sad that we were learning classification that was changing right under our very eyes and will continue to change. Thus memorizing classification felt like a waste of time to me. You do learn a lot about birds of the world and the lab is a great supplement to the lecture. By taking the lab I felt like I understood many concepts from the lecture much better. If you take this class be prepared for lots of memorization, and try to learn each week\u2019s birds a you go or else the exams will be hell. Also, beware the Professor Prum, while very knowledgeable about the material, is difficult to work with or have any sort of relationship with. His attitude is difficult to deal with at times and don\u2019t expect to have your questions answered. Over all I would recommend the class but with some reservations. Just be prepared for what you\u2019re getting yourself into. I think that if the course were to go a few significant changes it would be fantastic."
