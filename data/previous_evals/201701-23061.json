    "It was useful in gaining a background in this particular field of study and strengthening my understanding of key sociological concepts!",
    "This class in addressing how social theory not only theorized but also was shaped by trauma was really great at teaching how theory is historically situated and shaped",
    "This course was very interesting. I learned about sociological terms and topics which I had previously not known about before.",
    "I took this course without any knowledge of sociology, but I feel that by the end of the course I have learned a lot about social theory and memory studies in particular."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the readings and discussions! The engagement with film was nice as well. It was hard to discuss things when people didn't do the reading but that's hard to work around.",
    "I think sometimes the discussion wasn't as in depth as it could have been because people all wanted to bring their very specific knowledge and expertise to the discussion. While this knowledge is cool, sometimes I wished we delved more deeply and directly into the text, maybe through establishing an area or question of inquiry and then sticking with that for a while.",
    "Each week's discussions were very interesting and fun to take part in. Each student was very engaged in the reading and it was a very interesting topic to discuss. The readings each week were very informative and interesting as well. The summaries each of us had to write really helped me focus on the the main aspects of our readings, which could sometimes get a bit long."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great class that is accessible to undergrads and useful for any social science\/humanities\/any majors! Ron is also a superstar!",
    "Yes, the readings and subject matter is great if you are interested in memory, history as a discourse, and cultural sociology. The discussions are not always super structured but as with seminars in general, if it is a good group of students that dictated the quality of the discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student willing to take part in lively discussions every week.",
    "Yes, this class gives a foundational understanding of theories that can be used in a variety of contexts. The class is as much as you put into it and if you are willing to put in the time and to ask and answer questions in class, you will get a lot out of this course.",
    "Not only would I recommend this course to others, but I have already recommended it to everyone interested."
