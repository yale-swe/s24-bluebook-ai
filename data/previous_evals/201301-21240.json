    "I would recommend it to a student. Especially if one is interested in philosophy of language, one has to deal with the topic sooner or later. Since this seminar gives a comprehensive overview in an enjoyable way, it is perfect to grasp this important topic.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course for someone interested in pragmatic theory - I can't think of anyone with such an interest who wouldn't find it extremely rewarding. I would warn them that it moves moderately fast however and that it involves quite a lot of reading. I would warn them too not to expect very much group discussion."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very helpful for me as it brought together disparate bits of knowledge I had on the area and helped me synthesise them. It left me feeling more on top of the area than before, though also somewhat daunted at how much more there is to learn and how detailed and specific these areas can become. One of the most useful things it did for me was point me towards new areas that I have not had much contact with in the past but that I am now very keen to read up on."
