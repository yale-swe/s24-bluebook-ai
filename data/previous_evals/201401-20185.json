    "This is the best class I've had at YLS",
    "Prof. Gluck is great - enthusiastic, responsive, and insightful. This class provided a really good overview of healthcare reform, and the guests were really engaging people involved with different aspects of healthcare law. I only wish that we could've spent more time on some of the topics we covered towards the end of the class (public health law, bioethics, etc.). Definitely worth taking if you have any interest in health law!",
    "For someone like me with only a bit of prior experience and knowledge in health care, this class was an amazing learning experience. Though we had a lot of reading, most of it was interesting and I got a lot out of doing the vast majority of the reading. Professor Gluck did a great job of structuring the class (in terms of sequence of topics), and she managed to find some really amazing speakers and guest lecturers, which were the highlights of the class. We covered a lot of material, but there were many topics in health law that we could not get to due to time constraints. The only downside to this class (besides the sheer amount of reading) was that we had to come up with paper topics relatively earlier on in the semester. For me, it was difficult to come up with a paper topic, having had only a little previous knowledge to draw upon, but I chose to explore one particular topic covered in one of the earlier classes and it worked out just fine. Professor Gluck was very helpful with her feedback, really responsive by email, and generally available outside of class. She held a lot of office hours because she was also teaching a large lecture class concurrently, and her office hour slots would fill up quickly because she is so helpful and willing to talk with students outside of class. However, I appreciated the fact that she held a LOT of office hours despite being one of the busiest professors I know, and I also really appreciated how she reserved some specific time slots for her Health Law students, especially when it was time to decide on paper topics. Over all, this class was a spectacular learning experience for me - it did a great job of touching the basics of a wide range of topics in health law.",
    "I understand why so much of the reading was front-loaded this term, but that should be avoided in the future because it was impossible to get through all of the reading. There were also a few instances when the readings felt duplicative. Otherwise, I thought it was a great course. I really enjoyed the guest speakers and hearing other students' summaries of the readings and paper presentations.",
    "Very interesting class. I wish we had more class time each week so we could take better advantage of the speakers and have a more engaging discussion.",
    "Great guest speakers were the highlight of this class. Good opportunity to write a health law paper. A little bit like drinking from a fire hose in terms of the breadth of topics and material covered, but really interesting course",
    "I loved this class. It was a great intro to health law for someone who knew nothing (like me) but I learned a ton from other students who were more knowledgeable as well as from Prof. Gluck. We all wrote papers, which I think made it difficult for Prof. Gluck to meet with us all as much as she would have liked to (and she was also teaching a large lecture class at the time as well.) That was the one downside to an otherwise amazing class. Great guest speakers as well.",
    "Professor gluck was very flexible about our papers. Really excited to get feedback from her. I appreciated guest lecturers but also wanted to see Professor Gluck lecturing or leading discussion more as well.",
    "This class had two parts: an introductory series on different parts of the health care system and a speaker\/discussion series on various law-related topics. The speakers were phenomenal--extremely knowledgeable and candid. The introductory classes were not as interesting and our class discussions in that era were much less productive. Professor Gluck is so enthusiastic and I learned a ton from this class. Highly recommended.",
    "The ratio of the amount of assigned reading to the opportunity to discuss it (in class, in short papers, etc.) was way too high. For example, in guest speaker weeks, there might be 200 pages of material with only the opportunity to ask one question. Either clearly specifying which material was \"required\" versus \"recommended,\" or requesting longer, less frequent responses (that require you to do more synthesis across the readings) could be helpful changes for the next iteration of this course. The materials also varied considerably in quality. Some of the academic papers and casebook excerpts were fascinating; others were deadly boring (even for someone keenly interested in the field) or repetitive. The material could be cut in half while communicating just as much information. Now for the good stuff: the speakers were fascinating. Professor Gluck is a brilliant, outstanding, caring teacher from whom everyone at the law school should try to take a class. And the quality of class discussion was regularly very high. All in all, it was a very valuable experience that I would sign up for again in a heartbeat."
