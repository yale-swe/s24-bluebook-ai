    "H&P might be the best of the first semester. Every reading is great: Herodotus vs. Thucydides, Plato vs. Aristotle, the Romans, the Christians - it's a roller coaster ride of fun. You find out that 300 is far more accurate than you expected and you get to read about the Hannibal crossing the Alps with the elephants! What could possibly be better! The only weakness is that there's a ton to read. But (almost) all of it is interesting.",
    "DS is an excellent way to read the classics of the Western canon.",
    "Good content, but too much dry reading. You'll only get through if you learn to skim.",
    "I recommend it because it's a bootcamp type of class where you really learn how to think and write. Dr Slanski is very demanding and makes you really engage with the text. If you're not up to the challenge, this class is not for you. Definitely the hardest of my 3 DS classes.",
    "There is a ton of reading to do in this class, and it becomes very hard to keep up by the time the class reaches the Roman historians. It's important to focus in on the important sections and themes from each work. Although Slanski is very intimidating at first, she is a very intelligent professor and a really nice person. She is flexible with deadlines if you need some extra time. She focuses mostly on the politics part of H&P, and not much time is devoted to history.",
    "It is highly useful for someone not entirely sure about his or her western ancient histories.",
    "DS H&P is a combination of reading Greek and Roman historians and political philosophers. The central idea of the course seems to be the intersection of history and politics - it's really exciting when a moment in which that comes blatantly to the front of the text appears. Every one of the texts has good moments. This is a course that is worth putting a lot of work into. I would definitely recommend it."
