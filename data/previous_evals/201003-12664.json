   "comments": [
    "It's undergraduate-light and graduate heavy, but after a while you'll forget about age and think only about Russia.",
    "Intensive Russian is self-explanatory, but it is one of the best courses that I have taken. While challenging, it has the best faculty assigned to it (in the course of studying 5 languages over more than a decade, Constantin is the best language professor I have ever had), and though the class takes a staggering number of hours each week, one learns Russian not in steps but in leaps and bounds. There is no other way to take a language; in the course of one calendar year, one can go from no experience to taking literature courses. If one can put in the hours, I cannot recommend this class highly enough.",
    "I would recommend the class to highly motivated students or to those who already know a Slavic language. The class teaches you a lot, but the workload is enormous, even compared to other intensive language classes.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Its workload is very manageable (comparable to normal L1 Chinese, in my experience) but you really do learn alot very fast. I mean, between this course and the summer program, you can be fluent (in the words of Muravnik) in one calendar year. That's awesome!",
    "I would absolutely recommend Russian 125 01 to any of my fellow students. It is the perfect course for a student to take who truly desires to learn Russian and is not intimidated by the work load.",
    "Excellent class, but be prepared to work hard outside of the classroom. If you work at it, you'll get a lot out of it."
