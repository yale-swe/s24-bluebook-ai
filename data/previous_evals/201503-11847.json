   "comments": [
    "Great writing class about love. Take this if you love love.",
    "Very intriguing and eye opening. Also very helpful for future classes and an awesome class to improve and learn writing skills. I would recommend this class because it is an easy, fun way to improve your writing for many classes.",
    "Common topics in an interesting light",
    "Take 114 if you have no writing experience before. It will help you learn academic writing. There is less content you get other than that.",
    "English 114 is a class you should take to thin the membrane between your emotions and the message you communicate. I would recommend it to anyone for this very reason; emotive writing can be academic and in and of itself can be as important as academic writing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend English 114 19 to a fellow student. Even though it was a time-intensive class, it was certainly quite interesting.",
    "ENGL 114 19 is an introductory college writing course for everyone. It teaches four major genres to students: analytical writing, argumentative writing, research-based writing, and creative writing. Along with those areas, ENGL 114 encourages grammatical and stylistic improvement. It also teaches up-to-date research methods that are effective in papers in both the sciences and the humanities. The Love, Romance, and Desire section presents love in a pertinent and philosophical manner. There is high demand for this course knowing that the student engages with a topic very dear to him\/her, while actively improving a skill that will last him\/her a lifetime. I recommend this specific course for its especially intriguing topic, as well as for its memorable impact on the student's writing. Clarity and argument will improve. Grammar and style will improve. And the student will be satisfied.",
    "This was a very interesting writing course with different levels of writing and materials to analyze. I really enjoyed writing about the movie \"Her\" and doing research for the research paper. The instructor was always very kind and helped teach how to write. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an introductory writing course that is engaging and creative.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 114 to another student if he or she felt he was insufficiently prepared for English at Yale."
