    "Absolutely. DS Lit is really what made the Directed Studies experience worth it for me. The heart of the curriculum, in my opinion. Much more reading than any other third of DS but easily the most engaging.",
    "Overall, I loved this class because it was engaging, had a well-chosen reading syllabus, and didn't claim to be a complete overview of its content material. I welcome that Directed Studies continues to be an ever-evolving program that refuses to leave behind the classics but also increasingly places these works in their historical context and modern context. Professor Roffman is an excellent instructor who cares deeply about the material she covers and her students. Definitely take DS and if Professor Roffman is teaching, take her section!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. War and Peace and Don Quixote are probably the two best books that I have ever read.",
    "I would recommend Spring DS Lit to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend DS - it's a great program.",
    "Would recommend",
    "Directed Studies Literature (DRST 002 03) is a course that examines a carefully and creatively selected oeuvre of the Western canon from the period between the early seventeenth century and the early twentieth century. This course offers member students the opportunity to evaluate the depth and complexity of an appreciable variety of European literary works that are each deserving of a particular esteem and acclaim. I would highly recommend this course to any student who is pursuing an understanding of the contributions to world literature that have been achieved and produced by European writers and literary artists between the dawn of the Age of Discovery and the eclipse of European civilization in the wake of the First World War.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in literature who is looking to improve their broad knowledge and familiarity with a large (but certainly incomplete) part of the Western Canon. I would also recommend it to students looking to improve their reading, writing, and class discussion skills, as the quick pace and intensity of the class really forces progress in each of these areas."
