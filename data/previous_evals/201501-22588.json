   "comments": [
    "I came in as someone who was always interested in policy but never took a policy course. I came out of the course--having written three policy memos and a policy proposal--primed to think like a policymaker when I look at the issues in the world around me. Reading isn't too much, workload isn't excessive, lectures are alright.",
    "Very good introduction to the key issues that policymakers in the United States work on. The course arguably tried to fit too much material into the lectures, but then again, its really difficult to cover all of American Public Policy without doing so. The assignments are not difficult if you ask your TA at the beginning what he\/she likes to see in a memo\/paper. definitely choose writing-intensive section. you get 2 chances to do well on each memo, and you write a 8-10 page paper on a topic you're interested in rather than take an exam that covers a boatload of material and readings that you (frankly) may not do",
    "While the lectures and readings make the course seem like a broad survey course of every major issue in US politics - which it is - the policy memos really help to focus you in on more of the depth to each issue and how the politics and policies discussed in class really come together when you're trying to solve a problem. And yes, Hacker will ask you to solve healthcare in a 5pg memo. Take this class if you like politics, especially of the US kind, or just generally want to be able to speak more informedly about the country you live in.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in public policy.",
    "This is a must-take for non poly sci majors. I wanted to get exposure to the field, and I was able to do so with interesting material and a great teacher. I learned about healthcare, incarceration, global warming, and other topics. There were knowledgeable guest lectures as well. A good amount of writing and not super easy grading, but a good class nonetheless.",
    "PLSC 214 is an opportunity to very deeply engage with many areas of public policy. Through the policy memos, students gain very substantial knowledge on topics such as healthcare, climate policy, and budgetary policy. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes, a great writing credit. I think this class made me much more informed about and interested in US policy.",
    "You learn how to write a policy memo but like u could do that in a lot of better classes",
    "Survey public policy course that covers substance and political obstacles to enact effective policies specifically relating to Healthcare, Environmental Regulation, and Budgetary politics. Worth taking for anyone who is interested in working in gov't, but if you are just looking for a fifth class, you probably won't get that much out of it.",
    "PLSC 214 is a good course about big issues in national politics. Professor Hacker is a very enthusiastic lecturer, and class is enjoyable. Because the topic is so broad, we can't go into very much detail, so this is more of an intro course.",
    "Phenomenal class. It will make you rethink your career focus.",
    "This class focuses on the politics, rather than the policy, of the US, and highlights the works of some really pivotal political scientists. Memo writing is a really helpful skill, and this class helps you develop it! Definitely recommend it if you want to learn about political nuances of US governance, but not if you want to know the nuances of particular policies.",
    "The class offers a broad overview of a few policy topics (health care, climate change, the tax system) with some political science thrown in. The assignments consist of policy memos, which are pretty easy to bang out. If you're looking for depth, I would look elsewhere. If you're looking for a low to medium (depending on how much of the reading you decide to do) workload political science course with a nice prof, you should consider this.",
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Take take take take. Jacob Hacker is the man and he's a really effective lecturer. Three 5-pg papers, section, final OR final paper. TFs are generally good and they normalize the grading so it's aight. If you care about POLICY, take this and learn substantive information about cool topics and how to link academic concepts to real-life examples and cases.",
    "Take it if you want to get a stronger background on public policy in the U.S. If you have no formal background in political science and\/or economics you may find the memos difficult, but there is definitely a learning curve. The lectures are great.",
    "This is a good class for an introduction to politics and to keep up with current events. Take it WI, because that will give you a chance to edit the assignments and do a final paper instead of the final, although the final exam wasn't too difficult.",
    "good but requires A LOT of work",
    "This is a great class to take to learn about politics and policy. The class is structured well, the material is interesting, and Prof. Hacker is a gem. The policy memos are fun to write, and if you take the writing section you get to do two drafts of each, which is nice. Overall, I really came out of this class feeling that I learned a lot and now have a tighter grasp on the inner workings of politics and policy making.",
    "Solid course for learning some of the major political topics (climate change, healthcare, and budget proposals), and the fundamental functions of the American political system. You will come away from this course being able to write a policy memo, and also have a strong understanding of some of the major partisan issues in the U.S., and how our political system navigates around this.",
    "Yes, take it! I think this is knowledge that every American should have. Definitely take the writing section, as you get to revise your 3 memos and write a final paper rather than take an exam.",
    "useful polisci class to galvanize one's understanding of policy and government as it applies to contemporary issues",
    "Good intro to public policy. You can learn a ton from the \"public policy\" textbook. Lectures could start to blur into a left-leaning graph-filled mash-up, but the class is new and I believe has a ton of potential.",
    "If you want an easy Poli Sci class, don't take this one. If you want a breathtaking, historically grounded, combination of theory and empirics, take this class. I understand the way American politics really works so much better now than I did beforehand, and I would really recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject and ready to work to understand it better. The syllabus was rich, and balanced delicately between theory and case studies. The course packs a lot of punch in not a whole lot of reading. It combines breadth and depth without being overwhelming. As a warning, Hacker's policy memo assignments are no joke. They were some of the most demanding short papers I've ever written here. If you're ready to dig in and learn with one of Yale's best professors, take this class. Hacker is a great lecturer, so you won't be bored.",
    "Really enjoyed this survey course of contemporary policy issues facing members of our elected office and people interested in government.",
    "A great overview of American politics and its impact on policy.",
    "Don't take with an Econ background. Really, just don't take. I want to go into policy (and still do, somehow) but this class did nothing to prepare me. And kind of made me hate policy for a few months.",
    "Interesting Content: 9\/10 Engaging Professor 9\/10 Jokes: 4\/10",
    "Absolutely fantastic class taught by one of the most engaging and energetic professors at Yale. The course is a fascinating combination of public policy and political science, and focuses especially on how political considerations and factors shape and constrain congressional policy. Professor Hacker is an extraordinary teacher, who is not only extremely knowledgeable about public policy, but is actively involved in national policy debates (he was known as the \"father\" of the public option during the healthcare debate in 2009). Too, he knows how to give a great lecture and keeps students consistently engaged for 50 minutes twice a week. The workload was typical for a political science lecture, with more emphasis on policy analysis than political science research or scholarship. The class would be especially useful for freshmen and sophomores who want a broad overview of policy-oriented political science, but even a junior or senior political science major could enjoy and learn from the course. If you are at all interested in public policy politics, take this class. I can't recommend it enough."
