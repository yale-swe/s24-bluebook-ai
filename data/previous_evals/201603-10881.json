    "I really loved this class. It helped me develop my reading skills, presentation skills, as well as my ability to convey arguments in French.",
    "Great discussion of current topics in complex ways, a somewhat-novel experience for me in French",
    "This course let you learn a little bit about everything France. This course was very helpful in drawing parallels between the US and France, which made it easier to learn about France. It certainly made me a better French student, though I think a large part of that had to do with my teacher.",
    "This course really pushed me to improve in my oral comprehension and speaking ability. The jump from Fren 150 to 160 is large, and required a lot of work but all of a sudden I feel I am able to talk about very complicated nuanced issues in French. My writing also improved because Mme Monfleur was a harsh grader who pushed me to always create better work.",
    "Improved fluency and facility with written and spoken French, as well as advanced understanding of multiple dimensions of francophone culture.",
    "I learned a lot about French culture and everyday political and economic situations in France today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course lied in its dynamic pace and its very engaging tasks throughout the semester. One weakness I noticed was that after seeing movies, we only designated one day to it and could have spent more time going over it.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, solid material, not always too much reading, small class size Weaknesses: could be supplemented with more conversational time outside of class, syllabus implies rigorous pace so not much time for exploration of themes",
    "This course moved at just the right pace- it let us explore topics to a good degree but was never boring. This course let us learn from so many different types of media- articles, TV interviews, movies, textbook readings, national surveys, documentaries- which was certainly a strength of the course.",
    "I love the format of this course. Being able to read about interesting political\/social phenomena and then come to class to talk about them is so fun. This course is difficult in that there are multiple individualized assignments that require huge amounts of work and preparation, and you never know whether or not those will align with exams, so there were certain times in the semester when the workload was enormous, and certain times when it wasn't. However, all in all Fren 160 is a great course with a great syllabus and a demanding pace.",
    "Excessive workload. For me, the most valuable aspect of the course was the in-class discussion that allowed students to practice conversing and debating in French, rather than the barrage of written homework assignments.",
    "This class is extremely engaging during class time and the readings are extremely interesting."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I recommend the course to students interested in improving their speaking skills and knowledge of French culture.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to take their French to the next level. Even though one may think that the course is geared strictly for people who want to learn about French culture, there is a place for everybody to grow and develop their French language skills.",
    "Yes, good for improving grammar, discussing complex issues in a foreign language, and familiarizing oneself with French culture",
    "If you have the appropriate French background coming into this class, I would recommend this class to any one who wants to study French at a high level. It is unlike any other L5 French class in the way that it focuses on culture, history, and current events. This course lets you learn a little bit about everything rather than some other L5 French classes that teach you a lot about a specific topic.",
    "Yes! This class is a ton of work, like most French classes at Yale, but if you like to speak French and are interested in French culture this is the perfect class.",
    "Yes -- The class is excellent for an intensive French experience and very valuable for improving language skills. My complaint is that the workload can be impractical when taken alongside other demanding courses, and that the emphasis on class participation verges on aggressive. I completely understand the importance of speaking consistently in French to improving those skills, but the weight of this requirement in determining grades does privilege certain learning styles over others, and can deny the value of thoughtful listening, which tends to be undervalued in most courses and in society as a whole.",
    "I would definitive recommend this course. The material was engaging and class time was very interesting and discussion orientated. The class is small so the conversation is comfortable. Overall an excellent course for improving speaking skills."
