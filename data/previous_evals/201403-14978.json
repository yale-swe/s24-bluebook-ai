    "Absolutely take it. You will learn so much, and take skills away that you will be able to apply to whatever aspect of the social sciences interests you.",
    "I recommend this class to someone who has strong quantitative skills, is interested in the theory behind economic policy-making, and who prefers a heavy reading load than heavy writing.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Rosenbluth is simply brilliant, and she translates that into an incredible seminar -- the time and dedication she puts into her teaching is obvious. Her pedagogy, combined with a carefully curated syllabus that covers the crucial elements of the literature clearly and concisely, makes this seminar a delight to attend every week, even at 9:25am on a Friday. Unlike other combined grad-undergrad seminars, the graduate students did not dominate this class, making discussion much more engaging for the undergraduates. Perhaps most importantly, I left this class with the feeling that I had a strong grasp of the methodology of the field and could apply that in the future, which is extremely important as a Political Science major looking forward to the senior essay. In short: take it. I learned an incredible amount about political economy, and I reached the end of the semester wishing it hadn't come to a close so soon.",
    "Take this class! If you have any initial interest in the topic, this seminar will teach you about all its most interesting aspects."
