    "Good course. Would have been great to try to make things a little more interactive. It can be hard to focus during a 2 hour lecture if some time isn't taken for discussion.",
    "It was a good class and very informative. I would have liked to see more guest speakers - I found those lectures the most engaging and offered a great perspective on applications of this course. A brief break halfway through the class would have been nice to break up the content and give my brain a break. Something to keep in mind for next semester! I enjoyed giving the final presentation and the work that led up to it.",
    "This was the first time the course was offered so they were definitely working out the details of the course as we went along. The instructors were great at getting feedback which was great. Some lectures were much better than others at lecturing, the guest lectures were much better than instructor lectures.",
    "I certainly gained a lot from this class. A few weaknesses must be expressed in order to benefit future students - The overall structure of the course was good in terms of topics and assignments. However, during a few lecture themselves, I felt were a bit lacking in terms of student involvement. I feel that the structure of this class would be better suited to a more discussion based approach for at least half of the class. Perhaps the instructor could lecture for 1 hour and then the other hour could be spent discussing issues regarding the topic of the week, including potential case studies and larger themes throughout the class. - IN terms of larger themes throughout the class, yes we know from the title that WASH will be the focus, but what about this? What skills in dealing with WASH issues would you like us students to gain from the class? Deciding the direction of the class by answering these questions would help bump up the continuity factor as well as empowering students who will be dealing with WASH in one form or another in their future careers. - For strengths, the guest lecturer from the CT DPH was excellent and definitely provided some fascinating insights. Please bring her back for future classes. - Finally, I would really enjoy a lecture on international development and current global efforts to ameliorate the burden of WASH issues in LMICs. I feel like this topic is most useful to public health\/policy\/MBA students.",
    "I think the course could have been so much better if the instructors tried to incorporate the presentation through out the semester instead of at the end. The presentation provided for great case studies that could have facilitated class discussion. Also, I felt like there was no point to the weekly response after a while -- you just got a check no matter what.",
    "It was very obvious throughout the semester that this was a brand new YSPH course. The class topics were very broad. I wish they were more specialized. I don't feel like I learned anything new from taking this course."

    "Instructor: Elsio Wunder \u00a0Prof. Wunder is really great. Very response to student concerns, very nice, and clearly has a strong interest in the subject.",
    "Instructor: Elsio Wunder \u00a0I enjoyed Elsio's lectures and he was good at engaging the class in discussion",
    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0Ying was a good instructor. I enjoyed her lectures but wished she'd been more confident in the material she presented. I did not enjoy Iris' lectures. Her content was not relevant and she did not know many facts and pertinent details.",
    "Instructor: Ying Chen \u00a0While Professor Chen tried her best, she announced numerous times throughout the course that this subject of water and sanitation was relatively new to her and that she was learning with us. Hearing this throughout the semester made me feel a little uneasy. I would prefer to be taught by someone more knowledgeable in this area. However, I did appreciate her willingness to both learn and teach new subject material."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for a fellow student. It's not some time-intensive as some other courses at YSPH, the material is generally interesting. I would especially recommend it if the instructors were planning to re-tool it a bit for next year and make it a bit more discussion based.",
    "I especially enjoyed the case study portion of the course and liked how open ended it was. Not much work required. Very broad course topics",
    "Overall, I definitely gained a great deal from this class and hope that you will Incorporate my comments in the future. Thanks!",
    "If you're looking for an easy course to take, look no further. This course is about as easy as it gets for a graduate level course. The course grades were based off of participation, weekly one page responses, a final group presentation, and a final grant proposal. All of these assignments required very minimal effort."
