    "MATH 120 is the study of calculus in three dimensions. It covers vectors, 3D geometry, double and triple integrals, and vector calculus. I would recommend this class for anyone who is mathematically-inclined or is curious about the applications of multivariable calculus. If you're not curious and you're not particularly adept at math, you probably shouldn't take this class.",
    "Take it if you need it or are really interested in math. It's a tough course but it's possible to learn everything and do well. Expect to study a lot unless math is extremely easy for you.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the material for the course, but it may not be as enjoyable to students who don't enjoy math. If you're just taking it for the credit, it might seem a lot harder.",
    "If you're going to take Math 120, take it with Jose. He is just the greatest, must supportive professor out there. He was always willing to meet up with us outside of class, even outside of office hours. I'm almost certain that everyone in our section was able to understand all the material. Seeing that most people who take this class have to be taking it, it is incredibly helpful to have such an enthusiastic supportive professor.",
    "I would only recomend this course if you must take it. It is very advanced and may not be for everyone. It is doable though and if you work at it you will get it.",
    "Math 120 is can be very difficult but it is definitely manageable.",
    "I would not recommend MATH 120 to another student, especially a pre-med who needs to maintain a high GPA.",
    "You gotta take it. Not a hard class. No curve so study up.",
    "I would recommend it only if that person were willing to pursue a math major or knew they were very good at exam taking.",
    "This is a challenging class. Doing well in Calc BC does not necessarily mean that you will do well in this class. I am not discouraging anybody from taking it, because I personally feel like I gained a lot from the challenge that it presented me and I am also happy with the skills it taught me. You'll have to be pretty creative and clever with how you approach problems; the days of rote memorization and applying formulas are long gone. You'll have to be pretty comfortable with visualizing curves and surfaces in 3D, as well. If you do decide to take this class, though, I would definitely recommend Jose. He is one of the nicest people you will ever meet, and you'll be happy to attend his lectures.",
    "Standard multivariable course. Starts out very easy but at about the second midterm things get pretty confusing. Also the curve is brutal; everyone seems to do very well in exams and problem sets so be very very careful. Homework isn't much - just problems from the textbook every week and also solutions can be found online so don't waste your time there. Jose is extremely nice - he's always available for help and always encourages us to go for his office hours (he has them 4 times a week). Others say he explains things clearly and is pretty good; however I found that most classes involved mainly copying out examples directly from the textbook - so seriously if you want to just skip the section and read from the book (which isn't very good, but still). If you're looking for a more theoretical or conceptual approach to math you're probably not going to find it here. To do well in this class you need a very good understanding of the material and how to apply what you've learnt to problems in the exams (which were pretty interesting and fun actually - but then again of course the problem therefore is that if you just read the few meagre examples in the text you probably won't understand the concepts very well and hence probably get stuck along the way). So practice, practice and practice. Do the practice exams and problems and homework and whatever and try to get a good understanding of how things work (especially in the later third of the class when things get interesting). Unfortunately you can't just sit in class and expect to do well. Go for Havlickova's review sessions - she's the best and you learn things there that you never did in section. Also don't fall behind - everything builds on everything else (especially when you get to the integration) and this class is pretty fast paced. You have been warned.",
    "Don't take it if you don't need to, but if you do, Make sure to get Miki or Jos.",
    "Very hard and covers a lot of material in a short period of time. I would only recommend it to someone who has either taken the course before or is incredibly confident in their math skills.",
    "Math 120 is difficult if you don't keep up with the concepts. I enjoyed parts of the class but would have enjoyed it more if i had taken the time to understand the problems sets and lectures more fully.",
    "Do not take this class unless you genuinely enjoy learning the material taught. Otherwise, you will not go to class, and the course will gradually and subversively corrode your sanity. That's pretty much it.",
    "Hard but not that hard ."
