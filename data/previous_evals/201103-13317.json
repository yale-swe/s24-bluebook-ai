   "comments": [
    "It's what you expect in an English Literature course more-or-less. You get better at analyzing literature and get better at writing. Choose it by whether you think you'd be interested in reading the texts that will be studied.",
    "Yes. It's a solid intro literature course with interesting readings and topics that let you broaden your thinking. Also, Komorowski is awesome, so take this class with him if you decide to take ENGL 115. The workload is manageable, though the readings got a bit heavy toward the end of the semester. Still, you'll get a lot out of it and really improve your writing. Great class.",
    "I'm not sure if the freshman seminar literature courses are always of this size, but my particular class was incredibly small. While some students may prefer this much attention and opportunity to contribute in class discussions, other might enjoy a larger class with more a lecture-type feel.",
    "This is a good way to start out your study of literature and\/or get a WR credit freshman year. While there were considerable amounts of reading and writing, the course load was certainly manageable. Professor Komorowski is really nice and approachable and gives great feedback on papers. You generally must send him a draft of your paper before submitting the final version. He always seemed to understand exactly where I was going with something or where I should expand on a point to strengthen my argument. He's not an easy grader, but if you follow his advice you can't really go wrong. I found the workshops on writing introductions and conclusions especially helpful and definitely feel that my analytical skills and general writing has improved."
