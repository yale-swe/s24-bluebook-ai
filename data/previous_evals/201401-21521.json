    "Take it. It's a bit of work (but this iteration is different from any previous ones). It's rather theoretical so don't expect to be making animated movies. Matlab and C\/C++ will be extremely helpful.",
    "The terrible structure of 479 turned what could have been a very interesting course into a fairly miserable slog. About 90% of the time spent on psets was on figuring out small, insignificant things that had nothing to do with the subject matter of the course. The psets were never well-explained or well-defined and it often seemed like the TA and the professor had completely different things in mind for what they wanted in terms of solutions. Professor Rushmeier also decided to have every student in the 25+ person class do a powerpoint presentation where we read and present on a research paper that is tangentially related to something we're studying in the course. They were supposed to be 5-10 minutes each, but they were invariably more like 25-30 minutes long, which meant that they wasted 8-10 classes in total since we weren't expected to know the material, and the presentations were generally badly structured so students didn't pay attention to each others' presentations. Professor Rushmeier is friendly, enthusiastic, and at times extremely helpful, but the psets need serious restructuring and the presentations should be eliminated.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Given that it changed every year, however, I'm unsure exactly how valuable any comments I could make would be. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "I recommend this class to people who are interested in the material that is going to be taught. I know some people were disappointed that it wasn't what they thought 'Computer Graphics' was going to be."
