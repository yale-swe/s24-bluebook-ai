    "The lectures were unorganized and unilluminating, and the problem sets often depended on just finding the right formula in the book instead of understanding the material.",
    "Lecturing did not provide sufficient explanations for concepts while examinations were overly explanation heavy and mathematically lacking.",
    "Strengths: Breadth and depth of material. Good texts and very interesting physical properties of materials explored. Weaknesses: Only adequate professor and very little ability to go beyond the set course material."

    "If you're interested in learning about solidstate physics, just read it out of the two textbooks, that's what you'll be doing in this class anyways.",
    "Yes. I felt that the material was extremely interesting and the pace of the class was adequate (very rare for me). I highly recommend reading the text books as lecture provides a nice supplementary understanding\/interpretation and the texts provide rigor. Honestly, the professor is not the most inspiring, however, I felt that lecture always helped me understand material which was not at first clear to me upon reading it exactly the model of a good grad class."
