   "comments": [
    "Learned more about the calculus",
    "Calc 2 knowledge -- some topics include polar graph, convergence or divergence of series, Taylor polynomials, parametric functions, etc.",
    "Integration, series, and applications",
    "I thought this course did a good job of providing me with the fundamental skills that I will need to pursue my intended major and continue to grow mathematically. The content was relevant, understandable, and Im glad I took this course.",
    "Integrals and series",
    "I learned how to think about mathematical concepts in a way that was not just surface level, but understanding where concepts and relationships come from.",
    "Integration, sequences and series, parametrics, etc.",
    "I learned about infinite sums and how to use them, and also realized how to connect the concepts of sums and integrals. It was a great review of the calculus I learned in high school which then moved logically into math I hadn't learned before. I really enjoyed this class!",
    "I learned to think critically about quantitative problems.",
    "Knowledge: calculus Skills: calculus without a calculator Insights: the importance of math",
    "Applying mathematics in more than just solving problems.",
    "Math 115 is Calculus 2, or the BC part of BC calculus, so it's integrals, sequence and series, polars, parametrics, etc.",
    "How to use theories and use them to logically solve mathematical problems",
    "One of the most important things I learned in this course was the importance of breaking problems into smaller parts. In doing so, I've learned that you can solve the smaller problem and then use that solution to solve the larger problem. This kind of skill is something that I will take with me for the rest of my time at Yale because I believe it is so important.",
    "I learned about sections of Calc II which I had never seen before, especially in such detail."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's math: if you like it, awesome; if not, it's boring.",
    "Strength: after taking this class you will have deeper understanding of Calculus even if you took Calc BC in high school Weakness: some Pset problems are tedious and not similar to the ones you will encounter in midterm\/finals; exploration (some online assignment we need to do prior to every class) is mostly useless",
    "The explorations could be annoying, but they were helpful in getting me to think about topics before we did them in class. Overall I think the class is organized very well and I never felt overwhelmed with too much material all at once. Phil also took care to show how different topics connected together. That said, I think the instructor really matters for 115.",
    "I thought the explorations were major strength of this course. I thought they really helped with understanding and preparation for class. I cannot think of any weaknesses of consequence.",
    "More time on series (especially Taylor series)",
    "It was well-organized but the lectures were not very engaging.",
    "The workload is very manageable and the p-sets helps solidify the concepts. One thing that could be improved is that sometimes I feel like the class moves a little fast, but for me it is manageable if you pay attention and go over it during the p-sets. Also, I think that it would be less stressful if the final exam were worth less of the final grade.",
    "All the material was covered adequately, but not enough attention was given to some topics that I felt needed more coverage.",
    "Strengths: homework assignments were really helpful in the sense that you were learning as you completed the assignments. The work was what made you understand the material. Weakness: The course was not really structured for you to have enough time to study. Often times the course was behind and made students cram in information that was going to be on the tests.",
    "More handouts in the class, better homework.",
    "I thought that the professor taught very well in a way that maintained structure but also responded to questions flexibly.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is the way that it is structured to build on all of the topics. One way it could be improved is if there was a little bit more time spent on some of the harder topics.",
    "The explorations were based on a good concept but ended up being tedious and not always educational. I believe that if explorations were not before every class, but rather before every class with new important concepts they would be more engaging. When they introduced new concepts they were a great tool to prepare me for class.",
    "It was taught at the wrong pace - very slow and then all at once to catch up."

   "comments": [
    "I'm personally not a fan of the calculus so I simply took it as a requirement. It's not a bad class but it's just not my cup of tea.",
    "Yes; probably need to take it as a requirement if you are in stem. Look into which section (time and professor) that you want to take because it seems to make a big difference",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as long as you like your instructor. Phil is a great person and a good teacher and if you get the chance to take a course with him before he leaves, do it!! If you have\/want to take calculus, 115 is a good place to start.",
    "I would recommend this course, and I would also recommend the instructor I had. I thought he was clear in his descriptions, answered questions well, and i think it specifically showed in the results his section achieved.",
    "If necessary",
    "This course prepared me to continue the math sequence and gave me the concrete skills necessary to learn future concepts",
    "Yes, but only if it's a requirement.",
    "Yes I would. It was a great class for getting a foundation in calculus after taking AB calc in High School. I really enjoyed it, and Phil is an amazing professor.",
    "I would recommend this course because it teaches fundamental mathematics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to take it as a prerequisite. If you do not need to take this course and just want a QR credit ,you should take a different course. This is, of course, unless you find yourself confident in both calculus and handling the workload.",
    "If you want to do anything related to mathematics these are the basics, yes.",
    "If you have to take math 115, take math 115. If you don't have to, you probably don't want to, and if you don't want to take this course then you probably won't have a good time taking the course.",
    "Yes I think it lays a good foundation.",
    "I would recommend this course because it teaches complicated math topics in a way that allows you to find the answer to a problem without memorizing a bunch of equations. It focuses on understanding why a specific equation is used and how it is derived logically.",
    "It is necessary for most majors so I do not have to recommend it. If it were not a requirement, however, I would still recommend it to others as it was an interesting course if you enjoy maths."
