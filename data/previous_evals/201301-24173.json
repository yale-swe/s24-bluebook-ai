   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it. The movies are fun and really informative.",
    "A solid seminar that gives you detailed insight into some pretty famous cases. No prior knowledge of the law (or even the cases really) is required, so it's a good class for anyone with remote interest in the material.",
    "Great class. Take it if you can.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was my favorite class of the semester. There's a lot of reading but it's fascinating reading, and Mr. Ford makes the class a pleasure to attend.",
    "Excellent course. Anyone in any major should definitely take it.",
    "Great second semester senior year class! Mr. Ford has super interesting anecdotes. Broadened my understanding of US history through a unique lens.",
    "One of the most interesting classes I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Awesome course particularly for a senior. Professor Ford is engaging, the material is extremely interesting, and there isn't too much work. The grading is fair. I would say that this course is one of those gems for seniors and you should do what you can to get in. Also, you realize how much you can understand about history, laws, and culture from trials.",
    "Yes, if you can get in! It's a fascinating look at some of the most interesting trials in US history, combining law, history, and sociology. Professor Ford is great and has so many anecdotes about the relevant cases, as well. Workload involves a take-home midterm and a final paper. Highly recommended, but difficult to get into since it is in high demand (and rightfully so!).",
    "Yes. Learned about the most famous trials in American history"
