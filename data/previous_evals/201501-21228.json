    "Nice overview of ethics in science with perspectives from a range of current faculty. Would recommend to get a sense of current scientific ethics.",
    "This course is a discussion based course about different relevant ethical topics related to neuroscience. Being comfortable discussing these issues with peers is important before potentially discussing your perspective with the public or other non-scientists, so this course is a great way to build a strong basis for understanding the ethical issues facing neuroscience, how they might relate to your own research, and how to best explain your perspectives on the matter with supporting details. I would definitely recommend the course to another student, both because I think it is important to have experience discussing your point of view and perspective with peers who may or may not disagree with you, and is also important to understand the ethical considerations of your field and to know how to articulate your stance on the issues.",
