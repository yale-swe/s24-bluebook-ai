    "I wish there was a higher rating for this course. It has been one of the most influential and inspiring courses I have taken at YSPH. The material is indispensable. I have grown immensely through the in class discussions, critical reading and reflections.",
    "This course is terrific. It is a lot of work--reading and critically analyzing all readings, but it is well worth it. Classes can be challenging as everyone is expected to know the readings and engage, but it keeps you on top of your work. I learned so much from this class.",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at YSPH. The workload and readings can be daunting at times, but the amount is necessary to fully understand and discuss law topics. Shelley makes this class as active, interesting, and engaged as possible.",
    "Shelley Geballe is one of the most amazing instructors I have ever had the pleasure of taking a class with. She is incredibly knowledgeable and extremely open to hearing student feedback. I cannot recommend this class more.",
    "The main strength of this course is Shelley. She is a phenomenal professor: brilliant, engaging, sweet, funny, and makes you think differently about the world. There was a lot of material in this class, but it was clear that it was assigned because Shelley is just so passionate about what she teaches, and couldn't pick between all the different interesting readings. The class size this year was particularly large, so my advice would be to either have two classes or make the class size smaller. I think that way students can engage in a more intimate way.",
    "This was one of my all time favorite classes of the MPH- I learned so much about the law (and about public health)!",
    "This course provided a great intro to law, and is good for someone trying to learn the basics. That being said, there is a steep learning curve, and the class is definitely still challenging if you don't have much of a background in policy or law. Shelley is amazing. She is such a leader in this field and it was great to get to learn from her. I do think that this class was a little bit too much work at times. I think it might have been beneficial to also start the final toolbox project earlier in the semester (like submit one section at a time) so we can get feedback early on and it isn't a big rush and a huge time commitment at the end of the semester.",
    "It's a lot of reading and, for most students, a steep learning curve but, boy, do you learn. This is one of the courses that I'll remember for the rest of my life.",
    "Very comprehensive overview of public health and law but the class moved too quickly for me to feel like I got enough out of the class",
    "This course is AMAZING! Truly one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Shelley is one of the most compassionate and invested professors I have had and she truly cares about each and every one of her students. It is a great introductory law course but though the lens of public health. I learned so much and I recommend this course to EVERY student no matter what you are studying. You learn a ton of very valuable research, writing, and presentation skills.",
    "The course provided an extremely comprehensive yet concise overview of public health law. Discussion flowed very easily, and the environment was supportive and respectful.",
    "Great introductory course to law and its role in public health. Acquired analytic skills and understanding of legal tools that can be applied to a public health problem. Tool box project was an excellent assignment. It was very interesting to learn and see the the vast role of law in almost all public health problems. Projects involving stakeholder role simulation was very interesting. Consider more such assignments in future. The range of topics witnessed in the final presentations was excellent. If interested in recruiting students from all departments, perhaps consider making the first class a little less heavy on legal terms\/briefs and procedures. It is very intimidating for those not familiar but interested in taking the course from other departments."

   "comments": [
    "Your YSPH education is made 100 times worth its value by taking this course. The material is overwhelming but will change your perceptions of public health and interactions with other disciplines (particularly law)",
    "It covers the basic legal tools used in public health. It is challenging but productive. I highly recommend.",
    "I would say that this course attempts to tackle public health law from a variety of lenses: criminal law, tort law, etc. It provides a broad overview of the ways the law can be utilized to address health issues. I would highly recommend this course to another student based on the amount of knowledge gained from the course and the excellent guidance and teaching under Shelley.",
    "If you want to learn how important the law is as it relates to all things public health, this class is necessary.",
    "Even if you are not that interested in law, take this course because of Shelley. She is incredible and you will learn so much because of her. This class helped me think about the world differently, and I will always remember our discussions even after I graduate. I am in SBS and have never taken a law class before, and I truly thought this was phenomenal.",
    "This is hand down one of the best classes you'll take in your life. You'll learn so much about the law and the ways public health can utilize (or be threatened by) legal tools, but you'll also learn about the history of these cases and the precedent they set for the future of public health. Shelley is incredible-- you'll want to try your hardest because she puts in so much time and attention to the class and students that you want to match her effort!",
    "As an EMD student is was a bit out of my comfort zone, but if you're looking for a cool and interesting elective with a great professor, take this course! It is a lot of work though, so be careful not to overload your schedule like I sadly did.",
    "I highly, highly recommend this course. This is one of the classes you cannot leave YSPH without taking. This should be a requirement! I would tell students who are considering taking this course that it's a lot of reading and, for most students, a steep learning curve but, boy, will they learn.",
    "The course is a broad overview of the law and public health so it's hard to get a very good understanding of everything in the class. It's a challenging course and I wished that we would have gone slower, but Shelley was great.",
    "This course involved weekly reading, weekly reading responses and individual or group project assignments. Each student had to work on one final paper\/project on any public health topic throughout the duration of the semester and present on their project in the final two weeks. This course had a very heavy workload but it was definitely worth the investment.",
    "Excellent class recommended for everyone. A great overview of public health law. Heavy on the reading, but you will learn an extraordinary amount. Totally worth the work.",
    "Highly recommend this course to students interested in learning the role of law and how it can be applied to address public health problems.",
    "The course requires a fair amount of work but is absolutely worth it. The material is fascinating and generates great class discussion."
