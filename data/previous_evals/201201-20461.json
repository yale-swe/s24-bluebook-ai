    "I'm not sure it'll be offered again, but I highly recommend it.",
    "The corpus methods course is an excellent\u0097and as far as I know, unique\u0097introduction to empirical research in musical corpora, with an emphasis on evaluating articles and developing programming skills. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it introduces extremely useful skills that are rarely part of a music curriculum, and raises fundamental questions about the nature and purpose of music research."

   "comments": [
    "In spite of the fact that the course deals with a relatively small branch of research in music theory, it deepened my knowledge of the field greatly through the perspective that it casts on methods of studying music. The course had an important influence on my thinking about music, one that might turn out to be central to my future research."
