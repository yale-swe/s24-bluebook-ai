   "comments": [
    "Great introductory survey to some of the main monuments\/paintings\/periods in the history of Constantinople\/Istanbul and Venice.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in art history or Venice\/Istanbul, definitely check it out.",
    "Great class! I would recommend it to anyone interested in cities and their histories. The exams are not easy so make sure to take it properly.",
    "A great overview of Istanbul and Venice and their relationship through art and architecture. Never took an art history class and this made me love it!!",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in the development of two inter-related, but unique cities. I highly recommend for students who like art history but want a small class experience. It's a lot of reading, but very worth it.",
    "This is a great class that I would highly recommend. Istanbul and Venice are fascinating, beautiful cities and you will learn a huge amount about their art, history, and culture. It's accessible to someone with no background in art history, though a lot of material is covered and you should have some interest in economic and political history as well as art.",
    "This course has fascinating content and does an amazing job showing the historical connections between the two cities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I find the comparison of two cities a successful approach to the material."
