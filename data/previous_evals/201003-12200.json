   "comments": [
    "I think this class is pretty comparable to other entry level foreign language courses. The language is beautiful and Professor Iacovella is great so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation. The workload is doable and classes can be tedious but ultimately helpful. Obviously you get out of the class what you put into it.",
    "If your interested in italian, then take it. I know plenty of people who do well and enjoy it. If you are fulfilling a language distribution, i'd look somewhere else. Italian moves quickly, and most L1 italian students have a working knowledge of italian to begin with, thus the basics are never really enforced. Class meets every day and is REALLY boring. There is a TON of everyday assignments and homework, so if you have a busy schedule... clear it up",
    "Definitely take this. And with Iacovella no question - she is unbelievable.",
    "If you're looking for a fun introductory language, this is the perfect class. TAKE IT WITH IACOVELLA, SHE'S AMAZING.",
    "Anna Iacovella is the best.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It has been my favorite course so far. You do not only learn the language but also parts of the culture. There is a more laid-back atmosphere that you do not find much at Yale. Even with this atmosphere the manner in which subject matter was relayed was most effective.",
    "The course has been extremely enjoyable and I have learned so much, going from knowing only a few phrases to being able to understand parts of songs without referencing a dictionary. The pace of the class is brisk (unit tests\/quizzes every two weeks or so and weekly compositions) but not unmanageable if you keep up. Professoressa Iacovella has been a wonderful teacher. She is very kind and knowledgeable, and her love of Italian is infectious. I could not believe she told our class we could call her on her cell if we had urgent questions; I emailed her once with questions before a test and she was very prompt to respond. I appreciated her sincere interest in each of us, not just as Italian students, but as students in other classes, athletes, singers, etc. Did I mention that we also took a field-trip to the Music Library in Sterling and as a class translated a letter that Clementi wrote to his publishers? Needless to say I'm excited for ITAL 120!",
    "Italian 110 is very much like a high school class. You can get away with not doing the daily bookwork every day if you pay attention in class but it definitely helps if you do. I would recommend this to anyone interested in Italian. It is a well-paced and fun class.",
    "A fast-paced introduction to a language that is extremely beautiful. Ultimately, one cannot expect too much significant cultural exposure, though in the way of cuisine, we learned a lot that was worth sitting down with in the context of learning the language.",
    "If you have never taken a romance language before but you're interested in Italian, I would highly recommend 110. Even though classes are held every weekday, they are always engaging. The coursework is very manageable, and I have come away from this semester feeling comfortable speaking Italian at a basic level."
