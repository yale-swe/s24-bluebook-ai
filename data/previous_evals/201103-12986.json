   "comments": [
    "A decent class with a great professor. You'll learn Spanish, and have fun doing it. Having class 5 days a week is not the greatest experience, but Profesora Alexandrov makes it worthwhile. I recommend this class to anyone beginning to learn (or just getting reacquainted with) the language.",
    "If you test into L2, it's a fun and fairly easy class that really helps fortify your skills.",
    "Yes, well taught and a useful class, even if you have already fulfilled your language requirements.",
    "Professor Alexandrov was absolutely wonderful. Her energy and enthusiasm made me want to get out of bed in the morning and she had us laughing as we learned through the majority of the semester. Really excellent.",
    "Spanish 120 is a great way for students who have experience with Spanish, but are not really confident in the subject to advance their study of the language. Class consists of a variety of different projects, homework assignments, and presentations, all of which are manageable. If you have taken Spanish before and are questioning whether or not to continue on with the language, I definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "It is a very fun class, definitely take it, helps you brush up on grammar.",
    "Yes, looked forward to coming to class everyday and it was an enjoyable experience",
    "I mean, if you placed into L2, or are following up L1, you are probs going to take this class regardless of what I say...but actually I really enjoyed my L2 spanish experience with Professor Alexandrov. In class you really just talk and discuss interesting things, and its a class because you are simultaneously learning another language. What's not to love? Also, professor Alexandrov is WONDERFUL.",
    "Yes. Great way to obtain basic communication skills in spanish",
    "Yes, I would reccommend it to a fellow student. It can be difficult, but if you put in the work you'll show great improvement.",
    "This course is exactly what the title says it is a Spanish level 2 course. There work load is not very heavy and my Spanish improved. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Take it if you want to learn Spanish. If you can, take it with Sybil Alexandrov--she's wonderful.",
    "Really great. Take it with Alexandrov, she's a great teacher.",
    "I took this course as part of a language requirement, and if a student were looking to fulfill this I would recommend Spanish. My experience was so good because of Professor Alexandrov, though, and I'm not sure how another professor would be."
