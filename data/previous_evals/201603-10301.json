   "comments": [
    "I gained a lot of knowledge both about post-colonial literature and colonial literature. I also feel that I developed the skills to analyze the relationship between these bodies of literature with much more nuance than I had going into the course.",
    "This course allowed me to revisit classic works (and read some classic works for the first time) through a completely different lens than usual, which improved my close reading and analysis skills. While not being dry with theory, the course encourages reading each work taking into account the colonial or post colonial context. I learned about about the colonies and the legacy of colonialism left by the French and English Empires all through literature. It was quite interesting to see how contemporary and modern texts spoke to older texts.",
    "I developed a more critical approach to literature and historical knowledge. I also became better at articulating myself and explaining stances i took in the class."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course could be improved by focusing discussion not on evaluating whether a text was good or bad in the viewpoint of postcolonial politics (I felt that this happened occasionally) but on how the text either supports or rejects certain tropes like the Other, white supremacy etc. I also think the student presentations did not add much to the course, since we didn't really engage with them in discussion. The presentations and the texts they discussed felt ancillary. I also wish we had read Csaire because I think the syllabus could have used some poetry.",
    "Overall this course was extremely well designed. The vision of this course was very clear, yet flexible as the professor allowed students to guide class discussions. It was the first time the class was thought, so at times I found that I struggled to understand the place of a text or a movie on the syllabus but that seems like something that can be strengthened as this class is taught more.",
    "This is a very strong course in the tightness of its structure and the requirements of its syllabus. The variety of media used to explore the themes of this course was also a strength of the course. It could be improved by perhaps having more guest lectures incorporated into the course.",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this course. I think most of its weaknesses were the result of it being brand new some of the early narrative\/counternarrative pairings maybe didn't make as much sense as the later ones, and some weeks the readings had to be adjusted or shifted. None of those minor bumps affected my enjoyment of the course though. Overall the conversation was interesting, the readings were great, and Professor Miller and Usha led engaging enlightening discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. Discussions were usually interesting, the teachers were good. This is also conceited to say but I think the course attracted good students. If you feel like you've read a lot of post-colonial literature, then this might be a good course to take in order to read the colonial narratives to which this body of literature responds.",
    "A brilliant course. I highly recommend this course. This course stretched how we we look at novels and film by taking into account the colonial and post-colonial contexts in addition to all the other things we look for in literature and film. It is very interesting to read literature in a continuous way, meaning looking at texts as being related throughout time. I've never had to think so deeply about reading before, which a very good thing! This is rare approach and for those who love literature, in French, in English or in both languages, this course is a must.",
    "i would to a student who wants to go more in depth in their study of english and french colonial and post colonial literature. The course draws a very specific kind of person to it which is a strength more than a weakness for the concentration of diverse experiences and expectations for\/in the course.",
    "Yes! This course allowed me to read a lot of canonical French and English literature (The Stranger, Robinson Crusoe, Heart of Darkness) that everyone probably should read, but it contextualized the works as relics of a colonial past, and allowed us to look at what that means for the pieces, and how other authors have responded to them. You can't read a book like Heart of Darkness or Robinson Crusoe without a discussion about the colonialist under(over?)tones, so it was great to read them in a literature class that allowed us to focus specifically on questions of colonialism and imperialism, who is othered, who gets to speak, etc..."
