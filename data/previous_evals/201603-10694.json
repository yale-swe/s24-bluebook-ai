   "comments": [
    "I read Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality, and traced our understanding of equality through sexism (Christine Delphy's \"Rethinking Sex and Gender\"), capitalism\/communism (Marx, and Chen), and racism. I became far more knowledgeable about the Black Lives Matter movement and mass incarceration in the United States. I improved my essay-writing skills and had deep conversations about the intricacies of equality, inequality, and whether they are actually possible\/how we would go about achieving them as a society.",
    "Fitting with the name of the course, I truly learned a lot about the trouble with equality - and this is not an understatement. There are so many ways to approach solving the problem of inequality including determining what equality even looks like and addressing how or if it is possible to reach 'equality' without causing any any other type of 'inequality' in the process. This course really helps you think critically about what equality and inequality, in an of themselves, truly mean.",
    "This course provided me with a solid understanding of how to write an academic paper.",
    "I learned a lot about historical concepts of inequality and ways in which problems concerning equality continue to permeate society.",
    "Effective incorporation of multiple sources was a focus of the major paper. Some discussion and analysis of techniques used in assigned readings.",
    "I think my writing certainly improved with this course, and also my ability\/willingness to connect ideas that I am interested in to academic research, papers and projects.",
    "By taking this course, I gained skills that helped me improve upon my writing abilities. The course topic was also incredibly enlightening and allowed me to gain many insights relating to equality.",
    "My writing improved tremendously. I developed my critical thinking skills further. I also learned how to evaluate a piece of writing critically to mke sure it covers every topic\/item it is supposed to cover.",
    "My academic writing, especially ability to write concisely, improved. I also feel much more equips to tackle and analyze scholarly articles."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -encouraged provocative discourse -introduced material about various important, current social movements in a comprehensive way Weaknesses: -this didn't apply to me, but I could see there being the potential to slack off and not, say, do readings. I don't say this to mean there should've been harsher homework grading, because I'd imagine it could be reflected in participation grades and because I believe most students were truly in it to gain from the experience",
    "As a seminar, the course is really based on what each individual student contributes to the discussion. The professor has a lot to say and everything he says is very interesting and enlightening. That said, the combination of the professor's inputs and the student's contributions really matter. If you don't have much to say, it's fine and rewarding to listen, but if no one has much to say, then the class might drag. This was definitely not my experience though - the people in my seminar were very engaging and got into many debates and deep discussions which made the class very very very enjoyable.",
    "This course is amazing if you are wishing to learn about \"the trouble with equality.\" However, it focused more on the subject of the course than actual writing skills. I appreciated this, but this could definitely be a weakness if someone is taking the course solely to learn about improving their writing skills. That being said, it definitely helped me with my academic writing.",
    "The strengths of this course were the level of engagement that everyone was willing to give, and Professor Kreiner's knowledge on all of the readings that we engaged with. I did not perceive any weaknesses in the course.",
    "The idea of creating topic-specific essay writing courses seems like a good way to enhance student engagement, but often I felt like we spent an outsize share of our time discussing the subject of the assigned readings instead of the effectiveness of the writing and specifically the techniques used.",
    "The course material is incredibly engaging, which made writing the essays all the more interesting.",
    "Seminar style is perfect for this class. Allows content from reader to be cleared up and engaged with by students. The lack of use of technology allows the students to be more engaged, but the couple times the professor tried to use it early in the course, the computer would not work. Could benefit from videos and other media being shown.",
    "The strengths of this course are its very engaging topic and strong course sources. All the articles and sources we looked at offered developed, interesting arguments, and I am so happy to have read each one. The course also balanced discussion and concrete writing improvement well."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, because I found it to be a very informative overview of highly relevant social circumstances\/the history that led up to how we consider equality today that really broadened my understanding of the topic. Very thought-provoking and interesting",
    "In addition to the great discussions that go on in this class, the professor does an amazing job with helping the students to improve their writing skills. For all the essays, each student gets to turn in a rough draft that the professor reads and comments on. The professor's feedback gives a lot of guidance for the final draft of papers and also allows the student to pick up on the writing skills they need to work on.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. The subject matter is incredibly relevant and the readings and class discussions will completely transform your understanding of equality, what equality truly means, and how to go about creating true equality. In addition, the class forces you to think and write about incredibly difficult topics that will certainly improve your writing skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Any student would find this course fascinating.",
    "The course was very useful and I was very glad to have been able to take this particular concentration with this instructor. While there were certainly times of frustration, I feel I had the best experience among my peers who were in other sections with different concentrations.",
    "HIGHLY recommend. This class is my favorite I've taken at Yale. Tim is phenomenal -- he's funny, engaging, and friendly while also being a fascinating and inspiring teacher. He gives great feedback to each student, and meeting with him is as fun as it is informative. The curriculum of the course is actually enthralling, and presents new ways to think about struggles for social change. It feels more like a Sociology or AmStud class than it does an English one (not that I'm complaining). And there's a lot of room to bring what you want to discuss to the class, so it ends up being really tailored to the group of individuals that are in the room. Absolutely take it.",
    "Yes, I would. If a student was interested in taking a writing seminar, I believe this course is a great choice.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to understand the difficulties and limits with certain equalities and the fight to fix inequalities in order to create change effectively, take the course. The readings and working with the professor make sure that you are engaged and ready to discuss.",
    "Yes I would. Not only does your writing improve from the course but it was also an eye opening course that gives you the ability to understand social issues with much greater nuance."
