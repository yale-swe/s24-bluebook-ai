    "This is a good class if you plan to do research the whole year - you write a grant proposal at the end of the first semester and a final writeup of your research at the end of spring semester. You only have to present once throughout the year as part of the class.",
    "MCDB 485 is a great option for those wishing to receive a B.S. but not wanting to (or not being able to because of medical school interviews) spend the 20 hours\/week in lab required for an intensive B.S. The time commitment of 10-12 hours per week is reasonable, as is the work load (which includes a few papers and a presentation). Most MCDB majors are likely to have had some research experience already, so the only difference is that now the research you do counts towards the senior requirement.",
    "Research, required to attend 3 presentations of students per semester, 1 proposal, one update paper.There should be a grade given for each semester. Not just unsatisfactory\/satisfactory for the first semester, then a grade the 2nd semester",
    "Obviously if you want to do a senior research project you will take this course, but how much you enjoy it and how successful you are all depends on the lab group you work with, and how much work you personally put in. Good luck!",
    "MCDB 485 is a yearlong research course. You are required to do the following: go to lab, project proposal due the second week of school, grant proposal due at the end of fall semester, a presentation chosen randomly for either semester, a final paper due in the spring, and a poster. Most bio majors end up choosing this course over others because its a full credit for both semesters and isn't a terrible amount of work outside of work. Your research mentor basically ends up choosing your grade, so its really not bad unless your mentor doesn't like you.",
    "Allows you to do independant research, and if you don't present first semester, it really is not that much work - just going to the lab.",
    "Regardless of whether you're considering entering a PhD program upon graduation, I would recommend conducting research as an undergraduate as the skills you acquire through critically investigating your project, troubleshooting, and being a member of a collaborative team can be applied to many future careers.",
    "Be sure to start looking for labs early--like spring semester\/summer. You only get two weeks to figure it out once getting back on campus, and finding a PI at that point can be pretty stressful (you have to meet with several, check out their labs, find out what projects they have---very time consuming if you leave it til the last minute). Lab work is rewarding if you have a good lab and a good project. Make sure you're learning a variety of techniques in the project, not just one thing over and over. Make sure your PI\/mentor is willing to really sit down with you and work on things (your proposal, your finalpresentation, your grant proposal final paper, etc) because its a lot easier than going at it on your own.",
    "Even if you dislike lab, you should strongly consider doing your own research. It is way more fun, and you will learn much, much more than by conducting prefabricated experiments.",
    "I would recommend it, even if you are not a biology major. If you are doing research independently, it is nice to have some structure, and to get formal credit for it. That being said, I don't think my experience would be radically different if I were doing the research without taking this course. I am presenting in the spring, though, which I imagine will be a worthwhile experience. Worth noting that 10 hours a week is both a significant amount of time to dedicate and very little in terms of what you can get done. So temper expectations, and set aside a couple large chunks of time each week. Also, you have to attend the presentations of other students taking the course, which is cool but falls right in the midst of reading period\/finals."
