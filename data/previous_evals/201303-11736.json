    "A great Econ elective, even better if you're interested in health care",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Important material to know and a great lecture without a lot of busy work that a lot of classes tend to have.",
    "Great course, limited math required, lectures can be a little hard to follow.",
    "",
    "It is a survey of the U.S. health care system from an economic POV",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you put in the time and attend class, the workload is very manageable. I would take anything Dr. Forman teaches.",
    "I 100% recommend this course to all Yale students. Healthcare isn't just important for pre-meds or future politicians; it's really an important subject for everyone to understand, and Professor Forman teaches it in a way that is engaging and exciting. There's a lot of material and I wouldn't say it's easy to memorize it all, but the workload was never overwhelming. This class is totally manageable, and if you put in the time and effort you're going to get so much out of it. There are two exams (a midterm and cumulative final), three homework assignments (all pretty straightforward, and almost everyone gets full points) and a final paper on any topic in healthcare. The paper was the most stressful part of the class, because there are few guidelines and it's hard to know what Professor Forman really wants to see. Still, if you get started ahead of time he's happy to talk to you about potential paper topics, so there's no real reason to not do well on the paper, either.",
    "I would recommend this class. I learned a lot about the US health care system which is so important especially with what's going on in the news with the ACA right now.",
    "All premeds should take this class! You need to know how the system you are going to be a part of works. So much more relevant with healthcare reform now too. It is interesting and relatively easy.",
    "A great class if you're at all interested in health economics",
    "It's a good survey of the U.S. healthcare system with a focus on how it has changed since the ACA. I learned what I went in wanting to learn; it was one of those classes that I crammed for the tests the night before but left the test realizing I actually knew a fair amount. Howie is funny, but his lectures get dry pretty fast. The guest lectures spice up the course a little bit, but form a study group and take turns actually keeping good notes because it didn't seem like anybody could pay full attention for the entire class every day. Review sessions were nice and tests were fair. The paper was open ended and a cool project. It's a good fifth class, low on work and low on rigorous analysis, but interesting if you want to learn a little more about health or apply econ outside of the core classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you will be working with the healthcare system after graduation. Great overview of the system as a whole.I thought both the midterm and the final were pretty fair. P-sets were easy. Essay assignment was actually interesting.",
    "Cool class with real-world-applicable material (not many classes like that!). Professor Forman is a boss.Minimal work, no reading necessary, 1 easy paper, 1 midterm, final.",
    "Very interesting course in healthcare policy. I thought the material was a bit too dense and the lectures a bit too long and dry, but everything was applicable in our daily lives, especially given recent American legislation. The workload was definitely manageable (2 hw's, a midterm, a paper, and a final). Little econ background needed at all. Howie was a great professor and he definitely knew what he was doing. I really liked that he had experience in both the MD side of things as well as the MBA side. He did a great job of bringing the two sides of healthcare and business together.",
    "Mostly interesting and I think it's important to understand healthcare, so I would recommend.",
    "Yes, I strongly believe this should be a required course at Yale. Material is relevant to everyone and the workload is manageable. Just make sure to attend lectures and thoroughly go through his slides\/ your notes.",
    "This class has a lot of information about a very relevant topic. If you want to learn a lot about healthcare than there are probably faster ways to learn than these 75 minute lectures (READ A BOOK!!) but you definitely come away with a serious amount of knowledge, and a great example of which constructs lead to market failure. In less reality-grounded econ classes, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to hear about the frictions in real world markets, and healthcare is the sector with the most frictions, and the most difficult process for solving them. Also good if you like politics. This is not your typical yale class format- you get a lot of information about laws, trends and market failures in healthcare, and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tested on them!",
    "I think that all premeds should take this class. They don't really teach you this kind of stuff in medical school, but it's very relevant to how your career and life will be as a doctor. It's nice to have some exposure to the policy\/economic side of healthcare to not only get a more broad perspective, but again reaffirm if it's the right path for you.",
    "Take it if you have an interest in the subject. Don't take it if you find healthcare boring\/too complicated to sort out, because you definitely need to have some sort of interest to get through the denser parts of the course. And make sure you attend the guest lectures and take good notes because those presentation aren't posted, and the exams test you on them.",
    "Yes! It's a fun and interesting class. Tests are straightforward, but there is a paper. Good extra class if you're looking for one.",
    "A relevant, easy, and interesting class with much less economics than you would expect. I would highly suggest this class to anyone. I went in knowing and caring next to nothing about the healthcare system, and I definitely came out with enough to have a decent, educated conversation about it. Don't worry if you aren't an economics major; the concepts are very accessible, the econ is minimal, and the math is non-existent.",
    "Definitely recommend it--it makes the ACA and history of healthcare economics extremely digestable!",
    "It's a lot less work during the semester, but the final paper and the final exam becomes quite a hassle. Moreover, keep in mind the curve is not that great - there are way too many people who already have extensive knowledge on the subject, and they dominate the conversation.",
    "This class is phenomenal and informative - definitely my favorite of the semester or even of my whole Yale career. I think it's an incredibly important topic that everyone should know about, especially in light of the massive healthcare reform going on in our country right now.",
    "Pretty easy for an Econ credit, and a great way to get familiarized with the healthcare system if you don't know much.",
    "Econ 170 is a course that students need to take if they want to be sufficiently informed to participate in the discourse surrounding the healthcare debate going on currently. It also gives students a baseline of knowledge about healthcare that will likely prove functional at some point in the future.",
    "Yes, definitely take it.",
    "Econ 170 is an extremely interesting course, and I definitely came out of it with a lot of new knowledge about health insurance in America. Professor Forman goes very fast through lectures, and if you don't have a good general understanding of health insurance, it may be difficult at first. There's not too much work--a midterm, final, and final paper, and a few small homework assignments. You don't actually have to do the readings.",
    "This class gives you a very good understanding of the economic underpinnings of the US healthcare system. If you're hoping for a class on healthcare reform, this is not it. You spend the last lecture and a half on healthcare reform, but the bulk of the course deals with health insurance, government healthcare entities, and understanding the different healthcare industries. Interesting and important, but can get a bit dry at times. Not a difficult class, but not easy. You have to do the work, but the grading is fair.",
    "I would recommend it wholeheartedly, even if they don't have an Econ background",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I love current events and public policy so I thought I knew a lot about healthcare coming in, but boy was I wrong. You touch on pretty much every aspect of the healthcare industry and learn just why the industry is so complex and why finding solutions are so difficult. The professor is incredibly engaging and genuinely interested in you and how well you do in the course. There's a short article to read for every lecture, a midterm, a final, and a 6-8 page final paper, so I'd say the overall workload is pretty light as well.",
    "Professor Forman is great. He makes the stuff exciting. Issue is that a lot of this stuff just isn't - think pie charts percentages etc. That being said, it is a very useful and interesting class and I do feel as if I learned a good deal.",
    "Yes! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Health Economics and Public Policy gives a comprehensive, detailed, and easy-to-understand of the American healthcare system. I would highly recommend this to anyone in or outside of the economics major. It's a super-relevant and well-taught course.",
    "If you know nothing about healthcare in the US and would like to learn more about it, this is the class for you. You have one midterm, a final, a final paper, and a few easy, short homework assignments. Most lectures are pretty interesting, but it can be hard to follow the slides sometimes.",
    "I thought the class was alright. It's a lotof information on healthcare\/insurance and those types of things, which wasn't particularly interesting to me. But Forman is quite knowledgeable. If you're really into the topic, it's probably a good class to take, but I wasn't really that interested.",
    "This class is a heavily memorization-based survey of the U.S. health system. It may interest certain econ majors and pre-meds, but for whatever reason it didn't end up interesting me. Lectures (and test preparation) were just details stacked on details, and there wasn't much (if any) time for the discussion of bigger ideas in medicine or economics. If you know for sure that you want to learn about the intricacies of Medicare and physician reimbursement, go for it, but you have any doubts about your own interest in the field then they will only grow over the course of the semester.",
    "Great overview of health econ. It was exciting to be taking this while obamacare came into effect. You get to decide how much you want to get out of it; you can hang onto Howie's every word, or you can pay attention in only the most important lectures. I got exactly what i wanted out of it, which is simply good insight and some details about healthcare. Took it cred\/d but i feel like i could have gotten an a-.",
    "A great overview of the general Healthcare System but lacks a big holistic structure. Take it for informative purposes.",
    "ECON 170 was not a very interesting course to take. The most I learned was from writing my final paper at the end of the semester. This course has the *potential* to be really interesting, if it were updated to integrate the current healthcare reform with concepts from the US Health care system. I felt like the course could benefit from more cohesiveness among lectures (Prof Forman's powerpoint slides are boring and uninformative). I felt that sometimes I could find a clearer conveyance of the information through Wikipedia or simply by googling the terms than from the powerpoint slides. I think it would be more interesting for the course to focus on contemporary health care reform issues, rather than spending so much time talking about the specific details or Medicare or Medicaid. I think by updating the course so that we can learn and talk about Medicare\/Medicaid and other issues in the context of the ACA and current events would make the course a more worthwhile course to take. I also found the \"economics\" part of Health Economics to be tenuous. While we superficially discussed terms we already learned in Intro Micro, such as adverse selection, moral hazard, and asymmetric information, I was hoping the course would have taken this a step further, so that we could apply these concepts to the newer topics of value-based insurance design&reference pricing, and used this to analyze the ACA. If you expect to take a mind-blowing course about health care, this is not the class for you. Looking for a great 5th class though? Then this may be it.",
    "material can get dull at times. important to be at lecture because a lot is said that is not explicitly on slides. midterm and final were not overly difficult if you attend class and take good notes",
    "Very interesting course with lots of interesting guest lectures. The material is very specific at times but the tests are fair and you learn a good bit about the healthcare system in the us.",
    "Econ 170 is a great survey course for those interested in healthcare. If you're at all interested in becoming a doctor or working in healthcare take this class!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Prof. Forman is a wonderful teacher, and he presents the material in a clear and thorough manner. He is also very easy to approach and extremely dedicated to the students \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which makes the class fun to be in. The pace of the course may be fast at times, but you will have the opportunity to learn A LOT. In addition, the expectations for the tests are very realistic, since you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be asked to regurgitate every little detail covered in lecture but actually to engage with the fundamental concepts and recurring themes covered in class. If you are a pre-med, I definitely recommend this course as it covers material that is very relevant for the medical profession. Even if you are not pre-med, the course covers practical information that is applicable to everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal and professional life. Take it, take it, take it!",
    "GREAT class. I am a premed bio major who had never taken an econ class before in my life, and I got exactly what I wanted out of this class: a basic understanding of how our healthcare system works, why it is so expensive, and how health reform will change it. This is important material for someone in any major, and I would recommend the class to almost anyone at Yale. Professor Forman is a great lecturer, and it's not too much work: one midterm, one final paper, one final exam, and the readings are really optional. Just go to class and pay attention to what Professor Forman says...you'll learn a lot.",
    "This is a pretty standard Econ class and very interesting if you want to go to into a health-related field, whether you're pre-med or not.",
    "yes! Definitely take this class. It's not super easy, but it's worth it!",
    "This was my favorite course this semester, and it's definitely not just for students interested in healthcare. I think every student needs to take this course before leaving Yale to get a much better understanding of how a system that directly touches our everyday lives works. Because the information is relevant and applicable, and because Professor Forman is a great teacher--funny, organized, and genuinely invested in his students--I definitely recommend the course.",
    "YES DO ITTT",
    "A fairly broad examination of the US healthcare system, very little actual economic theory is involved although it does touch on some concepts these are not explored in any depth and simply knowing definitions is about as difficult as it gets with regard to that.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was fascinating because it explained massive American healthcare systems that I've always heard about but never really understood - such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, etc. I really liked the way that the informative lectures by Dr. Forman were interspersed with guest lectures from individuals who were involved with different aspects of the healthcare industry. And I thought that the workload was very reasonable - I really appreciated that the course didn't involve a lot of busy work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, as it provides a comprehensive and interesting overview of the U.S. health industry in an economic context.",
    "Standard econ class",
    "Excellent class. Professor Forman is fantastic, and the guest lecturers were amazing. A terrific introduction to a really complicated subject. The workload is manageable and the exams are fair."
