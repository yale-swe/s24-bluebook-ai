   "comments": [
    "yes but, too much info to cram in. too many random names and facts - more important that we study the concepts and watch videos and analyze the performance. we need more practical and in depth information on a selective few. FROM ALL OVER.",
    "The course gives me an over view of theatre history in the Western World as well as particular time period in China, Japan and India. The through line of development is really helpful.",
    "The class is organized reasonably well. We move chronologically as much as possible and primarily focus on Western theatre practices. The class is structured as a traditional lecture-style class with a weekly discussion group. I did wonder about",
    "The course was extraordinarily well structured which made expectations very clear and also illuminated material in its historical context.",
    "I must say that I am highly disappointed with the overall formation of this course. I am disappointed because, upon coming to YSD, I was stricken with it's core value of care in the sharing and development of knowledge; the care that it takes to share this immense understanding and love of each of the school's faculty member's niche. In every class I can see the love for the subject in the eyes of the professors leading the course, including this, Drama 6 Survey of Theatre and Drama. However, where this class's leader falls short is the care that it takes to truly SHARE knowledge. I want to know this information. I really want to know this information. But how? After a full semester of this course, sure I've picked up a few facts about theatre and drama history that I've mostly been forced to try to cram in leading up to an exam, theres one thing I know for sure is true: Paul loves what he does and loves what he knows. I just wish I had the opportunity to have a seat at that table of knowledge. It seems that if I don't learn by having tons and I mean TONS of information thrown at me for 2 hours a week and deciphering enough to understand what exactly I'll need to hold on to to make it through an exam that is set up that only those who can express what it is they do know is by writing essays all under the pressure of a intense time crunch, then I am not meant to share in the knowledge given in this course. Which sucks! Because I really want to know it, but presently, most of time in class is me trying to figure out how I'm ACTUALLY going to learn whats being talked about. If this is how information continues to be presented, I am afraid that I am doomed for failure and I know for a fact I'm not alone in this fear. I'm honestly willing to put in the work to learn if I know HOW to do it. But the information I receive from this course is not presented in a way that is conducive to my learning, and I pray the tons of others that have openly shared this sentiment have spoken up about it as well.",
    "Solid syllabus. Properly planned lectures. And I don't know about the other discussion groups, but Sam was great. I thought some of the DFA lectures could've been better organized though. The lecture on Japanese Theatre was absolutely awful. I thought it was extremely disorganized and very culturally disrespectful. That is the only lecture I was not able to take ANY notes from, because it was so pointless. Also, the final test review (with Nahuel and Sam) was great. The review was no bullshit and to the point. However the midterm test review (with Nahuel and Jenny) was extremely disorganized and not very helpful. We don't go to test reviews to have a discussion, or to spend 15 minutes watching the two moderators try to decide who has the correct information. We don't want an answer to a question to be \"I don't know. What do you guys think?\". That sort of thing is for discussion groups. Not a Sunday night test review.",
    "No comments.",
    "The course organisation is great. We know what we are doing and when well in advance. All the course information is on Classes V2 and is pretty clear and concise.",
    "Paul exhibited a wealth of knowledge on the subject of theatre history from ancient Egyptian sacred drama to the 17th-century in Europe (English Restoration, French Neoclassicism).",
    "I liked the fact that we studied chronologically parallel theatre histories which helped me understand how theatre developed in different cultures during the same historical time frame. but it was difficult to keep track of genres that were nested within each time frame because of the amount of information in each lecture.",
    "Great organization, but i find it a little harsh with the absences. I overslept one Thursday which gave me 2 absences and I was late another day +1\/2 more. So I'd have dropped from the class if i was late another time. I realize discipline is important, but it's very hard to keep up sometimes, with the level of intensity we have in YSD."

   "comments": [
    "Don't like the discussion exercises",
    "The balance between lecture and section was helpful, but it would be helpful for the TAs to be more pointed in facilitating the conversations. There were some weeks when we didn't really talk about the themes and material mentioned in lecture, which made it harder to absorb the information.",
    "I thought the discussion groups provided great opportunities to discuss what was covered in lecture, but I was occasionally disappointed by the quality of discussion. This obviously reflects on my peers just as much (perhaps even more so) than the instructors, but I often craved a deeper critical and more intellectually rigorous engagement with the material than we were able to achieve.",
    "The lectures do pack in a LOT of information, and sometimes it's difficult to absorb all of that. But Paul is always willing to answer questions during and away from class, and the discussion groups help us process and digest all the information as well.",
    "No comments.",
    "I found that sometimes the prompts were too Verbose and phrased in a way that was too wordy and this made it difficult for me to engage in the discussions or give an adequate answer. I also wished that the discussions had more to do with how we engaged with this history and and these topics in 2016.",
    "Because the class was taught in a lecture format, there was not always a lot of time for discussion of the material in the final five minutes of class. I sometimes felt if the amount of information covered was lessened, I, as a student, would have the opportunity to retain and discuss the larger points more effectively in the amount of time allotted for class.",
    "Too much discussion - groups strayed off topic and could have finished significantly earlier.",
    "The lecture style of this class makes it both difficult to comprehend and hard to retain the information that is being provided. Paul Walsh is an extremely knowledgeable and very sweet individual, however, his reading off a script and quickly flipping through powerpoint slides makes it almost impossible to actually understand the material. The discussion groups became a place of valuable conversation but they were also very limiting in terms of the content we were discussing. I feel if we could break down the powerpoints and lectures it might be helpful. I enjoyed our conversations a lot.",

    "Why do we have to take tests? The paper was fine because we had a chance to go in depth and study some questions that interested us. Better if we have to use our artistry and connect the things we learn in class. that is practical and useful...",
    "The essay assignment was really interesting and fun to work on. The weekly responses, however, felt tedious. Mostly because the prompts were confusing or unrelated to the lectures. It was also frustrating that none of the TAs sent out the prompts at the same time or had the same submission deadlines. That inconsistency made it hard to keep track of the course in addition to everything else going on.",
    "I think that the assigned paper asked for a level of critical engagement and analysis that often didn't exist in the course. The lecture portion of the course moved at a clip, and the focus was often on factual information rather than analysis of the socio-political ramifications of those facts, or any sort of real synthesis of ideas. I spent most of class writing down names, dates, staging conventions, etc. so that when it came time to actually write the essay, I wasn't necessarily prepared for the level of depth required to analyze a single convention for 4-5 pages. While I received a good grade on the essay, I didn't necessarily feel like the assignment reflected the aims of the course as I had experienced them up until that point.",
    "I really enjoyed the paper assignment and found that it reinforced my understanding of the material from class. It was helpful to individually investigate how the socio-political-historical context of a play informs its content and performance conventions.",
    "No comments.",
    "It felt as though regurgitation was more important than analysis and I would have liked to engage with these topics in response to issues and realities of the present in more depth. Understanding the past and reflecting on the changes that have been effective and ineffective.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed researching my paper topic on Hrotsvit of Gandershem and her use of the teleological plot and stock characters within Medieval Drama.",
    "The paper wasn't too much, but there wasn't a lot of structure to the instructions for what it should resemble and if we should do real research.",
    "I did not find the timed exams or the paper at all helpful in applying the material to my own discipline or artistic practice. YSD is not an academic school--it's hands-on vocational training. So to be forced to perform academic evaluations was very frustrating, unhelpful, and irrelevant to the content and structure of our other training. Learning theatre history is important, but I resented needing to demonstrate my understanding of the material by proving how well I can take a test or write a formal academic paper. I would much rather demonstrate my knowledge through discussion, short and informal discussion responses or reflections, and perhaps oral evaluation or presentations. How well I can write a paper or take a timed exam has little to nothing to do with my ability to interpret a character deeply, attentively, authentically, and effectively. Timed exams are a flawed form of evaluation in formal academia, let alone in what's essentially a vocational school.",
    "I answered this below, but I think the exams should be take home exams or some other form of exam and the paper should be done away with. I can't justify putting all of my other work aside to focus countless hours on these exams and papers.",
    "Lots of busy work in this class. I would find several larger projects more helpful than a ton of small ones.",
    "I thought writing the paper was really informative. Having to do my own research on a particular theatrical convention used within a play that we read was great. I almost wished that we wrote papers instead of taking the exam."

   "question_text": "How did the amount of assigned reading work with weekly discussion?",
   "comments": [
    "My only issue with the amount of reading as it related to the weekly discussion is that our discussion responses were due to our leader by noon on Wednesdays. I have a major departmental class from 9-2 on Wednesdays, so often I spent Tuesday nights completing assignments for that. The noon on Wednesday deadline meant that I needed to have the reading for THURSDAY completed by TUESDAY NIGHT, which was difficult. The result was that I often missed the deadline for the discussion question, but did have the play read in time for the actual discussion. It wasn't ideal, and I wonder if there's a way to have that deadline be a little later next semester considering that YSD classes end at 2:00. A 3:00pm deadline on Wednesday would have made a huge difference for me.",
    "It's easy to get busy and ignore the readings sometimes, but I think one or two plays per week is totally reasonable. On one hand, I wish there were more secondary\/critical readings but on the other hand there's so much work for the school as a whole that adding too much more to any one class is a tricky proposition.",
    "The readings aren't bad. But sometimes I do think this class doesn't consider production schedules, and how impossible it is to do the readings sometimes.",
    "I don't think this should effect the amount of reading assigned, but I think it's worth noting that there are one or two weeks where the majority of students do not complete the reading due to work overload. (The final discussion of the semester was definitely one of these weeks.)",
    "I never knew if my prompt answer was correct or in the right direction because we never really engaged with our personal answers in the discussion classes but rather did a general discussion of the question and the class topics.",
    "To be very honest, the amount of reading was sometimes overwhelming, considering all my other responsibilities in the school. If I had had less material to cover, I would have retained more by the end of the semester. I feel somewhat like a novice in many subjects, rather than an expert in a few.",
    "Too much reading.",
    "In general, the amount of reading was reasonable.",
    "Sometimes I felt that the amount of reading required and the responses required did not match up and required much more in-depth research.",
    "I wish we had access to the scripts we have to read. It doesn;t seem like a big deal to find a book in the library but time is so short sometimes so this could really help!",
    "To be quite honest, reading for this class becomes insanely difficult with the amount of work we have to do for our other classes. I found myself reading synopsises or asking friends for summaries of what they read instead of taking the time to read the play. The work was also incredibly dense to get through and easy to put down.",
    "Sometimes readings AND written responses were a bit much to juggle. Really prefer to absorb the material before I have to opine on it, but we don't really have that luxury."

As a result I came away feeling that I knew a little bit about a lot of things (natural in a survey class), but I don't know that it filled a significant gap in my knowledge of the field.",
    "I had already taken similar theater history courses in undergrad. Paul's unique dramaturgical approach and contextualizing of theatrical history alongside world history are extraordinarily valuable and very much appreciated, but in terms of facts or names or general movements and seminal works, a lot of the material was a recap of my undergrad theater history course.",

    "Definitely leaving this class with more information than I had before. Introduced to a lot of unfamiliar plays as well.",
    "Yes, I appreciated how this was so much more inclusive than undergrad\/high school coursework (which was basically Greeks & Shakespeare.)",
    "There is the obvious gap in that I was learning about some Theatre History I did not know before however the disappointing side of that is I was learning about a History that was mostly vrey white and a society where other bodies seemed to not exist at all. We had one class two\/three classes in total that were not white history (Sanskrt, Noh and Japan) and the rest was completely a white version and perspective of the History of Theatre and this was disappointing to me as a black female because my body did not exist in one piece of History I learnt this semester. I feel like that is a very important gap that was not filled and should strongly be considered going forward.",
    "Paul's course certainly enhanced my knowledge of theatre history. He is very passionate about his work. I enjoyed the lectures and researching for the paper. However, because we covered so much information in such a short period of time, I have not retained much of it. This is particularly a problem when studying for the midterm and final exams. I felt like I was memorizing a lot of terms, cramming vocabulary into my brain, that would fall back out after the exam. I would prefer to have studied less information and feel more secure in my understanding and retention of the broad concepts. **I address this further in Question 18: what improvements would you suggest?",
    "Too much in-depth content which will rarely be needed again outside class.",
    "I learned about Chinese, Japanese, and Indian theatre history, which was nice. I didn't have previous knowledge of non-Western\/European theatre history. However, I already had a good sense of the trajectory of Western theatre history. I suppose I learned some more specific names and terms than I knew before, but I'm honestly not sure how knowing what \"Affective Piety\" is will help me in the 2016 entertainment industry.",
    "I definitely learned things I hadn't before and feel like I am to speak about theatre I knew nothing about prior to this class. However, I think the material was very euro-centric and male dominant and didn't explore the theatre of other parts of the world. I'd be VERY interested in learning about theatre and performance from Africa, Asia, Latin America, Indigenous nations, etc. In essence, the course filled the gap of knowledge in Euro-centric theatre but NOT in the theatre of other cultures.",

I don't think that this course is necessarily ideal for people who are looking to dive deep when it comes to certain time periods, staging conventions, etc. But it is a good broad look at a large swath of theatre history, and so it serves the purpose of being a good introduction to the subject matter.",
    "It depends how much time they had, what they're interested in, and what their learning style is. I enjoyed the lectures (indeed, I think I'd have enjoyed them more if part of me wasn't worried about what I'd need to hold in my brain for the exams), but for someone who doesn't learn well from lecture I imagine it'd be a fairly frustrating course.",

If it was just the lecture and the tests, I would definitely recommend it. It's not the material I have a problem with. I actually think the material and the plays we read are extremely valuable to designers. But time management is really impossible. And I don't believe that's an exaggeration.",

I think we can continue to learn the history offered in this course but we can no longer ignore or leave a massive gap in the histories that are happening side by side it and the histories that have made such massive contributions to what we regard as \"classic\" theatre today.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "It's good, it's just an immense workload.",
    "Not for my department.",
    "Not especially. It's quite a lot of time and effort to learn material that isn't intimately connected with my artistic practice or goals, and most of which I have honestly already forgotten or begun to forget. My ability to recall what autosacramentales are will not impact my ability to be cast in a network TV comedy. Although I can see why the material is good to know in theory, it was not demonstrated why the material is important to know in practice. The class provides some nice context and a few interesting tidbits, but a lot of it seems mostly like a formal slog for the sake of formality and slogs. I would not recommend the class for anyone other than extreme history nerds or people who truly don't know the first thing about theatre history. But I do not think the course is a good use of time for people who already have some (even general) knowledge about theatre history.",

    "No.",

    "There is so much interesting and valuable information offered, the lectures are beautifully written- yes, some of your students actually care that the lectures are eloquent, not just full of fact- so I would say yes."

    "Paul Walsh is clearly very, very knowledgeable about many things. He teaches certain sections of the course with an unrivaled passion and clarity. He's able to work critical analysis into the content of the lectures and keeps the material in conversation with contemporary practices and notions about performance. On these days the class is engaging and educational and you as the student feel confident about his expertise. However on days when we move into practices that he's less familiar with--Eastern theatrical practices--the class becomes a little less engaging. It's more fact oriented and it's clear that while he grasps the material better than the average student, it's not his field of expertise. On these days class can be confusing, and can be a little uncomfortable for students who know more about the material being covered than the instructor.",
    "Paul is not only extraordinary knowledgable but also incredibly enthusiastic about the subject matter. I appreciated his passion just as much as his breadth of knowledge. One caveat: sometimes the presentation of the non-western (European) traditions felt less informed than their western counterparts. I think it's really important to really brush up on the cultural context of these plays since they can be really different from our prevailing western culture and also - and this is key - to learn to pronounce names, terms, places, etc. (even the really hard ones!) so that the material cannot be misconstrued as obligatory or tokenism.",
    "No comments.",
    "I think that Paul knows what he knows very well. However, I think there needs to be an expansion in the course subject matter.",
    "Paul has a very strong grasp of the subject matter and is very passionate about theater history. His fervor makes the lectures exciting and enlightening.",
    "He has an excellent grasp of Western and European history. His (and the TAs') grasp of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian theatre history is clearly more limited and much less specific and deep. It is adequate and helpful for non-experts, but I imagine that I may have been frustrated if I had passing knowledge of Chinese and Japanese and Indian theatrical traditions before this class.",
    "Paul is a lovely man with a wonderful well of knoweldge. He's incredibly passionate about this and I respect that deeply. I think he could benefit from expanding his style of teaching. Perhaps we can spend more time discussing the topics in his lecture class versus his reading off a script. When he was the facilitator in my discussion group it was FABULOUS. I love speaking with him directly about the plays and being able to go on a journey with him in the material!!",
    "Mr. Walsh clearly knows his stuff and it was always fun to hear his extemporaneous responses to questions at the end of class. Sometimes made me wish he was able to digress within the lectures themselves, but time was so short, that didn't or couldn't happen."

    "Professor Walsh writes very thorough and thoughtful lectures, but he packs so much into the 50 minute classes that he speeds through the material. If he could read his lectures more slowly, it would be easier for us to absorb what he is saying.",
    "Paul Walsh presents his lectures with heavy reliance on pre-written notes. He effectively types out the lecture and reads that lecture aloud during class. While I understand that this is probably the most effective way to make sure that all of the material is covered, it can be a little alienating which makes it hard to concentrate. The result is also that the lectures move at a break-neck speed sometimes. While reviewing some of the material for the exam I realized that some of the slide shows are up to 100 slides long, even with pictures, that still means we're reading about 2 slides every minute. It can be overwhelming for even the most attentive and engaged student.",
    "Paul's humor is essential to keeping these classes interesting but at no time does it feel like he doesn't take the material seriously. His passion is what makes this class so enjoyable even when you're dog tired in tech for a Rep show with three other projects due and yadda yadda yadda.",
    "I wish the lectures were less scripted. Speaking to Paul out of class (or even when he answers people's questions at the end of class) is SO different from the lectures. It's hard to focus during the lectures because it's too fast and scripted.",

    "The high speed with which the classes go at made it very hard to take notes or even engage with what was being said.",

However, because he reads his lectures and only allows for discussion time at the end of class, I sometimes miss information due to the speed at which he reads. It would help me if he covered less information and slowed down so that I could process everything he teaches.",

    "I found this course very valuable - the study of theatre is very valuable to me as a designer. The balance between lecture and discussion was good, and I always appreciated Paul giving some time for questions at the end of lectures. The lectures are very interesting, and a LOT is packed into them. I'm hesitant to suggest less content to be in the lectures, but when they go along at such a breakneck speed it's hard to sit with and process all the information. As a second-year designer, the scheduling of the course was exceedingly difficult (and I suspect that it may be the same for second-year TD&Ps.) Because of us all being wrapped up in productions, and our two critique classes being on Wednesday, the timing of the response questions was not ideal, as Monday and Tuesday are when all of our homework is due for all our classes, including other departmental classes. If the responses were sent out much earlier we could have more time to complete them and be less rushed about it. The midterm and final also happened to always line up with a thesis show tech and opening as well. Again, I feel like this class is very necessary, and I appreciate being able to spend time with different eras and texts throughout theatre history, but I think second year might be the worst time for designers to take this class.",
    "As noted above, I often did not read the assignments until the night before they were due, but I was able to read a good percentage of the assigned reading.",
    "Paul is a wonderful person and a generous teacher and the care he puts into his presentations is evident. I enjoyed Jennys discussion group a lot. Im really glad to have read all of the plays I did for the class and to have a broad knowledge of Western theater. The classes on Japanese, Indian and Chinese theater were difficult to follow and I would have loved to have experts on each of these traditions come in and guest lecture. I was really happy that we touched was some non-Western theater, but these classes felt the least in depth and I would have loved to better understand these traditions and innovations (and frankly, even just correctly pronounce the words).",
    "I must say that I am highly disappointed with the overall formation of this course. I am disappointed because, upon coming to YSD, I was stricken with it's core value of care in the sharing and development of knowledge; the care that it takes to share this immense understanding and love of each of the school's faculty member's niche. In every class I can see the love for the subject in the eyes of the professors leading the course, including this, Drama 6 Survey of Theatre and Drama. However, where this class's leader falls short is the care that it takes to truly SHARE knowledge. I want to know this information. I really want to know this information. But how? After a full semester of this course, sure I've picked up a few facts about theatre and drama history that I've mostly been forced to try to cram in leading up to an exam, theres one thing I know for sure is true: Paul loves what he does and loves what he knows. I just wish I had the opportunity to have a seat at that table of knowledge. It seems that if I don't learn by having tons and I mean TONS of information thrown at me for 2 hours a week and deciphering enough to understand what exactly I'll need to hold on to to make it through an exam that is set up that only those who can express what it is they do know is by writing essays all under the pressure of a intense time crunch, then I am not meant to share in the knowledge given in this course. Which sucks! Because I really want to know it, but presently, most of time in class is me trying to figure out how I'm ACTUALLY going to learn whats being talked about. If this is how information continues to be presented, I am afraid that I am doomed for failure and I know for a fact I'm not alone in this fear. I'm honestly willing to put in the work to learn if I know HOW to do it. But the information I receive from this course is not presented in a way that is conducive to my learning, and I pray the tons of others that have openly shared this sentiment have spoken up about it as well.",
    "Lessen the course load. Even JUST eliminating the play responses would be helpful. The lectures are great. The discussions are great. The tests and term paper are hard, but they're necessary.",
    "I did my best to complete as much of the coursework as possible. Some of my responses to discussion questions were pretty weak and I wasn't able to finish most of the reading for the second half of the semester due to production workload. (I'll try a few different techniques next semester to see if I can fit more in.)",
    "I believe I missed one weekly prompt and did hand it in later.",
    "My biggest suggestion about this course regards the preparation for the midterm and final exam. The study guide covered a lot material that wasn't on the exam. I would have preferred a more concise guide so that I could adequately retain the pertinent information. For example, instead of loosely memorizing 300 terms (which I will inevitably forget after the test), I'd rather know more specifically the 80 key terms and concepts that I can commit to memory and know for the rest of my life as a theater artist. That way, this learning benefits me beyond my schooling. (Learning the basic principles of neoclassicism, for example: decorum, verisimilitude, the 3 unities, 5-act structure rather than memorizing four or five different architect\/scenic designers from the Renaissance period). Another solution to this problem would be to write papers in lieu of midterm or final exams. Then, as a student, I could delve deeply into one subject matter and gain a more comprehensive understanding of that period of theater history. As a student, I genuinely want to learn what Paul is teaching. It is fascinating and stimulating. It is unfortunate that, as an acting student, I also have classes from 9-2 and then production assignment and work-study. For example, I had to study for the Drama 6 Final this semester while I was ushering for Seven Guitars. That was my only free time from roughly 9am to 11:30p for the two weeks leading up to the final exam. I hope that the two suggestions above might solve some of this problem for the upcoming semester, so that we can digest the material in a more efficient, less chaotic way.",
    "Given how severely time is at a premium at YSD, I sadly don't think this course is the best use of time for members of the acting department. The material is important to know, but it would perhaps be a better use of our time to take it as an online course over the summer before we arrive on campus. Having an extra four hours a week to devote to other courses and physical training would be incalculably invaluable in our training. Other conservatory acting programs have far more class time and hands-on physical training than the actors at YSD do, and I deeply regret that we are behind peer institutions on the sheer training time we get. I would feel infinitely better prepared for my career as a competitively trained actor in this industry if I had more physical training and more film\/TV training, whereas my knowledge about theatre history doesn't make me feel better prepared to be an effective and competitive actor in the industry after I graduate. That extra four hours a week could be spent continuing New Games through the second semester, including a much, much needed physical workout\/training\/health\/nutrition class with Mike Rossmy for the actors, additional tutorial time for Alexander\/voice\/speech, expanded scene study class with Ron, or even incorporating TV\/film acting into the curriculum before the third year (especially vital given that most of the actors will be making half or more of their income and career from film and TV work). Theatre history is very important to know and Paul teaches it very well. His task is rather impossible: impart a massive amount of information to students in very different disciplines. But for all of Paul's wonderful expertise and facility of teaching such a huge swath of knowledge to different departments concurrently, I unfortunately would rather taking this as an online course over the summer to free up more time during the semester for specific actor-training classes to allow us to be more competitive with actors from peer institutions who receive far more physical and practical training time than YSD actors do.",
    "Paul is terrific and passionate and incredibly intelligent, but the way the class is structured I just can't retain and or focus on the material in class. I think the mid term and final exams need to be reevaluated and the paper should be done away with. I simply cannot justify spending a week studying several hours a day leading up to the exams and at least 3-5 days writing a paper that is essentially a book report and not applicable to anything I will use in my work, and putting off all the work that I'm trying to learn in order to become a better actor. I think the exams should be take-home exams, that way no matter what every person will have to learn the material enough to write it down and will likely retain it because of the lack of pressure. Even if everyone studied and worked on them together we would still have to put the answers into our own language and would still have to learn the material fairly thoroughly in order to answer the questions. It's the only solution I can think of.",
    "I wish there was more personal review of the response essays to get a better idea of my quality of writing or answering. I had no idea whether my writing or analysis were improved or whether they needed corrections.",
    "The class is great and i've learned a lot. My only issue is that is a little too overwhelming - it takes way too much more time and efforts than my specialty ones, i wish i could focus on. Little bit more flexibility (on the assignments and attendance) would be very appreciated!",
    "I HIGHLY RECOMMEND diversifying the content that is taught in this class. As a person of color, it became discouraging to constantly be learning about a Euro-centric theatre. I more interested in learning about theatre that comes from all corners of the world. And I mean more than just one lecture on chinese, japanese, indian, etc. A more inclusive approach to the this class would be ideal!! I suggest that this class make space for guest speakers\/lectures to work with us for two hours on the Thursday slot that specialize in a particular theatre style, form, or culture. A guest artist from Japan who has a solid understanding on the history of Japanese theatre would be wonderful, for example. Having a different guest artist every two weeks or so would be beautiful. I also suggest incorporating more videos of specific performances.",

    "I really enjoyed my discussion group. There was a great sense of openness and camaraderie in the group. I was frustrated by how often students who obviously didn't read the text felt entitled to speak and take up space in the room.

    "Personally, I did not find the discussion sections very useful, though I recognize that they may be moreso for other people. Part of my problem was that on any given day, many in the section hadn't done the reading, so the discussions didn't feel particularly productive. And while I understand that having students split into yet smaller groups (or pairs) to discuss first is an effort to ensure that everyone talks, it's an approach that reminds me of being back in high school and makes the conversation feel really stilted.
