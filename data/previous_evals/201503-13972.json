    "Instructor: Jennifer Burlingame Hoyle Fair \u00a0Jenn is great!",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Burlingame Hoyle Fair \u00a0Very flexible and responsive. Jenn was very willing to re-schedule field trips. She is incredibly knowledgeable of the course material and generous with her time.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Burlingame Hoyle Fair \u00a0Jenn is an approachable and helpful TA who tries her best to provide assistance in the different assignments throughout the course. She is able to ask pertinent questions in class to shed light on issues and concerns tied to river restoration as she had the experience of working out in the field. These questions would not be asked by the class as most of us do not have the insight to the actual construction works. Her questions had helped to clarify and provide depth to the discussion. She is one of the best TA I have worked with! Great work Jenn!"

He was also so helpful with the final projects, and went out over various weekends to help groups complete their projects, always with a smile on his face and a snack for us! I am very glad he decided to teach the class this year. Thanks Jim!",
    "Jim has an intimate understanding how how rivers work and his enthusiasm for the subject material shows through. His wealth of real world experience and theoretical understanding is a real asset to all students interested in river processes and\/or restoration or watershed management work.",

    "The field trips were a highlight. Jim is a practitioner, and it was helpful to see him in his element. We visited a number of sites that he and his company is involved in. The trips are necessary to better understand how river restoration really works. Jim's tangents on his past projects were also enjoyable, and he goes on a lot of tangents...",
    "Field trips and real application of what we learned in class.",
    "In field experience. Going out to the rivers and seeing things first hand. The rest of the classes is a flood of powerpoint, charts, pictures, etc. but nothing beats putting your boots on and getting out into the rivers.",
    "Field trips!",
    "Jim's wealth of knowledge and learning from him and Jenn in the field.",
    "Learning from Jim was a great experience. He was so helpful on our final project, and I felt I was absorbing some of the knowledge he has gained throughout his long career. Working on a project helped me to see how a similar project could work in a \"real world\" consulting situation. The field trips were fun as well.",
    "Jim is very knowledgeable and great. The field trips were the best part so we could see what we talked about in class",
    "The professional experience of our lecturer and the field trips were helpful ways to consolidate the lectures. The field trips provide the grounding for the theoretical discussion in class by demonstrating its application. This is something important for a professional school as it prepares students for work upon graduation."

    "The course this semester was a bit disjointed. Part of that is because the structure of the course was altered for this semester to fit Jim's schedule, but I think better care could have been taken to present the material in a more straight forward manner. More applied practice and activities for the students to take part in would have been helpful.",
    "The long field trip write up and the final take home exam seemed repetitive. Also since we completed a final project, the final exam felt like unnecessary busy work.",
    "I wish the class was more applied and discussion based.",
    "Would like more foundational information in Lecture.",
    "Following through on the idea of student-led paper discussions would have been great. We had a few presentations, but there was little back and forth discussion at the end of them.",
    "The course wasn't very well organized--there wasn't a good flow from week to week. The readings were erratic and not that helpful. Expectations were vague.",
    "I felt that the number of assignments for the class should be listed out clearly at the start of the semester so that students could plan for the work that is required. For instance, I did not expect a report for each of our field trip and one of them were of consideration length. However, I see the value in the report as I learnt alot from them."

Also, a group project where you get to do a \"restoration\" or any river-related project near the end of the term.",
