    "Please, please, please in the future inform students that a solid understanding of genetics is required to benefit from this course. Perhaps it should even be a prerequisite. Having no prior coursework in genetics, I felt like large portions of the class were being taught in a different language. I did benefit from my prior coursework in epidemiology and toxicology, but struggled keep up with the large genetic component of this class.",
    "Great overview of molecular methods. Perhaps references to textbook might be useful, although is difficult in a rapidly changing field.",
    "The breadth of material was quite large. It might be better to narrow the scope and cover it in more depth.",
    "Good introduction to molecular epi, but requires a good deal of scientific background knowledge.",
    "Material was interesting and relevant to current molecular epi research. Lecture slides were a bit disorganized."
