    "If the crazy poets who wrote prose poetry intrigue you, take this class!",
    "This is a very close examination of the prose poem in French literature. The reading list is pretty good and you read some of the best poets French lit has to offer, and though each reading follows a similar format, the professor does a pretty good job of mixing it up so that things stay interesting. Professor Connolly is really nice and will equip you with some of the skills to interpret the prose poem - he'll open your eyes to the smallest details, such as the number of syllables in a line, or a little jeu de mots. The reading load ranges, as we usually read about one anthology a week, but different poets have different styles (some are much more dense, complex than others). You will need to write two papers on a single poem, which is actually rather pleasant since you do a lot of deep analysis on a single poem, rather than a surface reading of many poems; the final paper is on two poems; overall the workload isn't too bad. I would certainly recommend this class, as you will enjoy building a toolset to analyze any French text. I had not had much exposure to poetry before, and I'm glad I was able to take an in depth look at a very particular type of poetry, the prose poem.",
    "Excellent French class - hard reading in an underappreciated genre, brimming with beauty. Prof. Connolly is a compassionate but challenging instructor. Class was usually split between a mini-lecture from Prof. Connolly and informal discussion, either in small groups or with the entire class.",
    "This is a great class. You come into it most likely wanting to read more Baudelaire or Rimbaud, which you do, but you're also introduced to a vast array of other (awesome) French writers. Professor Connolly is enthusiastic and knows his stuff, and, even at 9am, managed to make the class fun. There's a decent amount of one-on-one, peer-to-peer discussion, which could be really enlightening and useful, but depended heavily on who you were sitting next to for the day. If you think the material looks interesting, take it for sure.",
    "'The Prose Poem' as taught by Professor Connolly was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale because of the authors we read, the ideas they brought with them, and Professor Connolly's presentation and framing of the discussion. For those interested in those period-defying prose innovators from the mid-1800s to the present (with special attention given to the kings, Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9 and Rimbaud), this course will be a great pleasure, particularly since coverage of 19th and 20th century verse seems oddly rare in the department. For those interested in the poetry in question, the writing and presentation for the class will be a pleasure. The reading, either because of its density or occasionally sheer length (Lautr\u00c3\u00a9amont) was too much to finish most weeks; much of it was incredibly opaque, denying facile comprehension. In that sense, some of the reading is nigh impossible, as the very process breaks down. But the reward is great and Professor Connolly was understanding of the difficulty. Most of it is so good that you'll make up the reading on your own out of your own interest. Overall a simply wonderful course!",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone. It's just brilliant!",
    "Yes, absolutely. This was a great course which I highly recommend to any student wanting to read canonical French poetry with a brilliant and creative prof. One of my favorite courses of the semester, even of my time at Yale. Prof. Connolly is the reason this course was so enjoyable. His readings of the works are smart and creative and he really takes the time to lead class discussion in a productive manner. He also makes you feel like you can actually speak intelligently about poetry, which is probably the toughest task for any poetry prof. His assignments were great and I would fully recommend taking a class with him to a fellow student. Also, listening to his takes on the texts was one of the most fascinating parts of the course every week. He is really knowledgeable, but remains accessible and friendly.",
    "YES; very interesting course. It will be different from any other type of poetry class you will encounter. The main theme is distinguishing the difference between prose and poetry in style as well as intention of the poet. You will read some very interesting stuff."
