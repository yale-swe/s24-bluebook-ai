   "comments": [
    "Latin 110 is by no means a \"gut\" course-- you should not take this course simply to fulfill the foreign language requirement-- but is a highly enriching and satisfying one if you are willing to put in the work. It is intended for someone who has never taken Latin before, and the material seemed to build slowly at first and then rapidly accumulate, so it is necessary to keep up with the work lest you fall behind and be lost. The course, by nature of the language, involves a lot of memorization, mastery of different forms and terminations of words, and study, which are tested through weekly quizzes and translation assignments; however, minimal speaking is required, and speaking Latin is not a graded part of the course. So, this course may especially appeal to someone who enjoys a high degree of organizational structure, but does not particularly enjoy the speaking element found in almost every other language.",
    "I would recommend the class because Latin is very interesting and the class moves at a great pace.",
    "This course was excellently structured. If you do all the work, you will most likely get an A. However, take note that doing all the work, at least for me, meant putting in an hour or a bit more per night. At the end of the course, though, I was extremely confident in my Latin grammar skills - much more confident than I thought I could have been with only one semester of study. Although ancient Roman cultural\/political\/intellectual concepts are not tested in this course, I was exposed to many of these concepts along the way, too, which helped me maintain interest in the coursework - especially once we started translating the works of actual Latin authors\/orators in the second half of the term. If you're a) interested in the language or b) trying to fufill your language requirement while still shooting for an A (if you put in about an hour a night), I highly recommend this course.",
    "Prepare to work hard every night. Get the textbook and start working on vocab months in advance in order to keep up...",
    "Latin 110 is a fantastic, exciting way to start learning Latin if you've never done it before and want to jump right in. You'll get through all four conjugations by week four, all five declensions by week six, and effectively every tense, voice, and mood in the language by the end of the course - and you'll get snippets of real Latin authors in the original, like Horace, Catullus, Virgil, and Martial, starting about halfway through and continuing through the end. If Latin interests you and you haven't gotten a chance to do it yet, this is the way. Homework is daily but light (rarely more than 30 minutes to an hour), and weekly quizzes are actually more helpful than harmful, since they give you good checkpoints on whether you're absorbing the large amount of stuff you're learning."
