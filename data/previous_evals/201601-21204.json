   "comments": [
    "Intro to Ethics is a great class, and if you're only ever going to take one philosophy class, this should be it. I wouldn't be too worried about the grading policy, but it's definitely not a bad idea to start the course Credit\/D (I changed mid-way through). The class will force you to think, and if you're discussion section is good you really will have many of your ideas challenged and likely come out of the course with a different perspective of what morality and ethics are.",
    "A crucial note: you need to take a step back on the papers and think about the logical structure of your argument. The papers will take longer than you think. On the other hand, this class was reading-optional because the original texts of Kant, Mill, etc. don't really help you understand the arguments compared to the premise-by-premise breakdown that you get in lecture and that you can read more about elsewhere.",
    "Solid class on moral philosophy; provides good vocabulary for students interested in ethics, though I recommend taking it Credit\/D (it is a great class for it)",
    "I don't recommend Introduction to Ethics. I just didn't think it was that interesting.",
    "This is a great Credit\/D\/Fail class. The lectures were always interesting, I enjoyed section, and the papers were relatively low work, high rewards.",
    "Interesting lectures. Light and pretty much optional readings. Engaging discussion sections given the right TA. Brutal grading system. Hard to mess around and get a triple double... Take it credit D unless you're gonna go hard in the paint.",
    "If you want to read Kant and Mill and maybe talk about free will a little, take this class. If you want to discuss a philosophy that is more universal, more grounded in the real world, more able to engage with social science on human behavior, more broadly and fairly sourced to female and non-white and non-Western authors, then avoid this class if possible.",
    "Not great: Shelly is rambling and slow and as a result does not go into depth on the interesting issues. The course describes utilitarianism and its many flavors without really motivating the theory before transitioning to a discussion of Kant that is actually very helpful (Shelly gives a good exposition of the Kantian theory which is difficult to get from reading Grounding). It ends with a rushed description of contractarian theories which suffer from the same lack of motivation and detail. That being said, the class is probably worth taking as a freshman so you can get into better seminars later on. Papers and grading really aren't bad, and there's almost no reading, so it really isn't that hard a course.",
    "Take the class credit D. It's an awesome class but the grading is tough. Worth using the credit D to learn the material.",
    "Don't even use a credit D on this class.",
    "It is not joke grade-wise (I ended up taking it credit\/d), but it isn't as tough as it is reputed to be.",
    "I would not recommend PHIL 175 on the basis of the grading system, as the stress of performing well may detract from the enjoyment of philosophizing one could gain from a class composed of engaging lectures and interesting discussion. However, if this were to be rectified, I would certainly recommend it.",
    "I think this is an ideal course for anyone who wants to have a brush with the classic ethical philosophies: it is a very manageable workload (especially if you take it credit\/D, would recommend), very engaging material. Shelly is a great lecturer though you should be sure to try to find a good section because a huge part of what made the class a positive experience for me was the well-moderated, polite discussions we the students had.",
    "Your experience will depend on whether you take this class for a grade. Unless you take the plunge, I doubt you will tackle it with the same rigor. You will not learn as much, otherwise.",
    "Like the others say, probably best to take it Credit\/D, though it really isn't too hard to get an A\/A- if you put in some effort. His \"How to Write a Philosophy Paper\" isn't super helpful, and I suspect that is why grades are so low--skim literally any modern philosophy paper to get a feel for the required style, and then belabor the point as much as you can in your arguments for thoroughness, and that will get you a good grade. Being honest, if you have any sort of even modest background in ethics, you probably won't get too much out of this course, but it's an easy credit, I guess. Section is also a huge part of the grade: just generally speaking, Shelly's classes are highly TA-driven, so make sure you have a good one. Just don't be afraid to talk.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to the most influential moral theories. Shelly Kagan is a great lecturer, and the readings and essays are completely manageable (albeit the essays require a bit of work and a comprehensive understanding of the material in order to do well). I definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about philosophy or the foundations of contemporary moral theories.",
    "For sure take it Credit\/D.",
    "I took this course because it was required for my major. If this is the case for you, then my advice would be to take it cr\/d\/f if you can, and to shop some sections and choose a TA whose style works for you. If that is not the case for you, and you are wondering whether to take this class, I would advise against it. I will say that I think the lecture style works very well for some people. What I found irritating was that lectures were not dense enough Shelly would introduce a simple concept (anyone could easily understand it, even having no philosophy experience) and then spend 10 minutes going over it. I (and many others who felt the same way) found it very easy to lose focus. That said, he does do the same for more complex concepts which is actually helpful. Even so, I dont think I walked away with a better understanding of the questions that the course purports to answer, such as why should we act morally? and what is morality, really?",
    "I read a bunch of different reviews before deciding I would take this credit\/d just because I thought it might be an interesting, low stress way to get a credit. Wasn't that interesting. I didn't really end up doing anything. I wouldn't recommend it. If you do take it (definitely take it credit\/d) you won't work that hard and also won't learn much.",
    "Introduction to Ethics is a fantastic course and has been my favorite course at Yale thus far. Not only is the subject matter fascinating, but Shelly Kagan is engaging and makes difficult material accessible. Although the class has a reputation of being difficult to do well in, it is definitely feasible to be successful if you put the effort in. I would recommend Intro to Ethics to any Yale student without reservation.",
    "An introduction to ethics- i.e. foundations of morality. I would recommend, as helps one think about these important subjects, even if they are not an EPE major.",
    "It was great! I'm a senior epe major and it was a wonderful way to end my academic career! Shelly was wonderful and inspiring, and I leave the majors feeling all the better for this experience!!!",
    "PHIL 175 is a great course to take Credit D, the material is interesting, the lectures are enjoyable to listen to, but the grading is very hard. I am happy I took the class and learned about philosophy as it is a topic I didn't know much about and the course made me think about morality more than I ever had before.",
    "Summary of prevailing moral theories. I would recommend for students who are at all interested in Philosophy or Ethics.",
    "Though there is not much work, the class makes you evaluate your own moral perspectives while at the same time making clear what those of some of the leading philosophers were. I would recommend this class but know that the papers are harshly graded\/there is some uncertainty as to how you will do on each paper.",
    "Don't take it unless you take it Cr\/d and love philosophy. I often felt discouraged and inept",
    "Overall, while I had to take this course as an EP&E major (and I suspect many in this course are in a similar position), I would say that this was a fairly solid course in-and-of-itself. Grading is as difficult as advertised (and tended to be rather slow), though this can be alleviated by electing to take the course Credit-D-Fail (which I strongly recommend). I recommend putting good effort into the first and second papers, which takes much stress off of the third paper during reading period. Lectures were, as expected, lively and engaging (though a bit rambling at times). The TFs are good overall as well; mine was good at breaking down concepts and generally leading discussion in section, though was not as helpful with feedback on essay outlines. This is not a particularly demanding course Credit-D-Fail; there are only three essays and discussion section (which requires being engaged and active as a participant), and the readings feel rather optional, as they are not brought up extensively in lecture or section and are not as helpful as the lectures in thinking conceptually about the essays. As an EP&E major, I took this course as a sophomore, which I believe was a good choice, as it lays the foundations for future philosophical coursework. I would probably recommend prospective EP&E majors to take this course after being accepted into the major, as I think it helps to have another philosophy courses (like DS or Intro Political Philosophy) under your belt before starting this one, in order to get in the mindset of thinking abstractly and conceptually.",
    "If you want to experience Shelley Kagan's brilliance then yes, take this course... But the grading is really rough and I wouldn't recommend this class unless it is required for your major.",
    "I think you should be able to tell from the first few lectures whether you like Shelly's lecturing style. You can also find his guide to writing a philosophy paper and see if that is the kind of paper you'd be interested in writing. Personally, I enjoyed the opportunity to argue my own opinion.",
    "PHIL 175 is a good started philosophy course, but lectures can get a little dull occasionally as it is a survey course. Shelly is a really passionate lecturer though, I had a great TF and wonderful section. The grading is difficult, but manageable, so if you're interested in philosophy take it.",
    "The class is not great. I took it credit\/d so I probably could've worked harder and got more out of it. Kagan is pretty interesting most of the time but I don't think I like philosophy as much as I had previously thought if I'm being honest with myself.",
    "You've probably heard a lot of things about this course. I think it's a fine course, and even a good one if you're interested in moral philosophy, but I wouldn't rave and call it a classic Yale course as some have. Please, please take this credit\/d. Three 5-page philosophy papers doesn't sound like a lot, until you realize that they're philosophy papers. A friend said upon finishing the last paper that he'd rather get a root canal than write another one. The grading in this class is as harsh as you've heard it to be. I had to take this class for a grade for my major and found it really frustrating because everyone else seemed to be taking it cr\/d to avoid Shelly's grading policies.",
    "PHIL 175 is a class that all students who wish to do EPE have to take. If you're not going to do EPE, I would suggest that you skip this course. There are other philosophy courses that tackle more specific subjects that have more interesting content. The grading in this class is also very harsh, though I think that people like to think that it is harder to get a B\/B+\/A-\/A than it actually is. Shelly is not kidding when he says that he weighs later grades more heavily.",
    "challenging class but it helped me form cohesive and distinctive arguments.",
    "This class is not a survey philosophy class, but an opportunity to figure out your own moral principles. Take it if you are confused about what morality means for you.",
    "Excellent course. I learned a lot and I'm really glad I took this course. Philosophy gives you a new way of thinking. Papers are good for thinking through the topic, but talking to other people + your TA is a necessity! It helps so much. Paper writing is difficult, I wish there was more instruction for how to write a good philosophy paper, and differentiation on how to approach tangible topics and more theoretical ones. Overall, very good course, but definitely Credit\/D, then switch to a letter grade later.",
    "Wonderful introductory course. The lectures are stellar and the section reinforces the lecture while allowing for deeper exploration of the topic. I would recommend it either credit D or for a letter grade. Rewrites are possible which is something that is rarely discussed when talking about this course.",
    "This was an amazing class! My favorite by far this semester. Each lecture was so interesting. The sections were great too. The grading is a little annoying, and I really don't see the point, but in the end I think everyone does okay. It is definitely not an easy class though.",
    "I would tentatively recommend this course to another student, but only if they have the time to take it. This should not be a fifth class. I think almost all students can do well, it's just a matter of time.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures and working on the papers, although the readings are not immensely helpful or important except for a basic understanding of the themes in the class. Take this class credit\/d at least to start with, it makes it a lot more enjoyable.",
    "Though most people take PHIL 175 because it is a prerequisite for EP&E, I would recommend this class to anyone in Yale College. Not only does it provide you with a fundamental basis of moral judgments, it also teaches you to think analytically in a broader sense. It pushes your limits of logic and after having taken it you will find yourself not only a person of better judgment, but person of better analytical skills--skills you will be happy to use in any career that you might pursue.",
    "Pretty interesting, easy course. Review of Utilitarianism, Kantian Deontology, Contractariansim. Shelly is an engaging lecturer and it's very easy to follow him 3 papers, 5 pages each, pretty harsh grading at the beginning but reasonable as the semester goes on. Good TFs mostly. Take it if you're interesting in discussing you basics views about ethics and how we should measure the Good and all that good stuff. Reading is light and you don't really have to do it if you don't want to, though it helps to do some of the reading when you write the papers. Solid course.",
    "A good class!",
    "PHIL 175 is a great crash course on morality. I would highly recommend you take this class but suggest that you take it Cred\/D\/Fail, especially if you have not taken philosophy classes in the past.",
    "I took the class expecting to be challenged in my thinking and writing in order to become better at both. I left slightly disappointed. Shelly takes 50 minutes to present ideas that could have been described in much less. n fact, I often found myself going to lecture only to get an idea of what Shelly's particular version of a certain school of thought looks like (to write the paper accordingly). But would have loved to go out of pure interest in the lectures. The grading is fairly strict, yes, but this should not be an issue if it helps to push you to give it your best. I just wish Shelly's lectures had been nearly as good as his expectations are high - which was not the case, in my opinion. On the other hand, the sections were great! Shelly is fantastic at one thing: isolating philosophical ideas from their historical context, forcing the students to engage logic and discussion. As a result, the sections are pretty intense and require you to follow each argument carefully. If you want to improve your ability to discuss abstract topics, this might be a great class to look into! Unfortunately, I often felt like the sections went way beyond the content of Shelly's lectures.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Around campus, you will hear these various moral positions thrown around and you will not be able to make insightful and clear remarks until you take a class similar to this and experience such a rigorous process of moral critique. You do not want to live your life being bullied by people who are willing to sophistically guilt you into conforming to their world-view. This class is a must-take for someone who wants to live a purposeful and clear-headed life.",
    "This is a pretty good class. It wasn't life changing, like some of the reviews had said but it was a solid introduction to moral philosophy. Shelly does a good job of explaining material that can be complex at times. Definitely take it credit D if you are a stickler about your GPA. And if you have some interest in ethics, I would recommend this class.",
    "Intro Ethics was easily one of my favorite classes at Yale. Professor Kagan does a great job of guiding you through the thought processes used to evaluate ethical theories. The format of two weekly 50 minute lectures combined with discussion sections worked really well. It's not a lot of work, but there are very high standards for grading. I'm really glad I took it Cr\/D. I would definitely recommend taking it if you have an interest in learning more about ethics.",
    "Excellent--must take!",
    "Take this class if you like articulating your opinions about philosophical issues and willing to a put a lot of time into the essays.",
    "This course is painful, but I'm glad I took it. I feel like the best thing I got out of it was a working dinner party knowledge of the standard ethical theories. Section was also really great, but that depends on your TF.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS CREDIT\/D. YOU WILL BE FINE!! Shelly will kill you on the first paper and then you'll get a good grade in the end.",
    "Take this class only if you value learning more than the letter grade you will end up with! Otherwise, get a gut class!",
    "Mad hard grading. Even if you're a straight A student, you'd wanna pick this one as your CR\/D. Kagan is a fantastic lecturer. Section was a bit dull.",
    "Reputations about this class are about right. The lectures are really good, the readings are not too demanding, and the papers are downright unpleasant. The prompts are really hard to get rolling with and it is difficult to get an A if that's what you're looking for. You would need a little more reading and learning to really have a good grasp of the variety of ideas within ethics even if you complete this course and do the readings, because the nature of the course precludes certain strands of thought. That being said, it can give a good feel for the kinds of questions ethicists deal with and Shelly has some great insights into philosophy in general that are peppered throughout the course."
