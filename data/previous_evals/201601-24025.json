    "Fascinating course, great syllabus, learned a lot.",
    "This was an amazing course! We went over so much material and each topic was so interesting. Aaron is a great seminar leader, facilitating dynamic discussions. I would definitely recommend this class to others. Aaron was so willing to meet and help me when I wanted to talk over different topics and the papers. I don't think I would change anything about this class.",
    "Take it if the syllabus interests you! You gain from the class a lot more if you do the reading",
    "In this class, youll read a book or a few articles about some example of the white middle class discovering a minority or other previously ignored group (families in rural Appalachia, tenement housing residents, Southern folk singers, California grape workers, etc), then discuss questions of authenticity and power dynamics. I would recommend it as a way to not only learn history, but critique events within it. Discussion is kind of free form, and the two papers are rather independent. Be prepared to be left with open questions at the end of class about the morals of discovering that will never be answered",
    "Absolutely! Take it for a good HU credit, but above all, for Aaron! He will soon become your favorite professor at Yale. The class is not that work intensive either, but be sure to do your readings carefully! Take it with good people in the class to make for more pleasant conversations.",
    "I think this was a new class so it was a little disjointed; it was also too small in my opinion (I think there were 8 of us). It's true name is really \"critiques of those who claim to have discovered the other America,\" which is an interesting lens through which to examine American histories. It's cool to take a seminar that is essentially thesis-driven. It should be cross-listed with AMST, not sure why it isn't, but it didn't seem to be a problem. Really good class for anyone interested in social justice but who wants to avoid being a \"social justice warrior\", and for understanding the nuances of how reformers\/the white middle class conceptualizes those they perceive as \"others.\""
