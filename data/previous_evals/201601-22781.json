    "The topics varied. I particularly enjoyed the sections on finding the right advisor, how to write\/ organize a research, and conflict of interest. The lecturer for animal misconduct was very engaging. I thought the part on sexual harassment\/misconduct was straightforward and not particularly useful.",
    "I mean the course is obligatory, but it wasn't terrible. You have to look at the course as an opportunity to ask all the questions you have about what's ethical and what's not without fear of criticism or retaliation.",
    "This is a general class that introduces you to a lot of different matters that will be experienced in graduate school. The class is usually just an open discussion.",
    "I think it is helpful to know about all the topics, but I would prefer the course material to be more concise.",
    "Overview of the social and work issues surrounding labs and how to navigate them."

   "comments": [
    "There were sections that were helpful for research (fraud, plagiarism, research article organization). There were sections that were not directly related to research but relevant to the work environment (conflict of interest, animal safety).",
    "I feel much more prepared for discussions with my peers and PI, especially when it comes time to publish and consider patents\/IP",
    "This course helps me to consider a lot of the issues that are crucial to my research, but I have never considered before.",
    "I feel that I now know where to find resources if I find myself in one of the situations discussed.",
    "It'd be helpful if some of the sessions were earlier in the semester (like choosing an adviser)",
    "I learned a lot about potential issues that can come up and how to best handle them."
