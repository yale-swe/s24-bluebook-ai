   "comments": [
    "Probably only if necessary for the English major. It didn't seem to be particularly thought provoking, just a set of knowledge that is useful for analyzing other more interesting works.",
    "I would recommend this course to English Majors. The expectations as far as quantity and quality of writing are concerned might exceed those of the casual poetry lover.",
    "I would recommend this Engl 125 section to another student with the understanding that they are willing to spend more time on this course than other course, and that they would consult the professor during office hours.",
    "Most will take it it for the English Major. Professor Minnis is a passionate and dynamic professor, extemely accessible, and an obviously brilliant scholar. But we spent most of our actual classes just summarizing and re-summarizing our readings. I wish Professor Minnis would challenge us and perhaps focus more on close-reading (with the longer texts especially). Chaucer is fantastic. Donne is a lot of fun. The sonnets felt like a waste of time--I did not develop any new knowledge or skills from studying them. Spenser got repetitive and, again, we talked about little besides surface plot details. Felt like high-school at times. Hopefully Professor Minnis will hold future classes to a higher standard. If not, most of your learning will be in writing the papers and seeking out his expertise one-on-one.",
    "ENGL 125 was an enjoyable look at English poetry. Professor Minnis strikes a good balance between student discussion and making his own points, and is super nice. If you're taking an English class for fun, there are probably better ones out there, but if you're a prospective English major I certainly would recommend taking it with Professor Minnis. As far as essay graders go he's neither the harshest nor the easiest, and always provides a ton of useful feedback. The final is pointless but doesn't require much studying. At times the reading can be heavy and at other times light.",
    "Yes! Take it even if you are not planning to be an English major. Writing these papers will teach you crucial skills in close reading and analytical thinking. But bear in mind that Prof. Minnis' sections might at times feel repetitive and too summary-oriented, although he is a great professor to interact with.",
    "If you're just taking an English class for fun, there are probably better ones out there--English poetry can only be so interesting (although Donne and Shakespeare are amazing, and will blow your mind). If you're a prospective English major, I certainly recommend taking it with Professor Minnis. Workload is average and you won't have to study much for the final exam. He's great at giving feedback on essays and is neither the hardest nor easiest grader I've ever had. Overall solid class.",
    "I'd recommend this course to students who are interested in any of the poets whose material we read. The Middle English can also be a fun challenge to those who are up to it. Although I might not have taken this course if it weren't a prerequisite for the English major, I'm very happy I did so that I had exposure to these texts and authors, some of whom I would love to revisit later on in my academic career.",
    "Read \"The Flea,\" or \"The Ecstasy.\" Then take the class!",
    "Take this if you're an English major, but avoid Minnis if you can -- he is well-meaning but his seminar is dull."
