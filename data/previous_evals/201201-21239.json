    "Although it's required, this course is anything but a drag. It's amazing to get to know your fellow Cog Sci seniors and their cool projects. Plus, it is a supportive environment in which you can pose questions that you are having with your research or writing. Definitely one of the best aspects of the major.",
    "i mean you have to take it.. but it's worth it. The 2hours is a bit long though. my biggest suggestion to Josh or whoever else leads it next year is to make it shorter. also, don't allow people to bring laptops. It is extremely annoying to see a few members of the class just sitting doing other work and paying no attention during a peer's presentation!",
    "CGSC 491 is like a magical pink rabbit floating through a cloud of pepper jack cheese in a land of tiddlywinks.Considering that if you're reading this, you have to take this class, this review won't help or harm you.",
    "This is a required course, but it should be required because it is a great format for inspiration for senior projects and knowing what questions to ask and how to go about solving them.",
    "If you're majoring in cognitive science, then you're required to take this course -- so it doesn't need much recommending. But it is a fun, relaxed course.",
    "Yes, it's wonderful and one of the best things about being a cogsci major. It's really interesting to see what everyone else is doing, and a lot of good ideas come out of the discussion.",
    "Hear from professors the first half, select an advisor, and pull together a thesis. That's the whole year. The class itself has minimal requirements other than the thesis, which will devour the second half of your senior year. The best piece of advice is to find an advisor early. The summer before your senior year, look through everyone affiliated with cogsci, make a list of your top 5, and meet with them all by November. Shop around and select an advisor before winter break. Your life will be easier.",
    "It's a requirement. Show up, pay attention, and you will have the opportunity to learn from your peers in a unique and inspiring way.If you don't pay attention its rude to them and is boring."
