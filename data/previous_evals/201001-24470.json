    "One of the best ways I can think of to be introduced to Art History--in an art gallery! Great books, great discussions while standing in front of the painting (no comparison here). The workload is perfectly reasonable and Professor Carlisle is both knowledgeable and approachable. Her enthusiasm is infectious! Take it.",
    "No, but I would recommend reading all the books and meeting with Prof. Carlise to discuss them.",
    "Take this class, or another, with Professor Carlisle. More than perceptive, intelligent, and prepared, she is also an incredibly diligent and kind teacher. The material was fascinating and well selected. One of Yale's best.",
    "The class looks at different Charles Dickens novels and paintings from contemporary painters. It compares art from the period with the literature to see how they trouble each other. I'd definitely recommend the class to people who love Dickens, Victorian literature, and Victorian painting.",
    "Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor, great chance to do research in the BAC. There is a lot of time devoted to random Victorian cultural phenomena though, so if you will find that frustrating or are looking for a literature focused class, this course may not be for you."
