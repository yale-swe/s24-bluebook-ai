   "comments": [
    "The immersion style of the course is helpful, and feedback is constant. There is every resource available for individual help if needed.",
    "Strengths include absolute submersion into the language and activities designed to aid in learning the language. No weaknesses noticed thus far.",
    "This course was taught perfectly. I wish the Caprese videos had subtitles.",
    "Strengths: - If one puts in the time, they will see results. I notice French all around me, and I am beginning to be able to understand without translating much. Weaknesses: - Some students come into the class with greater fluency and skill, and it is very apparent. Some students did not seem to fit within the level. - The tests had glitches sometimes, and could cause great stress when malfunctioning. Computerized testing should be stressed before the first exam, to allow students to prepare. There should also be some workbook assignments that are online to prepare students for the oral portion.",
    "This course was challenging because of all of the homework and time that had to be put into it to understand the material. It was extremely hard trying to do two workbook chapters in a single week and almost impossible to have a test every week. It takes time to really understand everything and the pace was very quick. I think it is unfair how students with no previous background in French are in the same course as students that have taken the language for 3 years in high school. The first half of the course was a \"really easy review\" for students with experience, but was challenging to those who have never studied French which made the course intimidating. I wish French 110 was a course, or that there were sections, reserved only for true beginners of the language."

   "comments": [
    "Anyone looking for another language would do well to take French 110. The teaching resources like the videos are a little outdated, but that is part of its charm.",
    "The course is very effective as long as effort is present.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. It is very rewarding and I feel like I have a good French vocabulary to maintain basic conversation with native speakers.",
    "Yes, it was effective and enjoyable.",
    "For anyone looking to actually learn a brand new language at Yale, I would absolutely recommend French. But for someone just looking to fill the language requirement, maybe not.",
    "Yes, if they are willing to put in a lot of effort and time to understand the material. I came into the course with some experience in French, yet I was still investing approximately two hours a day on the material.",
    "If you have the time to spend on it and are eager to learn French then definitely take this course because you will really learn the language. Do not take this class if you want an easy language because it is a lot of work!"
