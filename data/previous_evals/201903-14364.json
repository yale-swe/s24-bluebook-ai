    "Learned a lot about mass media law and regulation, and also more abstractly the significance of the manner in which we consume media -- and how thats changed with the internet.",
    "This was a solid course that definitely engages with extremely relevant questions around media\/trust\/politics. You learn quite a bit about mass media as well as its ramifications -- and my thinking on these issues expanded tremendously through this course.",
    "A fantastic seminar. I thought I had a fair background in media\/politics but Prof Libgober did an excellent job of providing scholarship\/insight that challenged popular belief. This class helped me think more critically about the role of media in American politics."

    "I think this is a good course that could be a little more exciting!",
    "Strengths: The readings - Not too many, and all were useful. The structure - very flexible, let us invest time in final paper of our choosing. Prof Libgober really centered us undergrads developing our own ideas during discussion. Weakness: I wish Prof Libgober lectured more, he clearly knows a ton about the subject I wanted to hear more of his opinion\/expertise, maybe at the end of the seminar as a summary of the scholarship\/discussion and his take."

    "Brian is a fantastic professor! I do wish he sometimes would spend 15-20 min to lecture because he definitely frames discussions well. Only reservation about this class is to take care that you are taking it with people who will also be engaged. Otherwise discussions get awkwardly quiet and one sided.",
    "This was a really good course. Professor Libgober is an engaging professor and the course content was incredibly interesting. The readings were selected thoughtfullyeach contained good information without merely becoming busy work.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. Not sure if Prof Libgober is teaching again but highly recommend."
