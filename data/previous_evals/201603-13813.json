   "comments": [
    "I learned how to work on a project with a big group of students and how to create an achievable research project out of a very broad client request.",
    "At first I was worried about the project, but I came to realize I would learn a great deal in one of the most applicable courses I've taken at Yale. Very valuable class learned about team work, got to travel and have fun, and how to research very difficult broad questions that do not have a clear answer. I of course learned more than I ever expected about the Chinese diaspora but these core skills were an even more important takeaway, especially since I'll be consulting after graduation.",
    "-Experience working with a team on a long term project where we set our own objectives -Experience presenting to a client -Developed familiarity with research methodology\/statistical analysis -How to cope with limited data",
    "The GLBL capstone is essentially a consulting project for an outside organization, so it's a great way to learn real skills and get a feel for doing actual research work with deliverables and deadlines. I learned a lot about my own topic (from a place of knowing nothing at all) and also a lot about working in a large group for an entire semester on a single project.",
    "Research, data collection where this is very little data, ability to talk to diplomats. Patience.",
    "This class was fantastic in that we were able to explore a topic that had very little research. We learned about the economic, political, and societal aspects of the Chinese diaspora in Africa."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Ideally the groups would be smaller and the clients would have more specific requests.",
    "A little More initial structure could have been helpful, but I think the lack of it made it more challenging and rewarding.",
    "Tom Graham is the greatest strength of this course. Poor project choices and a lack of sufficient resources were the greatest weakness.",
    "Strengths: -Excellent instructors -Exciting topics that are at the cutting edge of research: felt like I made an original contribution -Ability to build community within the major Weaknesses: -Our question felt very open ended compared to the other capstones -Some groups appeared to receive preferential treatment (IE, a trip to Africa) As it was difficult to conduct our research remotely this would have been very helpful for our team as well.",
    "The GLBL capstone is great, although I'm sure it depends on your project and course instructor. Professor Graham was a GREAT help during the project, so I'm sure that colored my perspective. It was clear that he cared about the students our success. It was particularly helpful to have a (small) assignment pre-semester to get us thinking about the topic and do some research on our own before meeting with our client. I'm not sure how we would have done the project if we were all starting from scratch in September.",
    "The capstone is one of the best parts of the Global Affairs major. However, the Africa theme seemed to leave Jackson struggling to come up with projects for all of the groups. This made the project feel a bit like a wild goose chase for information and a recommendation on a topic that was extremely difficult to pin down. Further, if you are going to give us a project based in Africa, it would have been beneficial for us to be able to go to Africa to actually research firsthand what we were looking into.",
    "There should have been a more concrete question, and support from Jackson. If you try to concentrate on a subset population in Africa, there really should be the resources to go and speak with that population.",
    "Great capstone. But, when you have our case be an ethnographic study of a group of peoples across Africa, send us to Africa."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, best kind of \"thesis\" at Yale.",
    "You have to take this class to graduate. That being said, don't spend too much time trying to convince yourself that it's not as underwhelming as everyone says, because it is, but then you don't have to write a thesis in the spring, which seems nice.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, especially with Professor Graham. You will learn so much about a particular topic, about the field in which your client works, and about group research work.",
    "It so depends on your questions that probably yes but who knows.",
    "Group project with an advisor. You struggle for the first three weeks, flail for the next seven, then magically pull it all together in the last three."
