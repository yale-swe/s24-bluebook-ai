    "Overall a great course that really brings to light how visual images have shaped US history. The discussions each week were engaging. This class is a definite recommend.",
    "Yes!!! Like a history class on imperialism + cultural studies framework. Learned so much with regard to both. I used so many of the ideas I learned in this class for other history and humanities classes",
    "This is a great course and definitely one that I would recommend to a student looking for a history\/art history\/american studies course with a lot of relevant topics and important readings."
