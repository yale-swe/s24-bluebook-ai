   "comments": [
    "A neuroscience course for those not deeply invested in the biology but would hate to go into cognitive science. It is a decent effort by the psychology department to ground themselves in tried research methods (although the usefulness of such methods now is largely debatable depending on your research background). If you care for comparative biology and animal models, I would say take it. Otherwise, reconsider how much you would like to be on the Neuroscience track or switch to Neurobiology in MCDB if you want more bench science techniques.",
    "If you want to learn cool stuff about neurology and neuroscience this is your course. I definitely have a better understanding of research now and the experiments were just so much fun and interesting. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in psych and especially if you major in the neuroscience track.",
    "PSYC 270 is an awesome research methods class that helps you truly understand the brain and nervous system on a more profound level. Each unit of the class (gross anatomy, electrophysiology, and animal recordings) enhance knowledge of how the brain works to generate behavior and think about research in a more thorough way. The assignments were long at times but definitely helped to synthesize the material. Highly recommend this class.",
    "Must take",
    "It was a good class. Lectures are a bit dry, but I learned a lot",
    "PSYC 270 is AMAZING! The course is really interesting and fun and Professor Donegan works hard to make it engaging for everyone. The class is a lot of work but worth it in the end. This was my favorite class that I took at Yale by far."
