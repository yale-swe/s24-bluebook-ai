   "comments": [
    "I think that H&P needs revision and development to become a good course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in comparative historical study and\/or political theory.",
    "Taking Directed Studies has been one of the best decisions I've made since coming to college. This section, History and Politics, was awesome. Professor Lizarribar is a great section leader, and the texts covered in the course are fascinating and invite the reader to consider their world, lifestyle, and government from a number of different angles. It's also an introductory political philosophy class, so the survey style allows you to get a good foundation for future poli sci classes you might take later at Yale. Obvious weaknesses of the program include the \"insane\" amount of reading (which, by the way, I thought was manageable,even if it was time consuming,) and the fact that you only really interact with a small group of people within the freshman class for most of your classes. However, DS is absolutely worth taking. It's the first set of courses I've ever taken that has taught me how to think.",
    "DS H&P has lots of reading. Lectures very widely, with some being much better than others. It's recommended, but not always pleasant. Additionally, Dean Lizarribar is not an effective section leader. She is, however, a nice and supportive teacher and an easy grader.",
    "I'm sure H&P can be good with some professors, but it wasn't with mine, which made the material undesirable too.",
    "No. No. No. I do not recommend this. Trust me, I've heard SO many people say that DS History led them to seriously consider dropping DS. No course, especially with such a wonderful syllabus, should be so miserable.",
    "Parts of this class are great, other parts (Maimonides and Alfarabi) are less great. Being DS, it very much is what it is.",
    "History and Politics is a lot of reading, and a great deal of it is quite dry and difficult to get through. Professor Lizarribar is also the Dean of Stiles, and she often seemed overwhelmed and unable to grade essays on time. Her essay comments seem rushed and her grades rather arbitrary.",
    "H\/P first semester provides a good foundation on Greek and Roman history and basic political theory. The small class environment is challenging in a very positive way. Professor Lizarribar creates a welcome classroom dynamic and is very warm and encouraging of students. However, she is very busy as a Dean, which makes it difficult to meet and results in frustratingly long waits to have papers returned. I wished discussion in this section had been more guided.",
    "Fall H&P walks an often blurry and never really defined line between being about history and being about politics (eventually abandoning the history part entirely). If you've never been exposed to Greek or Roman history before and don't find it particularly compelling, the histories can be a little bewildering to get through--you have to be very attentive to what can be somewhat tedious reading to have a good grasp on the material. That said, the questions raised in H&P are some of the most interesting and universal political problems you'll encounter, and you'll be exposed to a number of different lenses through which to view and to answer those questions. I found it ultimately rewarding, though not the most exciting thing in the world.",
    "There are better professors, there are worse. Not the professor for you if you prefer guidance, but she is good if you want to freely discuss. Doesn't kill you on the grading, and gives adequate feedback. Kind and caring - if you have her, don't be afraid to approach her out of class with any concerns.",
    "I would recommend this course as good if they are interested in political philosophy or history.",
    "The readings are god, but they aren't related to each other in super obvious ways, and many of them are in very different styles. This would be fine if professors made an explicit effort to explain their relationships (in a way that isn't really necessary in the other two DS sections) but a lot of the time they don't. The lectures were also a little confusing. While many of them were great they engaged with the text in very different ways: some as literature, some as philosophy, some as straight history, and some as what I guess could be called historiography, and therefore didn't provide us with a good example of the kinds of arguments and readings we should put forth in our papers, in the way that lit and phil lectures did. Finally, I found the papers themselves didn't make all that much sense. Even after having turned in three, I'm not totally sure what they should look like, and I had no clue at all when I wrote the first paper. Because there isn't a disciplinary model per se, I think profs need to be especially careful to make clear their expectations.Dean L is really really friendly and supportive, but a lot of the time it felt like she hadn't prepared very extensively for class and so we would, either from confusion about the way we were supposed to be talking about a text or because she was holding back from the conversation, just run out of things to say and start digressing or arguing about the same wedge topics (women) in ways that weren't really productive and didn't force us to engage with the text. It also felt a little (at times) like she herself didn't have a clear understanding of the way the course should work (i.e. is it history or philosophy or historiography etc.) and that only made the confusion which seems sort of inherent in the hist and pol curriculum even worse. So again really nice and probably a good professor in an area where she has more expertise (and more time to prepare), but didn't really do a good job with this class.I don't think the fact that hist and pol is \"ok\" should be enough to put you off DS (it really is *ok*), but it is definitely not its strongest attraction either."
