    "I improved my comfort level with complex formal theory and the associated math. Exposure to the models we worked with was valuable. Many of the mathematical concepts applied in this course are necessarily siloed into different introductory courses. For example, probability distributions are usually kept separate from calculus and geometry. By drawing on concepts from many different buckets, this course helped me start thinking about math in a more unified manner, which is starting to pay dividends outside the world of formal theory."

   "comments": [
    "The course is rigorous, but Prof. Roemer endeavors to make the material accessible and is always available to help. Great for comprehension of formal theory and math in general. It is too bad some of the problem sets had errors, but the reasons were understandable, & the experience of doing the problems is how you learn. Better to err on that side than to make things too easy."
