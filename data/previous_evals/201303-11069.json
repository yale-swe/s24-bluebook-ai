    "I would absolutely recommend it because she approaches the material differently and wants people to develop their spanish and have an understanding of why they are teaching things instead of just memorizing them.",
    "I took this class coming out of high school Spanish, and although my writing and reading skills have improved, the most drastic improvement has been in my listening and speaking abilities. The class is conducted completely in Spanish which I found intimidating at first, but it was so exciting to realize I could understand everything, and although I had very low speaking confidence when the class began, I'm a lot more comfortable now just speaking off the top of my head. Take 130--Barbara is a little crazy, but she'll really challenge you and she's a good teacher.",
    "L3 Spanish with Barbara is a great way to get a language requirement out of the way. Simple as that.",
    "Consistent effort is required, but if you have to\/want to take it-- take it with Professor Safille! She is animated and brings life to the class.",
    "I think this class is better\/easier than L2 Spanish.",
    "Yes because it's a review of Spanish 1 and 2 combined",
    "Daily homework, lots of conversations. I would recommend it for getting a language requirement",
    "I am happy I took the class, but I'm also happy I am done with my spanish requirement. It is very time-consuming (every day for 50 minutes) and became kind of redundant. But, at the same time, my Spanish definitely improved and I am glad I have a strong foundation in the language."
