   "comments": [
    "Lighter (content-wise) than most of the other L5 German classes you'll find, but work-wise it will probably be about the same.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Good class, covers a wide expanse of topics. If you are looking for a class that surveys a number of years of German history, that is conducted in high level German, then this is it.",
    "German 160 is a great way to maintain and improve your German. The topics are relevant and interesting. Frau Gehlker is helpful and enthusiastic. The essays take a lot of time and effort, but there are only six. I would recommend this class!",
    "Don't take this class, there are so many other better classes out there. Sure you only have to buy two books for the class but you better be ready to fill in that gap with a lot of conversation.",
    "Good all-around course in German if you want to keep up your skills after taking an L5. You'll get exposure to a lot of different media forms of German.",
    "The course is on the border between a language course and a German literature course. I would recommend this course because it pushes students to speak more fluently and express complicated, abstract ideas in German."
