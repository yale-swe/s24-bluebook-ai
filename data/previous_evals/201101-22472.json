   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student - I think that we all to frequently think about \"Africa\" in the present without understanding the historical context on which many countries are based, and this really gave a great perspective into that. I especially liked the comparison between the two Congos, so it was a great overview of the subject matter.",
    "Just take it. Especially if you're interested in the region but haven't read much literature from there... Or if you're interested in Africa in general. This is one of the few African Studies courses that does ANY kind of literature, sooo take it.",
    "Yes, do it. Not much work aside from reading, and I challenge a reader to get 30-40 pages into these books and not want to read more. The French language can be daunting but the stories are exciting and you'll be sorry if you don't read 'em. Plus the English-language stuff is tremendous. Hothschild, Conrad, Naipaul--5-star stuff here.",
    "It's a great class! Take it--you'll learn a ton about the Congo and its culture!",
    "If you are interested in delving deeply into a country mostly through literature, both external and internal, but also films and music, definitely take this class. While some of the readings might have been above my French level (or my willingness to spend 5 hours reading a French book), many of the readings were really wonderful. Take it.",
    "Amazing course, enlightening and transformative but beware Professor Miller is such a hard grader. Great class overall, interesting readings, films and amazing discussions.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. The history of Africa and the Congo is so relevant to today (and still so recent), and I think it is important for western students to be exposed to other world traditions that don't otherwise fit as neatly into the academic canon."
