   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. I think it's useful without taxing the student too much, which is exactly how graduate level classes should be.",
    "It is a great, low stress introduction to histology as applied to various fields. I don't feel intimidated by tissue slides\/images in papers or talks anymore, and I would recommend students take the course if they are not very familiar with histology.",
    "Awesomeness!This class brings together how systems work together to give rise to a functioning organism. Also covered are the causes of whathappens when things go wrong. And you get to learn how to interpret histology, which is a very useful tool.",
    "Great course that surveys the primary organs and systems of the body. It's a good opportunity to learn about basic human anatomy and histology especially if you haven't had much experience. The course will also help you understand histology figures and techniques when reading the literature.",
    "I will definitely recommand it to those who have not taken physiology. But for those who have taken physiology, this class can he helpful as well!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course -- high amount of usefulness with stimulating lectures that involves relatively low input of homework.",
    "Yes, it's a very interesting class that you can learn many different things.",
    "This class was a good overview of the different physiological systems of the body. Lots of emphasis on histology. Could have more emphasis on research. Grading of homework was inconsistent, but overall the workload for the class was very realistic. Could even add the reading and short discussion of a paper related to a particular system once a week or every other week.",
    "I would recommend CBIO 604 to anyone with not a very strong background in cell biology but that is interested in the behavior of different types of cells in their respective environments."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It gave me insight to certain areas which I was not familiar with before.",
    "I now can understand most histological figures in papers and, since I expect to work with animal models during my Ph.D., I believe that this course will contribute to my research.",
    "The lab I am joining deals with a lot of histological methods. I feel more prepared for my dissertation now that I understand what cells look like at the histological level in slides and under different stainings. A very useful course to understand how the body functions as a whole and what the systems of tissues are doing to make it function. Awesome!",
    "I felt that this course prepared me well for my future research as I have chosen a field that is physiological in nature. Since I did not have much background studying many of the systems that we discussed in the class, it was very helpful to be introduced to these systems in a classroom setting.",
    "My main focus of my research is on the vascular system and, albeit only two lectures were dedicated to it, I feel like I learned a lot even from lectures that seemed to be totally unrelated."
