    "I learned to analyze the different dimensions of presidential press coverage.",
    "Lots of knowledge about the inner workings of press and political interactions",
    "The class gives a good overview of what modern political journalism is about. It mostly focuses on the last two presidential administrations and their press practices.",
    "I developed critical insight about the White House beat, reporting on the President and how the relationship between the press & the presidency has evolved and changed over time.",
    "Learned about the history, evolution and current state of the relationship that exists between the Press and the Presidency.",
    "SO much! How it is to be in the press, how the presidency changed",
    "The course gave me a deeper understanding of the techniques employed by political journalists and the ethics of political journalism, particularly as it relates to the presidency. It taught me how to consume news like a journalist and to look for how different political stories influenced media \"narratives\". It provided deeper insights into what we should learn about presidential news coverage in the wake of the 2016 election."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: fun and interesting. relevant topic. guest speakers that provide insight on their careers as journalists or politicians. Weaknesses: can at times feel structure-less (though this did create for a warm, open-discussion type of environment)",
    "It was very easy to understand and discuss the different arguments of the press' intentions in coverage. It was weak in that it was not very informative or very open-minded to views other than liberal political opinions.",
    "strengths: FIELDTRIP! weaknesses: not much, organization\/note taking?",
    "There isn't a lot of reading material in this class. It would be great to have more of those so that class discussion could be more grounded.",
    "This course was by far the best and most interesting I've taken at Yale. I loved how Prof. Sinderbrand had a relaxed and fluid teaching style, often offering several anecdotes from her personal experience as the NBC Senior Washington Editor (and her experience at many other publications as well). The content was very applicable to the current political climate and she gave us some of the most interesting readings I've had at Yale. The guests she brought into the class were insane, honestly. Never have I been in a class with such famous and important people. She also took us to the New York Times and NBC News\/MSNBC Studios in NYC and it was the coolest thing ever. Prof. Sinderbrand is just really great and it's a shame that not every single person at Yale wasn't able to experience the course! No suggestions for improvement; this class was the highlight of my semester.",
    "strengths - fantastic field trip, great accessibility to high-profile journalists, very accessible professor, love the round-table discussion style weaknesses - really very few. perhaps greater proficiency in canvas would be an improvement."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, class offers you the chance to experience journalism through guest speakers and a field trip; the professor is super smart and experienced and has a ton of wisdom to share; the reading is not at all dense, considering we read the works of journalists and follow the news rather than read theoretical, scholarly work about the topic; great for journalists who want to enter the field (the professor makes it very clear that she will help you if you're interested in a career in journalism).",
    "It is an easy gut course to learn something new. Don't credit\/d it because it is very easygoing as a class.",
    "yes",
    "Yes! Every single student (and person) should take this course. It is essential to understand the politics of the country right now. 100% would recommend.",
    "Yes, engaging, great guest speakers and extremely relevant in this day and age.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The Press and the Presidency was an extremely interesting class. The material was very timely and important to learn in terms of current events. The guest speakers were all really great and",
    "Absolutely, the level of access to high-level journalists and politicians, conversational rather than lecture teaching style, field trip, and professor all lead me to recommend this class very highly",
    "Yes. It provides invaluable insight into the current political media landscape."
