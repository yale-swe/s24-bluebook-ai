   "comments": [
    "It is a class that covers many topics in science in module forms that is on the whole accessible. There is a personal atmosphere that encourages questions if a student is lost. I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "I would recommend it to students who are looking for a broad understanding of differnet topics in science, without too great a time commitment.",
    "This course gives short units on different scientific fields, which means that what you are doing varies greatly. Undoubtedly this means there will be some three week periods you find much more interesting than others. I don't think I would recommend this course. I enjoy it, but other freshman seminars seem much more interesting in retrospect.",
    "I would recommend Science 030 to any student interested in science in general, or to those who want to know what work is currently being conducted around the world. The course explores a variety of topics, each presented in a novel way by an expert in the field.",
    "This is a fun class! You spend three weeks at a time learning about different areas of science like global warming, evolution, and the expansion of the universe. The professors were all good and some of them threw in info about their own research which was cool. There's a quiz, a problem set, and maybe another random assignment each unit, variable in difficulty but never too hard. The hour-and-a-half on Friday afternoons can sometimes drag on, but it's only once a week and there's free coffee and baked goods. Take this class, it's easy, informative, and no final!",
    "Current topics in science is an introductory science class, traditionally for non-science majors. What it lacks in depth, it makes up in range: you will cover topics from cloning to climate change to global warming. But it is hard to get fully immersed in a subject with only three weeks. A great class, I would recommend it."
