   "comments": [
    "Absolutely the best course of my freshman year. Second semester is the gem of DS, and Professor Sussman is the gem of DS Lit professors. The reading list can't be beat by any other course at Yale, and Professor Sussman supplements it with tidbits from Foucault, Kant, Hegel, Bergson, etc. He's completely brilliant, quirky, and still open and encouraging with students. I think everyone in Professor Sussman's class left feeling smarter and better about themselves. Take it.",
    "Recommended. A lot of reading though.",
    "The workload is definitely challenging and pushes you to your limits; we read a LOT this semester (Don Quixote and War and Peace in two weeks each, though we had the school breaks before we started sections on them to get ahead in the reading). That said, I think the effort pays off: I was exposed to so many masterpieces of literature, and my writing progressed significantly.",
    "\"Western canon\", etc. etc. You know what this class is. Definitely take it.",
    "DS Lit Spring is a great course. It doesn't feel as cohesive as the Fall course, just because there's more literature to cover. All the books are wonderful, and even though the amount of reading is often insane, it's worth it.",
    "Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Lots of reading, but good books.",
    "DS Lit is an amazing overview of many of the highlights of the western canon, from Petrarch to Virginia Woolf. While hundreds of pages could be assigned for each class (and be prepared to read Don Quixote over winter break, and War and Peace over spring break) and seems at times reasonable, Lit readings are ones you want to actually read, if you only have time to read one. The reading list is phenomenal, and it's really incredible to be given the time and class environment to discuss the works we read. It was my favorite reading list of all year, I think even better than first semester lit, and quite possibly makes sticking with DS for second semester worth it."
