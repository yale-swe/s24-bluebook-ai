    "Introduction to Graphic Design was good: it was fun to make things, and to think about the way in which we approach design. That said, I often found the course boring. For one, the entire two hour class was devoted to critiquing the work of others - and not to studio time. Additionally, I am not sure what technical artistic skills, if any, I honed this semester. I also found some of the assignments to be fairly bland. I did, though, really enjoy making posters for other classmates and producing a book.",
    "Great intro course. It's a lot of paper cutting and pasting for the first half of the course, so just be aware of that if you're just trying to learn how to use InDesign. The course tries to teach you how to think visually and does a great job doing so.",
    "Great class. Loved how we didn't just start with the computer, like `here's how to use illustrator\/indesign, make a poster.' Because then the focus for us was way more how to think critically and evaluate each & every design choice we felt compelled to make. Man, I was thinking so much more, making way better stuff as a result. All credit due to Yeju. She taught me about this, how to think like this, then really pushed me & held me to it.",
    "Take this class if you're happy working in any medium or if you want to try out working with your hands. Don't take this class if you're trying to learn the Adobe Suite tools, but do take this class if you want to learn basic graphic design that will help you through your eventual learning of the Adobe Suite. Yeju's goal is to teach you graphic design-- a way of thinking, not a skill. You will get more out of this class if you approach it like this. You get out of this class what you want to put in. Yeju has high expectations. I put a lot of effort in and was happy to see the results. Expect a lot from yourself and make some room in your schedule for it--a great second semester senior class, but at the same time I wish I took it earlier so I could take more graphic design classes in the future.",
    "The class can feel slow at times, and takes up a lot of time (4 hours in class per week, at least). But, you do end up learning a lot!",
    "I was a STEM major taking this course to try something different and learn more about the fundamentals of design. This course exceeded my expectations and I got a ton out of it. Yeju was as great professor. I took it Cr\/D and it was not nearly as much as work as the course reviews suggested.",
    "You will learn the basics of graphic design-- don't expect to produce something insanely complicated by the end, but it is a pleasure to watch your fellow students (and yourself!) develop across the semester. You will end the year with a nice book of photos you should be proud of, and if all goes well you can take Intermediate the next semester!"
