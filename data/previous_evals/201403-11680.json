   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wished to look beyond the academy, particularly those with interests in policy and government. This course has been both an excellent introduction to Grand Strategy and policy formulation, but also real world focused, or with an eye toward common sense. Grand Strategy, therefore, is one of those exceptionally rare university courses with direct application and utility in life, particularly political life or government service.",
    "It does not live up to the hype. The material is fascinating, the course itself is awful.",
    "Demanding. Forces you to wrap your mind around big problems and apply the appropriate resources to solving them. The Marshall Briefs are the most demanding intellectual exercise I have ever experienced."

   "comments": [
    "The course allowed me to explore a topic that I am very passionate about with the summer odyssey portion of the course. I was able to to go abroad and research about a topic that allowed me to gain deeper insights into how my interests fit into a larger strategy. Overall, incredible class and one I will remember for the rest of my life.",
    "The course really opened my eyes to a range of issues regarding grand stategy. The course did a great job to identify the implications--near-term and long-term--of US foreign policy."
