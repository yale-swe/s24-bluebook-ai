   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. The workload is really manageable and the final paper ends up being really rewarding, as you work closely with professor to develop a unique research question.",
    "Great course. Interesting topics. Come to class prepared. A couple of the students were annoying (felt they had to comment on every single topic) but that's a problem every seminar has. Chevalier is a great professor.Lots of reading",
    "Awesome class whether or not you have a great interest in technology\/the web\/etc. No chance you'll get in if you're not an Econ major, but if you are, I can't imagine a better seminar to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this! The instructor is very engaging and the topic covers a wide range of information areas and is very interesting.",
    "Great seminar on topics most people would find interesting given the ubiquity of information technology in their lives.",
    "I'd recommend it if you are at all interested about the world of technology and information delivery. You'll learn alot about the economic concepts behind the policies dictating the future of the information superhighway.",
    "A solid seminar that allows you to explore some interesting topics that you might not normally encounter in econ classes.",
    "A fantastic and well-taught course for those interested in economics as it pertains to information; telecommunications, the internet, etc. It's a low-key class that does not have a significant work load, but you will get more out of it if you do all of the reading."
