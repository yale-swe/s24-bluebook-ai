   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, although I would say that one should not take this class if they are not interested in writing proofs. It really is a math class for people who like math, but that is not at all to say that it is particularly difficult. The rigor is good and the material is really interesting.",
    "Take this class! It's not overwhelmingly difficult and the workload is so much more manageable than some other math classes. It's perfect in terms of consolidating linear algebra concepts and getting an introduction to group theory and abstract algebra, and Coxeter groups are really cool in general.",
    "Really interesting subject mater -- if you liked linear algebra, you'll probably really enjoy this class. Professor Lachowska is great, and it's a good intro to some group theory concepts, as well as some applications of linear algebra."
