   "comments": [
    "Most students taking this class have just returned from a summer abroad (usually with the Light) in Japan. So be prepared for a big change--no matter how good the instruction at Yale is, it can't compare to actually being in the country. That said, the workload is lighter (thank God!) especially since it's not everyday anymore. You have to work a little bit more on your own if you want to maintain your level of Japanese. But if you love Japanese, you'll love conquering the little things in this class!",
    "There are fewer conversational practices in L5, which is a major drawback for me, but overall the class is interesting and manageable.",
    "A very supportive, tight-knit classroom environment.Very manageable workload:3 Classes per week:Nearly daily Kanji quizzesReadings and grammar worksheetsApprox. 2 tests (not so different from HW) and final",
    "you get as much out of the class as you put into it. It's easy to only study the readings lightly and not really know what's going on in class but then there's really no point in taking the class.",
    "It is a good continuation of previous levels.",
    "All in all, a great class - really interesting readings, some fun discussions, and two of the best teachers ever! Maybe a little bit of a struggle sometimes to effectively communicate our ideas(I think most of us this class were at a middle ground where we were beyond basic survival conversation but weren't fluent enough to talk about advanced concepts), but all in all good practice for building to the point of fluency.",
    "Overall, Japanese 150 is a great course that I would recommend taking if you can. You definitely will improve in listening and reading ability, although you may need to put in more effort to improve your speaking ability, such as through the kaiwa conversations with the TF, or the language tables.",
    "Japanese 150 is just a continuation of past Japanese work. It is based out of a packet of readings rather than a book. There are discussions of these readings, their content, and vocab, grammar, and expressions that appear in them. There are more or less daily vocab and kanji quizzes, but the work is generally quite manageable, certainly far less than L1\/L2. I didn't take L3\/L4 at Yale so can't compare to that.",
    "Take this class if you want to sort of improve your Japanese. I think of this class more as a way to not forget my Japanese.",
    "Like all Japanese at Yale, this is a great class. The teachers are awesome, the movies\/TV shows are fun, and you get to keep doing skits. This one is a little more work than in past years--or at least, you'll need to put in more work to get as much out.",
    "I would definitely recommend Japanese 150 to any student who has enjoyed studying the language at Yale. This class is similar to lower levels, but allows for a lot more freedom since you are working with actual Japanese texts rather than a text book. This class is challenging, but I feel like my Japanese has improved so much over the past few months, to the extent that I now feel comfortable reading Japanese with the help of a dictionary."
