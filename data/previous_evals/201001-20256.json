   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course because it demonstrates the best of interdisciplinary study, it exposes contemporary social challenges -- especially those that are silenced in dominant discourse, and it inspires (re)constructive ways that scholarship can engage these challenges.",
    "I would absolutely give this course my highest recommendation to another student.",
    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. As the first course that I took outside of my department since beginning graduate school at Yale, I found myself challenged and inspired to explore perspectives and connections that I had not encountered before. I am not sure how exactly to summarize the course, as it took us on a journey through fiction, anthropology, history, social history, and political engagement with multiple areas of the globe during which we encountered inspiring, enlightening, frustrating, infuriating, and always unexpected ideas and analyses by a group of remarkable writers and speakers. I suppose that is how I would summarize the course.",
    "A combination of literature and theory spanning the globe."

   "comments": [
    "Before taking this course, I intended to restrict my study to African American creativity as I thought that was the only manageable way to approach what I want to do. I now realize not only what would be lost and obfuscated by doing that, but also how necessary however challenging a transnational approach is.",
    "This course contributed significantly to my research insofar as it introduced me to an alternative set of theorists and inspired new connections between my subjects of interest, transnational circumstances, conceptualizations of archives, and imaginations of positive change.",
    "This course radically improved my ability to productively and provocatively contribute to my field in future scholarship. Although this course was not in my department, I often found myself using ideas, theorizations, and terminology from this course in class discussions and papers for courses in my department. In fact, this course may have significantly contributed to a shift in my potential dissertation research due to the way that it inspired me to harness my political and ethical convictions through my academic work."
