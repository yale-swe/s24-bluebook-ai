    "Developed insight into the nature of civil conflict and its economic effects.",
    "Reading all those papers *really* helped me to generate research ideas and think critically about identification in empirical work! I learned so much about what development economists do.",
    "The syllabus was created with intention and care, and I learned a lot about the mechanics of designing papers and thinking through the theoretical frameworks of economic research papers.",
    "I learned an immense amount about the various determinants and effects of intrastate conflict in the developing world. I learned how critically analyze empirical papers and draw out their conclusions while also realizing their limitations. I also learned how incredibly frustrating and tedious it can be to write your own research paper.",
    "I learnt a lot about the various aspects of civil conflict, and also about econometric methods and how to read papers in the economic literature. I learnt how to carry out an empirical project and to work with STATA."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is essentially reading papers and talking about them, which I don't like as a teaching model.",
    "Strength: a great selection of papers, appropriate for a senior undergraduate audience. Professor Ibanez knew the field extremely well. Weakness: the reading responses took a lot of time and weren't even graded - I think it would have been worthwhile to include them in the class participation grade.",
    "I honestly think the course was pretty much perfect the way it was.",
    "This course was great. I think the best part was the class discussions, so I would have loved to spend more time on that.",
    "Not sure how this will be relevant since Professor Ibanez is a visiting professor and this course will never be offered again, but: papers are all very interesting and the professor knows a ton in the field; a very good exposure to conflict literature and to econometrics in general. Empirical project and the empirical work could have been a bit more guided\/structured, especially since most students don't have that strong a background in econometrics coming in (alternatively the department really needs to work on their core classes)."

   "comments": [
    "I'd only recommend this course if you're passionate about the subject matter. I wasn't, and didn't enjoy it much at all.",
    "If this course is structured similarly to when I took it, then you should take it! Conflict is a subset of the development literature, and you spend the course reading and discussing a ton of papers. You also write your own empirical paper, which is hard but definitely a rewarding exercise.",
    "This was my favorite econ class so far at Yale.",
    "Definitely! If you are interested in the different determinants and effects of intrastate conflict I would highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Again, not sure how this will be relevant since Professor Ibanez is a visiting professor and this course will never be offered in future, but - yes; the papers you read are really interesting and you learn a lot throughout the semester. It's well-structured and you actually get to learn from reading each paper, and it's a good introduction to the literature. Also this class is pretty econometrics-heavy, so you get to actually apply what you've learnt in 131\/132.",
    "Definitely! Professor Ibanez is absolutely great! You'll learn so much on how to read economic papers - you'll also really really learn how to conduct economic research and empirical analysis which is great prep for writing a thesis"
