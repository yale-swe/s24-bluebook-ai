   "comments": [
    "Chem 119 is a good course to let you get to know the basics of experiments. I would recommend it, especially before taking a more challenging lab, just so you know your way around the lab.",
    "Chem 119L is hardly an elective class, so it's difficult to say if I would recommend it to someone. However, I would tell new students that it will be rewarding. There is a moderate but manageable time commitment, and the lab hours can be downright fun and friendly.",
    "Chem 119 is a good class to learn lab techniques. Make sure you prepare before the labs. The quizzes are often detailed and they count for 40% of your grade. You can't just blow them off. Start the lab reports well in advance of the due date. I often found myself up late the night before the reports were due with no idea how to do the calculations. But if you prep before the lab, you can ask Dr. Parr how to do the calcs during pre-lab lecture. Dr. Parr is hilarious but will be very scary if you are messing around in the lab. Also, don't be afraid of the four hour lab time. It was rarely necessary to stay past four.",
    "Usually you take it out of necessity so there isn't much to recommend. However, I think it does provide a good introduction to the laboratory setting.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you have to take it for requirements. If you're just trying to explore chemistry just take the class.",
    "I don't think I would recommend taking it for fun, but it's a good lab credit and a helpful complement to 118 (I actually got more practice doing acid-base and quantum calculations from lab than lecture)",
    "Yes, it's a fairly straightforward lab.",
    "If you're taking Chem 118 and need to take a lab for any reason, you should definitely take Chem 119L. It's relatively easy: pre-lab quizzes every week count for 40%, lab reports count for 60%. Grades are not curved (>95%=A, 90-94=A-, etc.) so kids aren't super-competitive. Pre-lab quizzes are easy and graded nicely, as are lab reports (it's tough to get less than a 90). For about 8\/11 labs, the writeup consisted only of results and calculations, which was nice. The lab manual walks you completely through the lab writeups. There's never anything unexpected, and you don't even need to think to know what you need to write up, really. This is a great class to get a good grade in.Dr. Parr is a bit eccentric. He's a good teacher I guess; pre-lab lectures sometimes cleared up confusing points in the lab manual. Normally he is extremely nice. He'll come around, ask how we're doing with the lab, check out what we're doing. On several occasions, he'd just come up and help me with the lab. However, when people asked stupid questions, he'd give very sarcastic (funny to everyone else I guess) responses, treating the person like an idiot. If you have a question you think is stupid, ask a TA first instead. If they don't know, then you can feel safe to ask Dr. Parr.Lab reports can take a while (perhaps 4 hours\/week on average), but it's just busy work of messing with the equation editor to type up equations and making graphs. It's not painful work.",
    "CHEM 119L is a wonderful introduction to the lab sciences. The course load is heavy some weeks, but the work is always rewarding. I actually found this class more informative than 118 lecture. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially one with little previous lab experience as they do a wonderful job of introducing you to lab equipment and procedure.",
    "Chem 119 is a good intro lab course that is comprehensive and teaches are variety of lab practice and techniques. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I'd recommend this course. As someone who hates labs, I found it to be reasonable. It's not an obscene amount of work as many labs can be, so it doesn't turn you off immediately. Dr. Parr is good at explaining concepts, although he is a particular personality so be aware. The format of the course is well-set up, not requiring full writeups every week.",
    "The labs are tedious and long. The reports take a long time. I would recommend this for people who desire to be science major but not for those who are taking chemistry to fulfill a general requirement.",
    "Yeah, well, it's a decent lab, alot of work, but a fun class.",
    "Chem 119 is a solid lab course. You only meet once a week for four hours, and then you have a lab report. We only had to do three full lab reports, which was great. It's frustrating that the class is only 1\/2 a credit, but there's nothing that can be done. I found that lab corresponded well with the material we were learning in 118. Professor Parr has a sense of humor and is good to work with in the lab. However, you will interact the most with your TA. Though the lab reports can take a while to do, they were graded easily. The lab quizzes are weighted more even though they only take up 10 minutes. Study for these!",
    "A lot of work, but if you're premed, you have to do it.",
    "YES. Lots of pretty colors in experiments, and labs are really easy.",
    "Overall, this is quite a painless lab. The experiment themselves can be slightly tedious, but at least there are generally cool color changes to make you go 'ooo'. Prof. Parr explains them well and the quizzes are all very reasonable. He often shortened lab reports aswell, so the lab doesn't take over your life. If you need a chem lab, I would recommend Chem 119L.",
    "Its a lab, so don't take it if you don't have to. That being said, this lab seemed better than the labs associated with 112 and 114, so maybe take that into consideration.",
    "Take this class ONLY if it is required. The workload is definitely not proportional to the half-credit that comes with the class. Some of the questions in the quizzes were unnecessarily challenging.",
    "It's pretty straightforward; just don't slack on the lab reports or else you will stay up ALL NIGHT finishing it and it will not be pretty. WATCH YOUR SIG FIGS. AND THE QUIZZES. They will kick your butt if you slack off.",
    "TAKE IT. PERIOD.",
    "Labs are pretty straightfoward but can sometimes be time consuming. Schedule labs toward the end of the week so there is more time to complete repors. Would recommend.",
    "Take Chem 119 at the same time as 118; it will save you plenty of time and effort.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are taking Chem 118. The labs are not too complicated, and it's easy to get a good grade if you do the work.",
    "Chemistry 119 was a lot of work. Many of the labs, even when you just have to do the results and calculations rather than full lab report, took me a very long time to complete. I would recommend this lab though because I thought it was a good introduction to the lab setting and had a good group of students.",
    "Chem 119 was a good lab to take, but writing lab reports for it is awful. I have nothing but good memories from being in lab, yet nothing but terrible stories to tell about writing my reports. So keep this in mind: do you want to stay up until the wee hours of the morning the night before?",
    "Since many of the people taking Chem118 are pre-med, there is no choice but to take the lab as well. It is not spectacular and you will dread the weekly 4 hour labs, but it is manageable.",
    "Labs are always a tad bit annoying and the day you have lab is the day you wish you didn't. Just take it; bite the bullet and take it along with Chem118. The materials sometimes overlap which is nice; depending on your TA, your lab report may or may not be graded easily. Prelab quizzes are very burdensome, but it beats having a lab practical (test) at the end of the semester. You'll be fine. Lab reports are a bane, but not that bad if it's not graded too harshly (again, depends on your TA)",
    "Chemistry 119L was a helpful supplement to the course Chem 118, and though having lab for ~4 hours once a week can ruin a day, I still think it is worthy to take for practical knowledge and experience.",
    "A necessary course, Chem 199L is certainly not enjoyable, but is also not too bad of a lab course. Many students may feel that they are not getting much out of the course. I would only recommend it for those that need it for their majors or those who intend to pursue medical\/graduate school.",
    "I would recommend it only to fulfill a requirement.",
    "Yes because it's usually required and it's not that bad.",
    "Chemistry 119L was a pretty good class. I doubt it'll be a class you particularly look forward to, but it's really not too bad. Yes, the labs are long (4 hours, though not all labs take all 4 hours) and the lab write-ups can take a lot of time. If you're going to take this class, be prepared to devote some quality time to the lab write-ups. Some caveats: Be prepared for the pre-lab quizzes. They constitute 40% of your grade. The other 60% comes from the lab write-ups. Also, start your Hess's Law lab write-up early. Some students said they spent anywhere from 7 to 14 hours on this lab write-up! Just a heads-up. Dr. Parr is very patient and has a great sense of humor. Also, your lab TAs can really set the tone in lab. Friday labs tend to be pretty chill, as it's the end of the week, so chances are you--along with everyone else--don't want to be at lab until 5 on a Friday. I've heard labs on other days tend to be a bit more strained, but you do get your lab out of the way early in the week.",
    "I would recommend this course because it accompanies Chemistry 118.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to take it.",
    "I had no issues with CHEM 119 and enjoyed several of the labs that we did. Dr. Parr is a great lecturer, and his prelab lectures always strengthened my understanding of that day's lab, and he was always very understanding and helpful when I had to miss a day because of sickness or when I left my notebook in the lab, etc. The lab reports can be long--especially the ones requiring hand drawn graphs--but as labs go, I thought this was fine.",
    "Yes, but like for other lab classes here, be prepared to spend a lot of time writing the lab reports! Don't wait until the night before.",
    "Dr. Parr is fun, and the lab isn't as stressful as it could have been. Make sure you study up for prelab quizzes, and don't overwork yourself in lab. Accuracy (while a part of the grade) isn't that big a part. I was off by a factor of a thousand for my result in one experiment, and I still got a 92 on it! If you don't get caught up in the little things and just enjoy the ride, this class can actually be fun.",
    "Chemistry 119L, though annoying and sometimes a little stressful, really does help you learn certain concepts in Chem 118. The professor, is snarky but helpful. I would take it if you don't have much going on that semester, but be warned that the work is worth that of a 1.0 course than .5 course. And also, planning a time for a four hour lab is a little hard as well. Take the quizzes seriously.",
    "This is a great course for people interested in chemistry who have not had AP. If you have had a fairly good chemistry lab course before, you will tend to find this class tedious and at times boring.",
    "A necessary evil. It was good that the lab usually did not require full lab reports.",
    "If you take 118 then you should take 119 just to get a lab out of the way. But personally, I didn't really like it because it was so time-consuming and tedious.",
    "If considering a Chemistry lab course, Chemistry 119 is definitely a good course to ease into Chemistry labs at Yale. It is well-taught and very easy to follow.",
    "A chem lab.....only take it if you need to. Not full lab reports for each lab, which was VERY nice, but just make sure to study for the quizzes due for each class, and your grade will be a lot better",
    "I would recommend this course. The most difficult part is the lab quizes.",
    "I would only recommend 119 for students who need a lab class for their major or medical school. While the lab is relevant to a chemistry course, it is time consuming and altogether not worth 1\/2 credits.",
    "Chem 119 is a lot of fun, and you'll probably have to take it if you're taking Chem 118. But don't worry, it's definitely worth taking!",
    "Awesome experience all around. I must admit, I was kind of scared coming into lab because of some of the negative reviews of Dr. Parr, but he's actually a cool guy, and is always there if you have a question the TA's can't answer. Mind, if you ask an obvious question, he might crack a joke or two at you, but it's all in good fun. TA's all are brilliant and funny, and really are the ones that help you survive what can be a long and arduous 3-4 hours. The enjoyability of the labs vary week to week, but they're all really helpful for understanding core concepts from Chemistry 118, so they're certainly all useful. Might seem tough at the beginning, but gets infinitely more fun as the semester progresses if you keep at it.",
    "After Chem 119, I feel much more comfortable in a college lab setting. However, the pre-lab quizzes were, at times, unpleasant to study for, and the lab reports weren't particularly fun. The lab rarely matched up with Chem 118 lecture material. On the whole, I would recommend that someone take 119, mostly to have the experience of a college lab to go along with Chem 118.",
    "A good introduction to the basics of a lab: making accurate and precise measurements, keeping a record of data, writing lab reports. Some of the labs are quite mechanical. Be sure to read and understand all details of the experiment before you perform the experiment. I would recommend this course. It is advisable to to take this course concurrently with 118.",
    "CHEM 119L is helpful in improving your lab technique,and the labs can be interesting. However, it does take a lot of work despite it being only worth 0.5 credit. Not only are there quizzes every week, but the lab reports can take several days to complete! I remember having to stay up late some nights drawing titration or heat curves. It's not a bad class, but I would recommend not procrastinating on labs.",
    "If you do the work you will go well. That simple.",
    "It's the lab for 118. That pretty much sums it up. The lab reports can be a pain, but what lab reports aren't? There's no final exam or practical, so that's really nice. Dr. Parr is witty and amusingly British. And, best of all, the lab is only a semester.",
    "If you need to do a lab credit, this is a good course to take. If you think you might be interested in future scientific research or majoring in chemistry, this is also a good course to take. If you are taking Chem 118 because you like chemistry but don't intend to pursue it any further, there is no point in taking this course.",
    "Incredible amount of work for half a credit! Lab reports after the first one which isn't taken for a grade are graded harshly and the weekly quizzes can easily hurt your grade. Be careful and willing to devote around 5 to even 10 hours on some of the more difficult lab reports.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. If you don't, try to avoid it. The quizzes focus on incredibly specific (and often useless) information and are worth a surprising amount (40% of your grade). Parr is funny, but patronizing. And the lab reports take a exorbitant amount of time (although you only have to do three or four full labs--the rest just involve doing a results section). Again, there's probablynot much that I can say, because most of you have to take it, but just be prepared to be a little frustrated at times\/do a fair amount of work.",
    "It's a lab that requires a lot of work beforehand.",
    "If you are taking Chemistry 118, it's pretty much a given that you'll be taking Chemistry 119L. I would never just do the lab for \"fun;\" it's more of something you just have to do. You learn a lot of very basic lab techniques, which is good. Although I dreaded lab every week, I suppose it could have been worse. The labs themselves aren't terrible, but the pre-lab quizzes can be extremely frustrating. Be prepared to lose significant amounts of points for silly little mistakes. I felt that I was forced to rely on a lot of fading knowledge from AP Chemistry for the pre-lab quizzes. The lab reports can be extremely tedious and time consuming. As long as you're careful about working on them ahead of time and not waiting until the night before they are due, though, you should be fine. Dr. Parr is very sarcastic; while he is usually funny, he can come off as seeming a little mean sometimes.",
    "A fairly straight-forward lab; if you take it, make sure you realize at the beginnign that pre-lab quizzes are worth 40% of your grade.",
    "Yes, because no matter what these reviews say, those who need to take this course, will take this course. But honestly, it was a great experience to really learn how to utilize different lab materials and master techniques \u0097 and overall, it wasn't too difficult. The quizzes can definitely get a bit stressful, but it's definitely manageable. Also, most of the labs are partner labs, so you always have someone to help you get through it.",
    "Take the class as it provides good laboratory experience.",
    "It's a decent course. Some of the labs are incredibly boring and involve a lot of waiting (and make you wish you had brought a folding chair to class). Others are fairly interesting.You usually don't have to do full lab write-ups, which is nice. The quizzes aren't too difficult, though they occasionally ask you about details you might have thought unimportant and glossed over.Most likely you are required to take this course, but it won't be bad if you know the lab procedure well and choose a good lab partner each week.",
    "Chem 119 is a good course in combination with Chem 118. The concepts learned are fairly parallel, and it helps to clarify some of the confusing parts of concepts by directly applying them. Lab reports were graded very leniently, but the pre-lab quizzes were sometimes challenging. The first half of the lab reports were not challenging to write, but as time continued they became more time consuming (taking up a lot of time for a half credit course). Lab was sometimes a bit stressful, because of the concept that \"there is no such thing as human error.\" Overall, I did enjoy this course and would definitely recommend it to someone taking Chem 118.",
    "It can be very education, but \"fun\" just isn't the right word here. Read the lab manual ahead of time and be sure you understand it! Lab quizzes are very difficult.",
    "If you like hands on stuff you will love this, if you don't then you will not like it. I would recommend it to fulfill lab requirements.",
    "Chem119L may seem like a pain at first, especially with so many people complaining about the labs. But, in truth, Chem 119L will probably be one your less intense and higher-grade classes during the semester. The lab reports are not difficult at all, all you really have to do is make sure that you follow the directions and have correct significant figures. In addition, after the first couple labs, all of the labs are done with a partner, which makes the four-hour lab a bit more tolerable. Of course, no one likes being stuck inside for three hours, but if you have at least some interest in the material, it really can be quite interesting. Don't worry about being stuck with a bad partner, you switch partners every session to make it fair. I would recommend it, but obviously only if you need it to fulfill premed requirements or some other requirement.",
    "I would recommend this lab. I can't really compare it to any of the other labs, and if you're taking CHEM 118 as a prerequisite it's essential, but I think the merits of this lab stand on their own. It's worth taking just to get some time in the lab and get a feeling for what it's all about. I think everyone should spend a little time in the lab.",
    "It's not an interesting class, but you have to take it if you are pre-med. Basically everyone who takes Chem 118 takes the chem lab (even if he or she is not pre-med). It's not that bad, but it is a decent amount of work.",
    "I looked forward to Chem Lab every week. For an extra half credit, it's worth the time you put into it and the opportunity it gives you to meet other chemistry students. Lab time is essential for students of any science, and this lab in particular is quite useful for gaining a better understanding of the material. While one won't be impressed with the level of equipment (it is an intro chem lab...), the experiments are challenging and rewarding, and the level of responsibility one assumes over one's experiments distinguishes this lab from high school courses.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it. It's a lot a work each week typing up all those lab reports. But Dr. Parr's pretty awesome. Just don't procrastinate like I did. Oh, and the lab book is super confusing at times (definitely minus.)",
    "Labs aren\u0092t as bad as non-science people make them out to be. It sucks that they\u0092re only half a credit, but if you\u0092re taking it, you probably have a good reason and no other choice. Bite the bullet and appreciate the fact that it\u0092s only half a semester.",
    "Chemistry 119L focuses on the material you take in Chem 118 but branches out to discuss more topics. It blends relevant material with interesting experiments that make it fun. The instructors are also very helpful.",
    "Chem 119L is a fun course. Sometimes the lab reports can be a little long but if you don't put it off till the last night you should be fine.The class meets once a week and there is a lab report due every week. There are quizes every week.",
    "Chem 119 is a solid lab course and a nice compliment to the 118 lecture. Dr. Parr makes the course more fun, the experiments are interesting and not as painful as I expected a college lab course to be. I would recommend this course to a fellow student. It's engaging and relatively painless way to get a requirement for your major\/pre-med requirement out of the way.",
    "Yes, this class is hard. Yes, these labs will be a lot of work. However, you will learn a lot and Dr. Parr is amazing in his sarcastic ways.",
    "4 hours of lab followed by lab write ups that don't take that long to do usually. Great class!! I would recommend it but this is not to say that you would not be wishing you had no lab at times.",
    "This course does not complement Chem 118 as well as I had hoped. Although it is probably difficult to have the labs coincide with the lecture material, sometimes we were expected to know or learn things (for quizes or even the labs themselves) that we had not yet learned. For example, there were quiz questions on balancing redox equations, which you would have no idea how to do, unless you remembered that from AP Chemistry. (And some of my friends did not take AP chemistry in high school). The phrase the sums up the class best for me is that they are \"Sticklers for grading.\" This includes lab quizes (which are only four questions, some of them multi-part, AND lab reports, in which there are endless oportunities to lose silly points. They probably do this to weed out those that cannot tolerate lab enough to stay premed. At the time, I really dreaded lab every week, but looking back, it wasn't so bad; I probably just conditioned myself to feel horrible every week as I walked up Science Hill. However, it was really helpful that we only had to do a FULL REPORT about half the time, if that.",
    "You have to take it if you take Chem 118. It's not that bad, really.",
    "It's a lab course that corresponds to the material covered in Chem. Completing the lab reports can sometimes require a lot of time and effort, but besides that, it was a very good course.",
    "If you're on the fence as to whether or not to take this lab, it's probably because you're not pre-med. If that's the case, one good reason to take it is that you will meet lots of interesting people who otherwise you'd never see outside of lecture or the library, because many of the labs are partner labs. I'm glad I took the class, and I would recommend it for that reason. You can take it Cr\/D\/F if you're worried about performance. On the other hand, many of the experiments are tedious and take some time, and you may often find yourself in the lab until 5, so keep that in mind.",
    "Take it if you have to. Lab reports take way too long a lot of the time and are just a pain to do. They can end up taking many many hours to complete each time. The labs themselves are OK. Some of them are remotely interesting while a good amount of them are just boring for the most part. Sometimes the only reason you can pay attention is because you know you will get a bad grade if you mess something up.",
    "It is a LOT of work for half a credit, but all Chemistry labs are and I really wish the department would realize this and make them a full credit. Writing up the lab take ages, especially when you have to draw a bunch of graphs. The weekly quizzes start off easy, but do get harder and actually make up a large proportion of the grade - 40%!!- so do revise for these if you want to do well.The great thing about this class is you get to spend time with other students, who are mainly freshman, and it is a great way to make friends with other people into science. You work in partners for almost all of the labs so there is always someone to ask questions when doing the write up or if you're both extreme procrastinators, to work through the lab the night before it is due. The labs themselves are also quite interesting, a lot more fun than just learning from a textbook. Is it worth the work? I would say yes.Don't take lab on a monday if you can help it because then you have nobody who has done it before you so you don't know the quiz questions and everyone else does, and you also have nobody to help out with your lab report writing. Also don't take it on friday because nobody wants to be stuck on science hill until 5pm on a friday.",
    "It is a good laboratory course that covers many of the topics at the same time as the Chem 118 lecture course. The laboratories are rewarding because the results are often fairly similar to what they are supposed to be, so you don't have to spend the whole time hypothesizing as to what could have gone wrong. Lab quizzes\/lecture before the lab are good and easy if you study rather than just complain that it counts as 40% of the grade. The lab reports are not that bad because you usually only have to do the results section rather than the whole write up. Try to combine speed AND accuracy on the lab because the accuracy of your results is graded.",
    "A pretty straight-forward lab course, with weekly quizzes and lab reports. Some students had trouble with the quizzes but they were actually very manageable if you read through the lab beforehand and familiarized yourself with the purpose, key equations, etc. The lab reports were made less painful by often requiring just results and calculations in the write-up, rather than a full-blown report. This probably won't be your favorite class of the semester and writing up reports does take some time, but it's still a good course. Definitely worth taking alongside 118, which is excellent.",
    "It's a good idea to take this course with Chem118, as it's a good introduction to lab techniques and it will be everyone's first time in a college lab. You basically do a different lab each week and turn in some kind of data\/report, but we only wrote a full report (abstract, procedure, data\/calculations, discussion, conclusion) maybe three times, so the workload the other weeks wasn't too bad. Definitely read over the labs before coming, as the pre-lab quizzes seem to be where the most points are docked off. Dr. Parr can be a little abrasive, but if you have a good TF they can help you out a ton. The labs don't always correspond to the material in class, but they're usually somewhat interesting.",
    "One of those classes you take only if you have to. You definitely learn lab techniques and some experiments can be satisfying, but for the most part, everything seems dry and predictable. Parr and some of the TAs can come off as a bit pretentious at times, but if you can get past that to ask them for help, they'll usually be helpful.",
    "The bright side: experiential education. A chance to kick around a chem lab. A chance to apply what you\u0092re learning in Chem 118, and occasionally play with fire. The downside: long lab reports, tough quizzes, more long lab reports, and then even more tedious, busywork-filled lab reports. If you have to take it, it\u0092s okay, you\u0092ll learn something. If you don\u0092t have to take it, you can use your time better elsewhere.",
    "Yes I would recommend CHEM 119 as there is no lab final exam (like a practical exam) as in the other labs. Also its just half a semester not a full semester long. It was perfect for me.",
    "Workload is predictable - no work leading up to the actual lab, lots of work for each lab, and most people leave the lab to complete the night before. But professor Parr usually doesn't make you do an entire lab - most times (except for really important conceptual labs) you just have to do results and calculations. If you're not a chem major or premed candidate, it's a a QR credit that could be aquired more easily elsewhere.",
    "Only take Chem lab if you have too. Labs can take forever to write up and the four hour lab can seem endless. If you make friends with people in your lab it can help pass the time.",
    "A necessary evil. More trouble than the measly half credit is worth. Only do it if you need the lab for your major\/premed requirements.",
    "If you are planing on keeping your options open for pre-med or chem major, you don't have much choice but to take this class if you're taking Chem118.If you do have a choice, go for it. Check it out the first couple weeks. You may find it too stressful and nit-picky and pointless, but you might like working with your hands.For me, the best part of this class was becoming friends with my lab partners. You have a much more intimate relationship with your classmates than you would in a lecture or even discussion setting.Give yourself plenty of time to finish your lab reports -- it's unnecessarily stressful to do them the night before. Half credit does not mean half the work.",
    "Overall, not a bad lab. Prof Parr is fine--you honestly dont interact with him enough to strongly like or dislike him. Grading sometimes depends on TA. Quizzes are worth a lot.",
    "Why would you take chem lab if you don't have to...? But take this over th 114 lab. You don't have to write full lab reports. Yay.",
    "Chemistry 119 is harder than the chem lab that comes with Chem 114. Yet, do not be scared away from CHEM 118 because of this lab, I almost was. Yes, Dr.Parr is a bit sarcastic, but the TF's are wonderful. You will need to study each week for the quizzes so make sure to read over each lab beforehand. This lab was probably one of the best classes I took this semester.Though a lot of people complained about it, I think that most kids end up with an A or A- if they do their work; so don't get scared away.",
    "This class would probably not be taken by choice. If you have to take it then take it, otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. The lab reports take up a lot of time as do the labs.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for pre-med requirements. The labs are tedious and useless.",
    "This lab is absolutely dreadful. Unless you're meeting Pre-Med requirements or being threatened with torture, avoid Chemistry 119 at all costs. I still can't understand why a half-credit class was the largest cause of stress and misery during the fall of freshman year. Parr's sarcasm is a huge hurtle to actual learning. Lab quizzes are over-specific and heavily weighted, and lab reports generally take a massive amount of time to complete. Worst of all, I came out of this class feeling as if I'd gained no great or valuable understanding of the material. Take 118 without the lab, if at all possible.",
    "I don't recommend this lab unless you need it or really really love chemistry. It is a little boring and very long, and the lab reports can get tedious. Start these ahead of time if you do take the class!",
    "only if they have to do it for their major."
