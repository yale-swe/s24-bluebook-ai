   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this lab to anyone who needs labs for pre-med or the major. It's a pretty relaxing experience, and also interesting. It compliments the lecture course very well, betterthan any lab I have ever taken.",
    "This was a very interesting lab. I think it really helped explain concepts of the class. Though the class periods were often long, the out of class work was very manageable. A very good way to fulfill lab requirements.",
    "This was a good lab. It was a little stressful because sometimes it can be very hard to collect data; however, you're allowed to share with other groups, so that helps a lot. Generally a good course.",
    "Yes! As far as biology labs go, this one is relatively relaxed and doesn't have long lab reports and you still learn a lot. You get to work with invertebrates like earthworms, drosophila, frogs, and grasshoppers and learn some basic electrophysiology techniques that are a good supplement to the lecture topics. Many of the experiments are a wonderful hands-on demonstration of phenomenon discussed in class especially if you are interested in neurotransmission or visual transduction."
