    "Amazing class! Unfortunately, it's not likely to be offered again, as Liz Montegary is leaving Yale. But if it's offered again, I feel like this class is a must for WGSS majors (and activists concerned with issues of privatization, neoliberalism, militarization, etc.)",
    "I chose this course based on interest in the subject matter and good reviews of the professor, and was not disappointed. I loved the format of two weekly seminars, and the structure of the coursework (three short writing assignments as check-ins throughout the course, and a research paper of a reasonable length at the end). Seminars were engaging, maintaining a balance between semi-lecture style to get people on the same page, and discussion allowed to stray just enough beyond the precise topic at hand. Having student presentations throughout the course and again at the end was a nice way to mix things up, and to hear about people's particular projects. Liz is a wonderfully engaged instructor. Office hours were enormously productive on the multiple occasions I visited them. Papers came back promptly, accessibly, and with really useful comments. I appreciated her consistency in addition to her insight. She shared her own research in really productive ways, and did a splendid job of pulling current events and everyday encounters into the theoretical discussions of the course. It's a shame she is moving on!",
    "This class is a critique of neoliberalism as it stands in the US today and in the past. It focuses on US higher education and the military to discuss and critique the destruction of public culture in the US through neoliberal discourses of privatization, respectability, citizenship, and private ownership. The course is very theory heavy and extremely US centric. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topics\/authors discussed who has already taken a poly sci course and\/or understands some nuanced ways that neoliberalism works."
