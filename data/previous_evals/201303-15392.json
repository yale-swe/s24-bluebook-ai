   "comments": [
    "Health inequality as it relates to austerity was a topic I had literally never thought about, but turns out to be a really important issue. I thought the class furthered my understanding of macroeconomic policy and public health, and the four writing assignments are relatively short and interesting to research and write.",
    "Although this was my fourth choice econ senior seminar, I actually ended up enjoying it a lot more than I would. She might restructure the class next time, but it was interesting because you got to look at many countries over time. Sometimes it was frustrating because the arguments boiled down to fundamental differences in how one thought the economy works, but that was just the nature of the book we were examining. We had three five page papers and one fifteen page paper.",
    "The class ended up focusing more on economics than on health or development, but that may have been the dynamics of this particular group of people. Otherwise, I definitely found the class worth taking. Prof. Nattrass is great, the subject matter is interesting, and I learned a lot.",
    "It's a great class for anyone who's interested in reading about and discussing the link between health and the economy.",
    "Yes. First, Professor Nattrass is nice and helpful. You can talk with her at any time, and when you do talk with her, she actually engages you in conversation and listens to what you have to say and responds to what you said (doesn't just reply with some random comment).Also, the course helped explain to me how economics is not as objective as lectures have made it out to be. There are many biases in Econometrics.Also, just four papers and a presentation. No unnecessary work.",
    "Interesting class and Nicoli is great, but could use more structure. Each seminar consists only of student led discussion. Workload includes three short papers (5 pages each) and one 20 page paper.",
    "YES, it's great and the readings are manageable (besides the first couple of weeks). The papers aren't too hard to write but remember that you aren't expected to deliver a phd level paper!",
    "It was a really interesting class that went through the current health situations in a few countries after the 2008 economic crisis. I really recommend the course."
