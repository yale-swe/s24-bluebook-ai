   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about different phenomena that influence how people make decisions. Also got a good feel for how experts go about crafting and performing studies, and how to critique these studies.",
    "I learned a lot about how people are systematically irrational, how their predictions do not match their future realities, and how people use heuristics in uncertain situations. This was the first time I really dug deep into psych research.",
    "I learnt so much about the field of behavioral economics, how research is conducted in this subject line, how to critically analyze papers, and how to write a research proposal.",
    "I believe I've gained insight about how the practices of two different fields, psychology and management, can benefit from each other. I've also learnt a lot about cognitive biases that shape human cognition in almost every topic it is trying to interpret.",
    "This class provides a good overview of the existing and ongoing behavioral decision-making literature about how people form judgments. Structured like a lab meeting, the class challenges students to think critically about research purposes and methods so that they can plan to make their own contributions."

   "comments": [
    "Did not need 3 hours per class - a lot of it was just listening to the professors ramble. Between the 3 papers and the discussion, each class could have been 90 minutes or 2 hours without losing anything.",
    "I've learned a lot, and the greatest strength of this course is definitely the professors. Ravi and Nathan are very talented and knowledgeable professors. They know the ins and outs of Behavioral Decision-Making and were able to answer almost every question we threw at them. That being said, there are a few weaknesses. First, I have no idea how I've done in this course. We have not received any feedback about our performance, which made me feel constantly unsure about my standing in the class. Next, the discussions were a bit awkward and would largely consist of a student raising a point or a question, then one of the professors responding for several minutes. I learned a lot through the professors' explanations, but it was not super lively. Lastly, I wish we had talked a bit more about how to construct a psych study at the end of the course. I found it a bit difficult to prepare for the final paper. I ended up trying to model the paper off of papers that we had read, but I'm afraid I may have been missing some basics of academic writing.",
    "I really loved how we got to read papers from many topics. The overall breadth of the course gave me a really good sense of how judgment decision making research works and where it will move in the future. I was overall very inspired by everything we discussed and felt genuinely excited to come to class. The only weakness of the course is that we did not receive much feedback on how we were doing.",
    "I liked the fact that this course put the emphasis on the discussion part, rather than teaching component. However, I felt like most of the time the discussion was between a student and the professors, rather than becoming a discussion on which everybody in the class can participate. I believe that was the result of the students' tendencies rather than the professors' will, but in any case I feel like in class discussion could have been more participatory.",
    "The close seminar format challenges students to make thoughtful contributions to the discussion. The class is a bit long, and so students tended to lose energy and engagement towards the end. Although there is a break, perhaps more frequent, shorter breaks could help students who might feel tired toward the end of the first segment. The instructor also do not provide any feedback throughout the course. It is very difficult to gage how well one is performing and where they could improve. I wish the instructors gave individual notes midway through the class so that each student could understand where they stood in the class and what areas they should focus on for the remainder of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Only if you are really passionate about the material. Professors expect total engagement and a high level of thinking about the material, so don't take it if you're not 100% invested.",
    "This is a really good course. The primary strength of this course was in its professors: Ravi and Nathan, who are prominent researchers in Consumer Behavior. A good subtitle for this course would be \"How humans use system 1 far more than system 2.\" This is a course in systematic human irrationality: how our predictions of the future and memories of the past do not match the realities of those moments, how our affect influences our perception and judgment, and how we often think we know more than we actually do. Every week you have to write three discussion posts on canvas about the papers. This definitely kept me honest about reading the papers, but it gets a bit boring when halfway through the semester a lot of my responses start looking very similar.",
    "Yes, definitely. Judgment decision making is extremely interesting and thought provoking, and the seminar style of the course helped me digest all the papers we discussed with ease. The professors are both brilliant and funny, which made the course even more enjoyable. Definitely would recommend it.",
    "I would probably recommend this course to an undergrad SoM or social sciences student, rather than a graduate student, as even though the professors provide valuable insight (which is especially helpful seeing the greater meaning of the individual studies conducted in this area) and pose intriguing questions, in class the focus of in class discussion may not be that innovative from time to time. However, I should also mention that I also believe that even an advanced graduate student can still benefit greatly from this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. You are forced to really engage with the material, and so you leave the class with a much better understanding of the field. The class is geared towards students who would like to do research, so if that isn't your passion, maybe choose a lighter course that covers similar material."
