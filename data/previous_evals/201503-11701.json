   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this class without any reservation, but only if you are willing to put in the work. This is the most time consuming class I had in my first semester of college by a wide margin. When they say that you spend two or three hours on homework each night, they really aren't kidding. But if you were like me, you'll find yourself loving the content and genuinely looking forward to learning more. I find learning the Chinese language extremely empowering and exciting, and my Chinese homework is always the first homework I do every day because it's the most fun. Chinese I was by far my favorite class of my first semester, and I had really great other classes, too. If you're willing to put in the time and work, you will learn a ton from this class and be well positioned to become a proficient Chinese student in future classes.",
    "Quite honestly, I couldn't imagine a better way to learn Chinese than with the Chinese department here at Yale. This class has been a pleasurea challenging pleasure, surelybut it is the first time I've actually enjoyed learning a new language. The resources that Yale offers and the instructors are all amazing, and if you're looking for a language to take, I could not recommend any language more strongly than Chinese.",
    "Very organized, well-planned class that has a strong structure from the very beginning and allows you to accelerate through the curriculum as quickly as you desire. I greatly appreciated the predictability of the course, there were never many surprises.",
    "I would recommend CHNS110 to any student interested in picking up a new language. However, I would warn them ahead of time that the course takes sometime to get used to -- given how fast-paced it is. I think that most students have the potential to do well in this course; they simply have to take advantage of all the additional resources the professors and school have to offer that will aid the students in understanding the class material better.",
    "Definitely a solid amount of work. You can probably get away with an hour a night, but if you want to do it well, you should probably put in more like 2 a night and then some preparation each morning too. Definitely worth it though, you'll be surprised by how much you can say after just a semester's worth. If you're interested, I would also definitely recommend going to Chinese language table. You get to know your teachers better, meet other students who speak Chinese, and it really helps you improve your ability to carry out a conversation.",
    "This class is highly rewarding if you are interested in the Chinese language. It is by no means an easy ride because you have homework and preparation to do every night, but if you are willing to put forth the effort, you will be amazed by how much you learn in just a semester's time.",
    "It is very very challenging but also rewarding. I feel good about how much Chinese I ave managed to learn and am comfortable with where I am in the language. However, the extensive memorization can prove challenging and frustrating at times.",
    "I would describe CHNS 110 as a course that you should take if you want to build a foundation for learning the Chinese language. Yes, I would recommend CHNS 110 to another student because I believe that it is one of the more engaging and exciting courses in the language department."
