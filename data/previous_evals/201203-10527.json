    "I would certainly recommend Chem 570 to other students who want to learn mid-level quantum chemistry. Overall, I find this course interesting and well-organized.",
    "Chem 570 is supposed to be an introduction to quantum mechanics, and though some of it is a review, there were several parts that I didn't understand the way he taught it. I would not recoment this course to students who have not studied quantum mechanics before. It is also difficult to get much out of the course if you are focusing on other courses like I was."

   "comments": [
    "This course not only increased my knowledge in quantum chemistry but also trained me for how to think logically and how to raise key questions by examining the building and development of quantum theory. This course gives me a good start for me to further delve into the theories of quantum mechanics in my future researches and studies. My computational skills also improved a lot through this course.",
    "Parts of it really got me thinking, which is always a good practice. I do not forsee very much of the acctual content being useful."
