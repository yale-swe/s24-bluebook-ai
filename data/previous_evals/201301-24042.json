   "comments": [
    "Overall I really liked this class, and feel that I leaned valuable skills. At the same time, some of the material seemed a bit repetitive. I wish we had spent more time talking about the analysis. It might also be helpful if the individual groups did final presentations so that we could see the results and analysis from other groups.",
    "This course was wonderful! The class covered the entire processing of developing a questionnaire: writing it, implementing it, analyzing the results and summarizing them in a paper through one project. We had no assignments outside of this project, but rather, our final project was done in small steps throughout the entire semester. I much prefer this to classes that require lots of route memorization and then assign final projects\/papers assigned weeks before the end of the semester, which end up being hastily put together. Since we worked on our project all semester, many groups ended up with high-quality final papers that were of publishable quality. The class was both didactic and hands on. The lectures each week pertained to the stage of the questionnaire development we were in. Because we were making use of the information as we learned it, I felt that students were more engaged with the lectures than they would be if they hadn't had a chance to apply it. We also spent time in class discussing different group's difficulties and successes and learned a lot from each other as a group. I also liked how we were also provided with lots of articles and textbook chapters onClasses V2, so if there were certain aspects of questionnaire development we personally wanted to learn more about.",
    "This course in an excellent, applied course on how to draft and validate a survey instrument (psychometric properties and all) or a survey methodology. The lectures are a bit dry. I actually love Marney's stories and sense of humor throughout, but she tends to skip over the meat of the lectures too quickly (how to do the psychometric testing, what stats were using) and focus on the stuff that's easy to understand (questionnaire formatting). This course could benefit from greater focus on actually learning about the statistics behind questionnaire development - maybe even a few problem sets to get us familiar with it before launching into our own analysis.Overall, an excellent and very useful course.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The lectures were interesting, and the group project throughout the semester provided excellent practical experience in designing and validating a questionnaire.",
    "Strengths: practical skills are developed to field a questionnaire.Weaknesses: not surethat this is really under Marney's control, but some of the readings were very large files (almost 50mb), and would never print on the Yale printers for me.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and learned a great deal. It was very practical.",
    "The class was useful as it allowed the students to address a research question, develop a questionnaire and assess its reliability. Students are exposed to the process of questionnaire development and reliability validation through analyses. Although the materials\/lectures can be dry, with guidance from the professor, one can gain a lot from having to go through the questionnaire development process.",
    "The course gave us useful questionnaire development training.",
    "The format of this course where every assignment worked towards the final project was a major strength of the course. However, I do think that all assignments should be group assignments.",
    "This was a fret opportunity to work in a group and develop a questionnaire and write a potentially publishable paper",
    "The course is very hands on and interactive. I feel my group was able to put together a good piece of work. However, I don't know that I learned very much compared to other semester long courses. I would have liked to have had more in class discussion.",
    "Strengths--we learned by doing and got familiarized with all the steps involved in making a questionnaire. I feel confident that we could adequately do this again in the future.Good balance between the practical aspects of our group questionnaires and the teacher's lecture.We not only learned how to create a questionnaire from scratch, but also how to criticize existing questionnaires. I have not been able to calmly take a survey ever since. I notice everything that's wrong with it!The professor's teaching style was entertaining and I enjoyed sitting through lecture. Great combination between being academically solid, but also making it sound interesting.Weaknesses--working in smaller groups might be better. Developing the questionnaire items took a considerable amount of time, and it was hard to find common times to meet since everyone's schedules are different. Some things can be discussed through email, google docs or Skype, but some assignments did not lend themselves to this. Although this was done in a few classes, maybe groups could have 20-30 minutes to meet during each class as to diminish the burden of outside meeting times.Room for improvement--the data analysis class could be taught in one of the labs at 47 College since not everyone has SAS\/SPSS on their laptops.",
    "Time is spread out.Very flexible instructor.Whole class was a project... slowly build your manuscript and learn the steps along the way"

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great! Very engaging and funny. Explains things well.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0just wonderful!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is the best! She is very knowledgeable not only about the qualitative process of writing a questionnaire but also about the psychometrics and questionnaire data analysis. She was very positive, helpful, and encouraging toward everyone. I think she is a very talented instructor, especially in her ability to engage students; nobody seemed bored in her class because she was able to integrate learning concepts with applying them.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney White is an engaging, funny, and knowledgeable professor of questionnaire development, measurement methods, and epidemiology (with a psychology twist). She is very responsive to students, very excited about student projects, and clearly loves the subject matter. My only complaint is regarding Dr. White's lecture slides, which are often repeats of previous lectures either given in this class or other classes. We spent far too much time talking about questionnaire formatting and response formatting, and far too little time discussing the actual methodologies and psychometrics.Overall, Marney is an excellent and engaging professor, and the type you would love to hang out with outside of class!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was wonderful instructor for this course. She had a strong background in the subject area, and was able to provide many interesting examples to illustrate concepts. Additionally, she incorporated stories and tangents into the lectures which helped keep our attention for the full two hours. Finally, she was always prompt and helpful with questionsand feedback.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is an awesome teacher! She knows how to teach and keep the students' attention. I like that she knows how to teach us what we need to know, and provides us with a lot of resources that we can keep for future reference.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is an excellent professor and really dedicates a lot of time to helping students and providing feedback on written assignments. I think she is one of the few who encourages students to improve their writing skills. I am actually amazed with our final group paper and think it is one of the best things I have done here at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The professor had a set office hour session for students to come and to pose their questions or to seek clarifications. The professor was accessible and gave helpful feedback on given assignments. The work-load was fair and the professor strived to create fairness for group assignments. Since a group project was the ultimate final assignment for this class, the professor ensured fairness by having peer-assessment for group members so that credit can be given where credit is due. Overall, the professor is quirky, as she often entertains the class with interesting stores, but genuinely cares for her students' progress.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She was a great lecturer and gave us excellent, detailed feedback.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is great. She is willing to schedule time to meet outside of class. She is also energetic and excited about teaching this material.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney cares deeply for her students and tries to keep the class constantly engaged. She goes out of her way to be available and provide feedback.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great professor! Cares a lot about her students and gives helpful feedback on assignments. Makes class material interesting.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is very detailed and encouraging in her feedback, which is extremely useful. Actual class sessions weren't always well planned.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great instructor!!Provided adequate and detailed feedback so you were clear on what areas needed to be improved and how.Her enthusiasm for a topic that could sometimes be dense\/dry was contagious.Highly knowledgeable on the topic.Provided concrete examples to better explain lecture points.Great sense of humor, which made the lectures entertaining.",

   "comments": [
    "You learn a lot in this class but it doesn't feel like work because its a lot of fun! The class is both instructional and \"hands-on\" so you come away from it having the ability to apply what you've learned. The class allows you to conduct an entire study using a questionnaire you created, and at the end of the semester you really feel like you've produced something of high-quality (not just done a bunch of busy work). If you are interested in behavioral health this class is a must (whether or not you plan on developing or using questionnaires yourself). In going through all of the steps of developing a questionnaire in this class, you gain a much better understanding of how they can be used and what their limitations are. Taking this class is essential to being able to critically evaluate the literature that uses questionnaires.",
    "Yes - I would recommend it is an extremely useful course. All public health students will be working with and\/or designing questionnaires at some point in their careers, and this course will ensure you use or design the best questionnaire possible. Because I like the small size of the course, I'm not going to recommend that it be a required class. But, I do recommend everyone to take it!",
    "The focus of this entire course was a semester-long group project to develop and validate a questionnaire. Although the entire project requires substantial time, the tasks are divided up over the semester to make for a manageable workload. The combination of a practical project and interesting lectures made this course excellent!",
    "In this class you develop, pilot test, and field a survey to address a research question of your own.I would highly recommend this class to other students because it is practically useful. This is a good skill to have and not taught in other classes at YSPH.",
    "Very practical. SKILLS FOR MAKING QUESTIONNAIRES AND SURVEYS ARE SO USEFUL!",
    "I would encourage first years, who are anticipating that they may be doing independent research and think that they would rely on a survey to assess public health-related information, to take this course the second semester of their first year. Although the material in this course can be dry, this class would be useful as it exposes students to the components entailed in creating a questionnaire as well as analyzing its reliability.",
    "Questionnaire development provided the useful skills related to the topic. The assignments were valuable and were not busy work. The readings were difficult to get through and I think the class could benefit from a textbook.",
    "This course gives you an introduction into questionnaire development by first developing an initial item pool, collecting data and then determining what the final item pool should be.",
    "Great course to learn important skill in public health! Would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you would like an easy, hands-on approach to learning about questionnaire development, by all means take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Great way to learn about questionnaire design. Readings are good but Marney's lectures and powerpoints are better. The entire process is excellent and she formats the class in such a way that by the end of the semester she's led you through a really great questionnaire development process that you'll apply later on in your own studies.",
