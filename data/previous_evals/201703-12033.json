    "I liked the coverage of propensity scores\/matching and sensitivity analysis, which were largely new topics for me. Other material in the course had been covered in the other stats courses and so was not very new. The problem sets did not involve very challenging programming, so I did not gain R skills either.",
    "I learned a great deal about casual inference, and sophisticated political science methodology.",
    "great overview on quantitative methods",
    "I learned about causal inference in a more rigorous manner than I had previously and was able to work on a research project.",
    "504 was an interesting addition to the methods sequence, with more of a focus on causal inference oriented research design.",
    "A much more thorough understanding of how different approaches to quantitative analysis connect with each other and each of their strength and shortcomings.",
    "Causal inference--identification, estimation, RD, etc.",
    "I developed greater insights into hypothesis testing, assumptions underpinning statistical analysis, and sensitivity analysis",
    "An overview of the methods and perspectives of quantitative methodology currently employed in polisci.",
    "-Primarily an understanding of the potential outcomes framework for quantitative analysis (most of my previous work had been focused on regression analysis and econometrics) -Within the above framework, I learned to conceptualize (and, to a lesser but still meaningful extent, formalize) unbiasedness, identification, and variance -I learned to use R to simulate and measure the effects of factors such as sample size, selection bias, empirical and assignment overlap, assignment confounding, and others on identification, unbiasedness, variance, and consistency of estimators",
    "I learnt to use important quant techniques like the potential outcome framework, and designs like Diff in Diff",
    "identification strategy needed",
    "Introduction to statistical research methods, probabilistic causal inference, assignment mechanisms, experimental research in social science, etc.",
    "During this course I learnt about the various theories of causality and identification. I gained insights into assignment mechanisms, as well as differences between experimental and observational studies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the main points for improvement would be, first, integrating some examples, if only in 1-minute shallow explanations to make the theoretical discussions more concrete, and second, not going as much into depth on proofs. For students who mostly want to do applied work, some of the theoretical discussions were not very useful and took up time that could have gone to discussing other concepts. Ultimately, we just need enough familiarity with most of these methods so that we know what is out there, what its strengths and weaknesses are, and who we should read\/talk to when we find a possible application in the real world. Knowing how to prove unbiasedness and so forth is important, but it was given a little too much attention I think.",
    "The theoretical side of the class was fascinating--next time, I would love more practice applying the methods we learned, though!",
    "strengths: very focused presentation of material",
    "The discussion of assumptions was useful and I enjoyed the visuals used to illustrate points. I missed a mathematical approach, as many points felt hand-wavy. Fredrik did a good job in lecture but he reviewed too much each class. The first 15-20 mins was always a review, so he never finished the material for the day. In the end, we didn't cover many of the specific subjects I was excited to discuss. We also spent too much time discussing the theory of causality. I find this material interesting, but it can be condensed from a month to two weeks max. I did enjoy how homeworks clearly demonstrated specific points and had an overlapping narrative. It made it interesting.",
    "Well-planned lectures, introduction to big ideas. There was a lot of repetition and lesser of a focus on revision. There were many very technical details we got lost in.",
    "I think that Fredrik's initial approach of delving deep into the theoretical foundations was warranted and great. He listened to class feedback that they wanted more applied content, but I was enjoying the theoretical grounding that Fredrik emphasized. It could be improved by giving more homework.",
    "Great course",
    "Strengths: -- I thought the textbook was great and the professor's lectures were well-prepared and clear. I thought the balance between explanation through broader conceptual discussions and then through more intense, formal mathematical notation was appropriate -- The final paper allowed us to have a more in-depth exploration of a topic that we found particularly interesting\/applicable to our research Weaknesses: -- too much discussion about philosophies of causation at the beginning of the class -- not enough discussion of applications to social science research (would have been nice to incorporate replication exercises into problem sets - i.e. retrieve results that scholars reported in a particular paper, using their data) -- problem sets could have been longer\/more intense; supplemental quizzes might have been helpful as well in getting us to memorize basic things we were learning in the class -- there were lots of papers\/chapters assigned each week but we didn't directly discuss most of them; it would have been nice to delve into those a bit more",
    "The course was strong in formulating the process by which one could approach the general topic of quantitative methods (i.e. the flow charts at the beginning of the semester were very useful for framing). That said, it was a bit unclear how this class theoretically should have differed from PLSC503. There was a bit more rigor in the homeworks (which were very well-curated to the lectures), but the topics seemed to have a great overlap.",
    "We received fairly regular feedback on our problem sets (via personal feedback and answer keys) so that we could correct any of our errors earlier than later. Both the TA and instructor were very receptive to meeting and providing additional support for problem sets and projects. Fredrik, the instructor, met with all of the students in the course to give us input on our final projects. One weakness I found was that when we would review proofs on the board, they were not always easy to follow. If we did not record the proofs perfectly, there was no readily-available text or lecture notes that we could refer to to practice these proofs.",
    "This course is very strong on the theory and conceptualization of the concepts mentioned above. Fredrik does a good job make them formal enough to be rigorous but still accessible to students with prior preparation but who are not experts. The course needs more applied examples to help illustrate its concepts. I consistently understood topics when Fredrik or Kyle provided examples (even silly or toy ones such as tiny datasets or questions about dog vs. cat intelligence). I found some of the topics that were not attached to hypothetical or real empirical settings much more difficult to follow. If the course used a few simple, recurring settings (such as the asprin example from class or the civics lesson example from problem sets) and put each concept in that context, it would be much easier to follow. On the below scale, I would say the course started out as just \"fair\" due to the difficulty in following some of the more abstract material and ended as \"very good,\" perhaps simply as Fredrik found his rhythm and settled in. I give it a \"good\" rating as an overall average but think it was definitely on the up at the end.",
    "More example oriented lectures- pick up an easy example relevant to the current topic and discuss it in class",
    "too slow, too repetitive, homeworks were not challenging enough",
    "more application will be helpful",
    "Right amount of assignments that were carefully selected, didn't feel like we were made to do busy work for the sake of it. Problem sets were interesting and gave a taste for how to go about some of the concepts and techniques we were learning about but would have been good to actually practice application for relevant research. Course could generally have been more applied. A lot of time was spent on theory. Great that we received feedback on time and in detail thanks to professor and TA who were responsive and committed to students' progress.",
    "I think this course could be improved by reducing the amount of overlap the course had with previous courses in the quantitative methods sequence. This would allow the course to cover a few new topics which would be helpful for those students who are more interested in quantitative research designs."

    "I would recommend this to a political scientist, or a quantitatively-savvy policy student!",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Yes. I think Fredrick will learn from this semester to better be able to make the course more mathematically rigorous. This is the last core course in the statistics sequence in PoliSci. It is okay if it has lots of math and is difficult. The students can handle it.",
    "Yes - it adds important nuances to the previous courses.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Fredrik is an excellent expositor and approachable instructor. I enjoyed and benefited greatly from this course.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes; the material is quite helpful to cover and the professor is open to discussing projects with students",
    "I would recommend this course if Fredrik is teaching it. He has a great perspective on methodologies and is great at explaining concepts that are perhaps initially unintuitive.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in research design in general, and causal inference in particular. It is an excellent overview to the various challenges associated with causal inference and some of the innovative ways to correct for issues that one may encounter with estimation.",
    "Definitely recommended to anyone interested in study design, especially experimental and quasi-experimental methods. Clearly useful for those intending to run their own studies. Also useful for those who only intend to be consumers of study findings but are motivated to learn what is \"under the hood\" of the studies they read.",
    "Yes",
    "yes",
    "Yes, especially as a continuation of the political science quants sequence.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students interested in quantitative and empirical methods; however, it would be preferable if certain changes are made in the course (explained in other answers)."
