    "Sing. Yes. Because you like to sing.",
    "Yes, naturally. I got exactly what I needed the most to improve as a singer. Prof. Lalli and Sara were very attentive to details and made sure I perfected my diction, rhythm and expression in every single piece I sang. I got lots of practice and performance opportunities. Maybe it was because I sang a lot more than usual. By the end of the semester I improved so much in confidence and tone quality that I was almost starting to feel like a professional, even though my skills were quite there yet. MUSI 222 was also a small class. I became friends with all my classmates at the end of the semester. The atmosphere is really chill and friendly. If you take it, you'll love it.",
    "Take it. You'll be happy you did.",
    "If you enjoy singing and learning new music, this class is definitely an experience that I recommend. It is low stress, does not require much of your time, and does not require you to be a music major to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It is a great way for less experienced, and even shy experienced singers, to learn performance tehniques and have access to performance time. It is a pity that more people don't come to the concerts, though!",
    "Yes, take it. Basically you sing for the class about once a week. Learning the rep is fun, and hanging out with Lalli is fun.",
    "If you are a singer at Yale, whether you're interested only in a cappella or classical singing, The Performance of Vocal Music is a class you really should take! Students receive weekly coachings and have the opportunity to perform in concerts for their friends and professors."
