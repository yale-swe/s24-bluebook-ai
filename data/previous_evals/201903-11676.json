    "I gained quite a bit of knowledge regarding the history of our field and it was fascinating. The favorite moment in this class was reading some of Greg Walton's early work on social belonging. I worked in his lab as an undergrad RA at Stanford and we worked on a belonging intervention for underrepresented students in college. It was fascinating to learn how this line of work began from such a small social connection intervention here in New Haven!",
    "I got a broad overview over various studies in the field of social cognition, especially about nonconscious processes.",
    "I gained insight into a broad range of social psychology literature. I feel as though I have a solid base of knowledge regarding social cognition, in particular in the context of implicit cognition (compared to other big social psychology topics like stereotyping, for example - which were covered, but through the lens of implicit cognition).",
    "I learned to follow a 2.5-hour lecture course and speak up to ask questions, as well as learned a lot from peers who were from different backgrounds of psychology and shared their different interpretations of the topics. I learned to connect concepts and dive deeper into the material. The course was enriching and extremely fulfilling for me.",
    "I learned a base overview of the history and research relating to self and other, memory, stereotyping and prejudice, and other topics relating to social cognition.",
    "a good understanding of the development of Social Cognition and its relation to cognitive and social psychology theories, important studies and figures in the field, insight in its importance for various other disciplines",
    "I learned about the conscious and subconscious social influences on our behaviors. I learned about concepts of self and other, motivated action, and self-regulation. I feel up-to-date on major topics in social cognition.",
    "I feel like I was able to hone my critical thinking skills in this course. I was also able to put names and history to concepts I've experienced and\/or studied briefly in the past. Overall, it was a great way to truly get a deep dive into all things social cognition.",
    "Overview and history of social cognition, various mechanisms behind cognitive processes",
    "Got an overview about the different work\/history of social cognition research",
    "I learned about the historical and contemporary papers that were involved in understanding the concept of social cognition. I also learned about the aspects involved in bond formation.",
    "Background on social\/cognitive psych literature"

   "comments": [
    "I wish John would be a little clearer when he lectures about which papers he is referring to. I often had to crosscheck his notes with the papers to make sure I had the right information.",
    "We heard about a couple of different studies that were very interesting. However, the insights were not really deep - to me it seemed more like a \"psychology for beginners\" rather than a PhD class.",
    "I think the course did a good job providing a fly-over of social cognition literature. I did wonder about the applicability of some of the material - some of it felt like fun trivia facts more than research that could be applied in some meaningful way (this was only true of a subset, not all material covered).",
    "I thought the course was taught very well with the strengths being the course readings, the professor's discussion, and the way we were examined on our knowledge.",
    "I was very impressed by the instructor's detailed knowledge about the broad field of research in Social Cognition, I enjoyed the open discussions about the topics (underlying mechanisms of certain findings, alternative explanations and connections to newer findings) very much!",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Its biggest strength is its content, which is relevant and interesting to everyone. We didn't get too bogged down in neuroscience or economics, or any related subfield. The papers were the appropriate difficulty and were very enjoyable to read. The biggest weakness of this course is that it is a bit large, and was not taught as a discussion-based seminar.",
    "The classes themselves were fairly disorganized and it wasn't always clear which papers or studies specifically were being discussed. It would be great to write out the author and year on the board for each study being discussed. Also, while the professor wrote an outline of topics on the board, it wasn't always clear when we moved on from one topic to the next, so that could be clearer. But overall, the readings were great.",
    "I believe it was fine as is; the lectures were interesting and the professor, engaging. The readings were plentiful but thought-provoking - some of the recommended readings were talked about as much as the required readings, but I understand why.",
    "Dr. Bargh was very knowledgeable and his stories were fun and insightful. At first, to someone who has no background in cognitive psychology, it was a bit challenging to understand. But as the semester went by, I was able to understand the concepts better. Perhaps explaining some of the basic terms that may seem like jargons to those outside of cognitive psychology can be helpful in the beginning.",
    "Would have loved some sort of lecture slides to keep track of what the professor considered most important. Classes were just a lot of note taking with so much info being thrown at us.",
    "Strengths: Discussions, papers, small class size Weakness: Details about progress in the class periodically",
    "The course covers a lot of interesting material, however the overall structure of the course mightve been easier to anticipate and follow with additional lecture materials (e.g. slides)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "To get an overview about research that's going on in this field, I'd highly recommend this class! If someone if looking for deep insights to specific topics, I'd take another class.",
    "I would tentatively recommend this class, based on one's interests. If one plans on studying social psychology in any capacity, I would say that one would receive valuable exposure to certain perspectives\/bodies of literature. If not, I would worry that the material covered would not apply to one's field of study in a meaningful way.",
    "Yes! The assigned and recommended readings for class were all very interesting and the class discussions were all really interesting. For a longer class I actually stayed engaged the whole time because the discussions were so interesting.",
    "Yes, it was a nice change of pace and I enjoyed how Professor Bargh used studies and stories to support the ideas and topics we were studying.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone majoring in psychology who wants a base knowledge of information and studies related to social cognition.",
    "Yes, I think this course with the instructor's input is great to gain a good understanding of the development of the field and its relation to other subdisciplines of Psychology",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. If you find the course description interesting, then take it. Perhaps look over some of the readings and see if you would enjoy them. However, be aware that you are not about to embark on a life-changing intellectual journey. This class is seminar-sized but is primarily lecture-style with open questions. Some people didn't like that in the past, but I loved it and looked forward to it each week. It's not particularly organized in terms of teaching, but I don't see why it needs to be. I found Bargh to be highly knowledgeable, entertaining, and very friendly. Not a source of stress and very manageable workload.",
    "I would recommend it to other psychology graduate students who need a core course requirement with a low workload. There isn't that much reading and the topics are interesting!",
    "Definitely recommended if at all interested in social cognition; it provided a comprehensive overview of the field as well as detailed insights into particular studies and areas of interest.",
    "Yes, if you want to get a good overview of social cognition and learn about motivations, goals, the self, and other social cognition topics, this is a great course.",
    "Yes, it was really interesting and not too much work.",
    "Yes. This course is important to take for people that are conducting research in a social cognition or social neuroscience lab."
