    "An interesting class. This was the first time it was taught as a separate lab, so I think some of the kinks will be ironed out for upcoming semesters. But I am so happy I took this class. The classroom time itself was not very productive; each person gave a 30-40 min long presentation every class about a robotics topic, but these had little to do with the work we did in the lab and were often rehashing what had been covered in the 472 lecture the previous semester. But the projects were awesome. Scaz was fantastic about giving us so much free reign over what we wanted to study and what robots\/lab materials we got to use. I learned a TON from working with our robot and it was pretty fun too. But be warned: anything you want to do with a robot is 100 times harder than you think it will be when you begin, so pick your project wisely.",
    "Take it! I thought it was fun and really enjoyed being able to do a research project in a guided way. The student presentations during class time were very enjoyable, too.",
    "CPSC 473 was an interesting class. Working on the project was a great experience and, at the end of the day, I'm proud of what my team accomplished. Nonetheless, for most of the semester, it was extremely stressful. The instructional staff provided little support and we had to figure out pretty much everything on our own. Scaz is a brilliant man and a fantastic lecturer. Nonetheless, since all the lectures were student-taught, we really didn't get to learn from him in the same way that we did in 472, the lecture-based course. If you enjoy having the liberty to explore any topic you'd like, you should definitely consider taking the class. Nonetheless, be warned that working in a group with little support and somewhat ambiguous expectations can be stressful. The class certainly has a lot of potential, and if it is restructured to address some of these issues, it could be one of the best in the department.",
    "Scaz is a great teacher and an absolute genius with everything in regards to robotics. I would HIGHLY recommend the lecture class 472, but only take this class if you have enough time in your schedule to enjoy the work. The class time itself is not much use as each class is a student presentation, so Scaz doesn't really teach, which is the one disadvantage of this class I think. It's a great opportunity to get to lead your own project and I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in things like this, but don't take it just to get an elective out of the way. You have to have a good work ethic and NOT procrastinate - start your project very early. It ends up being a LOT of work even though in the beginning it might not seem like it.",
    "This is a great class. I would strongly recommend it. You get the experience of real scientific inquiry and you learn how to work on a group coding project. All are very important skills that I'm not sure too many other classes provide.",
    "Definitely. It's a great class with one major presentation, and one semester long project. The project can turn into a lot of work, especially near the end of the semester, but you really get the opportunity to get a feel for what it is like to work with robots. The project results in a final presentation along with a full conference paper than could potential turn into a senior thesis or maybe even published work. Scaz is a great professor and he pushes you hard, but in the end it's worth it. Definitely worth taking.",
    "This class is a head first dive into researched. You'll learn a ton, but you will get very stressed. It's a good life experience to be so on your own, and need to figure things out without the close guidance of elders.",
    "This course really gets you acquainted with the field of robotics as you build or study something new and useful for the field. It is very hands on, and while it is not much work at the beginning, conducting the study itself by the end is incredibly time consuming. But it is a very gratifying experience! This course is a great way to learn more about robotics and to apply some of the principles learned in 472.",
    "A nice seminar course with a semester-long project (groups of 3). Make sure you keep up a good pace on the project, but otherwise it's pretty chill.",
    "Take this class if you enjoyed intelligent robotics and want to get a chance to work with robots in the social robotics lab. Projects can be difficult to choose, so definitely start thinking early about what you want to do. The class works well for HRI projects, but other types of projects are possible.",
    "Great class. You get to do research for a whole semester but as a group and there's no pressure to publish (well, there is, but it's not very heavy). Choose your group members carefully because freeloaders will hurt you a lot. You also need to prepare a presentation on a topic about robotics. If they get the logistics issues sorted out I would def take this again. Even if they don't, I'd probably take it again. Projects require a lot of work but you will be so invested in it that you want to spend the time in the lab."
