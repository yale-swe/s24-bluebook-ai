    "French 276 focuses on caricatures and comedic texts from 19th century France. Madame Girard is very, very French and, in general, quite lovely.",
    "Taking it - it's a great class.",
    "You will learn about wit and satire; most of the course is about 19th century Parisian caricatures, but you also come away from the course to understand contemporary humor. If cultural fluency is important to you, take this course\u0097and do the readings. Don\u0092t take this course in order to \u0093practice your French\u0094 because you won\u0092t generally do much speaking. Also, the course was at 9am on Monday\/Wednesday for me; don\u0092t do that to yourself. I had never had a class that early before, and it was amazed by how difficult it was to stay engaged, arrive on time, and come prepared.",
    "It's a really interesting class and the material is fun and unexpected. I would recommend it if you want to take a low-key, upper-level French class. If you're looking to improve your speaking skills, though, don't take this class because we barely spoke. it was more just Professor Girard giving us information.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Excellent class",
    "Take this course. Marie-Helene is a great professor and very knowledgeable in a range of subjects: history, linguistics, art, current events, etc. She can comment on anything. Most of class time was spent listening to these interesting tidbits of knowledge. Taking the course instilled in me an appreciation for satirical images. I really enjoyed trying to analyze them and learned how to elucidate their meaning from signs and references in the images themselves. Marie-Helene is also keen to make you aware of the historical context in which images arise. I think the theme of the course changes every year, but keep this piece of advice in mind when you write essays for any of her classes."
