    "Take this class if you really want to learn a language. If you're not good at picking up languages, it will be difficult especially the grammar. French is a beautiful language. You will learn how to speak a fair amount in the few months that you are in the L1 course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were serious about learning French. The course is intense, but you'll be amazed by how much French you actually know by the end.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I would most definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. I learned so much from this course and had so much fun throughout the process!",
    "French is more work than I had anticipated\/ever wanted from an L1 language. But I guess I have learned a decent amount in a semester.Madame Burton is fantastic! She is such a joy!",
    "If you want to learn French, take this course because you will learn the language. I am amazed what I know by the end of the first semester. Be warned, that it is a ton of work! Also, it is by no means an easy A class, even for someone who is good at languages. You have to put in the time if you want to do well.",
    "It's fabtastic, but be prepared to devote many hours to it. Or else you will not get out of it as much as you want.",
    "Yes, fantastic way to learn a new language",
    "This class gives a lot of daily work. Be prepared to spend 2-3 hours everyday on homework, Also be prepared to meet during reading week and still have this amount of homework while you're trying to study for other finals. Nonetheless, i'd recommend this course because it made learning french easy.",
    "Excellent course, but be prepared to work. The French department here is top-notch and the Immersion method allows you to learn and become comfortable with a lot of new material in a short amount of time. For anyone really looking to learn French, this is your class. (However be prepared for an intensive introduction- Monday night tests are no joke.) All in all a great experience and I would highly recommend Professor Burton; she is wonderful.",
    "It is a good introduction to French, but it is a lot of work.",
    "Take it if you are willing to put in the work and have a genuine interest in learning French -- this isn't a gut language by any means, so reconsider if you're just trying to get the language req out of the way without too much work. The workbook activities, written compositions, and weekly tests form a substantial but doable workload if you stay on top of it. French in Action is very focused on listening comprehension and speaking, so if, like me, you're a more visual learner, you may feel overwhelmed, especially at the beginning of the course. That said, the French department is one of the best in the country, and the amount you learn in one semester is amazing. Mme. Burton is a sweetheart and prepares you well for the tests."
