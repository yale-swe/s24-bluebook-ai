   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it even for non-architecture majors, the workload is not as heavy as other art\/architecture courses and the lectures can be really interesting.",
    "Do it if you're interested in Architecture. And only if you plan on going to lecture.",
    "I thought this course was interesting and informative. I would, however, only recommend it to students very interested in architecture or who want to take a course that will show them how look at the world from an architectural standpoint.",
    "A must take at Yale. Purves is one of the best lecturers you will ever hear. Awesome",
    "Architecture 150 is an amazing class. It's really interesting and you learn a lot and think about things differently as a result. I would absolutely recommend it, although I will note that there is a weekly assignment (usually a drawing) that will take up a considerable amount of time.",
    "I would recommend Arch 150 to people as a nice break from dense reading and paper writing- it allows you to think in a new way and express yourself through drawing and model building.",
    "Architecture is the biggest breath of fresh air. The lectures are not essential to doing the assignments (although don't skip... Purves is a cool dude). The assignments\u0097a drawing assignment every week, like \"draw a gothic window,\" one short paper, and the final paper OR project\u0097 are all really fun. The drawing assignments take a moderate amount of time, but if you're hopeless at drawing, probably stay away. They don't grade so much on drawing skills, but on how you approach the assignment. Your enjoyment in the class will depend on what kind of TA you get\u0097 mine was especially critical, but it definitely made for a more meaningful\/constructive class. Definitely take Arch if you want an enjoyable class with fun projects and reading that you will choose not to do.",
    "Arch 150 is the survey course for the architecture major. It basically covers everything from Urban design, to sustainability, to engineering, and everything in-between.",
    "Great class. So so so much fun. Assignments are all drawing or making a lampshade. Can take it even if you can't draw very well but you may find it very frustrating. If you enjoy being creative and being able to work without strict guidelines then you'll love this class. I had a friend in this class who claimed she couldn't draw, and hated being creative\/couldn't handle not being told exactly what to draw and she got super frustrated. Although i personally thought they gave us plenty of information. Also lectures are good, but pretty useless! which is even better. don't worry that the class meets at 925. you rarely have to go. one of my fav classes at yale, you'll really enjoy it.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to any student interested in architecture, art history, or even simply interested in the nature of buildings and cities. It leans more heavily to the side of art history in the readings, but it does delve into architectural theory, and the drawing assignments give quite a lot of chance to experiment.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It has a relatively easy workload and the work that you are assigned is interesting and fun. The one annoying thing is that nobody has any idea how it is graded.",
    "The workload is definitely manageable and for someone who has never taken an art class before, it was fun. However, sometimes it also got a little intimidating since most of the class wanted to be an architecture major. It was annoying at times though because you never knew how well or poorly you are doing in the class.",
    "Purves was wonderfully kind and encouraging. His lectures flowed well and you really get to know certain structures by the end--Corbusier's Villa Savoye, the Yale Art Gallery. However, I wish the TAs had provided more constructive criticism instead of just praise. I didn't feel like I learned much from feedback on the assignments or from section--only from the act of doing the assignments, which were time consuming but very instructive. The TAs were a little to timid and didn't really encourage student participation either. Section was a little boring.",
    "Fun course if you like hands on projects. There is also always an option for students that are more inclined towards papers as opposed to the more aesthetically involved assignments. Doesnt matter if u dont want to major in arch, take the course!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially if they are interested in majoring in architecture. This class gives you a different way to look at the things around you, and is worth taking in your time at Yale.",
    "A great course if you are interested in architecture! Be prepared to sketch every week! The design projects are a lot of fun!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in architecture or just interested in art stuff..to get a taste of architecture and see if you wanna do it",
    "ARCH 150 is an intro survey course of architecture that is perfect for anyone, whether you have no experience or are positive you will be an architecture major. The grading consists of a paper, two design projects, and completion of weekly sketchbook assignments. The readings are interesting and can be helpful, but if you can't get to all of them it's not a problem (except that the paper is based on the readings). It's a lot of fun, and the chance to explore a new field was awesome. Purves is a great professor, and the TAs are good as well. Aidan is fantastic.",
    "Anyone planning on applying for the architecture major is required to take this class. For someone not interested in the major, I would still recommend it as the lectures are interesting and the assignments \/ sections are very palatable. Most assignments are drawings done in a sketchbook with the exception of one model, one paper and a final design problem. It's not a heavy workload. So, if you're at all interested in architecture \/ urban planning, take this course.",
    "Take this class. Even if you have no desire to be an architecture major, you will end the year with a new appreciation for the art and science of translating ideas into corporeal form.Purves' love for the theory and practice of architecture is palpable and infectious. Sections are run by two TAs, and do a really good job of making a large lecture class feel surprisingly intimate.There are weekly drawing assignments, one written assignment and an option of a final paper or design assignment for the final project. The design assignment requires you to construct a lamp shade; its objective is to get you thinking about how the inherent qualities of a material can influence a design. The final project is due in the week right after Thanksgiving, so while Thanksgiving break will be devoted to the project, you will be done with this class before reading and finalsweek roll by. Easily one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "VERY easy, interesting but too broad to actually learn much. Take it if you want an okay early lecture and a fun drawing assignment once a week",
    "Great class. Take it. Readings are nearly no work, and the weekly drawings are the most fun you'll have with homework. I came into this class with no drawing skill whatsoever, and the section really helped me learn to draw and see things.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's NOT a history of architecture. It's a survey of exactly what architecture is and what it consists of. Purves is fantastic. One of the better teachers I've had at Yale so far. I would even recommend this class to people who aren't interested in majoring. The subject is valuable and completely interesting.",
    "YES. Even if you don't end up majoring in it, it opens your eyes up to a whole new world where you find yourself appreciating buildings and things you'd never bothered to consider before. The workload was reasonable - weekly assignments, 1 paper, 1 group project, 1 final project. No drawing experience is required. I found this class really enjoyable and fun because it was a different type of work. Definitely take this course. Only bad thing was that it was unclear how we were being graded.",
    "Definitely.",
    "DEFINITELY take this class. Professor Purves is the only real incentive to show up -- and you should. No tests and only one short paper, but the weekly sketchbook assignments take legitimate time and effort if you want to improve your drawing ability. Great class that everyone should take -- and if you're at all on the fence about the architecture major, this class will certainly help you decide.",
    "THIS COURSE ROCKS! TAKE IT!List of things that were awesome:- diversity and depth of assignments- baller TA- Purves is an incredible lecturer- new insight and appreciation gained into\/for campus architecture\/architecture in generalThings that were not awesome:- bitchy sophomores who were planning on applying to the major and hadn't an ounce of humility or grace and were unkind during section- the paper (although it was like 5 pages so I shouldn't even complain)",
    "Even if you are not planning to become an architecture major, this is a great class to take. If your not sure, this will definitely help you decide. Work load is not too heavy and its fun.",
    "This course covers the basics of Arch principle, history and theory. While it only scratches the surface of these elements of architecture, you will still learn a lot. Weekly sketchbook assignments are fun if you like drawing and the midterm and final build projects take a lot of time but are worth the effort.",
    "Yes even if you are not planing in majoring in it, it was really fun and interesting.",
    "Great class, I would definitely recommend it to all. Purves makes intro architecture extremely interesting and engages those who are barely interested in architecture. Weekly work includes unnecessary readings and weekly sketches.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, regardless of major. The assignments (mostly drawing and building) are refreshingly different from average classwork. The lectures are interesting, though unfortunately unnecessary. I'd say take it - it's fun!",
    "ARCH 150 was an interesting and dynamic thematic introduction to architecture. If you like architecture at all, you will enjoy the lectures. Purves is a great professor, likes interacting with his students, and will support\/advocate for you. Outside of lecture you have a ton of reading (which is never discussed but you will have to write a paper about!) and weekly drawing assignments (which take up most of section discussing). Grading is a total black box, though. We didn't get a grade back for the midterm paper and model, even though a big deal was made of them. Sometimes I felt a little confused, between the undiscussed reading and thematic lectures, but the course is still interesting.",
    "Don't take this class unless you love to draw buildings or are considering a major. Don't be deceived on the workload--though readings and lectures might not be enforced so strictly, the assignments do take awhile to complete. I was disappointed with this course. Considering a major, but decided against.",
    "Definitely take this course if you have any interest in architecture. You don't even need to have a strong artistic background to do well. In the course, you will be exposed to a bunch of different types of architecture, and you will learn how to look at spaces in different ways. The workload is very manageable and enjoyable.",
    "Interesting lecture - honestly Purves teaches you to look at buildings in a whole new way. And I'm a math\/comp. sci. major, so I came into the class with a healthy dose of skepticism. Drawing assignments werewell thought out and the course load wasn't bad. Unfortunately they're is no feed back, so you'll have no idea how you're doing. Purves didn't even bother to return our midterm evaluations (why did he have the TA's write them? I don't know.) I could be getting anywhere from a C to and A - I'm about to find out.",
    "I would definitely recommend Arch 150 to anyone, whether you plan to major in architecture or not. You will look at space in general differently because of this class. Professor Purves is wonderful and the drawing\/design assignments are demanding but fun.",
    "A great introduction to architecture. It got me thinking about different aspects of architecture I had never considered before and particularly liked the examples from around Yale and New Haven. The weekly assignments were interesting and a nice change of pace.",
    "Yes",
    "Arch 150 is a drawing course with a couple of projects. There is a lot of creative freedom and you get out what you put into it. I would recommend it to everyone.",
    "I would recommend this to all students. It's a different type of class, drawings are challenging but enjoyable, and it's good material for anyone to know.",
    "Yes, definitely, even if you're not considering the major or are taking it Credit\/D. It really educates you in a different way of seeing the world: you notice buildings, lines, styles, it's actually really revolutionary.",
    "Intro to Architecture is great whether you're going into Architecture or you're not. I feel like it's designed for either type of student, especially since the final project is either a paper or a design problem. Important class in a liberal arts education.",
    "All students should take this course. Especially at Yale, where architecture is so valued and varied, all students should have at least the basic knowledge and exposure in order to appreciate their surroundings. The lectures are engaging and the readings reasonable. The projects are thought provoking, and, despite -- or perhaps because of -- their time committment, rewarding.",
    "Good! Lectures were fabulous, Purves is wonderful. He cares about students, which is a huge plus. Possibly a misleading intro into the architecture major simply because the workload is super light. Great for non-majors, probably an easier A than most, though not a gut.I wish the course had focused a little more on the vernacular, but for an intro survey course, 150 got all the hits. It's required, so that explains parts, but as someone with a previous interest in Architecture, it was a little underwhelming.Put thought into it, really do the readings, immerse yourself into the subject matter. It's great. The works light, the reward large.",
    "Arch 150 is an interesting course that allows a student to delve into the area of architecture without feeling overwhelmed by the subject. But it is taught very well, and definitely challenges students to think differently than most Yale classes expect you too. The course is not based on how much you know, but applying what you already know and forming it into matter. It's really neat.",
    "A great class if you really want to get a good background in all aspects of basic Architecture. Class definitely became more difficult throughout the semester. So beware if you are not an artist\/architecture-major-wanna-be.",
    "Intro. Architecture is a FANTASTIC course. I absolutely loved it. It does not teach you factual information about architecture: e.g. what a roman arch looks like, what gothic architecture is, but it is a GREAT introduction to how to think like an architect: notice your surroundings, see things you didn't see before. It is AWESOME. And Purves is the best! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested the slightest bit in architecture or urban forms. There were fantastic guest lecturers and it really gave a great summary of the field.",
    "Intro to Architecture was a fun class; there is a lot of work, but if you have an open mind and the time, than the work is a lot of fun. However, the feedback on how one is doing in the class is rather \"shady.\" No-one had any idea what they were going to get for a grade.",
    "I enjoyed the class immensely."
