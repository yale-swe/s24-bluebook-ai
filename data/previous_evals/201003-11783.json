   "comments": [
    "Conversational Spanish is a great class to take if you have little to moderate experience with speaking the language, as its focus is really on speaking above all other skills. You should be able to read and write competently, but speaking proficiency is only marginally needed to enter the course, as you will learn quickly and efficiently with Prof. Carballal's help. I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, it a good class to maintain your level of spanish.",
    "The class was basically a 50 minute conversation 3 times a week, but, ironically, it isn't necessarily the best setting for improving your conversation skills. I wouldn't really recommend it to students unless they are just looking for an easy Spanish class because it doesn't really stimulate students.",
    "Take SPAN150 if you want to maintain the level at which you're speaking Spanish. It may or may not improve your skills, depending on the level at which you speak. You cover a variety of [controversial]topics: family, crime, immigration, etc. You read a novel for the last couple of weeks of the course. Most of the grade is based on participation in class. Overall, it's a good course. I feel more solid in my Spanish-speaking skills after it.",
    "Definitely recommended as an informal conversation course\/if you are looking to increase your comfort\/fluidity with spoken Spanish, although don't take it if you are looking to develop grammatical accuracy. General structure is pretty informal: you read various works of fiction and non-fiction (most of which are pretty engaging), and discuss them\/write several assignments about them. Work to find a good professor (Carballal definitely recommended) and group of students.",
    "Spanish 150 is a really nice class that really helps your speaking. I would definitely recommend it for a foreign language class.",
    "We read something from our course packet and then discuss it in class. All exams are oral and super chill.",
    "A fun, easy class that will keep you speaking Spanish but not necessarily improve it. Carballal is a great section leader, keeps the class structured but interesting and engaging. Workload is fairly light--pretty short readings and written responses every week, vocab quizzes, several oral exams--all manageable if you speak\/read Spanish pretty well already. Not much grammar, probably won't improve your knowledge of Spanish though it will help you keep your speaking up AS LONG AS YOU SPEAK IN CLASS. Class is really what you make of it--it's up to you to participate, do the readings, etc. You can probably get by without it, but your Spanish will go nowhere.",
    "Definitely take it if you want an easy language credit - it's not grammar intensive, so you don't have to worry about verb conjugations and the like, you just get to enjoy speaking in class. The topics - everything from the tango to immigration - are interesting, as is the novel at the end."
