   "comments": [
    "A ton of fun, lots of learning, just a blast. Take it, you'll be glad you did!",
    "Definitely take the lab if you're taking the class. Helps you understand the material a lot better, and it's really very minimal work. Only meets about 6 times throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, it is a great introductory field course!",
    "This is one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. You only meet every other week and most of the assignments can be finished during class time. If they can't, they involve wandering around campus looking at rocks, which can be fun if you go with friends. The trip over fall break, to Canada, was a total blast. The geology department is wonderful and it's nice to interact with the people from the department (especially the DUS who is awesome and teaches 111L). I would recommend taking it with the class if you're at all interested in geology (and I've heard the class is also quite good and not too much work), but it's definitely a very relaxed, fun class, probably not even worth 0.5 credits!",
    "Take it if you have any interest in having a meaningless (for non-majors) talent of identifying rocks and minerals and showing off what you learned about Earth.",
    "I highly recommend this class to G&G and non-G&G majors. It's a necessary (but fun!) course for G&G majors and a great way to kick out some SC credits for non-G&G majors.",
    "Excellent and very fun class. The lab-work sections can be completed in your own time, and the geology field trips are not to be missed. A lab that's actually half the work of a normal class!",
    "If you want to go through a course without actually learning anything this lab is for you! There are 7 sessions in total, each of them more painful than the last. Also there are terrible scavenger hunts which are actually hard (because you dont learn anything) and not fun. And there's a final paper which is irritating to write. If you are a geo major you'll have to take it and then you might like it. The fields trips are fun, though, and you look at some cool rocks.",
    "Take it. Meets every other week, you go on field trips, and it's actually a 0.5 credit class. Take it if you want to get to know rocks on a personal level, not just read about them in books.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THE LAB IF YOU'RE TAKING THE CLASS! It makes lecture more applicable and understandable. Also, you get to know the other people in the class better. We went on a field trip to Canada which was fantastic. Majestic D!",
    "Definitely take 111L if you need a lab. It is fun. It is not onerous. It asks a few tough questions that are fun to work out with other students. If it also includes a field trip over fall break, you are an idiot for not taking this lab.",
    "I would recommend the lab mostly because of the trips. I cannot say it was my favorite topic though. I did like the final paper that crossed a broad span of topics. It was not too much work either.",
    "Very fun. Almost no work. Learned a lot.",
    "The lab assignments were sometimes confusing, but overall the class was great because of the field experience. Trips are not only super fun (5 days sightseeing and partying in Canada for free... yes, please!) but also really pedagogically valuable. You gain a completely new understanding and appreciation of geological phenomena when you actually see them up close and can explore features and ask questions to many of the knowledgeable guides accompanying you. This was a fantastic experience all around, so if you are in G&G 110, definitely take this class too!",
    "A really good lab. Everyone is chill, you get to learn about rocks and kettles (that are really cool holes in the ground caused by glaciers that you can see in CT). Anyway, you learn cool stuff, it's not too much work and it only meets 7 times a semester, 3 of which are for field trips! Doesn't it sound awesome?",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in geology or any science. It's by far the best intro science lab I've taken, and you get to go on field trips!",
    "GG 111L is a painless prerequisite for the geology major. The field trip is excellent (if a lot of driving). The labs can generally be completed in class or with minimal work outside of class. I would recommend it to anyone taking Dynamic Earth.",
    "G&G 111L was a great introductory course on the field component of geology. Instead of spending all of our time in the lab room, we were encouraged to spend time outside to observe outcrops and architecture with specific rock types.",
    "good, easy lab. fun field trips and learn about geology.",
    "While the course taught interesting and essential material, it was poorly organized.",
    "Take this lab if you are taking the class- it is a no-brainer! It involves a truly awesome (and free) trip to Novia Scotia as well as several day trips around Southern CT looking at outcroppings and rock formations. The lab work is equal to .5 credits as it says. Nicely complements the work in G&G110.",
    "Take itGreat course for identifying basic minerals",
    "This was my favorite class this semester. It truly supports all of the information learned in the lecture. The two were reciprocal in supporting each other and the field trips on this class were fun and educational.",
    "Learning the basics of geologic field work (identifying minerals, reading stratigraphy, using topographical maps, etc.). Assignments every other week.",
    "Fun,could get stretched out at times, as you look at yet another, rock. It is great though to get out there with the worlds best geologists and see first hand the story the rocks tell. Fossils, deformation, continent building, magmatism, you name it. If you're going to take 110 def take this course. The big field trip was great! The labs could be a little confusing, as you're expected to notice patterns in rocks that could be a little over your paygrade. The most important lab is the first one where you learn about minerals. You will absolutely need that for everything you will do later in the course. Pay Attention!!! Dave is fun."
