   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if they do not want to put in the extra work for the physical chemistry with physics applications. The class is not terribly difficult, however, it is hard to say what new concepts were learned. It almost seems like a solidification of concepts learned in general chemistry.",
    "I don't think that this class is extremely difficult. If you are worried about physical chemistry, this seems like a much easier alternative to the other P-chem class.",
    "CHEM 328 is probably required for you if you're an MB&B major. Take it because it's pretty easy, but it's not very fun.",
    "If you're an MB&B major just looking to get your p-chem requirement out of the way, go for this over Cross' class. You get force-fed a bunch of equations that you have to manipulate to spit out answers on tests, but if you know algebra and calculus, it's completely doable. Very stressless. Elsa is really friendly and nice, but she subscribes to the classic Yale science professor technique of deriving equations on the board for every minute of class.",
    "I thought it was a pretty good class. I found the workload lighter than biochem (either semester). I didn't have to spend more than two or three nights studying for the midterm, and the shortened reading period was surprisingly long enough to thoroughly go over all the material. That being said, you will hear A LOT of complaints from p-chem students about how difficult the class is. Don't let that psych you out ... as long as you pay attention in class, go to section, and make sure you don't leave the 3 p-sets for the night before they're due, you will do well in the class. Don't worry so much about understanding everything in the textbook either. The material is not presented in the best way, although the summaries at the end of each chapter are valuable for making your exam formula sheets.",
    "If you're looking at CHEM 328, it's probably because you need to take it for the MB&B major. It wasn't my favorite class, but it wasn't my least favorite. Every now and then it felt like I was just copying equations down for the entire class. The sections were enjoyable though.Format: three homework assignments, three midterms (with the lowest one dropped), and one final exam.",
    "A lot of it is gen chem. If you need to take it for MB&B, take it, but you won't learn a ton. It's not a lot of work, and grading is not bad. If you want to learn more, you may want to take the other pchem option.",
    "Physical chemistry at Yale is notorious for being poorly taught and difficult. That being said, I think that Professor Yan (and the TAs for this class) does a pretty good job at driving the important concepts home and doesn't deserve the bad rep that she has. The class was interesting and difficult. Reading the textbook really helped solidify my understand and reading it is definitely integral to the class. She brought in some cool biological science applications towards the end (though I wish she had done more), and the class taught p-chem that I really think I could see myself using as a biochemist. The derivations were helpful, but not so detailed that I had to be a physical chemist or a physicist to understand- which was good, because I'm a biochemist. Either way, as an MB&B major you must take p-chem- this choice seems to be much morerelevant.",
    "You're taking this because you have to. Just read the book and practice. And go to section.",
    "Structure of the class (3 problem sets and 3 midterms for the semester) made the workload manageable, as it was spaced out pretty evenly over the weeks. Having problem sets due the week before the exam forces you to study earlier, which helps. The material wasn't my favorite thing in the world (kinetics, thermodynamics, etc.), but I gained a better appreciation for it after the course. The exams were pretty fair overall. The lectures were not very good, with lots of unnecessary derivations that no one will ever remember rather than an in-depth look at concepts and examples, which would have been more useful. Zhuguang is an amazing TA; go to him if he is still teaching the section. At the end of the day, you probably are taking this course because you have to. I wouldn't call it a *good* class, but there are worse ones out there.",
    "There are only 3 problem sets in the semester, along with 3 midterms and a final. You need to keep up with your study throughout the semester, or else you'll have a hard time right before the problem sets and midterms.",
    "The professor and TA's are nice, but they aren't great teachers. You'll spend most of the class teaching lecture notes to yourself, and the textbook really sucks. Make sure you find a good study group if you want to do well. The psets are very time-consuming, but neither the psets nor tests are impossibly hard. For a required class it wasn't terrible, but it definitely wasn't stimulating either.",
    "This course is, I think, a better way to complete the MB&B pchem requirement, don't take it for any other reason!!!! It wasn't a terrible class, but very uninspiring and confusing at times. The material never got too complex, which was appreciated in a physical chemistry class, but don't expect to get any help if you don't understand, you won't get it. All the amount of material and the degree of similarity of the topics make things confusing. Best of luck.",
    "You have to take it eventually.",
    "For students who need either this or CHEM 323, I would suggest that you take this one if you want more biological relevance and better TAs.",
    "Chem 328 is a difficult introduction to physical chemistry. Yet, it is also rewarding -- you begin to gain confidence in material that you only read or heard about before. Concepts such as the kinetic energy of a mole of particles and how it only depends on temperature will begin to become not just clear, but sensical, natural, easy.I would recommend this course to another student under the stipulation that they are willing to work very hard and are willing to teach some of the material to his or herself.",
    "You'll be taking this class because you have to. If you don't have to, I wouldn't suggest it, but it is easier than the physical sciences one.",
    "It's a required course for MB&B majors, but I actually enjoyed it. It is hard, but I have found other classes to be more challenging, like Organic Chem and Multivariable Calculus. If you understand the concepts introduced, I really don't see how you could have a problem doing well in PChem. Only one thing: the p sets are quite long, so start early (ie not the night before).",
    "The book is really helpful in my opinion and the tests are an accurate reflection of the problem sets. I enjoyed this class, for me the applications helped me understand the concepts.",
    "A surprisingly fun class and a good way to meet fellow MB&B majors",
    "Primarily covers thermodynamics and kinetics, as well as colligative properties and equilibrium constants. It is pretty fast-paced and difficult, but manageable if you spend a lot of time studying. The material covered is useful for people interested in biochemistry.",
    "I really, really disliked this class. One of my least favorite science classes yet.If you're considering this course then you're an MB&B major, and also have the option of taking the one for the physical sciences. I remember considering all of the tradeoffs at the beginning of the semester. Elsa's is later in the day, but it isn't taught as well. Elsa's is more interesting\/applicable material, but it isn't taught as thoroughly. Elsa's has fewer problem sets, but they are more spread out and longer, so they are less effective at helping you learn the material. Cross is ancient and rambling, but Elsa is often clueless when it comes to answering questions.So here's my $0.02: you will get a stronger foundation in the other class. You will stay more on top of your work. You will understand the material better. And it will be less painful, aside from being earlier in the morning.The *one* upside to this class is that it was one of the first times that I got to really see all of my major in one room and actually interact with them and\/or commiserate. You would have to commiserate with a mix of MB&B and CHEM majors if you took the other class."
