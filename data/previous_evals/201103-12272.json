   "comments": [
    "This is a great course--pretty chill, without a lot of homework. This class really allows you to be creative without requiring any drawing skills, so if you're someone who likes to make things, this is the class for you! I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I mean it's a requirement for the Art major so I guess that's the reason to take it. Outside of that probably not though I did get good things out of it.",
    "A lot of fun, decent amount of work",
    "Visual Thinking includes a series of projects, many of which are collaborative. It changes for each class, but for ours we did photo manipulations, tessellated shape patterns, sculptures based on other students' drawings of sculptures from the art gallery, a non-objective two-minute film, a three-minute genre horror film, photographs of an image in different contexts, and a soft sculpture of a hard sculpture (metal, etc.) from the art gallery, with photographs of the original in the gallery and the soft version in a new context. The films were both collaborative. For many of the projects, we looked at approaches to the medium throughout history before starting. I would recommend the course, and I would suggest that art majors try to take it early on, as I think it will continue to inform their approach to other art courses and the artistic process in general.",
    "Art 111 is very out of the box types of art. You work with shapes and colors a lot and that is not necessarily very appealing to me. Although a lot of the art projects we tackled were what many would call juvenile, it made it almost that much harder. I would not recommend Art 111 to another student because I didn't enjoy or take much interest in any of the projects.",
    "Take it for the art major - if you're not an intended major, good luck getting in. The class is definitely a very broad intro class that covers many different interesting approaches to art. Would recommend to anyone!",
    "I would recommend it with Anna Betbeze if you have to take it for the major. makes you think about art through directions you may not have explored before, but it isn't overall incredibly stimulating.",
    "A survey class on how to think visually through a variety of different media.",
    "Visual Thinking is what you make of it. If you use it as a course to explore areas of artmaking you haven't tried before, and to experiment in ways you might not have before, it can be an incredible experience."
