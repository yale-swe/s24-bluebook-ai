   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this lab if you need to fulfill a bio lab requirement and do it in a lab that actually does real work and will teach you useful techniques. The second half was a lot smaller than the first half, so the class size was small and nice.",
    "Pretty good bio lab course even though it takes a lot of time. The presentation at the end seems scary, but it's not as bad as writing a lab report.",
    "Definitely take Nucleic Acids. It's way more interesting than other labs, you get more credit and the work load is a lot less than it is in other labs. You need to email really early to get into the class (it fills mid spring) so do it now, you can always take yourself off the list later if you decide you want to.",
    "We learned about an interesting new form of sequencing. What's great about this class and the preceding one, is how you learn both biology and skills but have less work all around than any other lab I've taken. The second half is less work than the first. The final paper presentation is a good exercise in scientific literacy and presentations.",
    "Half a semester course during which you work on a 454 Sequencing project. The course involves weekly problem sets, submission of a lab book, and a final presentation on a paper topic related to high-throughput sequencing. Enjoyable for a lab course and interesting, although we didn't find out our results during the course because not everything worked the way it was supposed to. Such is science.",
    "Great lab! Makes sense to continue after 342 unless the workload for the first half of the term was unbearable.Easier than 342 in that the final part of our grade was a presentation (powerpoint covering an article we prepared over Thanksgiving break).",
    "Highly recommended",
    "Best lab at Yale as far as I'm concerned, professor is great, workload fair, interesting, real project. In class can be slow at times, but that is the nature of research."
