    "This was an excellent overview course of the development and continuing legacies of Atlantic slavery. Historical inquiry, engagement with primary sources, and independent research were all part of the course.",
    "This course provided a surprisingly in-depth overview of the history of racial slavery in the Atlantic world. I left with more knowledge of the slave trade and of the institution of slavery in many countries that I had never studied in school before.",
    "I learned about the history of racial slavery in the Americas from the 15th century to the end of the 19th century. It's a fascinating, though disturbing history and the course was excellent.",
    "I developed good paper writing skills And learned a TON about trans atlantic slavery and its origins. Really interesting especially regarding to current day race relations",
    "A crucial understanding of the history that has led to the egregious racial inequities of today.",
    "This survey course provided a a full history of atlantic slavery throughout its existence and across the world.",
    "I learned of the true agony slaves endured under slavery and even after freedom -- a cruelty that we do not often hear about in its entirety in typical high school American history classes.",
    "I learned a lot of dates and people that shaped the Atlantic slave trade and the abolition of slavery over the course of a few centuries. It was really intriguing to learn how different areas and colonies developed and responded to change, population type, etc.",
    "You learn the history of slavery",
    "I learned how to analyze past history to connect it to current events today",
    "I gained more general information about slavery in the Americas. I was particularly interested in the slavery outside of the US as I had never learned about that in my secondary school studies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was excellent. The only thing I would have added is more discussion on lecture content. The discussion section was devoted to outside readings, not the lecture content.",
    "The lectures were very engaging, though they sometimes moved quickly. Perhaps this class should be extended to 75 minutes so that we have more time to cover the material. Discussion section was somewhat pointless, because we would read texts sometimes several hundred pages worth and write ungraded responses. We did not take in- depth looks into the texts or the arguments of the authors and we were not tested on the material. Personally, I think section could be modified or eliminated entirely from this course-- it is not necessarily engaging.",
    "With most courses at Yale, the narratives of individuals are taught in very abstract terms. I understand that there are close to no primary documents on the people who were enslaved, but it would be interesting to tie the course down to these stories.",
    "The final assessments for the course seem excessive. Reformatting that would be my main recommendation.",
    "Strengths is the subject Professor Rugemer is an excellent lecturer and speaks at the perfect pace (super slowly, almost like a preacher or storyteller) Weaknesses was definitely the spacing of the major assignments, basically the fac tthat the paper and final were within days of eachother. If they do this again, I suggest that the final have fewer terms to memorize.",
    "This class is a really good lecture course - you learn a lot about an era that is seldom taught at Yale. Lectures are really engaging. The readings are long and boring though, but you don't really have to do them except to write weekly blog posts. Having a paper and final in the same week is kind of ridiculous, the paper should be due earlier in the semester or should be longer and replace the final exam. In general a good history class with a decent workload..",
    "Sometimes the lectures were a little hard to follow. Especially from one lecture to another.",
    "The instructor, Edward Rugemer, is brilliant, well-spoken, and an amazing lecturer. I loved going to class. There's only improvement I might suggest: Professor Rugemer mentioned to us that, in past years, the essay for the final exam had been a take-home essay. This year, after he received student feedback saying that the essay should not be take-home, Professor Rugemer (very reasonably) elected to add it to the final exam. Professor Rugemer's reasoning makes complete sense to me. I think, though, that having the essay be take-home would allow students to provide a fuller response to both the essay and the identifications, which would remain on the exam. I had trouble finishing the exam within the time limit, so I think making the exam take-home again might help with that. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!",
    "The course is really good at giving a comprehensive overview, but a lot of the time lectures were delivered too quickly with too many details for me to actually process anything. It often felt like I was learning how to type rather than learning new information, and then I had to go back and review everything I'd written down after.",
    "The readings never seemed essential to read.",
    "I thought it was a great course, and the highlight was definitely Rugemer's lectures. He always structured them extremely well, and I came out of each one usually depressed about the world but also wanted to hear more. I did not feel that the readings always quite lived up to the lectures, but some of them were okay. Overall very interesting material that really made me think about the world.",
    "Students need more time to actually take in some of the facts we learn. I feel like sometimes we may just have facts given to us with not much time to actually process all of the knowledge we learn. Other than that, this was my favorite class of the semester and I learned so much valuable information! The professor was very interactive!",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures for this course and how they contributed to a cohesive narrative. The assignments were manageable and generally it was a good lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. It was by far the best class I have taken at Yale thus far. Professor Rugemer is an incredible lecturer and a true historian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in a comparative study of slavery throughout the Atlantic world. It also provides insights into regions not commonly taught in the American high school system.",
    "If you're interested in the history of American racial slavery, this course is excellent. Professor Rugemer is a great lecturer, and I learned a lot.",
    "Much recommended course. Rugemer is a fantastic lecturer. You will leave this course feeling as though you learned a lot.",
    "Yes. Good course but end of term is difficult and sections are probably awkward if you aren't black.",
    "Not unless you gotta",
    "Yes, an invaluable lesson in a history too often glossed over.",
    "Definitely would recommend this class to a student as a good history lecture class. It has a pretty average workload, you definitely have to work but it won't kill you. Interesting lectures with an engaging professor. Readings were mostly boring and not essential but that is the case with most history classes. Midterm, final, 10 page paper and weekly blog posts for section. Having the abstract and rough draft are kind of annoying at the time but actually help out a lot for the final paper and as a grade booster.",
    "Absolutely. The knowledge a student gains in this course is vital to an understanding of American history as a whole as well as the American political situation today.",
    "I would recommend the course, but only if the student is really good at memorization and organization of dates and figures, rather than really complex thinking.",
    "For fulfilling requirements, the class is fine",
    "Yes, absolutely. Rugemer is a great professor, and I always found lecture to be fascinating. I don't have a huge amount of exposure to the material (I am in STEM), so it might feel less fresh to some people who have already taken a number of similar classes, but I found it consistently new and interesting, and I really loved the new instincts that I got about the world from it. A \"must-take\" kind of class!",
    "Yes!! This course should definitely be taken by more Yalies. It discusses topics that many are ignorant about!",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Proessor Rugemer is a great lecturer and the readings are interesting (but you don't even really need to do them to do well in the class). The workload is very manageable--just a midterm, an 8-10 page paper, and a final. And it's a great way for Am Stud majors to fulfill their pre-civil war requirement."
