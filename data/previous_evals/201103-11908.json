    "I think it's a good introductory class. I'd recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid of being veryconfused for a good amount of time.",
    "It is a great class with a manageable course load. For the most part there are two readings and a problem set a week. In section, the homework is reviewed and passed back to you. Once you understand the basic works of the class it is very enjoyable. Lots of diagramming and sentence analysis!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Definitely shop it, because the teaching style might not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Go to section if you get confused, do the readings, and you'll learn a lot without ever having to freak out about work.",
    "Linguistics 117 is great for someone that wants an overview of many aspects of linguistics and peaks into its crossovers into cog. sci., psychology, and neurolinguistics. I recommend it for anyone contemplating further interest in linguistics. There is not a super in-depth dive into any one aspect of the discipline, so even if a certain topic doesn't perk your ears up, they next topic may."
