    "Yes! Must take. Really changes the way you think about things.",
    "One of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. The two hours fly by before you know it. This material is interesting and important: you're reading and critiquing experimental papers, not 40-page academic tomes. Professor Ahn is a pedagogical genius -- her methods are unique and will really make the material stick. The amount of time and effort she puts into her students is insane. Not to mention she's hilarious, brilliant, and unbelievably sweet and helpful. I honestly can't recommend this course enough. Apply early!",
    "Yes, take this class! You'll learn cool things about how we think. Professor Ahn is very organized and is an engaging lecturer, plus she generally chooses very well-written and interesting articles for you to read. Be prepared to spend a good deal of time writing and editing your answers to discussion questions each week.",
    "Syllabus is deceptive--looks like it will be an easy class. I stuck it out because I thought it was the best option for an interesting class with a good grade. While parts were interesting, most of the material was review, and good grades on assignments were very hard to get. It was fine, but I think other reviews were overrated.",
    "This is a great senior seminar class, especially if you're not expecting to actually go into the Psych field. You touch on a wide range of topics and apply them to your day-to-day thinking, which is nice. Work is reasonable and grading is fair, if a bit tough, but Professor Ahn is great to work with.",
    "Definitely take it. One of the better senior seminars.",
    "This is the BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. It's literally perfect. Every single class at Yale should take notes on how Professor Ahn runs this class. Seriously. If you can get in, count your lucky stars and take the course. Email Professor Ahn well before the start of shopping period to be put on the list especially if you aren't a Psych student who can preregister. Professor Ahn is the absolute best. She cares so much about her course, and really puts in a lot of thought into the structure of the course, the selection of the readings, and each assignment she gives us. The level of discussion is the best I've ever had at Yale, because everyone is forced to do the readings and has been forced to think about it critically, so people actually have interesting things to say. She makes you want to do well in the course and so you do. JUST TAKE THIS CLASS TRY YOUR BEST TO TAKE IT!!",
    "PSYC 479 introduces you to big topics in psychology through psychological study papers and in-depth written and verbal discussion. It is highly engaging, and while it is a lot of work, it is very worthwhile when you begin to apply your learnings in everyday life.",
    "This is an awesome class and I would highly recommend it!! There's a reason so many people want to take it! First, Professor Ahn is awesome and is super funny. Second, class lectures and discussions always are really interesting. Third, it's an incredibly useful class. You will learn a lot about how people think and the different biases we have, but you also will learn how to critically analyze research papers. The weekly reading assignments are pretty tough, but you learn a lot from them and it's definitely worth the effort. Another nice thing about this class is that there are no exams, just weekly quizzes that you don't need to study for -- that makes the class pretty low-stress."
