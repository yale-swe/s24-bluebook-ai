   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you're committed to doing the reading. The class is absolutely pointless unless you've read all the plays, and it's quite a bit more work than I was expecting. But yes -- I would recommend it. Broaden the horizons.",
    "Prof. Robinson is eccentric, but it's a good class.",
    "You read 2-4 contemporary American drama plays (Albee, Shepard, Mamet, Fornes, Kennedy, Parks, Shawn, Kushner, Gray, Greenspan, Maxwell, etc.), discuss them in class, and write two papers on them. Chill, fun, and a fantastic reading class. Take it.",
    "Read and discuss works by comtemporary American playwrights, write 2 8-10 page papers.",
    "The course provided a close reading of works written for the American Stage that have been published in the past 20 years. The opportunity to study the playwrights who shaped and continue to change the way that theater is made and performed in our country was extraordinary, and the syllabus allowed for a variety of writing styles and dramatic material to be examined. Two 8-10 page papers, on a topic of your choice, are required for completion of the course.I loved this class - Professor Robinson is a wonderful teacher, and his close attention to the interests and artistic styles of each student allowed for some incredible banter and created a wonderful environment in which to take class. His lectures were always interesting, and provided enormous amounts of additional dramaturgical material from which we could learn.I have only taken this one class with Professor Robinson, but Contemporary American Drama became one of my favorite classes I have taken in years at Yale. A great find!",
    "Great class. You get to read a lot of plays, but the work load is really not bad at all. Prof. Robinson is a great and energetic professor, and he knows his stuff. You can essentially steer the conversation wherever you'd like it to go.That all being said, do the reading. It's short and enjoyable, and you'll be happy to be a part of the conversations.",
    "it introduces you to some plays\/writers that you might not be familiar with- take it! professor robinson is really sweet and fun in class",
    "THST 365 is a survey of contemporary American drama - plays from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? through Suzan-Lori Parks. This class is a great excuse to read some plays you might otherwise not find time to read.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class. If you have any interest in theater, or even if you don't, you will become a better person for having read and thought about these plays. It's one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale."
