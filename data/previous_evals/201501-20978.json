    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. It's very clear that Professor Lee puts in a tremendous amount of effort into his teaching to make it as easy as possible for the students to learn. The topics covered in the class can be very challenging and are all interrelated, however, the payoff at the end of the class, when it finally all comes together, is worth it! The class is quite a bit of work, but you come out the other end knowing a lot more!",
    "I will strongly recommend this course to those who are interested in this topic.",
    "This course highlighted the basics of photovoltaic solar cell technology. From derivation of solid-state physics, to laboratory experiments measuring J-V curves and efficiency, to presentation on state-of-the-art approaches in 3rd generation solar cells, this course had a little for everyone. The n-p junction was extensively covered and the ideal diode equations were related to current research in the lab. I would recommend the course to other students.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student especially in the area of microelectronics."

   "comments": [
    "Solar is my discipline, so clearly it was very beneficial and related. This course was able to summarize and pull together a lot of the concepts that I deal with day-to-day in an easier to digest manner. This course also was able to give me the equations\/physics background on some topics that I work with on a daily basis that I did not previously know.",
    "This course was very helpful as I did not have much prior experience working with solar cells or photovoltaic devices. This course helped me understand the physics behind what many of my classmates are doing; it might contribute to my dissertation.",
    "The course helped me strengthen my concepts of device physics particularly p-n diode."
