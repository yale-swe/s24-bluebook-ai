    "TAKE IT.",
    "A pretty good class. Not enthralling, because it follows the textbook (Taylor) almost exactly, but Professor Poland is very clear. Toward the beginning of the course, and again in the last couple of weeks (with special relativity), there was a lot of overlap with Phys 260. Mechanics is kind of a boring subject -- can't be helped. The unit on chaos, though, was really interesting. This should be more of a thing. Also, a decent number of the homework problems require the use of Mathematica or some other programming language. I think the course could be improved if there were more emphasis on programming in homework problems. Programming is the most useful thing I've learned in physics classes at Yale.",
    "Interesting course, but study more than you think you need to.",
    "I took this course in order to be able to take Quantum, but I would not recommend it if you don't need it.",
    "Not a bad class, but not all that exciting either. Highlights: Calculus of Variations, Lagrangian Formulation, Two Body Problem, Special Relativity (the last lecture was pretty amazing) Low-lights: The Hamiltonian Formulation feels like a nuisance. Not an \"interactive\" physics class. You pretty much just watch Poland go through Taylor. There's not enough time to do the tests properly in my opinion. I tested really poorly. If you haven't taken differential equations, you'll still be fine. Just recognize your oscillators and you should be good.",
    "Professor Poland is a great teacher. Engaging and clear in his lectures, he is also willing to make time outside of class to help you understand the material or prepare for exams. Certainly a tough class, but I came out of it feeling glad that I took it (and continued with it after the midterm).",
    "Classical Mechanics is a great course. We covered most of the material in Taylor at a pretty satisfying level of detail. Professor Poland lectures from the book, but he succeeds in enlivening what is already a good presentation -- he bounces around frenetically (even anxiously) at the board, giving clear and energetic lectures, and occasionally connecting mechanics concepts to their use in quantum mechanics or field theory (his area of expertise). He's very kind, and seems to legitimately care about the class's learning and interest in the material. Homework consists of about 6-10 of the more interesting problems from Taylor, and are just about perfect for learning the material well; most of the problem sets took me about 8 hours to do. Tests were pretty difficult -- much harder than last year's exams -- but nonetheless fair. Poland is looking to challenge you, not destroy your GPA: grading was very fair, and he even gave us an interesting extra credit problem set that we could do if we weren't happy with our midterm score.",
    "A second course in classical mechanics; definitely take it if you enjoy physics. Poland is an excellent lecturer and his tests are very fair. The problem sets were pretty reasonable and took about 5 hours every week, though the material got much more challenging after the midterm.",
    "Absolutely, PHYS 410 is a phenomenal course without a doubt my favorite class this semester. If you want to see classical mechanics presented at a sophisticated level and are up for a (manageable) challenge, I would recommend this class without hesitation. We began with a quick review of the classical mechanics we had already seen to make sure we were all on the same page and then spent the rest of the semester on new and more advanced topics, including the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, two-body orbits, rotating reference frames (Coriolis and centrifugal forces), general rotations of rigid bodies (the moment of inertia tensor, Eulers equations, Euler angles, precession and nutation), coupled oscillators and normal modes, chaos, and special relativity. The class was challenging but reasonable, and I found the problem sets to be very comprehensive and extremely effective in reinforcing the material. Professor Poland is moreover an outstanding professor, and I would highly recommend taking the class if he is teaching it. As a lecturer, he was always extremely clear and organized, and I really appreciated his careful derivations and explanations of the principles, justification, and logic behind all of the physics we covered, as well as his efforts to contextualize the concepts we discussed in class within the larger framework of physics as a whole, always making sure to point out the relevant connections with quantum mechanics and other fields. He is also extremely approachable, willing and eager to help students and answer questions. Exceptional class and exceptional professor enough said.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to advanced topics in classical mechanics, especially Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, rotations, and coupled oscillations. The course structure tends to follow the textbook (Taylor) exactly, but Poland is a very engaging lecturer. A must-take for all physics majors, and recommended for math majors.",
    "Physics 410 is a continuation of classical mechanics. It covers the middle chapters of Taylor and moves at a relatively quick pace. Poland is a good lecturer, though his tests can be hard. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in physics who has a decent back ground in math.",
    "I'm going to be converting to a religion, because only an act of God could have saved my grade from a C. Excellent course, and I learned a lot, but I got screwed on the midterm and final. On the midterm I was stuck literally the entire time on trying to figure out what the equation is for a line on the surface on the cone (which screwed over the rest of the problem for me, despite me knowing what to do). As for the final, I did not have a solution to a single problem. It came nowhere close to the psets.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who likes Physics and wants to learn a more rigourous\/interesting version of Classical Mechanics. The class is challenging but rewarding, and although the exams are tough, the grading is fair. Seriously take if you are at all interested and have a little math\/physics background. If you want to learn when a book will wobble when you toss it in the air, take this class!!!",
    "Not as heavy a workload as the intro courses that you've taken, and much less tiresome than them as well. For anyone who has had even a childhood interest in physics, and intends to major in science\/engineering or even mathematics, this is a recommended course.",
    "Professor Poland is great. Course covers a lot of material and gets a little more difficult after the midterm. You will learn many physics.",
    "Take the class, you learn some cool new stuff.",
    "Basic class for physics or applied physics that is also useful for learning mathematica. Poland is an enthusiastic teacher who makes lecture interesting.",
    "Difficult review and extension of classical mechanics. Great course. Problem sets took around 10 hours a week on average. Tests were way too long though, be prepared to work really fast even if you know the material well.",
    "Loved it! One of my favorite classes I've ever taken. Take it even if you're not a physics major!",
    "Solid overview of mechanics, with more mathematical background. There were many satisfying moments of giving theoretical justification for classical phenomena - for example, top precession. Homework and tests pretty manageable and fair. Lecture with David Poland is easy to follow, and generally useful and even fun to go to. I would recommend any students with a strong high school physics background (at least physics C and maybe a little more mechanics beyond that) and mathematically confident to try this as a first physics course rather than 260.",
    "Good (but very hard) course of classical mechanics. Professor Poland is a very dedicated professor and I don't think the department could find a better professor to teach 410. As far as teaching and dedication from the professor is regarded, I believe that Professor Poland suits the course very well. It'd be helpful if we went over examples similar to the psets in class and if the exams were similar to the psets too. The review sessions before the exams weren't of help at all. So the only issue we had was lack of consistency of psets in relation to the exams, besides the exams being too long, which made everyone in the class very nervous. The first half of the course covers all of the classical mechanics we had in PHYS 260 with few exceptions. But don't be fooled, because the second half was way too dense, very difficult, and everyone was helpless\/hopeless studying for the final. Grading is fair if compared to the difficulty of the class, so we can't complain about it. Psets take forever to be solved, but they are worth 40% of the grade (which is fair, since it's the psets that make you learn the most), so we can't complain about it either. Lectures are good and Poland is a funny professor somehow.",
    "A great class. I'm a computer science major and I never felt left behind at all.",
    "PHYS 410 is the first in the sequence of physics classes required for the intensive physics major. You can either take the 401\/402 track, which aligns with the general physics major track, or the 410\/420\/430 track, which aligns with the intensive track. As an astrophysics major who took 260 last year, I had my pick of the two, and am happy that I chose the 410 class. PHYS 410 covers exhaustively topics integral to classical mechanics - namely Newtonian mechanics, Lagrangian\/Hamiltonian mechanics, and then non-simple oscillation. I felt that the class went into great depth with mechanics, greater depth than 401 would have. The class was certainly difficult, but the concepts were accessible with enough studying. I though the difficulty of the class ultimately made it rewarding, and recommend it to anyone with an interest in physics and a strong grasp of elementary concepts.",
    "Awesome sauce!",
    "Absolutely. Prof. Poland is a great teacher, and the material is fairly interesting. The first week or two are a bit of a review, especially if you took 260, but it picks up after that. Psets are definitely manageable. The course occasionally uses linear algebra in class and on a couple psets, but even if you haven't taken it, you could probably get by with looking it up online\/going to office hours."
