   "comments": [
    "Since you have to take a research methods class for the psych major, I would definitely recommend this one. You really learn how to write a research paper over the whole semester - take it if only for that one reason. Professor Gruber is really sweet, and the subject material is mostly very interesting.",
    "TAKE THIS for your research methods class. It is impossible to get behind on your work because there are weekly deadlines, and you will be so thankful for this at the end of the semester. The research paper is made to be SO manageable, but you also learn a ton.",
    "I wasn't looking forward to taking this class but I ended up really liking it. Your big 20 pg research paper due at the end basically writes itself over the semester because you do one part each week, which is so much better than sitting down to write an entire paper yourself. June is great, energetic and very invested in the topic and the group projects. For psych majors, I would definitely take this class for your research methods requirement.",
    "If you have to take research methods this one is probably the best because you write a section of the paper each week and get feedback. You aren't stuck with a 20 page paper at the end. The class itself though is not amazing and the labs are totally pointless.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS COURSE. BEST CLASS I HAD THIS SEMESTER -- and I was NOT expecting that, seeing as it was required for the Psych major. Prof. Gruber was an absolute joy. Basically, in this course you split into groups of 4 and you have to write a 25-page paper based on a research question and data analysis you perform as a group (papers are written individually). This is literally the only work you have for the course. And, best part is, you are working on the paper throughout the semester, handing in about 2-5 pages every week, so you're absolutely done with the paper before thanksgiving break.TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT",
    "Great class - you get to discuss happiness and its psychophysiological correlates in class with two wonderful instructors. The paper is a lot of work, but it's split up throughout the semester and you receive a lot of guidance and feedback. With all this support, I felt satisfied that I was submitting the best piece of writing I could produce. The group project that you are writing about is challenging, but it's rewarding to work and collaborate with other very driven members of the class to develop a hypothesis driven scientific project.",
    "The biggest pro is having your final paper 90% done by finals week. The lectures are somewhat tangential but interesting at times. If you can endure the Gruber, then it'll be fine.",
    "Take it, especially if you are interested in learning about research in happiness, or if you are just looking for a research methods class for the major requirement. Most people detest research methods, but the final paper is broken up very well, so you're done with it by the end of the semester, when most people are starting to figure out how to begin theirs.",
    "PSYC 231 was an overall great experience for a research methods class. The material was interesting, and I would recommend this research methods course over all of those offered. Take this course!"
