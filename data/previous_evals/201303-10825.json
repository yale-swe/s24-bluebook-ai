    "Japanese is the best class I've taken so far at Yale. The sensee are wonderful, and every student gets personalized attention. I couldn't believe how quickly and how much I was learning.HOWEVER: only take it if you are absolutely willing to dedicate a huge amount of time to it. Homework is 1 to 2 hours a night AT LEAST, and gets much more difficult as the semester goes along. This will also lock you in for the spring semester.",
    "This class is great, this class is fun, this class is brutally difficult. If you can, consider taking this class Credit\/D\/Fail. It was one of my favorite classes this semester but also the most work and the most stress. The professors are all, without exception, completely adorable, and the class is small enough that everyone becomes friends rather quickly. The class is a ton of work, so make sure you have the time available to dedicate to this class. The class moves super fast and you learn a ton, so if you have the time and have any interest at all in Japanese language or culture then I definitely recommend this class!",
    "Japanese 110 is very intensive, as are many language classes at Yale, and you have to be prepared to do a considerable amount of work each night, as the class meets Monday-Friday. That being said, Japanese was my favorite class, mostly due to the fantastic teachers, all of who brought such great energy and enthusiasm to every class.",
    "I loved every single fellow student in my class. They all worked very hard and I believe I could learn faster thanks to them.However, when I visited an earlier session, the class dynamic was very different from my current one (11:35am). I am a bit worried about this for next semester...",
    "This is a fantastic class to take, especially if you're at all interested in the Japanese language. All of the instructors are fantastic, and even though the daily homework and CC checks might get a bit tiresome, it's not too bad of a homework load each night and the CCs really do help. The class is structured really nicely. I met some of my best friends in this class and learned way more than I thought I would.",
    "I took this class credit\/d which was definitely the right choice because it is A LOT of work. And I mean A LOT. I think you need to have a determined reason to learn Japanese to make it worth it. I did, so that made all the work worth it on the tough days. This is not an easy course.That said, if you want to learn Japanese, this course will get you there! And the Senseis are all just really great people that you will love working with, and they will work with you. I would recommend this course to anyone who sincerely wants to learn Japanese. Shop it, see what you think.",
    "This class is for all of those who wants to learn Japanese with an amazing teaching crew as long as group of people.",
    "I would most certainly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in eastern languages. I would warn this person of the high course load .",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course - the instruction, overall, was excellent, and it was one of the more challenging course I have taken over my time at Yale."
