   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class to build a base of what professors at a school like Yale are looking for in different types of essays. Although I thought I had a basic knowledge coming into the class of what a successful paper should look like, I was surprised at how many new techniques I was able to pick up on throughout the semester. The best part was all the critical revision and group workshopping. It was great reading other people's writing to get a better idea of what I should be writing like, and also observe different styles and how they're effective in their own ways.",
    "Pursuing happiness with professor Karas was a really good class. The readings that you have to do are typically not too long and can sometimes lead to very interesting discussions. The essays aren't too bad, and professor Karas is amazing about giving feedback and helping you out. He is always there to answer any concern about your paper which is something that our entire class appreciated. Note though, that the class can be pretty boring at times when you are learning the basic structure for a good essay (which most peopleat Yale have probably already done). Besides that, I thought it was a great class and I really felt as though my writing has improved this semester!",
    "I would recommend it. It's structured in a way that keeps you on top of things, but it isn't overbearing. I do think it makes a difference if you choose a topic you're very interested in versus something you're ambivalent about.",
    "This was an amazing class, which really helped me improve on my writing while simultaneously allowed me explore an interesting topic. The workshop-group process, where I had the opportunity to review my peer's papers helped me learn more about others' writing techniques, while also helping me learn to look at writing objectively. Every one of the readings that we did in this class was engaging and thought-provoking, and I felt that I truly learned a great deal not only about the process of writing, but about human nature and happiness as well. I would absolutely recommend this particular seminar to anyone who is in any way interested about philosophy or psychology and wants to improve their academic writing.",
    "I would summarize English 114 as being a great class in which to improve one's writing and truly focus on developing a personal writing style that one can use throughout college. would definitely recommend this class for a fellow student, as it was both very fun and highly educational.",
    "I would recommend it as a really great intro course",
    "It's a good introductory course for English, you will definitely learn a lot of different approaches to write a paper. I feel that this is more of a philosophy course, than an English one - it teaches you how to think - albeit it a vague way."
