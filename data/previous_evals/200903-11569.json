    "I don't feel comfortableputting my feelings on paper. Suffice to say that it would probably make my grandma pretty disappointed. To us a metaphor, how would you summarize getting open heart surgery without anesthetic?I would recommend this class to my roommate last year, as it would potentially cause him to drop out of Yale, which I would love. As good as that would be for the University, however, it probably isn't a strong endorsement of the class as a whole, and is intended as such.PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. PLEASE DON'T.",
    "It's a tough course. Don't procrastinate because it would suck slash it would probably be impossible to do the labs last minute.",
    "TAKE IT! YOU MUST SUFFER! BUT WITH NO PAIN NO GAIN! especially in chemistry......",
    "PChem lab is by far more work than any other lab I've taken. The lab reports are beastly...if you take this class and procrastinate, you will be pulling multiple all-nighters in a row. Make sure you understand that going in, and it might not be too bad. The TAs were pretty helpful and very willing to answer questions.",
    "This class has the worst reputation ever. You are probably going through, reading these reviews saying \"OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS FOR THE MAJOR!\"I would like to add to these horrific reviews that this class IS a lot of work. A lot. I turned in 167 pages over the course of the semester, and was miserable while writing them. Be prepared to work very hard and not sleep and drop all your other work for the 4-7 days leading up to when lab reports are due.That being said, I do feel like I learned a lot. Vaccaro is a very good teacher. Go ask him when you have questions, as he really genuinely wants students to learn.I would also like to say that this class should not deter you from being a chemistry or ChemE major. Yes, it sucks, but you will survive. And you will be glad you didn't change your major because you didn't want to take one silly class.",
    "I would recommend this course because I feel like I learned a lot with regards to laboratory techniques and physical chemistry over the course of the semester. However, if you are taking this course, realize that it will take all of your time for 3 weeks, each time a laboratory report is due.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. It was a lot of work. The work is not even rewarded as the reports are graded very harshly.",
    "This class is a lot of work. You meet twice a week: your lab day and then lectures on Friday afternoons. It's really not that bad. If you get some of the work started earlier then the labs are totally doable. The final test is long but doable. You can definitely study for it...and don't count on getting practice tests from people who took the test before you. Prof. Vaccaro makes sure you turn in your test.There isn't a designated length for reports: they don't have to be so many pages. However, you will be proud of those 40 page lab reports. You will walk in on your lab day with those crazed eyes of a student who has not seen the inside of his or her eyelids for several days. At the end of the semester you will brag to your fellow classmates about your total page count. YOU DONT NEED TO WRITE 200 PAGES....but you will probably get close. My page tally got up to 164. I did include lots of figures...If you're a chemistry or chem e major...you have to take this class. It's just one semester...plus... one of the labs literally involves watching water boil. That can't be too hard, now can it?Oh, with the manometers, watch out for \"plumes of nitrogen\" when you remove the stopper. If nitrogen spews out of your your chatt-dewar flask set up...forget it. The apparatus is screwed for the day.Be brave, young ones! This class will teach you the meaning of life, the universe, and NMRspectroscopy!",
    "This course is a pain, pure and simple. While the material learned is interesting and the conclusions of the experiments are cool (I can now personally say I determined the distance between two hydrogen atoms in a water molecule), this class is at least 2.5 the work of some of my other classes. The equipment in lab doesn't always work, although the TAs and Professors are very helpful in trying to resolve it. It also seems a lot of the data collection (such as in the calorimetry experiment) could be automated with no loss of understanding (using LoggerPro to measure the temperature at every half-minute would result in no loss of understanding in the calorimetry experiment, yet appreciate the busy schedules of students).The main issue with this class is that the reports are so long that anyone taking this class basically has to give up everything else in their lives. Furthermore, if you pour 40 hours into a lab report, it doesn't necessarily mean you will even get a good grade with the curve, especially since the criteria are a bit murky and the actual creation of the grading outline is left to the TAs. So, lots of work without any known payoff. If I spent forty hours on a paper for another class, I would most definitely get a good grade. The curve (why there is a curve in this class is beyond my understanding) prevents this from happening.This is your cross to bear if you take this course. You will work harder than you ever have, and the grades in your other classes will drop. Avoid this class if at all possible. For chem majors, you're outta luck. For pre-meds, do some independent lab work and take the inorganic lab. This class is not worth it.The only benefits from this class were: an abiding knowledge that I can work hard on anything for the rest of my life; a really deep abiding friendship with my friend with whom I did these lab reports.",
    "NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS. I would not wish any such pain upon another human being.This is the single worst class offered at Yale. I have never heard of another class being this difficult, both in the complexity of material and the massive amounts of work. I cannot possibly think of any way to make this class worse. Professor Vaccaro is without a doubt one of the worst professors at this school. He takes no time to explain the material, just assumes the students in this class magically know complex physical chemistry and calculus. This class is described as different than Physical Chemistry 332a, and it is very much that. The material you go over in lab has almost nothing to do with 332 and Vacarro either doesn't realize this or is just such a terrible teacher that he is not able to explain anything that we are doing in lab. We are supposed to spend 1-2 weeks (8-10 hours) on a lab about entirely new material and concepts and magically understand it all.Then you get to the lab reports. I probably wrote between 400 and 500 pages worth of material total for the 5 labs in this course. That is ridiculous, considering each page requires a lot of side calculations, manipulations and complex understanding of the material. I would guess that for this course it takes on average 1 hour to write 1 page. The fact that we are introduced to brand new material every two weeks, spend around 8 hours studying it, then are supposed to turn it into a 50+ analytical lab report is just one of the stupidest things I have ever hear of in my life. Another additional note, if you think about it, a lot of majors at this school have SENIOR THESIS projects that are only 20 pages. This class is absurd.One last note on the logistics\/organization of this class that make it horrible. The graded work consists of the 5 lab reports, 5 lab quizes at the beginning of a new lab, and a final exam. Not only is the volume of work for this class absurd, but it is probably the worst organized class on campus. You start off week 1 with a quiz on lab 1 (without the material of lab 1 being taught obviously). Lab 1 takes four weeks, so on the 5th week of lab you have your first lab report due. However, not only do you have your lab report due on this day, but you also have to study for a lab quiz on Lab #2. For the next three weeks, half the class does lab 2 while the other does lab 3, then the two groups switch. Since these two labs last for 3 weeks, on the fourth week you have lab reports due on Labs #2 and Lab #3 AND a quiz on Lab #4. Half the class does lab 4 while the other half does lab 5. Each lab takes 2 weeks, and then you switch and do the other lab. This gets you through Thanksgiving, then you have Labs #4 and #5 due after Thanksgiving break\/reading week -- so this ruins either your break or the week immediately after break. Regardless, the work is never ending for this course and whenever you have a lab report (which is supposed to be the most important thing we do in the class) due, you also have a lab quiz that day. Its just stupid.",
    "This is a very well run class. Professor Vaccaro gives great lectures, but be warned that the lab reports are a ton of work. While some of the work is not very rewarding, I learned a lot of physical chemistry and laboratory techniques.",
    "P-chem lab is very demanding lab course covering a selection of topics in physical chemistry along with an introduction to electronics. It meets twice weekly with a four hour (or sometimes five hour) lab section and an hour long Friday lab-lecture. The labs themselves, which usually last several weeks and are preceded by short quizzes, are not particularly difficult, though they often involve long stretches of mindless data gathering. However, the lab write-ups take enormous amounts of time and tend to fall in the range of 30-50 pages once finished. Since they are usually due in pairs, this means that you must start both as soon as you have data (you can even write the introduction beforehand) to avoid pulling all-nighters to finish them. I would also recommend bringing your computer to lab and typing the data directly into Excel to save time later. While the class does teach you some useful experimental techniques and how to analyze and report your data, I would not recommend it for anyone who is not required to take it. The time investment is far too high to make the class worthwhile unless it is a requirement of your major.",
    "This class is not as bad as everyone says as long as you have a good TA and take it with some friends for moral support. A warning is that the lab write ups do take forever (my shortest was around 40 pages, my longest was 55). When they say don't procrastinate, they mean don't procrastinate. I am not a procrastinator and I still had trouble finishing the reports on time. Having said that I really learned a lot, and I'm proud of all the work I did, so take it and don't be scared. But take it with a lighter course load in other classes if you can.",
    "It's a lot of work, but essential if you plan to do chemistry research. The methods and concepts of this course are the foundations of modern work in chemistry- from electronics to NMR. You have to take it if you're a chem major; I'd recommend it to a physics major as well, especially if you're looking for a lab course of exceptional quality compared to intro physics or chemistry laboratories.",
    "This is definitely a tough course...probably the hardest I've ever taken. My final lab report page count was 211 pages. Make sure you definitely don't procrastinate, as each report takes about 3 complete days to finish. I'd probably recommend only taking 4 credits or so when taking this course. That said, you learn a lot from it and Prof. Vaccaro is a great lecturer, and he always (except for the last lab) explains things clearly and you can always ask him for help.",
    "If you are like me, you took gen chem lab, you took orgo lab, and you did pretty well...most of your classmates and friends spent a lot of time griping and complaining about how much time lab took out of the week and how much work it was, but you didn't really mind being in lab and you didn't really think it was that much work....then comes P chem. and suddenly, you are griping and complaining just like everybody else. Because even though it is a full credit lab, you have to put in twice as much time into this class than you do for any of your other science classes. And it's painful. So, so painful.but you have to take it for your major, so you find a few friends and suck it up. Just as a warning, though - there's a whole lot of \"P\" in P chem. Don't be surprised when your chemistry lab turns out to be pure physics.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student only if an upper-level chemistry class is required simply due to the volume of work. Aside from that, the professor, the TAs, and the material are all very enjoyable and this almost compensates for the high volume of work.(101 pages; 14,150 words)",
    "Although this class is painful, it is much less so if one stays vigilant and starts lab reports on time. You will learn a lot whether you want to or not.",
    "A lot of work and a lot of reading really obscure information in lab packets but will improve your understanding of the goings on of physical chemistry (especially when taken in conjunction with the class). The best part of the course is the people you meet who are going through the same hell of having two 30-page lab reports due on the same day.",
    "This is a ferociously time consuming course. You will walk out of it well versed in equipment last seen in professional circles in 1957. You will be asked to write a program in Basic to perform a linear regression. Most of the data gathering in the later portions of the course could be performed by a computer without you being there. If you seek confirmation of the value of your time, look elsewhere. General consensus was that some of the lab reports were graded by trolls. Additionally, vitamin D supplements are a must, as you will not see the light of day while taking this class.All of this said, you will learn a great deal. Professor Vaccaro is a fine lecturer. If you don't understand a subject after he has presented it, you were probably asleep... in a different building. My teaching assistant was also exceedingly helpful.Finally, as a word of advice, find someone who knows how to use excel. The difference is spending 40 hours crunching data, or spending 10.",
    "This course is one of the hardest and most time consuming courses at Yale. Take it only if you are sure you are majoring in chemistry",
    "Unless you need this class for your chem or chem e major, DO NOT TAKE IT. RUN. The experiments that you do are pretty interesting, but the lab reports are just absolutely ridiculous. Over the course of the semester, I wrote somewhere in the ballpark of 180 pages for these reports, a page count shared by many of the other students. The work load is light, except for those three all-consuming weeks when lab reports are due, when you'll be spending ungodly amounts of time to get the reports done in time.",
