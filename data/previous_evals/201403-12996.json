    "Absolutely take this course if you can get in. I loved this course. I actually looked forward to attending the seminars every Tuesday (can't say that about all my classes...). The time just passes as we discussed our thoughts on the weekly readings, current events (ex. Ferguson), and experiences. David will help you leave the class wiser, with full of memories and stories you'll remember, a bunch of great books to recommend to your friends, and maybe a little humbler. David also hosts office hours on Monday nights at the Study (free food, drinks, and more stories). Most of the class showed up for the office hours. *I was a non-Global Affairs, non-GS student.",
    "This course was a wonderful opportunity to learn from some of the classic philosophers spanning from the Greek moral tradition, through the Judeo-Christian moral tradition, the enlightenment, and finally making it to modern-day cognitive science. Every week brought substantial reading - usually the classic work of our main philosopher for the week (Burke, for example, or St. Augustine) - but I think Professor Brooks did a wonderful job putting together the syllabus, and they are all works that I am happy that I have read and now have on my bookshelf. Class was a good mix of Professor Brooks covering material he planned to talk about as well as an emphasis on class discussion. Finally, Professor Brooks - in spite of obviously being a busy man - really care about making himself available for students, and office hours were a great way to engage outside of the classroom. Overall, I highly recommend taking it if you get in.",
    "This is a great course chiefly because of the content and teacher. It's basically a philosophy course, and a very pertinent one for Yale students, particularly seniors heading off into the real world and thinking about their values and priorities. It definitely touches students on a personal level, which is something not a lot of other courses can claim. Take it if you can get in - you won't regret. Brooks is brilliant, funny, and kind, and the workload is not only fairly light but also really interesting and enjoyable. Only downside is that this class definitely attracts some of the real gems on this campus and having to witness them putting on a show of humility for David Brooks was at times intolerable -- but try to move past it.",
    "Yes, take it!!! It's wonderful and more courses at Yale should be modeled after this one.",
    "Yes- take if you can get in. It was an incredible experience.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The texts and discussion prompt a considerable amount of inner reflection, a skill not always traced with much finesse at universities. It also tends to attract students who are keenly and sensitively self-reflective - which actually provides many opportunities for friendships. Some of my best friends were made in this class. Naturally, it also attracts some self-promoting sorts, but they are identifiable in the first thirty seconds and are strangely endearing in their own way.",
    "Yes and yes. This class was a necessary breath of air from the vocational character that seems to be creeping into many Yale courses. The discussions were lively and grounded in the readings and Prof. Brooks offered many insights from his personal life that really illuminated the texts that we read. A must take for any Yale student.",
    "Take Humility if you can! Other students' evaluations are true: it's sort of a gut class (not much graded work but a lot of thinking!) and it does make an excellent fifth class. However, it is more worthwhile than any other class I have taken at Yale. It is not useful for any specific major or career - it's useful for you as a person. I'm not an overly sentimental person and I normally wouldn't elect to take a class to talk about morals and opinions but this class is the perfect combination of historical and modern perspectives and applies to everyone's life. Professor Brooks is AMAZING and really takes the time to get to know his students. Monday night office hours were the highlight of my week. The YDN called it - the class is full of section assholes but it's also full of people who genuinely want to take the time to get to know each other and hear each others' opinions. This class is a must take before graduation!",
    "This is a great course. The readings were phenomenal and Brooks did a really good job of choosing an interesting selection of students to facilitate thoughtful discussion. Take this course very seriously, do all the readings, and use it as the wonderful opportunity for genuine self-reflection that it is. Probably a good course to take as a senior. Also, make sure to go to office hours, Brooks is incredibly generous with his time.",
    "Humility is an overall enjoyable course. I'm not too sure about other iterations of the class, but this semester's group was thoughtful and relatively enjoyable to be around. Brooks is a very nice man who leads good seminar discussion. Keep in mind the discussions are often superficial and generic--this is not a rigorous philosophy class, for better or worse, and you're not growing your analytical reasoning skills by taking it. The reading is fairly good though--Augustine, Montaigne(!), and some others. This class is enjoyable, and if shmoozing with Brooks is something your into, I guess you can do that too.",
    "Learn about the stuff that matters in the end. I know that some of my best moments at Yale are those late-night conversations about life, and the deep stuff that makes it up. Give those conversations structure and literature, and you have Humility. The class discussions are rewarding. The readings are rewarding. Even the process of writing the two papers (incredibly manageable workload by the way) is rewarding. Take it, lest you miss out on taking one of the best classes that Yale has to offer, in a subject that Yale tends to offer very little in academically."
