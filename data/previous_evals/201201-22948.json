    "Take it.",
    "If you want to read the books, then definitely take it. Professor Smith's section was great! 4 short papers and a final. Lots of reading.",
    "Enjoyable English course that allowed me to read a lot of authors that I had always wanted to read. The course is nicely grounded in ideas around history and art, allowing it to appeal to a diverse set of interests. Though the reading list is pretty long, discussions were enjoyable. Grading seemed fair and Prof Smith was very available for whatever we needed.",
    "English 127 is awesome - you get to read lots of great books and it is not boring to sit through. However, it is also not easy. Maybe this depends on the professor, but Caleb Smith is not an easy grader. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to get a straight B in though. The reading amount is pretty strenuous at points though.",
    "The class was OK as a whole. Reading was front-loaded, which made the beginning of the course rough but the end more manageable. Class discussions were insightful and the side-trips were enjoyable. There should be a process to discourage overqualified people from taking the course. Prof. Smith presented the material in a helpful, insightful way. His writing prompts were interesting, but often were comprised of no more than throw-away comments. His comments on papers were helpful in improving my writing, and he led discussions well.",
    "Great intro level lit class. Highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student so as to be culturally literate."
