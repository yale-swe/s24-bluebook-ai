    "Do not take this course. Do not take this course. Do not take this course. You might get an A; you might not -- MB&B 105 is not a guaranteed A. You might not have to do a whole lot of work; you might have to do plenty of work. But really, none of that matters, because, even if you're taking a class just to fulfill a distributional requirement, that class should be enjoyable. It should be something you aren't actively dreading, and, after a few lectures, you might come to dread MB&B 105. Many of the professors are good, but the mere fact that there are five of them screws things up royally. If you're looking for a Science credit, do yourself a favor. Find another class.",
    "Really good class, especially for those who aren't big science people. It seems like a lot considering it has 3 midterms, section, and a term paper, but it is all really manageable. Definitely worth taking if you need a science credit and don't want to go too in depth with the science.",
    "The class teaches you biology by looking at controversial issues like GMO food or stem cell research. The class consists of 2 50 min lecture and section. Readings are short and are interesting articles that deal with the social or moral implications of science. There are weekly assignments but they do not take long to complete. There are three exams that are science heavy. The exams are reasonable if you study for them using the powerpoints. There is also a 5-7 research paper. A good way to get your SC credit if you are a non-science major.",
    "If you need a science credit and want to do fairly minimal work for it, while still learning (mostly) interesting material, this is the ideal course for you. The workload includes three non-cumulative exams (the last one is before reading period) and one final paper, plus weekly reading responses (instead of problem sets). Ideal for humanities or social science-minded people with a slight interest in biology.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class to another student. Inconsistent teaching and testing methods. Misleading title of class. Any class with more than one professor who clearly do not coordinate with each other is destined for failure.",
    "Issues Approach was a manageable if not riveting science credit. The midterms focus more on biology than the \"issues,\" so you do end up having to study a fair amount of bio. Weekly assignments were simple, usually four or five very readable and interesting articles from non-science publications. Discussion in section was interesting, but lectures were often bogged down in the science side of things without making clear enough the relevance of topics to current events. Take it if you need a science credit and there's nothing more exciting, but also try and find something more exciting.",
    "This was an enjoyable course. The strengths were definitely the variety of lectures, and the amazing lecturers. I also loved the personal, historical anecdotes and details that came up in lecture. However, I feel that the course description was somewhat misleading. I expected to learn a systematic approach to considering ethical issues in science; however, the only opportunity we had to discuss the \"issues\" at all was about 20 minutes per week in section (the rest was devoted to science review), in which a few people dominated the discussion with their personal opinions. It would have been nice if we could have treated the ethical aspect of the topics in a deeper, more systematic way.",
    "I have no idea how I did in the class overall, but it wasn't that much work. The tests require a lot of studying and the weekly discussion papers can be quite annoying, but you learn a lot from them.",
    "I would definitely NOT recommend this class to another student. If you are looking for a science credit there are better options. This class was not at all what I thought it would be. We barely talk about the \"issues\" and we are only tested on the science. And the lecturers are not clear when talking and aren't engaging.",
    "Excellent survey course for non-majors",
    "I thougyt this was going to be a basic dcience class but it actually covered many advanced and difficult concepts. I learned a lot and am gratefulthat I took the course. Take this if you want to have a better understanding of current scientific issues in our world. It's truly fascinating.",
    "Great class if you know biology already, don't expect to be taught basic things.",
    "As a science credit, it is survivable. You will also likely learn something about politics and society. But do not expect this class to actually be an Issues Approach. It is a scientific approach to issues, rather.",
    "Great class for both science and non science majors",
    "I would, but I'd say it is a great class, but not all of the lectures are very interesting and engaging",
    "A great course and science credit for a non-science major.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class for people who have truly never taken biology before",
    "This is a good class if you want an SC credit with a small workload; however, don't be fooled, the tests are still fairly difficult and there is a paper that you have to put effort into to do well. Also, if you actually like\/are good at science, I would recommend choosing a different SC course, as this one barely skims the surface with scientific information and you'll be left wanting more.",
    "Take this for a science credit, not for any other reason. It's frustratingly boring at times and interesting at others, especially with the lectures that relate more to the \"issues.\" The tests are deceptively hard but the key to success is to just memorize the slides. The grade breakdown is favorable.",
    "Yes take it for an easy SC",
    "For everyone studying politics\/economics but needing to take a science credit, this is your course to go. Its material is fascinating and tied into the social issues it creates. The grading if fair. What more can you ask for in a science class?",
    "This class is a great way of understanding many different facets around contemporary scientific issues, and a great way of understanding the importance of biology in today's world. It's true that outside this class, humanities majors such as myself would never have grasped the significance of these questions and the importance of looking at them from different angles, so going through that course is a great way of remedying this lack of knowledge. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "This is a decently manageable science course that lets you learn from leading scientists about interesting bioethical dilemmas. it's a good use of the science req.",
    "If you have to get your science out of the way, sure, take this class. But it's by no means a good class. Poor. Though the material was interesting, the lectures were disorganized and difficult to follow.",
    "You learn interesting things but the way the multiple instructors and tests and set up seem disorganized.",
    "This class is not a gut! I took it with no background in science or bio and struggled with the course.",
    "Interesting material but the relationships between lecture, section, and the tests was not good.",
    "Good class and great learning experience into an insightful field. Not a gut class by workload so take something else if you just want an easy grade.",
    "Take this class if and only if you've taken AP Biology. The lectures are dull so it's a good science credit, but I didn't take biology in high school, so I was lost.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to future students.",
    "It's an interesting course on different ethical, political, and economic issues related to biology. The section discusses these issues whereas the class talks about the science and the issues. However the exams are based mainly on the science which can be challenging.",
    "Yes but I'd tell them it's more science heavy than advertised",
    "Definitely harder than expected but a good course to have if you want to learn about interesting topics in biology",
    "It's an easy science credit if you go to class. It's also worthwhile, the content is interesting. Pay attention and you'll be fine.",
    "You focus a lot more on the science than the actual issues, which surprised me, but I guess it's a science credit so you need to learn some science. The issues you talk about outside of class are interesting but the science is not. Fairly easy science sometimes, but you will have to study for the exams. There are 3 exams, not cumulative at least, but tricky.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student who was willing to put in the work to understand the science behind the issues.",
    "Only if you need the science credit..",
    "This course was fairly interesting in the readings, but the lectures themselves were mundane. The tests were really difficult and had nothing to do with what was covered in section and readings. Not an intro class. Don't take it if you don't like memorization and surprises.",
    "It is basically a less advanced biology course with some discussion of (and a term paper about) social issues related to biology. I would probably not recommend it because I expected much more ethics and less straight biology, but it was still an interesting class.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with a decent background in biology, but this is not a gut course.",
    "I would say that the tests are hard but they get easier and that this is a nice class for non science majors.",
    "This is basically AP bio with some extra cooler things. learning about Chrisper and the Zika virus was pretty cool but not enough to offset Bio exams. the discussions are just during section and not on the exams. oh and there also is a final paper on top of the three exams.",
    "I recommend this class for someone who doesn't want to be a science major but who wants to have a sense of what is going on when you hear about ethical and political issues surrounding advances in biological technology and medicine. It is not hard; they don't ask you to read much; and the tests are really quite reasonable if you go to lecture and read over the slides beforehand. However, it isn't a throwaway credit. Although I won't remember much of the hard science distinctly I expect, I got to hear from leading researchers in their fields about what's at stake in the intersection of biology, ethics, law, and politics. They dispelled some misconceptions I had; they made me aware of challenges and problems I didn't know about before; and they gave me a more informed background for discussing these issues elsewhere. Long story short, not the easiest class ever, but it's not hard, and I think the interesting subject matter makes it worth it.",
    "Yes; standard non-science, the exams can be a bit harder than you think."
