    "Not too stressful, and a very great course to investigate a topic of choice.",
    "you have to take it if you're an mb&b",
    "You have to take this class if you're an MB&B major, but don't be scared. Use this as an opportunity to really dive into a topic that interests you! The final paper isn't too long, and the presentation is generally pretty relaxed. Good chance to practice scientific writing and presentation skills. Great end to the major.",
    "This senior essay is not that bad, in that you can essentially pick whatever topic you find interesting that is related to the field. It is about a 15 page literature review. You are assigned one advisor that you can meet with on your own time. It's good that a rough draft is due long before the final one is due, and your advisor should give you detailed feedback. The presentations were nice in that you were able to hear the projects from the other students in your group as well as receive some additional feedback before you complete the final version of your essay.",
    "The requirement for the MB&B senior thesis depends on who you get as your adviser, so the most important thing is to talk to your adviser shortly after the introductory meeting and talk to him (or her) about what is expected of you. Basically you write a 15-page paper that is either a review of some field, or a proposal for a set of experiments, or a bit of both.",
    "It is a necessary course to take if you are an MBB major",
    "Embrace it. Enjoy it. Make the most of it. It is a truly unique MB&B experience.",
    "Yes, MB&B has the easiest senior thesis at Yale."
