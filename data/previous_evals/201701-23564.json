The professors were very knowledgeable, and were experts in what they do. Moreover, they were were very friendly, understanding and helpful.",
    "The Costa Rica field trip was incredible. I definitely learned more on the trip than I ever could have in the classroom. It would have been great to visit the greenhouse or the NYBG as well.",

    "The field trip was wonderful",
    "The field trip included three different ecosystem types on one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, which gave us a lot of experience with plants that will be useful anywhere. The material brought to class was amazing!"

   "comments": [
    "(1) Though the course in on Tropical Field Botany, it covers only neotropical regions. Students working in tropical Asia and Africa would have benefited more, if there was some focus to cover important plant families in the Old World as well. (2) The course is heavily on plant identification to family-level. Field botany is more than that, and it should involve lab sessions on field collection and storage of samples and field measurement of traits.",
    "I thought the course was excellent and my only suggestion would be to include a possible field trip to the NYBG or another mini-field trip.",
    "I know it is difficult to teach botany to a group who has very little experience, and time is limited, but I think it would have been helpful to learn some more natural history behind the different families. I think this would help associate the plant families with certain traits.",

   "comments": [
    "The lecture and the lab sections synced very well. I do not see how it can be further improved. One improvement could be the classroom (Marsh Rotunda), which is not suited for a lab (or lecture), with random people moving through the classroom, as the Rotunda is not designed to hold a class, and as it is the only space that connects the front door to the rest of the building. The classes could be in the Peabody Museum building with increased and easy access to the collection.",
    "I thought the mix between lecture and lab was perfect. Each class was about an hour of lecture and then 2 hours of actually looking at plant features. Could not have been done any better.",
    "I appreciated having the lectures and then immediately looking at all the plant samples afterward.",
    "yes."

No one is going to take you less seriously, for the greenhorn you might be; (3) If you work in the Old World, think about getting books\/resources beyond the class; however, this class will greatly benefit you if you are a botanist anywhere; (4) Being the only such class in the whole of Yale, you shouldn't miss it even if you are not specifically studying plants. This will open your mindscapes towards the amazing plant diversity out there.",

    "Take it!",
    "Useful, even if you don't think you'll use botany directly",
