    "In depth understanding of plant ecology and natural science studies",

   "comments": [
    "It was very hands on learning and the entire staff was so warm. The food spreads and plentiful examples helped me understand the material in interesting ways. It also fostered collaboration among the students.",
    "Very fun, snacks were great, low stress. Could maybe be a little more about how to identify plants in the wild?",
    "The biggest strength of this course was the access we had to Marsh Botanical Gardens and the greenhouses. Because we had hands-on access to all of the plants, we were able to learn a lot about the diversity of plant anatomy. The greenhouse manager Dave was incredible and absolutely essential to the success of this course. The course could be improved by testing students' knowledge of the material throughout the semester instead of saving it all for the final. A midterm, weekly quizzes, or review of previous material would improve learning.",
    "The course was a great companion to the lecture, and was truly an enjoyable experience. The diversity of the plants we encountered\/the tasks we were asked to do was helpful and engaging. It would have been helpful to receive more regular feedback throughout the course.",
    "Amazing - would highly recommend - hands on engagement with the material and very fun",
    "The course is very well-organised, entertaining and informative. All the materials including food were well-prepared.",
    "Fantastic teaching, great setup for LEARNING and not just for getting a good grade, amazing facility with an excellent lab manager - literally zero things I would change!"

    "Yes! It's a fun and relaxing lab. You will get to eat so many new and different foods, and it's a great experience!",
    "I would recommend the lab but it is not worth the pain of the lecture course. The lab is great and there is great food but the class requires excessive memorization but could be interesting if you like that.",
    "Yes, take it! You get a lot out of it with the lecture and the snacks are awesome. You get to sit in the greenhouse and draw cool plants while drinking tea and eating snacks.",
    "YES! This was one of the coolest and most interesting courses I have taken at Yale. Spending each week at the greenhouses means that you get a ton of hands-on experience and the opportunity to look at all the plants up close.",
    "Yes! This course is a great companion to the lecture. You learn a lot more and better in the lecture if you are also in the lab. Would highly recommend taking both. The lab is probably the most fun and calm learning environment I've ever been a part of at Yale.",
    "Yes - the course was terribly difficult but the lab was easy and fun and facilitated an understanding of the course material",
    "Of course! It was almost a time of leisure in every loaded week.",
    "AMAZING class - truly the best lab I have taken at Yale. It was the highlight of my week every week, with an incredibly laid back environment, amazing instructors, and a fabulous lab manager who provided a feast of every week featuring all of the edible plants from the group we were learning about. Every week we'd examine, pick apart, and draw five to ten flowers and by the end, it was astounding how much we had absorbed without even trying or needing to study. Amazing class - take it if you can!!",
    "Yes"
