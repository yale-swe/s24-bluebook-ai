   "comments": [
    "ENGL 114 29 is without a doubt a class that students should take if they are interested in improving their writing, particularly in the context of studying consumer culture, materialism, advertising or other aspects of American freedom. Students who enjoy having freedom in their choices of writing should take the class. For the last two essays, students have almost complete freedom in their paper topics, so long as they loosely relate to consumer culture.",
    "ENG 114 29 is the perfect class to take as a freshman in college because it allows students to hone their writing skills. The class taught me to write clearly and concisely. I would recommend this class because it had a very supportive and inviting environment.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel it helped me improve my academic writing skills. In Consumer Culture, students learn to perform close analysis with the help of secondary sources by analyzing non-traditional \"texts\" like advertisements.",
    "ENGL 114 29 is a course for students who want to develop their skills writing academic papers. If you would like to practice developing nuanced arguments and analytical skills, I would definitely recommend taking this course. Also, this class focuses around concepts of American consumerism, which is something that I found fascinating.",
    "Great class, great professor, manageable work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great learning experience especially for students who are new to academic writing. The professor spends a lot of time covering the basic writing skills.",
    "I found English 114 very similar to AP Language and Composition, although more thorough. I would suggest it to a student who had not taken that course in high school.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The work is totally manageable and interesting. Andrew's grading is not too harsh and he gives awesome criticism on the drafts so it is easy to improve. Definitely was my favorite class this semester",
    "Definitely the #1 ENGL 114 class I'd recommend. I shopped a few others, but this one has a fun and engaging professor with an interesting topic. Hands down the best 114 class"
