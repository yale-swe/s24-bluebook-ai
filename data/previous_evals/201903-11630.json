    "I gained a broad familiarity with the comparative politics literature while strengthening my understanding of the key methods used.",
    "Better understanding of mixed-methods of research A better ability to think about a more comprehensive string of the research processfrom question to theory to empirics",
    "I learned so much about what makes good, robust research.",
    "This course introduced several important texts in the subfield of comparative politics, primarily as a means of introducing various research methods. The course ended with a comprehensive research design of our own, which was a useful, new experience for me.",
    "A great introduction to different research designs applied in different research contexts.",
    "We learned a ton about different research methods, many of which we learned from the books in the class and some of which we learned from our peers",
    "Various forms of research design in political science.",
    "I have gained more knowledge about the literature of Comparative Politics and specifically learned about different methods that scholars have engaged with. Beyond that, I had an opportunity to think thoroughly about my own research interests through writing the project proposal. The course has taught me to think critically about others' work and use the knowledge on my own research."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: breadth of subjects and methods, ability for students to think and discuss and practice presenting, chance to think harder about personal research Weaknesses: none? Sometimes less intriguing book is all",
    "I think the strengths lie in the intellectual challengewe each had to become researchers who were looking for holes in other peoples projects.",
    "This was a really good course. My only suggestion would be that perhaps students would profit more from developing a research design proposal at the end of Comparative Politics 2 (the second course of the sequence) rather than at the end of this course.",
    "Some students may wish to engage more with the texts in comparative politics, while leaving methods considerations for later in the sequence when we've had a chance to think more about them. Personally, I was grateful for the opportunity to get an introductory look at some unfamiliar methods in a relatively low-stakes environment -- writing short response papers in reflection, rather than being asked to use the methods.",
    "The ARD presentations were brilliant and the reading responses were very well organized throughout the semester. In the last class, we did a proposal exercise that could have been introduced earlier in the semester.",
    "Professor Baldwin cares so deeply about her students and the class is structured in a way that ensures that we are truly learning from the assigned materials. Most importantly, we receive thorough feedback on every single assignment which is really helpful in helping us grow.",
    "I wished that the final research proposal could be a plan for a smaller project that we could possibly take on in the near future. It is certainly true that it would be more challenging with the current format, but a smaller project would probably be more useful and realistic."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It's not overwhelming but a fantastic chance to learn about a variety of styles of political science and develop your own skills and research pathways.",
    "100%if you have a topic youre interested in doing research on, you should take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to other students, though that might be conditional on the instructor. Kate Baldwin was just the sort of professor to teach this course in an approachable way, with consideration for those of us who weren't experts on [m]any of the methods or techniques covered in class. Given that sort of professor, the course is a useful one in laying out a range of possibilities for CP research.",
    "Yes! Particularly to BA\/MA students!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend to anyone who wants to know how political scientists do research.",
    "I certainly will to anyone who wants to study or research in the field of comparative politics. It is a great introductory course both on different topics and on methodology. The seminar discussion was also thought-provoking."
