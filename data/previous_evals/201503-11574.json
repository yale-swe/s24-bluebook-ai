    "Beautiful class, BEAUTIFUL class! I would recommend this class to anyone who wishes to know art, or to anyone who thinks they know art. You'll hate it, and you'll love it, or at the very least you'll be confused. Either way, the class immerses you into art, and the world of art. How the class turns out will depend a lot on the class composition, but any newbie or expert, artist or non-artist will definitely be able to, and be expected to contribute as much as they learn - that's what makes it a great class. There are only a few other video art class that are offered at Yale (I think 2), and only a handful art classes that can match such experimental quality. Hands down one of my favorite classes, taught by one of my favorite professors."
