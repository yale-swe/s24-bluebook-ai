   "comments": [
    "The course was very integrated into different sections of sessions that allow me to comprehend the spectrum of visual art by different guest speakers. The value of the course relies on understanding from a different perspective how creativity can be nurtured at minor details.",
    "I really liked this course. For me as a student of SOM everything that we saw in the course was kind of new and also it helped me look at things with another view.",
    "I appreciated delving into a different topic for each class meeting, and I loved hearing from different guest lecturers in their respective areas of expertise. The class covered a wide breadth of content and introduced us to many different topics related to visual art.",
    "The content covers a wide range of different forms of art that related to the topic. It's evocative and inspiring.",
    "Really unique. I addicted to this course. Every week you experience different things. It is impossible to get bored about this course. Every week, I can't wait to meet the class on Thursday!",
    "I'm glad that Wendall invites a different artist to lecture each time. I wish that this could be applied to other courses as well. Great to hear and talk about what other artists in the field are thinking. It's nice but also difficult to have the class made up of people from different schools",
    "It's a great class! SO brilliant and wonderful to have varied artistic perspectives that change weekly and to have different schools come together to learn. the final project alone where we all brought in work was incredibly inspiring and informative to us as artists. Every single speaker has taught me something new and it has made me want to explore the world more.",
    "It was very refreshing that we had a few different guest teachers, each talking about his expertise. Wendel gives a very comfortable feeling as a teacher.",
    "1. Guest Speakers as well as classes with Wendall 2. info on a mix of different arts 3. students presenting at the end of the semester",
    "I very much enjoyed Ann's fly though of Art History, and was wonderful.",
    "Very exciting class, super interesting guest lecturers"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely suggest that the course also includes sessions explaining on how to tell a story visually using different image formats and a framework on how to express the story verbally or visually.",
    "I have learned new things that can be applied to the business area where I develop myself.",
    "Some lecturers were more engaging than others, and I wished that we had more of Wendall. I wished there were a clearer connection between the visual art topics and storytelling. That link seemed to be missing for the most part. I would have appreciated more discussion and active engagement, rather than mostly lectures.",
    "A smaller class would be great.",
    "None! Other than I wish I could do this class all 3 years. Actually...because the group is so big sometimes the students can be a little disrespectful in terms of playing on their phones\/making noise etc - they need to be told off! If there is an amazing speaker such as Tony Walton, the whole of the design department should know about it and get the opportunity to come - it was a shame that the word didn't get spread and some people missed out who really would have gained from it.",
    "It was very refreshing that we had a few different guest teachers, each talking about his expertise. Wendel gives a very comfortable feeling as a teacher. The course spreads over too many genres, styles, periods and tries to survey ALL the artistic mediums. The result is that it feels like a high school Wikipedia course. I would recommend focusing on less topics and mediums, and do a more in depth survey of them. For example, we had a guest teacher surveying the entire history of mankind art in three classes. I think it should also be clearer who this course is for. The majority of the students were from the school of management. Maybe for them, it makes sense to teach such elementary content, and to get only a very small taste of what is being taught. However, for drama students, whom I would expect to already be familiar with most of the course's contents, it just felt embarrassing.",
    "With a large class size stress the importance of class etiquette and respect."

    "I think this class is unique and for a in the box person as me it has helped me to have a different point of view about things.",
    "Davonte was super helpful! Thank you!",
    "Thank you Wendall for such a thought provoking, varied and engaging class. It was one of the highlights of the semester..",
    "-- Be very clear about the depth of the discussion. -- we were more than 50 students, all packed in room 101 in the Annex. I would recommend considering wither a bigger space or assigning less students.",
    "Wendall inspires me to be a more informed and thoughtful artist.",
    "A bigger classroom, or some airflow in that classroom would be most welcome."
