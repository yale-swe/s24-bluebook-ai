    "I have recommended the course to several people.This is a very difficult course. One of the hardest I've taken at Yale. It might be second to Immunology, which is hard because it is time-consuming and requires a lot of memorization. The mouse course requires understanding of the material and then application of the material. Very different. The midterm tests everything you learn in the first half of the course. The final exam is a written proposal that is not to be taken lightly. There are high expectations of good writing, well thought out aims, carefully designed experiments, and to foresee the possible errors associated with the methods. It is time-consuming and requires a lot of energy. But well worth it. You come out with a more clarity on your project.The first half of the course covers mouse genetics, making transgenics and knockout mice, IACUC approval, and phenotyping mice. The second half of the course goes through different areas of research and how the mouse models are created and used to answer hypotheses. The final exam is based off of a proposal using mice for your research. This is very nice because you are able to get feedback and answers from the experts in the field."

    "This is probably the single most important course I have taken for my doctoral thesis. Since I am new to working with mice, there were many things I was not aware of in many areas. And the final exam was highly important for the way I was thinkingabout my projects and designing experiments. I was able to learn about IACUC and why it matters to have approval of protocols performed on mice.Can classes be advertised? I only happened by chance saw the course as I was browsing the course list. More people should know about it!"
