   "comments": [
    "I loved the content of this class!! Really gives you a strong overview of the current issues in our education system. I would recommend it if you're interested in education at all!",
    "You should really take this class. You aren't going to go any further in Education Studies? Still take it. The lectures can be dry at times and the writing assignments are actually fairly substantial, but the content is so important and accessible. As a student at one of the world's best universities, you owe it to yourself to understand more about the system that led you here and how it can be improved.",
    "It was a great class if you are interested in how American education is structured",
    "I would really only recommend this course if you're very confident you at least want to apply for the Education Studies program (this course is required, no exceptions, to apply). Truth be told, I was fairly confident I wanted to apply until I entered this course. EDST 110 isn't horrible by any means, but it's not particularly great. Strengths include Lizzy, the professor, who's really sweet and knowledgable. The readings are generally pretty good and you certainly will learn a lot, or at least learn more about common buzzwords we've grown up hearing about (No Child Left Behind, Common Core, accountability movements, teaching as a profession, etc.). The weaknesses are worth going into: for one, the class was 56 students but taught as a \"leminar\"a lecture\/seminar hybrid. This, at 9 AM, was pretty frustrating, as no one really wanted to talk and often students didn't do readings. That's another major weakness (or strength, depending on your perspective): you really, really have almost no incentive to do the reading almost ever. Yes, there are assignments and nightly posts, but they're very very easy to do without actually engaging in the reading. In summary, this is a fine course, not onerous in any way. But it wasn't particularly great, and didn't stimulate me enough to convince me to apply to the program. Lizzy wants you leaving the course with more questions than answers. However, I found that I left the course with virtually no answers and only questions. A little frustrating, but perhaps to be expected from an intro, survey class.",
    "It is a class that introduces the policy and implementation issues of education reform, and it also gives a survey of how those issues are being dealt with. The class encourages you to come up with different ways to deal with the issues instead of just reading them from a textbook.",
    "Great course. Must take if you have slight interest in education and don't mind doing the reading because it is actually interesting. Take it!",
    "Great intro course into educational studies.",
    "This course gives a broad overview of some important issues in the field of education. I would only recommend it to those who are interested in the subject because you need to really be engaged in the material to get anything out of the class.",
    "(Same as answer to Question 1)",
    "A great eye-opener into the various issues and work-ons that the education sector is going through. However, you will get as much out of the course as you put in, in terms of reading and thinking about the larger issues, which have little weight on your grade.",
    "This is a great class to take if you want to get familiar with the American education system. There is so much to learn, and a lot left unsolved at the end to wonder about. The class, though it is a small lecture format, is very open and interactive and sometimes almost seminar style, which is a nice change and I think very appropriate for this material.",
    "A really great course for those even remotely interested in education. The first half of the semester is a bit disheartening because you learn about everything that is wrong with the education system but learning about the complexities of education is needed before learning about what we can do about it. You're graded on four different writing assignments which are enjoyable. Each one requires something different from you. Professor Lizzy tries to make the class as interactive as possible by asking questions during lecture, which I appreciated. She is also super supportive and you should definitely go out of your way to introduce yourself to her.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Education is one of those topics everyone in America should know about. It has increasing relevance as topics like Common Core, charter schools, and standardized tests continue to appear in the news. There are three papers throughout the course with one 12-15 page final in the end on any education-related topic of your choice. Professor Carroll opens her doors for office hours frequently and will read over your outline or draft before any paper, including the final. If you take advantage of office hours and ask the right questions (i.e., bring an annotated outline or even first draft of your paper with specific questions and areas of concern), you're golden. Also remember to take advantage of your Residential College writing tutor and the Writing Center writing partners before every paper.",
    "Take the course if you're interested in education. I thought it was valuable and I feel like I learned a lot. The workload is not absurd, but it's a lot of reading if you really want to get something out of the course. We also have to watch documentaries and do some research every once in a while. You'll have a variety of activities and assignments, so the course does not get boring. You also need to post 8 reading responses on Facebook before the lectures throughout the semester. Prof. Carroll brings in speakers every now and then. The professor and the TAs are very dedicated and make an effort to learn everyone's names. They are also extremely approachable people, so the students are all very comfortable in class. Even though it's a lecture, be prepared to speak in class; the classroom experience is very interactive. Visiting a New Haven Public School was very interesting too. It's a good and interesting survey course, but it can be redundant sometimes. The final project can be a very interesting experience if you plan ahead on what you're doing, and there's a lot of room for exploration. In short, it's a good course and I don't regret taking it. You'll learn A LOT if you take it. Even though it was the only one outside of my major this semester, it was one of my favorite classes this term.",
    "EDST110 is a great way to look into the US education system to better understand its weaknesses and how change can be effected. The readings, although sometimes lengthy, were interesting and helpful to being able to engage in class lectures. Professor Carroll is really great and cares about the class. Would certainly recommend this class to anyone who is willing to be actively involved and cares about the subject at hand.",
    "The covered topics and readings are fantastic--it's one of the best survey classes I have taken. If you're interested in any part of education you have enough freedom to explore it because of the flexible nature of assignments.",
    "EDST 110 is a great class for anyone interested in going into the education field or anyone who has been through the education system themselves (so, basically, everyone). Professor Carroll is incredibly sweet and helpful. She is really passionate about education and clearly wants you to feel the same way and realize how important it is to learn about this stuff and be able to make a difference in it. She may not be the most exciting lecturer in the world, but the lecture material is always interesting and she always assigned fascinating and relevant articles and books to read for class. You can go in lots of different directions (especially on the final paper\/project) based on what part of education you're personally interested in. Definitely take this class if you're even slightly interested in it!",
    "The class is good, I recommend it to any student, especially freshman and sophomores. This class really will inform you about education.",
    "EDST 110 is a small lecture course with a focus on participation. The course work is comprised of papers, a final project, readings, and blog postings. I would recommend this class to someone interested in pursuing education, but probably not just as an elective.",
    "Good introductory course to education. Would recommend for anyone wanting to pursue a career in education or thinking about it.",
    "I would recommend this class, but I think it would be better as a 50 minute lecture.",
    "EDST 110 is a great course to take if you think you might be interested in pursuing education studies. The workload is manageable, the papers are interesting and open, and it gives you a great overview of many of the problems (as well as some of the solutions) that exist in our nationwide education system. While at times the information is depressing, there is an underlying message of hope.",
    "EDST 110 was a great intro survey course to theory, research, policy and applications in US education. The lecture material and readings were extremely interesting. That said, it is a lecture course, so there's not too much opportunity for interesting discussion in class. However, professor Carroll does a great job of encouraging it online and in an optional discussion section. Overall, I would definitely recommend the class to anybody interested in issues in US education.",
    "It's a low difficulty survey course that has very interesting readings and an enjoyable final essay of a topic of your choosing. I recommend it to anyone looking to get their feet wet in education in policy, practice or research.",
    "This course is a great introduction to education and explores many issues that we may not consider when thinking about education. I enjoyed the course and appreciated the variation in topics and class style. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend EDST 110 to anyone even slightly interested in education. The course engages students in a lot of discussion that requires critical thinking to understand the issues in our education system. The course is fairly lecture based, but there were plenty of opportunities to deal with the content of the class in more engaging ways, such as classroom visits and a policy memo assignment.",
    "Very informative. I really liked its structure. I highly recommend it.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in education! You will not find every topic interesting, but you will figure out what you do find interesting, and you will be able to pursue those topics in further classes only if you take this intro class.",
    "An overview of the study of American education through the lens of research, policy and practice. A really good start for those who are interested in education as a social issue.",
    "I would summaraze EDST 110 as a great introduction to the educational system and its problems in the united states, bringing concepts that are discusses in K-12 policy around the nation into our vocabulary. I would definately recommend it becasue even if you are not conisdering becoming a teacher, it is a great class to get an introduction to the world of education.",
    "If you're even a little bit interested in education, take this class! Lizzy is great, the course material is interesting, and the assignments are all different enough that it's never boring or redundant. You get to approach education from a variety of lenses so even if one week feels kind of boring, you'll move on quickly, but it never feels rushed. Definitely take it!",
    "take it if you want to go into education because you will learn a lot, but if you don't I wouldn't recommend it",
    "If you are interested in education or public policy more generally, this is a great class! It helps to explain current debates in education and challenges you to think about your own education. The final project is fun because you can explore any issue that you want.",
    "This course is a prerequisite for the Education Studies Scholar program which is the reason why it's a general survey course. But, don't be discouraged by the structure of the course. You will really walk away knowing a lot more about education if you do the readings and talk to your classmates about your experiences in education! This class really highlighted how different are experiences in education have been!",
    "This class was a solid introduction to K-12 education in the United States. The variety of assignments allows students to approach issues in the education system from a variety of perspectives. Prof. Carroll was generally a good lecturer and the class was usually interesting. While she tries to bring in discussion and provides some opportunities for students to talk about the topics, this was not always possible with the 60-person class. While perhaps not feasible, there were definitely moments where it seemed as if it would be more effective to learn in a seminar format.",
    "Provides a solid overview on education, both policy issues and practice (for those students who see themselves as teachers in the future). Would definitely recommend.",
    "In this class you will get a good foundation of the basics of the United States education system, mostly from preschool to 12th grade. You will learn about everything from children's emotional development to standardized testing. I would recommend this class to people who are interested in education from an academic standpoint or are just looking for a unique elective."
