    "I recommend it but just know it's going to be a ton of work and you'll have very little time to really let the material saturate. Inevitably you'll learn something.",
    "TAKE IT. So worth it. My favorite class all year.",
    "If you just want a language credit I wouldn't take Chinese but if you are committed to learning the language I would definitely take this class. While it is a lot of work, you learn a lot and you grow a lot as well.",
    "This class is absolutely wonderful. It is well organized with extremely helpful teachers and every resource to help you succeed. Will you work? Of course, that's the only way to learn a language, but it's never overwhelming.",
    "More or less exactly the same as CHNS 130 in the fall semester. The weekly tutorials are slightly different but nothing too out of the ordinary or hard to easily get used to. In case you didn't take CHNS 130 or don't remember, here's a quick run down: same class structure every 2 weeks or so - can get somewhat routine but didn't feel as grueling this time around. Brilliant and caring professors - they teach well and want you to improve and will do anything they can to help in that endeavor. There is nightly homework but it's manageable - they are lenient if you don't always do it on time and also in terms of grading. Grades in general are fairly lenient, especially on exams. If you do the work and stay on the professor's good sides, then you'll definitely succeed in this class. I definitely recommend continuing your Chinese education with this course as I truly enjoyed it and found it worthwhile."
