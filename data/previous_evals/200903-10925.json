   "comments": [
    "Spanish 527 is a course that asks students to engage in close readings of a few medieval texts, focusing (though not exclusively) on the theme of love. It is a discussion-based class; the professor provides contextual information, but the analysis of the primary texts is done collectively and in collaboration. I would definitely recommend the course to another student, provided they are comfortable participating in class discussions. If someone just wants to hear lectures, this course is not for them, but for the student who is willing to take part in the class, I would highly recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "The texts we covered are canonical texts of medieval Spanish literature. In many ways they are the building blocks for all the literature that follows. Understanding these foundations is extremely useful when considering literature from other eras. Additionally, this course was helpful in the development of our ability to read a text critically. Since we analyzed each text in great detail and were able to spend a fair amount of time on each, we were able to develop our capacity for noticing significant details and seeing how different parts of a work (or of different works) play off of each other to create meaning."
