    "For a class on water, it sure is dry. Take it if you must, or are you're going into research in water pollution or watershed maintenance and knowing this stuff is useful. It wasn't a bad experience, and I learned a lot. But now I know a bunch of stuff and I'm saying to myself \"why would anyone even care to know this.\"",
    "If you like chemistry, this class is great. The content is interesting and reasonably straightforward, and the teacher(s) are very accessible.",
    "Tedious, only take it if you have to\/are super interested in aquatic environments",
    "This class can get quite interesting, once you understand it, but it will take a while. It is not difficult mathematically or scientifically, it just takes a new sort of thinking where there isn't one right method. At the end it is rewarding to be able to draw a graph and understand an aquatic system.The problem sets get long near the end, but they are so helpful in building your understanding for the final. Make sure you go to review sessions and see the TA if you're stuck. They help so much!Also, the final and midterm are open book which is amazing!"
