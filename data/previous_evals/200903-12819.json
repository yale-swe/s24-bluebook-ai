   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their level of language in French. I would also recommend taking it with Francoise Schneider. Her class was challenging but not overwhelming. My only complaint is that I am more interested in literature than culture and society, but it was informative and helped improve my speaking nonetheless.",
    "Definitely take it if you can! It does improve your French a lot if you participate a lot in class and pay attention to your errors. It was such a great introduction to modern French culture and to problems facing the French people today. It was a small class so you are able to participate a lot and get immediate feedback from the professor on your language. It isn't too much work if you keep up with it, but it does depend on the assignment. Sometimes it's just reading from a textbook or packet. Sometimes you have to watch a video and respond. Sometimes it's all 3. But definitely manageable.",
    "Absolutely take this class! A decent amount of work, but you get used to it. Just take care to notice how she grades and you can work the system.",
    "French 160 is an excellent class to take if you have a strong background in French, but want to improve your speaking skills. I was always good with grammar and writing, but my speaking skills were not as good. I feel that I can now express myself much more eloquently in French. Mme. Schneider is a wonderful professor. Her energy and enthusiasm make it impossible to get bored in class. Although there is a lot of daily work, it is all ultimately very helpful in helping to improve ease of expression in French as well as listening skills. The class itself is fun and casual; you mostly just talkand have debates. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Fabulous class if you want a fun environment to practice French and learn about day-to-day French culture and issues. There is a lot more writing than the description suggests (approx 300 words twice a week), but if you plough through these, the rest of the workload is manageable. And Francoise is phenomenal!",
    "I would summarize the class as being an interesting (most of the time) survey of modern-day French (and Francophone nations') culture(s), useful for developing aural and reading skills. I would recommend French 160 to those students who feel very comfortable in their grammatical language skills, and are eager to use them towards discussing present-day concerns and topics.",
    "A lot of work but absolutely worth it!",
    "French 160 is an excellent class. You will learn many interesting things about French culture and greatly improve your speaking ability. It's a lot of work, but you will get a lot out of it. Mme. Schneider is very energetic and creates a good class atmosphere. Take this class if you want to really learn how to speak French!",
    "This course does much to improve conversational fluency about the prescient social and political issues in France today, and it offers a stimulating and at times challenging classroom environment in which one must synthesize the content on a day-to-day basis to remain a part of the discussion. However, as is linked to the previous, this course does have a heftier-than-expected workload, but as long as one remains on top of it, the course can be rewarding."
