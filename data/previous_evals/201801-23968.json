    "I learned what an urgent threat Cybersecurity is to the United States and democracy more generally.",
    "I really gained a nuanced view of cybersecurity. Not only was the class engaging, but all of the opportunities to meet with people outside the class were incredible.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of the emerging cybersecurity field through this course. I have left with a deep knowledge of the various risks and opportunities for public and private actors in cyberspace, and a newfound fear of the many vulnerabilities cyberspace and the internet of things create for the average citizen.",
    "You will learn a lot about cyber security and cyber warfare challenges over last 20 years.",
    "This course provides a comprehensive overview of the history of cyberespionage and cyber warfare, and the main players and main issues related to those topics.",
    "This class was amazing! I learned all about the world of cyberwarfare and its relation to broader discussions about foreign policy.",
    "Interesting overview of the many cybersecurity challenges the U.S. and citizens face"

   "comments": [
    "Great survey course. I enjoyed how the course was structured, focusing first on an introduction to the field of cybersecurity first and then spending one week on important topics in the sector. Good amount of engaging reading material. Classes were well-balanced between structured lecture and discussion. Overall I really enjoyed the course and learned a ton!",
    "The main weakness of this course is that the readings are too longI was never able to complete them. However, generally discussion was always interesting. I really liked the individual and group memo assignments.",
    "This class was well structured around different themes. It might be helpful to have a greater technical aspect to the course that isn't all discussion based.",
    "This course is one of the best seminars I have taken at Yale. Professor Wittenstein structures seminars extremely well, and strikes a perfect balance between facilitating student discussion and injecting his own input.",
    "This is a great seminar with Prof. Wittenstein being a great discussion leader.",
    "The course was organized in a way so that all of the most important aspects of cyberwarfare and cyberespionage were explored in depth. I found the course readings engaging and informative as well as the in class discussions.",
    "Professor Wittenstein is fascinating and a really excellent teacher. The subject matter of the class is so cool and discussion is always interesting. The only downside is that coursework is very backloaded into the last month of the class.",
    "Good, manageable workload - an interesting array of individual and group projects"

   "comments": [
    "Yes absolutely! The class brings together a great diversity of students (Global Affairs undergrads, Jackson grad students, poli sci, history, CS, Law, etc.), and the breadth of topics also makes for very interesting discussions. The areas of cybersecurity we discuss are incredibly topical, and Professor Wittenstein does an excellent job of bringing in current events throughout the semester.",
    "Great, easy seminar course. Wittenstein makes hard material accessible to all. If you have the option to take this class, do it!",
    "If you are interested in cybersecurity, 100% take it. If you are just curious, I do not think it is the class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Wittenstein's level of engagement in the course was incredible, and made the class exciting. I learned a lot and had a wealth of experiences because of it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in cyber or international security.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who wants to know more about cyber issues or just wants to take a really good seminar.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in cyber-related issues and\/or international relations.",
    "Yes! This class is absolutely incredible and the subject matter is amazing. Take it if you can get in!",
    "Yes! One of the best courses I have taken at Yale."
