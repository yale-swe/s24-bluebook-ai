   "comments": [
    "It made me realize the vast resource opportunities Yale offers. To write a proper paper for this class required me to use all of the information I found about arts in Haas as well as Bienecke",
    "This class helped me cut out the excess when writing papers, and it showed me how using concise points truly made a better paper instead of using excess words. It also helped me with analyzing film, something I had no prior experience in.",
    "Better understanding of film criticism, art theory across media, the themes of ekphrasis and adaptation, and advanced film viewing techniques.",
    "I learned how to analyze films and be more wary of details when watching.",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for films. This course allowed me to watch movies that I otherwise wouldn't have.",
    "Awesome class, with lots of extremely interesting things to learn and discuss. Prof Dudley Andrew is great!",
    "I learned about film techniques, film history, and the intersection between literature, art, and cinema."

    "The course had interesting discussions but they were a little unorganized. There were some readings we were assigned but never talked about.",
    "It could've been a bit more open to discussion. The professor spoke mkst of the time but also had so many interesting things to say so I don't know if I would change it.",
    "Can't be improved, great class!",
    "I wish we talked more in class about the timeline of film and were given a baseline intro to the history before jumping in. I often felt lost in the timeline and names were thrown out in class that I did not register."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who's interested in contemporary art not just films",
    "The course is interesting and anyone would benefit from it, but may not be the best form of introduction for those who are interested, but have no background, in film. I struggled with some of the concepts of the reading or film, but deeply enjoyed listening to my peers examine the readings\/films from unique angles.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to analyze a wide array of films from all around the world.",
    "I think that anyone who is interested in films- especially obscure french films from the mid twentieth century - would enjoy this course. The professor is open to helping you improve your writing all the time as well which helped me a lot. Be prepared, however, to truly think outside the box.",
    "Yes!! Take this course if you love to write and discuss film and art.",
    "Professor Andrew helped my writing became more concise and more critical. He showed us some incredibly interesting films, and discussion around them was mostly student-guided. The class is what you make of it -- it is up to you to engage with the text and bring that level of engagement to class. If you are interested in film \/ art theory, then you will get a lot out of the class. I sure did!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to students who are new to film study. It's a great intro to the field!"
