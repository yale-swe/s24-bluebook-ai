   "comments": [
    "Great course. Joanne and Sandy both have extensive real-life experience, which were fantastic. I think it's important for graduate level students to have access to instructors who have the kind of experience these two instructors have.",
    "Weaknesses: Expectations and assignments and due dates sometimes unclear.Strengths: Great to a have real practioner teach the class using real life examples. Very skills orientated class. A lot of freedom to take the class and assignments in the direction of your personal interests in public health.",
    "Joanne and Sandy are a wealth of information. They are very engaged in giving you exposure to how things work in the real world and often share their own (amazing) experiences. Their expertise, knowledge, and interest is really remarkable. I have enjoyed working with them over the past year.",
    "Great depth about medical and public health emergency operations and planning. It really provided significant detail about some of the framework involved in emergency planning and preparedness.",
    "Strengths: The material is obviously applicable to real life and class discussions were informative and based on application of skills. Instructors have a wealth of knowledge on the subject, which is fantastic. They do a great job of facilitating collaboration between students and imparting their expertise to the course.Weaknesses: I understand the FEMA assessment requirement, but the modules are incredibly time consuming and redundant in some areas. I would recommended condensing the requirements to total of maybe 5 of the most important, diverse ones over the course of the semester. For example, require one of ICS, NIMS, NRS, or Incident action report, but not all four. I didn't like how we had assignments given to us last minute on certain weeks, this made the course stressful due to the combined volume of homework and FEMA modules. Other than the mock briefings (which are obviously time sensitive), it would be better to have this information up front and stick to the course schedule when possible. Otherwise, it becomes very difficult to plan for when to complete assignments, as we are nearly all taking 4 other courses as well.",
    "This is a great course. It is very focused on giving students tools which can be directly applied to or used in real world settings."

    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy is very knowledgeable. Busy with her various other roles yet accessible for questions and advice. Joanne is fantastic. Very approachable. Full of pearls of wisdom.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy Bogucki--I have no evaluation as she only observed the class. Joanne McGovern taught the course and is what I consider the primary instructor. It would be helpful if Joanne was more consistently responsive via email and explained assignments and expectations.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy and Joanne are both really informed and willing to share their experiences. They bring so much to the table. Working on the VMOC's, tabletops, etc has been such a rich and rewarding experience.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy was very knowledgeable about much of the hospital based and domestic public health and medical emergency preparedness. She was a great resource to have for logistical issues. Joanne McGovern did a fantastic job providing military and international perspective regarding emergency operations and disaster mitigation. She has a fantastic wealth of experience.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy: Helpful and knowledgeable on the subject.Joanne: Very devoted to the course and to the students. Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and accommodating. Powerpoint presentations were clear and interactive. She could improve by providing more explicit instructions on assignments. Many times I was confused about what was expected of us in terms of the work due; remember that the material and types of exercises assigned were brand new for several of us in the course, so we require more explicit examples to get started.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Both instructors are very knowledgeable, always prepared to lead an engaging class and are very responsive to student needs\/concerns.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Joanne and Sandy were fantastic!"

    "Instructor: Michael Kenneth Dalton \u00a0Dr. Dalton did a fine job.",
    "Instructor: Michael Kenneth Dalton \u00a0Michael was fine - not incredibly enthusiastic about anything or really involved in discussions, but he was reasonable and fair. However, he tended to send out information at the last minute (e.g. the day before class), which wasn't conducive to getting the assignment done in enough time. It would have been interesting to learn more about his experience as an EMT, and other students' experience as applicable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Kenneth Dalton \u00a0Michael was always responsive to questions. When he led class he was very prepared, organized and professional."

   "comments": [
    "highly recommended",
    "I learned a lot and Joanne is very knowledgeable. I wish I would have taken the Fall semester class though. However, a lot of assignments and random projects are thrown on you without a lot of details so if you have a really busy semester and need to plan ahead, keep this in mind. I would recommend it though.",
    "Opportunity to learn a LOT about emergency planning.Lots of certifications (FEMA trainings) to complete. They are involved, but will look good for employers not to mention being really interesting. Practical skill gained.Tabletops are great practice.Working on scenarios\/learning from classmates, Joanne, and Sandy has been excellent.Learning about management and considering how to build and broker innovative teams is hugely important.",
    "I'd strongly recommend this course. It provided me with a lot of knowledge on a subject in which I was pretty limited, and it was a valuable resource for me regarding the role of public health in emergency situations.",
    "Interesting subject matter taught by seasoned emergency response professionals. Heavy, time-intensive work load outside of class, due to FEMA module requirements. Projects were interesting and could be catered to your own interests. Different and perhaps more applied than any course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Taking this class provided the most practical experience in public health preparedness and response out of all the classes I have taken. I highly recommend it to everyone interested in public health emergency preparedness and response. The teachers are excellent and the course is engaging."
