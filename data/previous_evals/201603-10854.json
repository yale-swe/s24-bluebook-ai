    "I have learned a surprising amount of French in a short period of time.",
    "In this class I gained a strong foundation in the French language. We surely still have a ways to go before we can say we have grasped the essentials of the language, but I was still very satisfied with how far we got. By the end of the semester you have developed a solid base upon which to build the rest of your language study. The fact that class is run entirely in French allowed me to learn things far beyond the official material contained in the course books, and to become comfortable with French much more quickly than I otherwise would have.",
    "Learned French",
    "In this class I rapidly learned to speak and read in French. I have never taken a French course in my life, and this class was superb in making French an easy to learn language. My French professor was excellent. He reviewed the material thoroughly and I never felt underprepared for the weekly tests on Mondays. I feel that at the end of this course, I have gained good French speaking skills and I am excited for French 120.",
    "I can hold a simple conversation in French and understand basic French grammar. I learned that it is more effective to learn a new language by thinking in that language, rather than trying to compose a sentence in English and then translating it into that language.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: daily meetings, personal interaction with professor, reenforcement of material outside class Weaknesses: high workload, slow to grade or give feedback, and slightly disorganized department",
    "I wish we had learned more grammar rather than spending weeks on how to say what sports we play and the words for family members. We now only know three tenses and the immediate future, barely any real idioms, can't construct any conditional sentences other than simple ones, and can't say anything that would be expressed by the word \"would\" in English.",
    "This course does a good job providing us with a solid foundation in French that we will be able to build on in years to come, and it moves quickly enough for us to feel like we have made real progress. One incredible strength of this class is the fact that it is run entirely in French. This allows us to pick up so much more than is contained in the text and workbook, and to do it naturally rather than through a forced translation process. Our familiarity and comfort level with the language grows very quickly because of this, and that is something I consider irreplaceable. A weakness of this course is, to a certain extent, the organization of the material in the book. I think that the overall progression was logical, but there were multiple times where the book lingered on a topic for 2 or 3 chapters (eg, sports, careers) that we could have easily covered in 1 chapter and then moved on from. I feel that if this redundancy was eliminated or at least moved through more quickly we could complete the entire book in one semester rather than leaving a few chapters untouched at the end like we currently do.",
    "It's a little bit intense but good",
    "Strengths of this course include the manner in which we learn French. I think that the story (the videos we watch in class) we follow is useful for learning French. It makes it more entertaining. I also enjoy all of the skits that we were asked to produce within 5 minutes at least once a week. It helped keep the class energy vibrant. Weaknesses of this course would have to be that I don't feel we have enough practice inside the classroom. We have to do most of the learning on our own and then review in class. I think a mixture of in-class learning and in-class review would be the most beneficial. Sometimes, one can be very lost if you did a poor job of learning the material the night before.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it is conducted entirely in French, and it forces you to think and respond in French instead of using another language as a crutch. The French in Action course is a very engaging and effective way to learn French. However, some weeks we would study just one lesson from this course and other weeks we would study two; I thought that the weeks we studied two lessons at once were rushed and that pace did not help to solidify the grammar we learned that week.",
    "Main strength - that the classes meet daily and are taught in French all the time"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in learning as much as possible. With this class's structure, that entails devoting time to daily workbook assignments, and taking time each weekend to study for the weekly test. It is possible to take the course without these commitments, but they are essential to making the most out of the class.",
    "Fine for learning French. The book is problematic and outdated in a number of ways and tests take place outside of class every week. Again, fine for learning French, but not necessarily the most ideal in terms of scheduling and actual interest.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. I have never experienced anything like the speed of language learning that I experienced in this class (aside from actual immersion abroad), and to be honest, this has been one of the most enjoyable and satisfying classes that I have taken in my four years at Yale. If you have any interest in language or French at all, take this and you wont be disappointed. Dont be worried about the 1.5 credit load, the weekly tests, or an early section time, because honestly, the class is worth it. In return for dedicating just a little bit of your time each day, in one semester you get the door to the entire French language thrown open in front of you. Maybe its just me, but I dont know what could be more satisfying than that.",
    "Sounds good and fun.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class in specific to my peers because I feel that my professor was thorough in his teaching. Overall, these introductory French courses are good. I conclude said statement by the positive comments that some of my peers in other French courses have said.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student; it employs a very engaging style of teaching and while it is fast-paced, the feeling of learning the basics of a completely new language in such a short span of time is certainly worth the effort.",
    "Yes, I think it provides all resources to learn basic French"
