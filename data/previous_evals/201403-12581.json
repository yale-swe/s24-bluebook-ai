    "If you're a music major and this course is offered as a senior seminar your senior year, by all means take it! It's a topic not often discussed in the music department even though arrangements and transcription are so common in the musical canon. This course is a fun mix of theoretical and practical studies of a historically important musical practice.",
    "Harrison is a pretty cool guy, and he's open to discussing various types of arrangement\/transcription, from classical to pop music. Thought-provoking discussion on the nature of an artwork and metaphysical ideas of art. Having experience transcribing things\/orchestrating will help.",
    "A great discussion of that arrangement and transcription aspects of music. I would recommend it to fellow music majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others. I would say it is not a life-changing course per se; however, it did enhance my appreciation for the topic.",
    "Great senior seminar. Fun (a nice community of senior music majors), festive (interesting assignments), and very interesting discussions.",
    "This is a great class! Professor Harrison is an extremely knowledgeable, engaging, funny, and kind teacher and discussion leader. I highly recommend taking a class with him if you can!",
    "This class is as advertised: it's a survey and examination of arrangement and transcription in various contexts, notably Bach, Liszt, and popular music. Take it if you're interested in arrangement and transcription and\/or questions of musical identity. Workload is very reasonable; and the practical project and research project are due during the semester, so you'll basically be done with work for the class before fall break, which is really nice. Definitely make sure to put work into it--the research project especially--but it's a great option for a music major who needs a senior seminar, or for anyone who's interested in the material.",
    "This course is as advertised: it's a survey\/exploration of arrangement and transcription in different contexts, including Bach, Liszt, and popular music. Take it if you're interested in arrangement and transcription and\/or questions of musical identity, or if you're a music major who needs an enjoyable and interesting senior seminar. Workload is very reasonable; and both major projects (a practical project and a research paper) are due throughout the semester, so you'll basically be done with the class by fall break, which is really nice.",
    "Issues of transcription and arrangement, are there even any in the first place? That is exactly what I thought. But the very nature of transcriptions and arrangement bring forth questions of what makes a composition really a \"composition\", or what makes a \"cover\" of a song really \"cover\". We know that Busoni did piano arrangements for Mozart works, but can a similar discussion be transferred to electronic music and remixes? The class exposed me to many philosophical ideas behind music and was a joy to take. As a composer, it directly challenged my conception of what the differences between an arrangement, composition and transcription were. After this class, the lines were blurred. There are some arrangements with enough compositional intent to be considered \"90% composition, 10& arragenement\" or remixes that are \"80% new, 20% original\". An arrangement doesn't necessarily \"fall below\" a composition. You have a transcription project, a practical arrangement project and a written research paper along with weekly readings. The classes are structured like a discussion, which fits in very well with the nature of the material and reading."
