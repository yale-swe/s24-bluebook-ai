   "comments": [
    "Even if you have already fulfilled your language requirement, I highly recommend you take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "YES! It's a lot of work but compared to other language classes I've taken, I learnt a lot more in this course than any other L1 classes. After just one semester, I feel like I can have a decent conversation in Japanese.",
    "This is, perhaps, the best course I have taken at Yale, and definitely one of the best language courses. I cannot say enough about it. If you are marginally interested in Japanese language culture or language, and have some time to spare to work (because there is a lot of work), I cannot recommend it more highly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and you don't need to be a freshman; I took it as a junior, and there were several upperclassmen and professional students.You will learn so, so much, and you will also be in awe of the pedagogical excellence of these instructors, all of whom are caring and very warm and encouraging.I did mention it's a lot of work, yes?But again, wow. This course consistently stimulated me and, I dare say, revitalized my academic career.",
    "I am a firm believer that Japanese is one of the best languages you can take at Yale. Everyone agrees that the class requires a fair amount of work, but it is worth it for the great class sessions. The teachers are so dynamic and create fun, charming lesson plans each day to help you learn the language, often creating an entire scenario for the students to act out. Even the homework can be fun; many of us still remember the fun songs we listened to for homework. I highly recommend the class as long as you can balance the work load that accompanies it; there is a reason why it is 1.5 credits.",
    "Intoductory Japanese is a great course. Probably the most challenging course I've taken at Yale, certainly in terms of workload, but very rewarding. By the end of the first semester you'll be able to read and write in two new writing systems, read more than a page of text, and hold a 15 minute conversation.",
    "Japanese 110 is a spectacular course. There are four rotating professors who, over the course of a single semester, will teach you enough Japanese to be able to have some moderately elaborate conversations. It works quickly because the course covers a LOT of material, which is extremely challenging. I would strongly suggest taking this course because the department is spectacular, and you will make a lot of progress very quickly, but you will also have a ton of homework *every* night. That's how good progress is made, though.",
    "This is a great course. Class is fun and the teachers are engaging and great. There is a strong community in the Japanese department at Yale. Getting to know my classmates and teachers both in and outside the classroom was really nice. The weekly language tables helped in this regard. This supportive and fun environment made me feel strongly invested in putting in the effort to learn excellent Japanese. The course provides you with countless resources to do so, and the assignments are varied so that you develop skills in speaking, writing, reading, pronunciation, etc. I liked the detail and clarity of the explanations and commentary in the textbook. There is a lot of work on a daily basis, and more when you factor in time for free conversation, which is really helpful. Expect to spend 2-3 hours a day practicing Japanese. It is well worth it, after seeing how much progress I have made over the course of the semester.",
    "This is a very good class. I, and many other students, enjoy it. If you want to learn japanese, take it, but recognize that you will have to spend a lot of time to master the concepts.",
    "Japanese 110 is an introductory course for Japanese. It's a work intensive class class so you must be committed to taking this course! But all professors are awesome and really helpful!! If you want to learn Japanese this is a great class to take but be aware that it is not a gut class.",
    "very intense workload",
    "It is an intensive, but fun and enjoyable class. Look forward to engaging learning tools like songs and videos, and a great group of instructors."
