    "We should have not spent so much time on renormalization of QED, and spent at least two weeks on EW theory and the standard model.",
    "Strengths: we learned to calculate things. Weaknesses: calculations can take a long time, and are not the most engaging of tasks. Unclear if there is an alternative, so caveat emptor! Some other topics could be interesting, like exactly solvable models or solitonic solutions.",
    "very detailed",
    "The strength of this course was a careful treatment of the tools of the trade for particle theorists, but that somewhat singular focus was also its weakness given the breadth of quantum field theory.",
    "Strength: this course is very well explained, very well organized. Weakness: none.",
    "It would've been better if more review from the first semester could be provided at the beginning of the semester"

    "Yes obviously if someone wants to do particle physics or theoretical physics. I would not recommend it to others because its very difficult and a lot of work, however it is possible that other students may benefit from auditing the class.",
    "Learning to calculate is a prerequisite for any forays into QFT.",
    "Yes, Of course",
    "Definitely a must for anyone looking to do anything involving particles.",
    "Yes. This course gives very well-explained and detailed introduction to quantum field theory.",
    "Yes, if and only if he or she has decided to study QFT.",
    "Yes since it's a must for those who ask this question"
