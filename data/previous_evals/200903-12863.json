    "Yes. You learn a lot, especially grammar.",

    "I mean if you have to fulfill the requirement you have to fulfill it",
    "Reinforcement of L2, plus a little more grammar, more vocab, and a bunch of readings and videos.",
    "Lots and lots of stories you have to read before class so that you can discuss them, in Spanish, with the rest of the students. Lots of partner activites thankfully too.",
    "If you have to take L3 for a language credit, or if you want to continue studying Spanish, there's really no way around it.",
    "I took it to fulfill a requirement so it wasn't my favorite class but if you want to learn Spanish then this is a decent way to do it. If you only want to fulfill the requirement then there are easier languages to take.",
    "Take it to finish your distributional, but if you think you want to go on to L4, be careful. Myself and several other friends were all planning on taking through L4, but we are now contemplating that decision and many have decided not to. L3 is necessary for the foreign language requirement so take it yes, but don't expect anything great."
