   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Arch 001, but only if the student had prior experience with architecture.",
    "The material is great - in the span of a semester, you have a brief overview of architecture as a field and art, along with a strong focus on specific utopian proposals and thinkers. Lots of reading, little writing (responses), lengthy but fascinating lectures and occasional discussions.The discussion part of this course was my only disappointment - as my first small-class seminar, I expected richer, more in-depth and captivating discussions. But that depends solely on the class dynamic, and we had a weak one this year.",
    "I was surprised to find that I really loved this course.I had minimal\/seedling of an interest in architecture before. Now, I really love it! I don't think I will major in it, but I am definitely looking forward to attending open lectures at the School of Architecture in the spring.Architecture& utopia had a lot of great readings (and some dry ones too), but by the end of the class you'll realize all of the new ideas you have been exposed to and that you just never noticed in everyday life or thought about before.Really fun field trip to the MoMA (paid for by Yale).Great for students who like architecture, architecture\/art history, or cool\/new stuff in general.Only weakness: not too too much discussion in class (Professor Deamer talks a lot; she's used to teaching graduate students; doesn't leave much time for discussion; can seem kind of flighty sometimes, but that's just her nature); can sometimes tell when people are bs-ing; but all of this was fine because our class bonded over the humor in us not knowing each-others names until the very end of the semester (NYC MoMA field trip)Highly recommended!!",
    "I think that next year, the course will be better because the professor will have had more experience with teaching a freshman seminar and simplifying complex material. As well, if she tries to find ways to foster discussion throughout the course, everything will improve exponentially. As such, I'm not entirely sure if I would recommend the course, but I definitely think it's worth a try, and it's DEFINITELY worth a shop.",
    "It is a good introduction to architecture and I feel like a learned a lot. However, the class is dull and times and the weekly\/bi-weekly work is tedious. I would recommend the class if Professor Deamer lessened the reading.",
    "It's a really interesting class and got me thinking about being an architecture major - something I had never previously considered. You really learn a great deal about the thought behind these projects and the marriage of architectural design and social\/political thought.",
    "I think this class is more architecture based then I first thought and would recommend it for anyone with an interest in architecture.",
    "I recommend this class if you are willing to do the readings, really think about them, and join the discussion. You will be frustrated at not getting much feedback on \"how you're doing,\" but then you will realize that you are being allowed and encouraged to think and learn outside of the box of evaluation. Embrace it and do your best because you want to. This is not a spectator sport, but I would encourage it if you are willing to jump in. You will get what you put in.",
    "Architecture 001 01 stays true to its title: Architecture and Utopia. It explores and examines the progression of utopian thought as it applies to architecture, from Plato's Republic to the counterculture movements that inspired Ant Farm and Drop City. We looked at how utopian thought changes over time and what catalyzes these changes, such as various social, political, or artistic movements. I took this course because I wanted to take an architecture course as a freshman in preparation for the potential major, but if you aren't interested in architecture or the social and political implications of \"utopia,\" then I would not recommend this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The topic of utopia, as opposed to a survey course, is a great way to be introduced to the subject. I had no experience in architecture before, but now I am interested in possibly majoring in it.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in architectural trends, history, or even sociopolitical movements, to some extent. This class is less architecture and more utopia than I expected when I signed up for it, which meansthat the readings often focus more on what people thought than what they built (if they built anything at all). There are two-page reflections on the readings due weekly, but the class is not very writing-heavy until the presentation paper and final paper are due. The small class size (or maybe because this was the first year that the course was taught) meant that we had some input on the location of our field trip; we ended up going to MoMA one Saturday, which was a treat. This course will not provide a survey of architecture, but it will pique your interest in the topic if you aren't curious enough already.",
    "It is a course about the ideas that developed over time of how change society for the better by changing the environment, THe course evaluates many literal and fictitious attempts to due so."
