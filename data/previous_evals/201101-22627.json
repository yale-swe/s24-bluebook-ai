   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class. Having some basic knowledge of French literature is important whether you're planning on continuing in French or not. You'll get out of this class what you put into it - while you can probably get away with not doing all the reading, if you do, you'll end up learning a lot more. And if possible, take it with Pinzka!",
    "I highly recommend this class, particularly with Pinzka. She's really sweet, and very good at leading a discussion without being overbearing. She gives you a lot of choice on the essays, and makes herself very available if you need guidance. One warning, though: French 170 is very much the survey course it says it is. You will read a lot and very quickly, probably more quickly than you'd like to, at the expense of really discussing works in depth. Overall, though, an excellent introduction to French lit taught by an excellent professor.",
    "French 170 is a survey of French literature from the Middle Ages to the present. The amount of reading definitely picks up toward the end of the class but I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to improve their spoken and written French and is interested in exploring French literature.",
    "A good class, a (mostly) good reading list that gives a very basic introduction to French literature. The idea of a book or two a week was intimidating at first, but I managed to complete most of the reading after all. I learned a lot about how to write and think about French literature, even if my conversational skills stayed a little rusty."
