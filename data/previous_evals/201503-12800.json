   "comments": [
    "great intro to pharmacology and essential if you want to be in the pharm dept.",
    "I would recommend the class since it allows you to learn a wide range of topics. It also gives you an idea of what research a range of professors do, so it can also help you choose a rotation. However, presentation styles are different for each professor which made exams difficult to study for.",
    "PHAR 504 is an introductory pharmacology course that examines the pharmacology of several relevant disease treatments. It also provides background knowledge of general principles of pharmacology and an overview of the drug discovery process. I would recommend this course to another student because I enjoyed the lectures, learned information that was interesting and will benefit me in whatever I research, and exposed me to a number of potential research areas.",
    "A very good intro to pharmacology. would definitely recommend it if someone is interested in learning more about pharmacology.",
    "PHAR 504 01 provides extensive knowledge in basic principles of pharmacology as well as cutting-edge advances in development of novel pharmaceuticals. Lectures are well-organized and interest-evoking. Online course on drug development process is also included and helpful. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "A class with a fairly low workload and some (not all, alas) extremely interesting material, although lectures varied widely in quality and cogency.",
    "Phar 504 is an excellent overview of the basic principles of pharmacology and the strengths of the pharmacology department at Yale. I would recommend it to any student who plans to pursue a graduate degree in pharmacology.",
    "Yes"

    "overview of all the basic pharm ideas that i will need for my own research as well as learning about others' research and communicating",
    "I am interested in pharmacology, so the topics I learned in this class is useful for my potential research.",
    "This course provided me with a solid base of knowledge in pharmacology that will be helpful as I continue my research. This course also provided specific examples of principles of pharmacology.",
    "This course deepens my knowledge mostly by providing informative lectures both on basic principles of pharmacology as well as cutting-edge advances in development of novel pharmaceuticals. The Yale\/Merck online course also helps to understand the real drug development process. Learning about the techniques and future directions in many pharmacological research areas contributes a lot to dissertation\/research topic development.",
    "The course gave me an understanding of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, the drug regulatory process, and a general idea of the pharmacological strategies for treating a range of diseases.",
    "This course taught me the basics of pharmacology, and helped me confirm that I would like to pursue a PhD in Pharmacology."
