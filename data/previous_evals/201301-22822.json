    "Fun and engaging examination of various aspects of Chinese business and law. Nothing you learn in terms of content will be groundbreaking, though many new insights will be presented. The true value of this course is in developing the technical vocabulary and fluency necessary to engage in serious academic discussions of advanced finance, economics, and law. Prof Zhang is also superb - one of the sharpest professors I've had at Yale, and also very understanding. Workload is significant, but you get out what you put in.",
    "Yes! You don't have to be great at Chinese, but definitely be interested\/willing to learn a lot of technical business vocabulary and read a lot about business! CHNS 169 is much easier if you took the first part of the sequence (I did not, and it was difficult starting off in the middle). Expect quite a bit of homework too.The professor is really sweet, understanding, and flexible. He is pretty funny too! Overall, great higher chinese level class.",
    "Definitely take this. Can be a bit challenging but is overall really rewarding and you will learn a lot. The professors fantastic and really knowledgable. Easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far",
    "Take it!",
    "Absolutely, because business Chinese is a critical skill, and the class is great."
