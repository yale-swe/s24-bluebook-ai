    "ARCH 494 is a self-motivated studio, requiring an individual to pick and develop a concept throughout the semester.",
    "Have to take it, so yes. I would choose it over writing a senior thesis.",
    "Required, so yes. But remember, no professor or TAs will help you make decisions. One thing to learn is that this is a whole semester worth of one project and it always benefits you more if you commit to one idea and keep developing it rather than being all over the place until the last week.",
    "Well you have to do it to graduate. The competition is fun, but at the end of the day its all about presentation and graphics.",
    "Its mandatory so you have to take it. The success of the class is largely determined by the project you have to complete for the competition that is selected for that year. However, the competition is your opportunity to make a project that is a full expression of your ideas and problem solving skills. The class is only a resource and guide for completing the competition so take full advantage of the professors and TAs to do so.",
    "ARCH 494 is a competition studio. There is the potential for this course to be great, but it depends entirely on the professor and the competition. Unfortunately, I found the experience very frustrating and unsatisfying. Steven did not seem to care at all about his students (except for a select few of his 'favorites' which he quickly selected), and was completely apathetic to our projects. If you choose to be a design major, be warned that you CAN learn a lot, but you must work hard independently and must not let Steven Harris's insolence and indifference get you down. I think that writing a thesis would probably have been much more fulfilling (personally and academically). But, either way, good luck! You have made it a long way in architecture and only have one semester left to go, so try to make the best of it no matter any unfortunate circumstances!",
