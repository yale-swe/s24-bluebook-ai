   "comments": [
    "Poverty and Politics in US Cities is an excellent course for those interested in urban social policy. Upon completing the course, you will most definitely have a much more in-depth and nuanced perspective on what poverty means and the effects of various sets of poverty policy on America's urban poor.",
    "If you have any interest in cities or poverty (or even if not) then you really ought to take this. A class with Professor Horan is a must. Above average workload. The grading is not as bad as her reputation might make it seem she just doesn't inflate grades the way many in her department do. Most importantly, take this because she is one of the few professors who will challenge and push back on your ideas in seminar and in papers. This means you might actually learn a thing or two!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. You will learn a lot about poverty and probably more about the challenges to creating successful anti-poverty policy. The class is readings, reading responses, discussions and two papers. Most of the readings are very interesting and those that are more technical seem to be important for understanding how poverty policy works (or doesn't). Professor Horan is excellent and gives a lot of feedback on your writing. She also edits paper drafts and clearly cares a great deal about students' learning and producing quality work.",
    "",
    "Take it if you're prepared to work hard. Expectations are high, but if you do the readings and participate in class discussions, you'll find the course rewarding.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. This course is not as policy heavy as other courses on public policy might be -- it provides a good mix of lenses from which poverty is assessed. Professor Horan also makes some good book\/author recommendations to guide you if you are particularly interested in the topics from one week. Furthermore, the opening discussions we had each week about \"poverty in the news\" and current affairs were very eye-opening about where the public discourse and policies stand today. I took away a lot of important perspectives from this course, but also realized how much more I have to learn in order to comprehensively approach poverty -- including more about social movement theory, critical race theory, other sociological tools, and the history of public policy on poverty. Different segments of the semester were good introductions to many topics related to poverty; however, they would only be the jumping off point for more specialized study, for example of community development organizations or mobilization by the poor against poverty.",
    "This is an incredible class. While it is certainly a challenge--the readings can be dense and the essay prompts difficult--Professor Horan is without a doubt one of the best professors at Yale, and brings an unrivaled arsenal of knowledge and passion. (Be forewarned: your comments should be well-reasoned or you will be challenged!) A class for those interested in serious, rigorous study of an important and persistent issue.",
    "For those interested in the issue, this class is likely worth it just for the accompanying increase in knowledge. While Professor Horan can be difficult, she is incredibly sharp, willing to challenge students to improve their argument, and by the end of the class, her teaching will ensure that you know much of what there is to know about poverty policy.",
    "Great class that everyone needs to take. Come prepared to do the work though.",
    "I strongly recommend PLSC 280 for students who are interested in seriously thinking about anti-poverty policy in the United States. This course will make you think rigorously not just about the politics surrounding those policies, but also about what the appropriate metrics of success are, and how to actually measure success or failure. Professor Horan is brilliant, demanding, and an excellent seminar leader. This is certainly one of the best classes offered by the Department.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in urban poverty and want to have a better grasp of policy and how it impacts inequality. The readings are super interesting.",
    "This is a great class, even if you don't have a political science background. We started off with ethnographies, which grounded the semester's discussion in people and not just statistics. Professor Horan is wicked smart and cares a lot about her students. For example, she often integrates the weekly reading responses into the seminar discussions, and she provides good critical feedback on writing pieces. I feel like I have a decent grasp on the issues surrounding urban poverty now, and am very grateful that I took this class. Highly recommend. Expect to learn a lot!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to become more informed about America's anti-poverty politics\/policies and is willing to put in the work to learn. The readings were all interesting, the discussions were often lively, and Professor Horan is the absolute best (demanding but kind and very very knowledgable).",
    "I would recommend this class. The readings are all very interesting and will give you a broad overview of issues relating to poverty throughout the US. I would recommend also opting in to doing a research paper for the class rather than the assigned essays, which seem to be less rewarding than choosing a topic you know you are already interested in.",
    "The class is a must take to think critically and engage with conversations of poverty from all angles, I would absolutely recommend this class."
