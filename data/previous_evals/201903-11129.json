   "comments": [
    "This course pushed my comfort zone as this is not my field, but I learned a lot from listening to my classmates and Professor Allen. Particularly, as a social historian, the intellectual and political histories included on the syllabus were good introductions.",
    "The course made me think about the practice of history in an entirely new way. This was the first opportunity I've had to engage in historical theory in a constructive, applied way and to really dive into complicated monographs. Prof. Allen is by far the best seminar leader I've ever seen, and her feedback on my writing is more detailed, constructive, and substantive than I have seen in any other course.",
    "- A proper grasp of recent scholarship on modern Europe published within the last ten years, an awareness of the methodological, thematic, and stylistic trends\/focuses in the field. - Improvement in my writing and analytical skills",
    "This course helped me to think more deeply about modern Europe epistemologically, chronologically, and spatially. I found it to be extremely helpful to my foundational understandings of European historiography. It also gave me valuable insights into future pedagogical paths for 20th century European courses I may craft in the future. The last class, in which the necessity of each week's reading was discussed and debated as a group was especially helpful to my understanding of how to put a course together."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think maybe spacing out the 500 page books that are clustered towards the start would be helpful, or swapping a few out. Even reading quickly or skimming for important sections this was a lot when combined with other graduate courses. Also maybe a few more books, or even a week, that address social history and\/or gender. But I thought the format of the course, discussion led by students etc. was helpful. Particularly the partner discussions at the beginning of class did serve well as icebreakers, especially for those of us who are not modern historians.",
    "Strengths: Professor Allen is totally brilliant, the class is impeccably structured, and the readings are extraordinary. Weaknesses: I'm not sure that the peer review was really worth a whole class, and I think the journal analysis could have been replaced with a more constructive assignment. I enjoyed the presentations, but they tended to be a little bit disorganized, probably because of the wide scope of the assignment and very limited time.",
    "STRENGTHS Our written assignments were thoughtfully constructed and paced appropriately throughout the semester. We had an opportunity to improve and clarify our thinking and our writing because we had three separate assignments rather than just one final paper at the end of the semester. When class discussions were good, they were really good. Professor Allen guided discussions without ever becoming imposing or lecturing. As a result, she gives her students the freedom\/responsibility to make or break the quality of in-class discussion. WEAKNESSES At times, in-class discussion lagged. I'm not sure whether this was because students were zoning out or because it wasn't always clear what exactly we were discussing. I think spending some time at the beginning of class recapitulating an author's argument rather than diving into the class's critique of the work would have been helpful. The reading list for this course wasn't terrific. Only using scholarship written in the past ten years imposes limitations, and I appreciate how this focus on recent scholarship is helpful for students who hope to teach history in a college setting. But some of the works we read were mediocre, and I struggled to engage with their arguments fully. I think this is also a reason why some of our in-class discussions lagged.",
    "I did not especially find the group peer editing in class helpful. While I appreciated my peer's comments, they had far different points of focus than the grading criteria and therefore did not necessarily better my paper as an assignment. Additionally, the in-class portion seemed redundant due to the in-depth comments that we had already received.",
    "A good selection of works was undercut by an excessive focus on discussing minute issues of little significance rather than assessing the importance of works to the broader historical narrative and the accuracy and validity of the authors assessments."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes! Although more tricky if not your field, still a useful introduction into high level thinking on modern Europe.",
    "Yes, if you have a strong grounding in European history and are willing to put a whole lot of work in. You will gain more from this class than from any other history seminar at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Allen provided me with the most thorough and thoughtful feedback on my written work I have received in either my undergraduate or postgraduate education. It's not so common to find a professor who truly *reads* her student's work, and I would say one should take this class regardless of their interest in European history for this fact alone.",
    "Absolutely. Any student, undergraduate or graduate student, who is interested in modern European history would find this course absolutely essential to the more advanced study of European history. PhD students especially gain a lot from this course due to the strong focus on pedagogy."
