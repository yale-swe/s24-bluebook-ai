   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who will be using these techniques in their own research. Great way to learn the necessary theory\/background info.",
    "Would recommend - nice to have general knowledge about these techniques even if they aren't your primary interest",
    "We learned about many different new techniques in biophysics involving various forms of spectroscopy. Its a good class with a manageable workload and useful subject matter.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Optical spectroscopy methods are becoming increasingly more prevalent in basic science research. Even in the absence of using these techniques on your own, it is important to understand how they work in order to critically evaluate the work of others.",
    "I would not recommend it. It was too much work for not actually learning very much.",
    "It is an introduction to various optical spectroscopy techniques like CD, single molecule fluorescence and a variety of microscopies. It's pretty fast paced and a lot of material is covered. I would recommend it for students interested in these techniques.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, mainly because of the instructor.",
    "This course covers is a very good overview of many different optical systems in use currently: their strengths, weaknesses and how they work, and the fundamentals of spectroscopy: why and how we can use light to do science. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, I thought it was excellent.",
    "You'll learn a lot about fluorescence - more than you thought you could - but also about super-resolution microscopy AND running good experiments (thinking about controls, false positives and negatives, etc).I would recommend it - you're probably going to work, but it's going to be a lot of fun and well worth it."

   "comments": [
    "Provided background on techniques I've read about, given me an arsenal of potential techniques to apply to my own research",
    "it exposed me to a variety a techniques in the field that are important to know.",
    "The beginning where Liz went over spectroscopy and the science behind it was helpful, but beyond that, I learned nothing useful.",
    "I anticipate using fluorescently-labeled proteins and microscopy, so it may should be helpful.",
    "This course significantly broadened my knowledge of biophysics, as I had little knowledge before. I am unsure the extent to which this will contribute to my dissertation or research, but I feel it will be very helpful for preparing my antithesis for the MBB qualifying exam.",
    "I can read papers with fluorescence experiments and understand them. I didn't forget a single thing that I learned in the course - and that's saying a lot.I think it was a combination of my own personal interest but also the interest of the instructor. She was extremely knowledgeable, and although she talked fast, I never missed a thing.Even more so than Methods and Logic (the MB&B version), I learned more about thinking about and running experiments in this class than in any other course before."
