His extremely busy schedule makes it a little hard to communicate via email, but if you show up to weekly one-on-one meetings with him you should be golden.",
    "yeah i would recommend it. i'd recommend taking it with maybe one other cs course, and try for a holistic goal for the semester -- i took databases, machine learning, and this project (my project was on big data) so it was cool that everything i took was related in some way. you can do as much or as little as you want pretty much for the thesis. build a relationship with your advisor and you'll have a good time"
