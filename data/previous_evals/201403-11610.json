   "comments": [
    "more real life experience would be better",
    "Independent work integration",
    "The course is excellent. The professors were very practical and the course was very engaging. I would recommend to assign a maximum of two or three students per group for project assignments. Thanks",
    "The Professor should provide more feedback to students. Setting up meetings outside of class to get a better understanding of each groups project would be helpful. It very much felt as though we as students were the only individuals providing our classmates with feedback, would have liked some more guidance from the professors.",
    "I think that the process of going through the various drafts of the evaluation plan was helpful. I definitely see the relevance of the course. I didn't find the lecture very engaging.",
    "Denise and Kathleen are both very well-versed and experienced in this field, so I felt I was learning valuable information. I really appreciated the ability to receive hands-on experience through this course by learning theory and methods in class and applying it to an actual evaluation program creation. The class was rather large, which was not always a problem, but I would have enjoyed more discussion based lectures. This would not have been feasible given the class size, but I would have learned more from lectures in class and would have spent less time outside of the classroom understanding concepts. Overall, a fantastic course and I really appreciated and enjoyed both Denise and Kathleen.",
    "This course has a lot of potential. It's an important concept but poorly presented. Much of the time I was confused and used internet resources to reinforce. The lectures are disorganized and the few times we broke into group work, the tasks didn't quite align with our projects or at least help us understand the components. The assigned readings were not of great use.",
    "It is a practical course intended to give students real experience evaluating a real organization. However, the lack of feedback provided throughout left students not knowing how to proceed. The lectures could have been more exciting, too.",
    "This course was terrible. I chose it because I thought it was going to give me tangible skills but it did not. The manner in which is was taught was infuriating. The readings assigned and the slides for each lecture were all over the map and very wordy. The materials need consolidated. It would be helpful it one or two very good evaluation plans were used as examples for the course and followed throughout the entirety of the course. As each new subject is presented via powerpoint, the class as a whole should go over that specific section in the example evaluation(s). The breakout sessions are infuriating because they often had no applicability to the actual lesson and wasted time that could have been used for group work on the evaluation plan or time spent with the professor or TA to get feedback since little to none was given elsewhere. I'm truly disappointed that Yale offers such a course after the numerous bad reviews and am even more disappointed that I wasted a precious elective choice on taking this course.",
    "Not a lot of gradual guidance with the evaluation plan",
    "strength: - no other class like this weakness: - so much information shared - not organized well in folders. - lacking regular feedback to improve final project - the powerpoint presentations need to be revamped and standardized. Don't use bright pink.",
    "Good course overall, but I thought some of the break out activities were not very helpful.",
    "It was a great practical course, in which we had the opportunity to work with a real organizations, and make a evaluation design for their needs. It would be good if the class had some potential organizations already lined up that we could choose from, and that they have clear what they want to be evaluated in their own programs.",
    "In theory, this course would provide significant insight into program evaluation. Didactically, the materials taught in lecture helped guide my knowledge about evaluation but I learned primarily through the semester-long evaluation project. This course could be improved with more application of evaluation skills in class and through a more dynamic teaching style. The breakout sessions in particular were not helpful.",
    "The classroom lectures were very scattered and the breakaway sections usually did not seem relevant and were also very disorganized. Reading assignments were very long and didn't always seem necessary. The general concept and structure of the class is good, but it was not always executed well.",
    "Strengths- Good overview to research and evaluation methodology, it was nice to have the freedom to choose an evaluation topic of interest Weaknesses- The focus of the class is writing an evaluation, not actually doing the evaluation. To my knowledge, most groups do not actually do the evaluation so the evaluation project ends up being more theoretical, as opposed to an opportunity to do applied work. Improvements- Professor Steven should find a list of organizations who are interested and ready to be evaluated. This would increase the chances of us actually doing the evaluation when the class finishes. Give us in class time to work on evaluation.",
    "At the beginning of the semester we were told that often times during class we would be allocated time to work with our group on the health evaluation plan. This seems like it would have been useful as we would have been able to obtain feedback during our conversations with the professor present. As it was we were not given such time, but rather given example worksheets and\/or mini in-class projects to work on. These did not prove to be of much value. The lectures felt like they were overloaded with information and did not flow. Learning about the professors own work is interesting, but would often drag on and much of the class would feel lost or tuned out. I would like to see the class organized so that it is more of a workshop orientation rather than a lecture format.",
    "This course was very disappointing. The breakout activities we had during the course did not tie very well with the material the professor chose to lecture on. I would have liked some more attention given to the lecture portion of the class as opposed to spending class time talking about the Ebola epidemic or some other topic that does not correlate to anything.",
    "Good course, well structured.",
    "Not much clarity about requirements for assignments.",
    "The course material was interesting, but the format of how the material was presented was not always very interesting.",
    "Strengths: Good insight into the logistics of carrying out a research questions. Real world experience and concepts applied to reality. Weaknesses: The rhythm of the course was not smooth. The lectures seemed intuitive and the readings were repetitive. I didn't feel like I knew what I was doing till the end.",
    "The evaluation project was really interesting to work on and I am proud to be able to take that experience into my career. The slides were dense but provide great information for anyone who plans to work in evaluation. I didn't always find the break out sessions useful, but I did like the opportunity to interact with my classmates so perhaps those exercises just need to be refined a bit? It would also be helpful to shift the timeline for the class because we didn't really have much time to discuss and refine our methods, which was the bulk of the project.",
    "There needs to be more feedback on work that is turned in.",
    "This course offered a lot of good information and ideas, but it was not well executed. Lectures did not flow smoothly, group activities did not feel well planned out. It was difficult to take away anything from the class, and to understand how the lectures should connect with the project. However, it was helpful to go through the motions of carrying out the evaluation and it was a valuable experience overall."

    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0she was great",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Kind. Genuine. Can give more specific feedback",

    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0I thought that Denise was very helpful and knowledgeable. She clearly had a lot of experience on evaluations and gave good feedback.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Fantastic instructor. She does program evaluation for a living and therefore brings her professional experience into the classroom. I really enjoyed learning from her.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise has a vast experience as an evaluator. Her feedback can be vague.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0I'm assuming that she knows the material well but she is a terrible communicator and ineffective at transmitting knowledge to her students. She gave almost no feedback to our project even after we asked for it and she committed to providing it via email. She did not take the advice of the students when we gave her feedback halfway through the semester. She should not be allowed to teach another course at the university.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Very responsive to students concerns if you reach out",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise Stevens is a great instructor!! She was always very helpful, giving us feedback on how to orient our evaluations when we needed help. She is an expert on the subject, and it was great to be in her class!",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0 I was disappointed with the teaching style of the course. Denise is very likable and knowledgeable but does not communicate that knowledge well. Lectures were very dry and readings were dense and not particularly relevant to topics taught in lecture.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Lectures were very disorganized, however general student feedback was good. The professor was always willing to answer questions and offer guidance.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Strengths- Nice, friendly Weaknesses- Not really engaging Improvements- Please try to be more engaging. Also act more confident and assertive.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0I felt the professor and the TF were kind and wanted to be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0While I am sure the professor is quite knowledgeable about program evaluation, it was not evident while she was teaching. There are times students would ask questions and it was evident the professor just used the same slides over and over again and failed to look back at her material or she would ask her assistant what she meant to write.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Good!",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0The class projects are great, but the slide shows are not the best.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0The professor and TA made a great team and were very responsive. However, it was difficult to know how I was doing in the class because we didn't get grades for all of our assignments although there was always constructive feedback.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0The instructor clearly has had a lot of experience and knowledge on the topic, and is very helpful one on one. However, she had a lot of difficulty communicating clearly to the class. Changes to the syllabus and deadlines were not immediately updated or clearly announced causing a lot of confusion. Requirements for the assignments were not clear either, as they were often different from what was written on the syllabus or the assignment itself."

    "yes",
    "For community health interested",
    "This course develops your analytic abilities and collaboration skills. Theories and concepts learned in this course are easily translated to other fields on public health. I found that I used this course material in other classes, and definitely in my professional life as well.",
    "Kathleen was the TA for the course and she was such a big asset. She provided in depth feedback with great detail and was key in clarifying a lot of the concepts. I recommend this course to any students that will be involved with local, community programs. Learning how to create an evaluation plan is a helpful tool. With just some re-organizing of the course, this course would be great.",
    "I would not recommend this class the way it is currently set up. I think program evaluation is an important concept and I have definitely learned skills by taking this course, but I think it should be either a year-long course in order to give students more time to consider organizations the would like to work with or somehow structured differently in order to keep students engaged and allow for more continuous instructor-student feedback. Despite all this, I did enjoy the class overall. I am even considering a career in program evaluation!",
    "This course is terrible. You will not learn the skills that it suggests you will. Do not take it and seek out another course (such as Dr. Humphries) that covers similar topics.",
    "Not very helpful. Do not take",
    "Overall, I thought the evaluation project was a good experience. In the beginning, I was pretty confused about how to go about the evaluation project, but if you reach out to the professor and\/or Kathleen, they will provide a lot of advice and help. Just be proactive.",
    "In this class you choose an organization to which you will develop an evaluation plan according to their needs. I would highly recommend it to another student because it is a practical course, which teaches you tools that are fundamental to a public health professional, and is something we will most probably use in our professional practice.",
    "I would recommend taking Community Health Program Planning over this course as I hear that it is didactically equivalent but more engaging.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because I do not feel like I gained any skills that I have not already learned in other public health classes at Yale School of Public Health.",
    "A good introduction to evaluation methodology. I would recommend you take this class if you actually have an evaluation project or if you already have the connection with a project that needs to be evaluated.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it was changed to be more of a workshop format whereby the evaluation was done in part, during class time where the lessons could be learned in real time.",
    "I would not recommend this course as it was unsettling how classes were not beneficial to learning the material.",
    "Recommend it!",
    "Easy class, for the most part.",
    "Important information for the decision making process in a non-profit setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I would suggest choosing a project you're passionate about and a group who also feel the same way, as this project can take a significant amount of time. It is most interesting to choose a project you actually intend to carry out and have a lot of background knowledge in, but that isn't necessary.",
    "This course offers useful information on carrying out an evaluation from start to finish, and the semester long project is very helpful in applying the concepts in class to the real world. For the experience you gain I would recommend this course."
