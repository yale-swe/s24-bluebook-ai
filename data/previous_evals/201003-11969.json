   "comments": [
    "Excellent course--take it.",
    "I would recommend this class, but be prepared that it is a lot of reading and class tends to drag sometimes. It would be better if it wasn't early in the morning. That being said, you will learn a lot about how American politics really operates.",
    "A great course which really touches on the intersection of politics and markets on both the domestic and international scale-- it really made me think more critically about a lot of the issues that we read about daily in the papers.",
    "This class is great if you're interested in the relationship between government and the private sector. It does require a fair amount of economic knowledge. Discussions may be a bit dry, but if you are interested in the material and try to engage the professor and the readings it should be a great experience.",
    "A fairly dull very poli-sci-y seminar that may hold your interest if you're deeply passionate about dense research texts. Not that much work though.",
    "Yes, if you have a background in finance.",
    "A highly recommended seminar. The reading load is on the heavier side, if not impossible, and the discussions are quite rigorous. Swenson does not hold back when grading your reading responses, making you really have to work to develop your thoughts.The writing requirements are very reasonable. Just five two-page reading responses, for your choice of any five weeks' worth of reading. If you write fluff, though, don't expect to come away with the easy A.The one caveat (and this wouldn't hold me back from taking this class if I were doing this all over again) would be that Swenson is overtly liberal and makes basically no attempt to conceal it. Unlike some professors who make an effort to hide their ideologies, Swenson is an unabashed big-government liberal who will jump in on all the discussions and make it quite obvious when he disagrees with you. There have been several anecdotes floating around the class that you also tend to get a better grade on your writing when you make a point that Swenson agrees with, although I can't quite confirm that.",
    "An interesting survey class with room for discussion. Take this class if you enjoy discussing theoretical politics from a liberal standpoint.",
    "every political decision is the product of different groups forming coalitions with each other to accomplish their goals. that is the entire class. if you find it interesting to see how this happens in different instances, the class is for you.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student considering the seminar."
