    "A very fun, lively class which helps develop your oral and written French. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "French 140 is a good course if you're strong in French but want to review some more basic grammar before taking an L5 or a literature course. The texts are not very engaging or relevant but your French will definitely improve.",
    "A thorough review of basic French grammar, and a course aimed to increase your ability to read french books. I would recommend this course, as you learn a lot for the amount of work you need to put in. It is a very well designed course. And, the course is lots of fun :)!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I enjoyed the readings, I enjoyed the dynamic of the class, and I learned a lot.",
    "Definitely. Its a good balance of reading, writing, and speaking. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "TAKE THE COURSE FROM PROFESSOR HOFFMANN. SERIOUSLY. Most adorable human ever. She is so so so sweet and nice. Great teacher.",
    "French 140is an everyday class that will have you doing work almost every single night including reading and grammatical exercises. In class, you must have read the text to be able to participate in the conversations, so you cannot take the class lightly. However, if you wish to improve your French, then 140 will absolutely provide you with the environment to do so as long as you dedicate yourself to the coursework.",
    "Do it! It's great fun but if you were placed in L4 but feel you can do L5 definitely go for it!",
    "The teacher is great. The reading is very manageable and there wasnt too much grammar. The conversations that you have in class makes it feel more relaxed."
