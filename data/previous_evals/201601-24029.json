   "comments": [
    "This course is an overview of different approaches to questions about free speech. Beginning with Galileo and ending with a discussion of recent campus protests, Prof. Rosenfeld shares the works of a wide variety of thinkers who have written extensively on the right to be heard (or lack thereof). I would strongly recommend taking this course if you have any interest in the history of dissent movements and how both legal and philosophical ideas about free speech have amplified\/silenced the voices of those who dare to speak controversially. It also helps you view campus discussions about free speech through a more thoughtful lens.",
    "Your classmates really make or break this course. This year, discussions were very productive and cordial.",
    "I really liked the class in the form it took this year (since there were only 12 of us, we moved to a seminar format). The spirited debates over hot-button issues really made the class, and I don't think it would have been nearly as good in a lecture. Professor Rosenfeld is great and gives a ton of feedback on the written work. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Very interesting lens through which to interpret history. Found very very relevant to modern times. Professor Rosenfeld is very smart and a very great teacher. Take it if you want to be dedcated to a class. I took it Credit\/D and still did reading 100% because it was interesting and you couldn't really get away with not doing it.",
    "Highly recommend this class. Really great history course, only made better by Professor Rosenfeld.",
    "Take this class. It'll be massively worth your time. I really appreciated the opportunity this class gave to bring students from across political and ideological spectrums to come together to intellectually explore the questions of censorship and free speech, particularly as they relate to recent and current events. Rosenfeld leads a great seminar discussion, grades fairly and is incredibly helpful. Definitely visit her office hours and ask for feedback. She really takes the time to listen to your questions and concerns, and is a wonderful person to talk to. If you decide to take this class, think about a paper topic early. If the syllabus stays the same, you'll have a pretty free choice in final paper, but this can be a blessing in disguise. Great class, definitely worth shopping!"
