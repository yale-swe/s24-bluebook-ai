    "Everyone in the social sciences should take this course, whether you are a GA major or not. Justin rocks. He's funny and cares a lot about making sure you understand the material. The problem sets take time, maybe 4-5 hours per week if you do them on your own, but you really learn the material by doing them and they're kind of fun. Highly recommend to everyone! This is low-key one of my favorite classes at Yale, even coming from a non-quantitative background.",
    "Good introduction to stastics, a somewhat boring lecture (the nature of the material unfortunately), but worthwhile. The homework is the worst part, being tedious and practically useless for actually evaluating one's knowledge of the material when half the points can be taken off for seemingly no reason.",
    "Yes. Take it and take it seriously and you'll learn a lot of cool, applicable math. The PSETs took a while and the grading was VERY specific.",
    "Justin Thomas was a great professor who managed to make stats really entertaining. The workload wasn't too bad at all and I actually enjoyed going to class everyday thanks to Prof. Thomas. The skills you learn in this class are very useful if you need to read and understand social science papers and\/or if you want a basic foundation in statistics. The only downside to this class was the grading. There wasn't a single assignment, exam or pset, I got back that didn't have a mistake in grading in it. There was never any explanation as to why responses were marked incorrect, and frequently it turned out that I was actually correct, just the TA marked it wrong. Overall a great class, but it's a shame that I always had to check my graded assignments as the grade I received almost always was incorrect.",
    "GLBL 121 is an intro level stats class that covers the more basic material that you would learn in an Econometrics class with more depth. It is targeted to GLBL majors, but I would also recommend it to any other majors interested in getting acquainted with stats. For Econ majors, it might even be useful to take this before Econometrics if you are unfamiliar with stats. This class will probably be your favorite in the semester if you do decide to take it. Professor Justin Thomas is engaging, interesting and an amazing lecturer. He makes your life very simple by providing you with all the guidance and material that you need to do well in the class. There is no mystery to it: go to class, study the material and there is no reason not to do well in this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking to learn more about real-world applications of statistics, any social scientists, or to anyone looking for a QR in which you really learn a new set of skills!",
    "It's a cool stats intro class that is not just about learning formulas to plug in. The theoretical stuff is packaged to be digestible.",
    "Manageable stats class, nicely-paced, significant but manageable workload and material, amazing professor, good TAs. Section wasn't mandatory, but incredibly helpful. Some of the material could get theoretically confusing\/challenging, but Professor Thomas did a good job going over most of the challenging concepts in enough detail. Exams and PSETs weren't easy, but were fair.",
    "Overall, a solid survey of quantitative methods and Stata. Justin Thomas is an absolute joy, and he truly makes this class worthwhile. For people without strong math or stat backgrounds, GLBL 121 strikes a good balance between intro statistics (which is so easy that it's barely worth your credit) and econometrics (which is much more advanced and proof-based). The problem sets and exams are not difficult in terms of the material, but they are difficult to score well on. The biggest down side of this course is that the grading is erratic and harsh (especially when Tara is grading). I had to get three problem sets and my midterm exam drastically edited because they were scored so incorrectly (some answers that were inarguably correct were marked wrong, and I would lose over five points, etc.). Professor Thomas is receptive to making corrections, but the downside is that there is no way to check how your final exam was graded, so your final grade is a crapshoot. Aside from the messy grading situation though, I got a decent amount out of the course. Manageable workload, great professor, good material.",
    "Justin Thomas is the reason you should pick this stats class over other stats classes. The grading by the TFs can be a little harsh, but overall JT is such a great professor it's worth taking the class just to have him find a way to make one of the typically most boring topics ever seem both interesting and applicable. He rocks. Take this class if you need a stats class!",
    "Interesting, fun class that is hard, but important material and there is definitely support when you are struggling with concepts.",
    "The class is a really good introduction to statistics and Stata through the lens of interesting questions and studies in the Social Sciences. The problem sets are very manageable, but time-consuming. I enjoyed the class a lot more than I thought I would.",
    "I really enjoyed AQA. I had never taken a statistics class before, but I never felt like I was struggling to understand the material. Professor Thomas was great - engaging in class and super helpful in office hours. Additionally, his exams were very straightforward, with no big tricks or anything like that, which was nice. I learned not only the basics of statistical analysis but also how to evaluate research, which I think will be very beneficial in the future. I would definitely recommend this class to another student!",
    "Yes. It is a good stats course with a great professor.",
    "The best intro stats course at Yale.",
    "Very low-level statistics\/QR class that I would only recommend if a) you are GLBL major and you have to take it b) you need a super easy QR or c) you want to learn a little bit about statistics\/research methods but don't have the ability to take higher level course.",
    "The material is boring, but the class is great because of Professor Thomas. He is the best part about the class.",
    "Amazing class! Anyone even remotely interested in the social sciences should take this. Professor Thomas has been one of the best teachers I've had during my time at Yale. These skills are so important and relevant to students as consumers and potentially future producers of information\/research. Professor Thomas is super dynamic and accessible to his students, hilarious, and great at explaining things. The problem sets are actually fun because the data used is so fascinating.",
    "For any social science students who needs a QR credit, this is the perfect class. If you've taken AP Stats in high school, it's pretty much the same material, but even if you haven't, it's not a difficult class and there's a lot of help available. The concepts are all very applicable, especially for reading academic papers, and the workload is manageable. The tests are also very straightforward.",
    "Useful, good class.",
    "I would definitely recommend GLBL 121 to other students. Statistics is a very applicable subject to most jobs and even just daily life, reading the news and other sources of data. My experience in GLBL 121 definitely felt better than what I heard other students say about the general stats courses.",
    "If you need a QR and you actually want it to be vaguely useful, it's a good class. I'm not a global affairs major so I just took it as a QR, and I think you get out of it what you put into it to some extent. That being said, the class really requires studying outside of class pretty heavily because Prof Thomas explains things a certain way, but that's not how he wants you to explain things on the exam. He wants super specific textbook definitions.",
    "Regardless of whether you're a Global Affairs majo, AQA is a great intro to statistics as applied to the social sciences. The course is structured fairly along with fair midterms and finals. The TA's and Professor Thomas were all great. It's a \"definite take\" if you want\/need a good and manageable introduction to harder statistical concepts, or just for your future knowledge.",
    "Absolutely take the class. No matter your field, you will encounter statistics - the numbers will be used for you and against you. This is your chance to understand how they are generated, and what they actually mean, in a friendly and thorough classroom setting.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. AND TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR THOMAS. He is hands-down the kindest and most engaged professor I've ever had. He single-handedly transformed otherwise boring statistics material into a course that is super well-organized, compelling, and relevant. His passion for the class was effusive, and he was really adroit at signaling which aspects of the course could help us answer certain policy q's, inform our understanding of elections statistics, compare discrimination claims, etc. I so appreciated how he would call on each individual member of the 100-person lecture by name honestly, just wow, that effort says volumes about his commitment to us as students. Problem sets were very time-consuming, and could have been better designed; I felt like I was answering basically the same question with tedious calculations over and over again, and not thinking conceptually enough. Other than that, though, this course is fantastic. If there is any intro-statistics course to take at Yale, it's this one.",
    "I was very impressed by professor Thomass lectures he maintained a high level of energy throughout each class and it was always, always clear that he was passionate about statistics AND about teaching us statistics. I learned so much this semester I had no statistics previously and found the material both interesting and really important. I loved that the data sets we worked with were real and related to issues that I cared about. I loved working with STATA, the statistical software we used. Its great. The grading system for this class sucks. It really, really sucks. The problem sets are graded out of 5 but take hours to complete (~ 3 hours), and you get one point off if you make a single conceptual error. Id estimate about 30 conceptual errors are possible on each pset. No one gets a -25, but people who put in a huge amount of effort dont do well. The psets are curved so it is fair you are graded relative to your classmates, but it is still infuriating at times. Angering. I encourage everyone to take a statistics class, but not necessarily this one (unless you are doing it as a global affairs major requirement). If you do take this one, consider taking it pass\/fail.",
    "!A: Impressions VERY USEFUL\/APPLICABLE class but ARBITRARY GRADING. Pretty easy material though which was good. COLD CALLING in class was a nightmare. Loved Justins enthusiasm though. PROBLEM SETS: They were quite lengthy but I thought they were very useful for reviewing class material. The grading on them was incredibly frustrating. One TA would say one thing, and the other would say the opposite. I would meet with one TA and he would say he wouldnt take off points on such a silly mistake (EXAMPLE: I wrote 28% or something instead of .28 and I got some points off since I didnt write a proportion). Grading was rough in this class, but not because the material was hard! Eugene: He is literally one of the best TAs I have ever had. Get him for incredible instruction. You also wont feel like youre getting hit with an axe when you get the midterm or problem setS back. GO TO OFFICE HOURS THE DAY BEFORE THE PSETS ARE DUE. Tara: I had some issues with her picky grading. Ive talked to about 6 or 7 other students in the class and they all agree with me. She was fine in section, but she was completely unfair with all these minor issues that we would get points off for, which of course did not reflect our lack of understanding with the material. COLD CALLING: Expect it every single class. I pretty much always knew the answer to questions Justin would ask us, but I almost never wanted to contribute. He would always make you feel guilty while he narrated the class like a movie (I see all the eyes go down, suddenly the notes become more interesting) in reference to us as we all tried to avoid being called upon. What an awful experience.",
    "Yes I recommend this class",
    "It's a great survey of basic statistics and extremely useful for future classes. Moreover, it's taught very well. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, even if you don't ned it for a major requirement. I always wanted to get around to taking a statistics class, and am very happy this is the one I chose. I feel as though it would have been much more grueling if it was another more theoretical stats class, as the application to political science\/global affairs really helps make it more interesting (especially with elections coming up). But I would warn that the problem sets are very long a tough.",
    "Definitely not a gut QR. However, if you're a non-Global, non-STEM kid looking to get your QR out of the way, this isn't your worst option. The exams were really similar to the work we did in class and in the review sessions. If you study a lot and make sure you know how to do the problems, you should be fine. Just do all of the work.",
    "This class is a statistics course. The material itself is not very interesting and the class is difficult, but the professor is entertaining and friendly and there are plenty of resources to help you.",
    "I think this is a great course for anyone. Though I took it for my major requirements, I think this is a really good way to learn statistics and be able to apply it to future work."
