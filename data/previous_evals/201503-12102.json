   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to learn German (you should, it's great).",
    "Sure! Learned a lot, looking to take German L. 2 next semester as well.",
    "Would recommend: I feel like I can now have basic conversations in German; if I were a tourist in Germany, I think I could get by.",
    "GMAN 110 was tough with the workload especially because it was every day but it was fun and I didn't mind having it everyday because of that.",
    "I would recommend GMAN 110 to a fellow student but would caution them that the course moves quickly and there is a fair amount of small homework assignments. These can be time-consuming but are important for measuring what you've learned in class. The class in general has a heavier workload than most Yale classes as far as frequency of assignments but not in terms of difficulty.",
    "This course didnt live up to my expectation of a Yale class. Take the intensive L1\/L2 if you pick up languages easily and are committed to learning German.",
    "Yes I recommend it. Good course. Prepare for a fair amount of work (class every day plus assignments all the time) Strengths: lots of practice and different types of exercises (final project, homework, email buddy, video assignments..etc) kept things interesting. Improvements: more spoken practice - I feel I still don't have enough confidence to go out there and speak freely. Random due dates for assignment meant lots of students missed deadlines."
