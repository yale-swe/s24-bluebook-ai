    "If you want one of your DS sections to have a lighter workload, stay with Manning. You will rarely feel very compelled to have finished the reading. Sounds bad, but honestly it might not be the worst thing when you're trying to deal with the whole college transition. On the other hand, I also am not sure what I even got out of this section..his insistence on making the thesis the first sentence of your paper maybe? Essays had minimal comments, and it got worse over the course of the class. The grades, however, got better by policy. Discussions were generally very lacking. Manning is more of a history professor, not very knowledgeable on the texts even though he repeatedly heaped praise on Herodotus. If you get him, I recommend switching out unless the lighter workload and easy grade sounds really appealing. Slanski highly recommended! (She subbed for us once and it was Really really nice guy though--everyone loved him on a personal level.",
    "It is a challenging but comprehensive study of ancient historical thought.",
    "Read Western historical and political works and philosophy spanning thousands of years. Discuss excerpts of those texts in class. I would recommend, but I'd give the stipulation that the professor largely influences the experience you will have in this class.",
    "DS H\/P changed how I view history: rather than a series of facts, I now recognize it as a sort of art, where authors collect, select, and interpret events and ideas like curators in a museum. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in this personal, interpretive side of history and who can handle a large amount of reading.",
    "More so than Phil and Lit, your H&P experience depends heavily on your professor. The texts are good, but without a strong professor they will be wasted."
