    "This course would benefit from either hydrology and biogeochemistry prerequisites or a more structured curriculum. As designed it benefited students who where advanced enough in these fields to accomplish a worthwhile project independently but greatly disadvantaged (and frustrated) those who weren't. While the team of professors had the potential to encourage collaboration across disciplines, the lack of foundational teaching within their respective disciplines only resulted in further division of the class and course.",
    "Pace of class is hard to judge. As a project course the lecture material also seemed to range in three very different directions.",
    "Things seemed a bit disorganized at first, but once we got our groups figured out I found the project-based set up of the course very helpful. I learned alot about my project focus; I came far in my knowledge base over the course of my semester. However, the knowledge gained was limited to my project (fine by me), did not retain much from the lectures\/field trips in the earlier part of the semester if they did not relate to what I was working on.",
    "There should have been more lectures. Three great professors were overseeing this course I think the students could have benefited more from their lectures.",
    "This could be an amazing class- but instead it is the worst class I've taken at Yale. The professors, particularly prof. Saiers, really don't care at all. They barely teach (Benoit and Raymond did teach a few classes each), but Saiers just had his phd students give worthless lectures. This class is an embarrassment to Yale.",
    "I really enjoyed this course; however I know that it received mixed reviews. The class is what you make of it. Providedyou have a good project and actively engage your adviser, you can take a lot away from this class.",
    "I thought the course should have spent a LOT more time focusing on using class time to brainstorm aroundthe design challenges and work with the professors during that time. The lectures didn't really feel applicable to the project I was doing and felt unnecessary.",
    "Q2: The work is entirely out-of-class, but the class is not billed as such an intense project-based course. Q5-7: Field trips did not apply \/ were not of interest to everyone, due to the project-based nature the course took on. Q8-10: The instructors disappointed us. There was so much potential to learn from the combined expertise of three of them, but they didn't coordinate the structure of the class well, or how their respective lectures would dovetail. Lectures were too few; my learning from the class was entirely from what I taught myself for my group's project. I learned next to nothing from in-class time, which made going to class seem like a waste. Q12: students interested in watershed cycles and processes would do well to look elsewhere unless they want a jump-start on a pretty intense project which could become (or give them experience for) their master's (MESc or MFS) research project.",
    "Class was unstructured and unhelpful. Instructors threw together lectures last minute (when they actually gave them - most of the class was basically an independent study). Class had great potential but ended up being a waste of time."

    "More lectures",
    "The course could be better structured\/organized. I rarely knew what we were discussing in class before arriving to the classroom. Some of the lectures were not too helpful.",
    "This really isn't a class. It's an excuse for 3 good professors to knock out their teaching load while doing no work. It's pathetic that the 3 water professors at Yale together teach one class, that doesn't meet for most of the semester, has no assigned readings, and isn't even well organized.",
    "Better organization and vision for the goals of the course.",
    "The team projects could have been better supported by readings throughout the semester. It was difficult to build on knowledge from week to week and understand course requirements without a finalized syllabus\/schedule of lecture topics.",
    "More robust lecture schedule would be helpful.",
    "The lectures.",
    "Though the course was designed to support independent projects Iwould have appreciated a syllabus with lecture topics and when (or generally when) they would be offered. I understand the professors would like to maintain flexibility to be able to address topics of interest as they arise but it hard for me to contextualize information presented outside of the independent project.",
    "Lack of guidance from instructors. We should have had more structured meetings and updates. I really felt like I was out on my own teaching myself material to complete the project and spent undue time on it.",
    "Coordination amongst the instructors, and legitimate course content. It was unfair to be so demanding with us regarding each of our projects, but not hold themselves to the same standards regarding course content and student learning. It at times seemed like the course was being run as a data-collection factory with free labor from Master's students.",
    "More guidance from the professors on projects would be very helpful.",
    "Lectures need to be given in reference to the course title: Watershed Cycles and Processes. Everything learned in the class was done so outside of class hours."
