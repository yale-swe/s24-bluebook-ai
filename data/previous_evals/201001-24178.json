    "Take it if you wanna have fun with architecture and die.",
    "Good course, if youre taking it you are probably thinking of applying to the major. it provides a good image of what the major will be like. Petit is a lot of fun, but not that helpful. Find the TA that knows the professor the best and you will be at a huge advantage as they will understand the assignments and what he is looking for (always up for question in this class) most of this class is made up of desk crits on the model you are building and reviews, there are only 3-4 lectures. if youve never studied architecture before you will feel lost on all the concepts that will not be properly explained to you",
    "This is a challenging class, and is needed if you want to major in architecture. It is really hard, but worth it once you get through the semester. You learn a lot through your own action in this class.",
    "You are assigned an architect. You read up on him (yes, they are all male architects you choose from). You pick a building and make four models.There are a few lectures and readings, a lot of desk crits where you have the opportunity to talk strategy with your TA and Emmanuel, and reviews where the learning takes place. It is debated whether Emmanuel is ever actually helpful, but in my experience he brought out the best in me.Pray that the people in your class are friendly and interesting because you will be stuck with them for the years to come. The Architecture major has incredible potential to be fun and rewarding, but it very much depends on how well you can get along with your studiomates. Solidarity.And one last thing--learn to live with the bullshit.",
    "I would recommend it only to students interested in pursuing the architecture major.",
    "I would only recommend this course to those applying for the architecture major. It was very rewarding in the end but a very very challenging course.",
    "You do not learn much in this class, and are forced to basically learn and do everything on your own. But, I enjoyed it.",
    "Only take if you plan to be an architecture major.",
    "It takes a lot of labor and learning to make models; be prepared to work late.",
    "I took this class, along with the drawing class, to decide if I wanted to apply to the major. The work wasn't too bad - you only have to make 4 models - but I should have prepared more for the \"desk crits\" you have in between model reviews and taken advantage of the professor more during these crits. Usually I left the model until 3 days before review and focused on it completely during that time. This was certainly doable and I was happy with at least 3 of my models, but I expect my grade to suffer because of it. Try to spend some time talking to the TAs and professor, even if you find it difficult to extract concrete suggestions from them. In the end you will learn something, even if you simply improve your understanding of how architects talk and what sort of \"analysis\" they value. I enjoyed drawing architecture more in the end - I felt like the techincal guidance in this class was lacking. I think we could have learned a lot more about different techniques and different types of models (sight plan models, sketch models, etc.) if the assignments varied more in subject (we had to do the same building for all 4 models) and emphasis. perhaps 2 larger projects, interspersed with 4 - 5 smaller, more technically focused studies would have been better. I also wish Petit lectured more - I think he was a good lecturer, but we only had 3-4 all semester. Anyway, I'm glad I took the class to get a sense of whether or not I should major in architecture - so I recommend it to students wishing to do the same.",
    "You are Petit's slut for a semester. He is your master, and you are nothing without his say-so. Will he call? Will he approve of you? Will he find you beautiful? This among other things is the roller coaster of emotions felt at the hands of this man. He will infiltrate your psyche. He will overwhelm you with work, and emotional warfare, and all you can do is give in to the Stockholm syndrome that awaits. Just do it. Give yourself to him wholly and explicitly... for the time being. Just pretend that he and this class will not be a major influence on the rest of your architecture career. Open yourself up to the possibilities that could unfold. Let every thrust be another step in the right direction. Let him finish. Let him ravage and ruin what you thought architecture was. Now clean yourself up you dirty little hooker. Go wash away the rejection that he often displays and prepare for another day-- another time to \"work\" to get back in his good graces. Rest up, you'll need your strength...",
    "An excellent course! Quite rewarding and a crash course in the major. It allows you to begin to think about building (or a building) quite analytically and from different frames.However, do not be brainwashed into thinking, as Petit does, that LeCorbusier will save your world. The course entirely focuses on space over place, abstracting the building into series of spaces and voids and the process of experiencing space in a structure, absent of any context or culture. It's a rewarding way to work, but I fear many students now see this as the only way to work. Analytic Model taken with Kent Bloomer's SpatialLanguage course will give you the best of both worlds, and introduce you to both sides of the space\/place argument. Many people in Petit's course had trouble getting to abstraction and analyzation (actually making a claim\/thesis\/new point over just eliminating details\/creating interesting models) and I think part of this frustration came from a lack of any prior architectural experience. Take another course in the fall, not just Purves, and try to get on with a little model building. Bloomer's is the only I know of, more might be offered in the future.Overall, it is one of the most exciting courses at Yale. I wish it was not over! It is a lot of work and should take over your life (and wallet). Realize, thought, that this will be your only really analytic work in your portfolio for grad school, and also realize you only have 4 models for the semester. Invest time in the projects. Keep them safe. Photograph them well. Use your TA's liberally. It is a good course. Sleep is for the week.",
    "Fact: Models take a long time to make. You will be faster at the end of the semester, and improve a lot in termsof producing compelling ideas and being able to represent them through a 3D physical model. Don't be discouraged along the way, if for instance, the professor and TAs seem to be holding back so that you are forced to teach yourself. You'll not only gain a better sense of what makes a \"good\" model or physical representation, you will have greater awareness of your work ethic and style. Models are like an extension of who you are, because you spend so much time on them, and because they reveal (or at least hold traces) of the thought processes that brought them into being. Take the class, you'll learn about architecture and yourself.",
    "This class demands a lot of time and effort but I think it is well-worth it. Emmanuel Petit makes the class well-worth it, if you can emerge from it alive."
