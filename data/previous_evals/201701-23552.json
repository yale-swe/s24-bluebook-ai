    "This is the best course I have taken at FES, at least in the energy field. While all the other courses only focus on theories\/policies, this is the only class that actually provides hands-on skills that are directly valuable to employers.",
    "This class was spectacular. Professor Gross was the most engaging teacher I have had here at FES and his class was the best one ive taken so far.",
    "This was the best and most useful class I have taken at FES. I can identify a handful of technical skills I have gained. This class seems like a niche subject but the skills are so useful. i am comfortable with basic finance, contracts, modeling, forecasting etc. Daniel Gross is a very clear instructor and cares that we learn something meaningful from this course that we can take with us wherever we go next. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Overall, the class is more important than the instructor here. But Dan is an able lecturer and his powerpoints make up for whatever degree of pizzazz he may lacks. Overall, he teaches an otherwise dry set of modeling techniques well. A-",
    "Professor Gross is one of the most knowledgable professors I have had the pleasure to learn under and was always receptive to asking for help for the class and beyond. All the TA's as well were fantastic and any issues I had were met with answers quickly. The course material was both interesting and extremely applicable to careers beyond college and renewable energy as a whole.",
    "Daniel Gross is an excellent teacher. His lectures are always meticulously planned and well thought through. He really, really cares about the course and the students, and perhaps most inspiringly, he cares about the impact he might be having on the future of the world. He was the best professor I have had at Yale, an he is not even a professor. Other Yale professors should take notes from Daniel and understand his process for developing lectures and providing the most valuable information in the most effective way possible. Put simply, Daniel is also a wealth of knowledge. He can answer any curve ball question he is asked with accuracy and confidence, and he knows what he doesn't know (in those rare occasions) and readily admits it, which is also an admirable characteristic. Daniel is truly an example to others.",
    "I wish you could give answers better than \"excellent\".",
    "After 4 semesters, Renewable Energy Project Finance was my best course at Yale. Daniel is clear and dynamic and inspiring and earnest, and this course provided an excellent balance of useful skills and conceptual understanding of renewable energy and of finance.",
    "One of the most valuable courses I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Best professor I've had at FES",
    "The course was incredibly well structured, lectures were very clear, and went at a very suitable pace.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at FES. It was also the most challenging class I've taken at FES.",
    "Phenomenal course - Gross is amazing!",
    "A visit to a solar project or wind farm Would be amazing for students to phisoxay See and understand what they are studying and valuing.",
    "It is rare that I feel confident in assigning 5 out of 5s to both the professor and overall course. That being said, Dan Gross is immensely deserving of the scores above. He approached the course with clear passion and enthusiasm for the subject matter, offered clear and detailed explanations for understanding energy projects, and left me with an understanding of the subject far grater than when I began the course. I would recommend this course without hesitation to any student interested in the energy industry, renewable energy issues, or general financial modeling. Dan seamlessly merged these complex issues into readily accessible lectures that were both engaging and thought-provoking.",
    "I learned so much from this class. Daniel Gross is a phenomenal lecturer, and it amazed me each week how much effort he and his TAs put into ensuring all 100+ students had access to the resources we needed, that we had answers to the questions we asked out of curiosity, and that we even had additional resources that can't typically be found online.",
    "This was my favorite course of the year. Professor Daniel Gross is very clear, articulate, well-prepared and truly cares about student learning. The problem sets and readings solidified my understanding of bringing the concepts together. The final exam was a culmination of all the techniques and topics we learned in class, and an educational experience onto itself.",
    "This was the best course I have taken in my masters program thus far.",
    "This was the best class I have taken since high school. The material was very well organized and it fit perfectly with what I wanted to study",
    "My best class in higher ed. Infinitely grateful for Daniel's clear, thorough and inspiring teaching style. This class might have defined my career path. The TAs were really helpful too and the recitation sessions were really valuable. Thank you!"

    "The skills we learn. The assignments are pretty realistic to real world but at the same time manageable, even if on the heavier side. of the time spent outside of class, this class got the most.",
    "Subject material, Professor and TA accessibility, The desire to want the students to learn and succeed",
    "I learned more in this class than I did in any other class at Yale. There are so many complex intricacies to be understood in the world of renewable energy project finance, and I was not familiar with even the basics. Daniel walked us through in a logical way that enabled us to build on what we had learned in prior lectures and homework assignments to end the semester with a valuable final product that showcased our newfound knowledge.",
    "The modeling learning and practice.",
    "Everything was great.",
    "Dan Gross is everything",
    "This is a very valuable class to help FES students understand how investment decisions are made by companies, specifically renewable energy projects. The classes were well thought out and Dan Gross was great at explaining difficult topics with clarity. I recommend this course for any FES student",
    "Focused. Excellent and clear instructor Wonderful TAs with excellent grasp of content and excellent communication skills. Amir and Jayson were especially helpful!",
    "Assignments",
    "Went at the perfect pace - professor was very engaging and taught incredibly well. Homework was challenging and exciting to do. TAs were super helpful. One of the most practical courses I've taken at Yale that I'm going to take into my job for investment banking.",
    "Daniel is amazing. I would take anything he taught. In this class, you get real, hands-on skills and a greater understanding of the world around you. I will take the knowledge from this class and use it in any career I might go in to.",
    "Professor Gross! Extremely useful and applied",
    "This course provides students with opportunities to practise and improve their modelling skills, their understanding of project finance, and even mainstream accounting and finance knowledge.",
    "This is a must take energy class. Daniel clearly puts in so much time and effort into this class and we are so lucky to have him. I have learned so incredibly much from this class and very practical skills and work product in particular",
    "Daniel Gross is the best aspect of this course. The Teaching Fellows are a close second - they were excellent, thoughtful, and dedicated.",
    "The hands-on problem sets were optimal for learning the material. Dan Gross is an amazing instructor and clearly deeply cares about improving our understanding and skills. He is an excellent, clear lecturer with interesting, interactive lectures and carefully thought-out assignments. Excellent course.",
    "The subject material is relevant and the course instructor was clear and helpful throughout. The practical skills gained from this course make all the work worth it and the course as it was taught (with the lecture and TA structure) should continue in future years.",
    "The homework assignments were extremely helpful in gaining an understanding of financial modelling.",
    "The most well structured, well formulated and deliberately organized course I have taken at FES or SOM. I can only imagine how much more I would have learned while in grad school if all profs put this much effort into the planning, pacing and workload of their courses.",
    "Lectures for this course were excellent, and the material was very well thought out.",
    "The lectures were fascinatig and the class material was very wel taught. The weekly homework assignments built on the course material and complemented it. The course was a very rigorous introduction to an exciting field, and the lecturer was incredibly competent in his field. It was always a pleasure attending class, and the lecturer always brought in different forms of media to bring relavance to the topics of the week.",

    "The course is very well fraught with a very good mix of technical, financial and legal concepts. Moreover Daniel ensures that even people with no excel skills learn how to do a financial model with the best practices.",
    "The best aspects of the course were Dan's teaching abilities, accessibility to students in spite of the course size and him not living New Haven, and the way the material taught conveyed an interdisciplinary education in energy project development that merged the financial, regulatory\/legal, and technical issues that professionals have to consider when evaluating energy projects.",
    "This practicum was truly practical. We learned tangible financial modeling skills that I've been able to apply to other classes. I can't say enough good things about this course and how relevant the subject matter is for anyone hoping to work in energy financing. While the topic was renewables, the skills we learned here can be applied to all manner of other issues.",
    "Financial modelling. This is a handy skill to have in the energy sector. The class was also well balanced covering both financial and legal aspects.",
    "The best aspect of this class is the teaching team. Gross is very engaging and receptive to questions. The TFs were very available and explained things very clearly. This class provides tangible, hands-on skills that are applicable well beyond renewable energy project finance.",
    "The lectures, homework assignments, and final project all built on one another and were designed to challenge students without being impossible to complete. The lectures were thoughtful, engaging, and well timed.",
    "I loved switching off between contracts and finance. You can tell the professor spent a lot of time preparing for the course; I couldn't say that for several other Yale classes I have taken so far",

   "comments": [
    "- Maybe we can spend a little more time talking about cutting edge topics in energy (storage, demand response, smart grid) and how finance related to them - Having sample answer for each homework would be helpful",
    "I dont not see any places that this course needs improvement.",
    "Dan should cut out the parts of the class that just go over background material on things like \"how a turbine makes electricity\" or \"how do dams work\" or whatever. Just assign that as background reading. The duck curve stuff is on the fence. Maybe fewer people know about that, but that IS relevant. Knowing how a turbine works isn't as relevant, and can be Googled. Or people can take an engineering class.",
    "I don't have any issues with the course",
    "I wish I could take this course again because some of the lectures went a bit too quickly on some of the most fundamental aspects of project finance. This is particularly true for the first lecture, when we learned all the essentials, but it went very quickly and I struggled to take notes and absorb what Daniel was saying at the same time. If I could give 3 ways in which the course to be improved upon, it would be for Daniel to: 1) spend more time on the materials from the first lecture, since some of the most fundamental information lies within that first lecture, and I feel like I still struggle to explain some of the most basic concepts of project finance because that first lecture was so dense with complex content that was introduced too quickly 2) allow students to download lecture notes before lecture. This would have really helped me be able to absorb the content of each class. I spend most classes struggling to write down what was on Daniel's slides, but I would have been able to get much more out of the class if I had instead written down the supplementary notes he was saying out loud, and spent more time simply listening to him so I could better take in his information-rich slides. I understand why he doesn't like to do things this way (he thinks it will make people zone out), but I'm not sure I understand his logic there, and I know many students would benefit from being able to take notes on the slides. 3) don't put quite so much emphasis on reading long contracts and summarizing them. The costs (time) vastly outweighed the benefits of those exercises. I can understand doing this for one assignment, but 3 or 4 was unnecessary.",
    "None.",
    "It's difficult to find room for improvement, but a field trip would be valuable. In addition, explaining to students the aspects of the financial model that the course is not covering, but that is included when employees make models, would give more context.",
    "Workload is too heavy. The weekly assignment schedule is also not as flexible. I can't do work beforehand if I have a busy week or will be out on weekends.",
    "Have less legal document assignments.",
    "The pacing of the assignments in the last few weeks of the semester was challenging.",
    "I do think it went very fast and there was a very steep learning curve. I wish the pace was a little slower so I could have fully absorbed everything. But I do appreciate that Daniel was receptive to our feedback and made midcourse adjustments by making some homeworks extra assignments.",
    "I think that at times the lecture strayed a bit from finance to more specific scientific concepts of energy. I do think that these are useful, but it is important to note that many people taking this course are very familiar with energy and this is repetitive. There was sometimes some overlap between this course and my other courses.",
    "The course requirements were quite heavy, but Daniel made some adjustments toward the end of the course that were very helpful. Keep the modified format for next year.",
    "None. I think the scale back of the final assignment was perfect and made the course a lot of work during the semester but manageable at the end while other classes were getting more demanding. I think it would have been a little over the top had the investment memo been required.",
    "I just never really understood why it was impossible to access lectures online, even though they were taped. I recognize that this may reduce the incentive to go to class, but it just seems like such a valuable resource. There must be some way for folks to \"check-in\" in class in order to unlock the lectures? Also, if we're learning so much Excel, I would love to be able to use a bit of VBA--this is a tool I've always wanted but never fully understood.",
    "The only thing that could be improved was how quickly the legal summary term sheet assignment is introduced. Some students didn't feel comfortable enough doing it, and the first legal document was the longest one. This aspect of the course was very well handled with the introduction of extra-credit assignments that could be used to replace our lower scores.",
    "Contracts",
    "More TAs for more office hours and clarity in the recitation sessions. Less homework.",
    "More attention could be paid to preparing students for the first modeling assignment, and the enhanced final model. I didn't feel adequately equipped to tackle those two assignments.",
    "The course was far more work intensive than many of my other courses. If I was not so passionate about the material and learning through the homework, it would have been very difficult to stay sufficiently motivated to complete the work. However, there were few times I felt the homework was not beneficial to my learning during the course. In addition, the advanced model for the project final was extremely challenging and ultimately required over 30 hours to complete. In spite of this, I still consider it a valuable exercise, albeit one that required me to draw time away from my other courses to focus adequate attention on.",
    "There are some aspects that I don't think can really be practically addressed. I wish we had more one-on-one time with the professor and TAs (or at least small group time), but Daniel is such a busy guy who has to train in from NYC as is, and there are only 4 TAs for a huge class. That said, I really appreciate that Daniel didn't want to cap the class (originally intended for a couple dozen students) in order to be able to share these skills with everyone. Perhaps one solution could be to give him two more TAs next year? I really believe demand is high enough-- for me and other classmates, this course was by and far our favorite.",
    "I would have appreciated more feedback on my homework assignments, but I understand there were constraints due to high volume of students enrolled in the course.",
    "More discussion on the legal document homework - probably make this an optional TA session so that students who don't care as much about the legal documents can skip. Examples of good work were posted but more detailed discussion will be good to help us develop the skill to read legal contracts, which I have heard again and again from project finance professionals that it is an essential skill. Overall the workload is too heavy. It's better to have fewer weekly homework assignments and more time for us to do the investment memo and\/or enhanced final model. I was so overwhelmed at the end of the semester and opted not to do either."

Without these sessions, it would have been very difficult to learn both the lecture material and the underlying modeling concepts necessary for the class. The TAs were also very accessible and helpful. The one recommendation I'd make for future semesters is to set a recitation time that will not conflict with other energy courses during the semester and stick with that. This semester the original recitation time overlapped with Financing Green Technology, and a number of students were enrolled in both.",
    "The discussions were quite useful as they helped in amplifying the concepts learnt in class. It was also a good forum to have a personal interaction with the team",

This course provides me with more knowledge on project finance for reweable energy sector. More than that, this course supplements my coursework in accounting and finance by providing rigourous training in financial modeling. This skill is very beneficial.",

There aren't many energy- or renewable energy-focused courses at Yale but this course combined relevant and timely material with extremely valuable skills that can be immediately applied in the working world. Currently there aren't enough Energy or renewable energy related courses at FES (there should be more), but this course is among the best anyone with an energy or financial modeling interest should take.",

As a result, this course was integral to my education and will constitute a fundamental component of my degree. The fact that this course was available to FES students was a strong driver in my motivation to attend Yale, particularly with so few other interdisciplinary energy courses offered.",

    "For improving excel skills and learning about project finance.",
    "I was in it for the modeling, but I enjoyed learning anecdotally about REPF.",
    "I am passionate about renewable energy and also finance, and this course was the perfect combination that showed how financial analysis can be applied to renewable energy projects and development. Furthermore, the lecturer Daniel Gross was highly compelling and an incredible professional in his field, and I really wanted to take the opportunity to take the class with him.",
    "As an undergrad with no finance background I wanted to learn how to do it.",
    "Curious about renewable project finance, and want to develop financial analysis skills.",

    "Keen interest in energy finance",
    "I am pursuing my masters with a focus on the intersection of energy regulatory policy and new markets for clean energy technologies. As a result, this course was integral to my education and will constitute a fundamental component of my degree. The fact that this course was available to FES students was a strong driver in my motivation to attend Yale, particularly with so few other interdisciplinary energy courses offered.",
    "I wanted to learn a practical skill tying together an understanding of energy systems with financial modeling. This course was exactly what I needed to make myself more marketable.",
    "I was curious to understand how renewable energy project developers finance their projects, how they model their businesses financially and what are the merits and demerits of the various types.",
    "I went to a guest lecture at SOM where Daniel Gross was presenting and I was so captivated, I knew I had to take this class, even though when I signed up I was not really sure what project financing was or where it was used or why it is important. However, through the course, I can now answer all of the above questions and more. I am interested in a career in alternative energy financing. To this end, this course really solidified my interest in this field and was quite illuminating.",
    "I took the course because I was interested in how renewable energy projects were financed and wanted to improve my financial modeling skills."

    "Yes!",
    "I actually learned more about renewable energy technologies - solar panels and their manufacturing processes, wind turbines and gear box, electricity conversion and transmission, steam turbine technology, hydroelectric turbine - than I have in any other course here at FES, and that isn't the main goal of the course. I also refined my excel skills, understanding of financial concepts and renewable energy technology in the marketplace.",
    "Yes.",

    "Yes. Even better it exceeded my expectations",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "The knowledge and skills far exceeded my expectations.",
    "The course's material, insights and skills exceeded my expectations. I came out of the course not only with rigorous financial modeling skills, but also with an understanding of project finance, legal document analysis, and bringing projects to life by working with many stakeholders. The course was highly intensive, which is how we developed many skills rigorously. I would very much hope that this course is offered again in the following years, as it was my absolute favorite class at Yale and Daniel Gross was an inspiring, competent and personable lecturer always open to teach us even more.",

    "It was one optional project and standard group work.",
    "The advantage is that each group member can help each other and achive a comprehensive result. The downside is that it may be difficult to arrive at agrement.",
    "The group work was kind of strange, to be honest, because we all worked on individual parts and weren't really allowed to collaborate. It was optional, but if groupwork is an option in the future, I hope it can be a little more thought-out so as to allow group members to actually work together and review each other's work.",
    "I did not partake in the optional group work assignment of the class, however I feel it would have been another great learning experience (writing an investment committee memo).",
    "My group was good and it was a solid experience. They were all undergrads though, and we would have benefitted from having a business school student in our group.",
    "They help a lot to prepare for the asignments.",
    "The advantage was that we could quickly break up the memo into pieces and all attack separate parts. Since the grade was able to replace my lowest homework grade, I was really glad we had this opportunity. I enjoyed my group so don't have comments regarding disadvantages.",
    "I did not participate. It was optional",
    "The groupwork was for an optional project. This made the project very easy to do as we each identified our strengths and pooled them in order to produce a strong deliverable i a short amount of time. It was good to do the group project because it enabled us to discuss what we learned in the class and solidify our understanding of what we learned in class."

    "100% take it! Useful for anyone interested in renewable energy or finance or honestly someone who wants to get better at Excel!",
    "Take the course, and don't be afraid of modeling.",
    "Take it and you'll get what you put in.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any students with an interest in clean energy and\/or finance. As Daniel notes, the course is a niche within a niche, but the amount of thought and care he puts into his lectures and assignments, and the vast wealth of knowledge that he supplies is invaluable.",
    "Must-take.",
    "Take it. Best course at FES hands down.",
    "Be prepared to feel a bit overwhelmed in the first week or so. Dont try to compare yourself to any of the MBA students. It's an amazing class, and it will be the best course youve taken at FES!",
    "It is a must.",
    "Absolutely take it if you're interested in finance or renewable energy.",
    "If you're even a little bit interested in this class, TAKE IT! You will learn a lot that will serve you well in any career you may pursue.",
    "Take it!",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "REPF is well taught, well structured, and relevant. Attend the first lecture and you'll see.",
    "Do all mandatory assignments and start them reasonably early (You will learn a lot more instead of sitting back and procrastinating)",
    "A ton of work but a huge payoff so its worth it.",
    "Problem sets took me a long time, not usually something that can be finished on Sunday! But overall a really great course and this effort definitely payed off, I can use Excel on a whole new level and have a much better understanding of the subject.",
    "Be aware that it is work intensive and put in the work. Start doing the extra credit portions of the assignment early on because they are not that hard. Also come to class with an open mind because the assignments and lectures cover a broad range and teach you very useful skills. And finally, definitely take this class if you can.",
    "Take it! Might be hard if you don't have finance background but is well worth the steep learning curve",
    "This is an amazing course if you are super interested in the niche topic of renewable energy project finance and want relevant financial modeling experience. As the title suggests, it's quite renewable energy and technology focused so it may not be extremely interesting to someone looking for just general financial skills. ~9 psets, prof grossman is brilliant and really does want you to do well.",
    "Be prepared to spend over 10 hours a week on the homework - it's painful, but absolutely worth it.",
    "Take it.",
    "It is challenging but interesting. Think twice if you are very busy, but should take it sometime during your program.",
    "Phenomenal course - take it! I submitted a complete review already but it appears it didn't get properly processed in the system.",
    "Please take it.",
    "One of the best courses at fes if interested in energy. Definitely a must.",
    "Take the course if it's offered, and prioritize it first over other courses that might be offered at the same time if you're anticipating a career in energy or anything that requires complex financial modeling for projects. Also, you should set aside sufficient time to complete the assignments each week, so I would caution against taking the course in conjunction with practicum courses that might also require substantial time, since you risk overloading your schedule, and undermining the amount of time you can spend learning the course material and practicing core concepts.",
    "Take it. Even if you don't want to work in project finance, the skills provide a framework for thinking about other types of projects and issues that can be tackled.",
    "while there are pre-requisite courses required, a basic understanding of finance and a intermediate level of excel will be quite useful and make work easier.",
    "Take it. It is well worth the time you put in and you will learn a lot- even if you are not interested in REPF specifically.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student with an interest in renewable energy or project finance.",
    "Start the homework and the final model early. If you are really interested in energy finance, prioritize your workload so that you can do the investment memo and\/or enhanced model of this class (not really for the extra credit, which is not worth it, but for your own learning)."
