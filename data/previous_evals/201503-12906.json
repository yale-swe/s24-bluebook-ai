    "Addictions is a very neuroscience and research heavy class. If you're interested in those two topics, you'll enjoy it a lot. If not, you many find it a bit dry. We focused very heavily on mechanisms of addictions, and not as much on the psychopharmacology of the drugs and drug treatments themselves. Professor Baskin-Sommers does a great job facilitating intense discussions in class, and I would recommend this class to people who are ok with style and topic.",
    "Great senior seminar! Work load isn't too high but class discussions are great and so is Professor Baskin-Sommers. Try to take it if you can get it.",
    "FANTASTIC class. Manageable workload, interesting material, amazing professor. not much else you could ask for. There is a fair amount of discussion about the cognitive and neurological processes that underlie addiction, but even if you're not as experienced or familiar with neuroscience (which is very much true for me), it's taught in an accessible way and shouldn't scare you away from taking the class. highly recommend. fair warning: you probably need to pre-register if you want to get in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The behavior change project we each engaged in was a transformational experience.",
    "Definitely take this course. Arielle is incredible and the class is extremely thought provoking and interesting. The behavior project is challenging, but insightful and actually fun.",
    "Whether or not you are passionate about substance use disorders at the outset, I think this course is a great psych seminar that explores the intersection of biological, cognitive, affective, and environmental factors in the development of addictions, as well as implications for treatment and policy. The material is advanced but accessible, and the class structure--a combination of lectures and discussion--is great.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "Yes, I recommend the course for anyone interested! Arielle is an amazing professor and class was always interesting and engaging. Work load is very manageable, and weekly assignments keep you on top of readings.",
    "Very fun class, I definitely recommend it if you can get in. Workload is fairly light with no exams and just one paper at the end. You have to write two weekly responses, but one is a free-form and leniently-graded response to weekly readings and the other is a \"journal entry\" of sorts documenting your progress on a behavior change project. The behavior change project basically entails making some sort of major lifestyle change (such as giving up something that you may consume too much of) and tracking how well you're able to stick to that change throughout the semester through weekly journal entries and class discussion. I'd honestly say that this class is worth it just for the behavior change - I've never had a class at Yale feel so interactive or relevant to my daily life before, and it really forced me to get better at controlling my habits on a day-to-day basis, which is pretty major, if you ask me. You'll also present alongside a partner about an assigned addiction-related topic towards the end of the semester, but I found this process to be fun and surprisingly low-stress, even given that I'm a person who tends to get a bit of stage fright. Definitely take it if you can!",
    "I think the title of this course summarizes it all. It is an in depth course on the factors that contribute to the development of addiction. I would definitely recommend this course to another student! There is a fair amount of work, but it is rewarding and the debates are really fun and entertaining.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can. It's a great way to top off the psych major and not too much work for a senior seminar. The topics are really interesting and Prof. Baskin-Sommers is amazing. Definitely do the reading and stay engaged so you can get the most out of it.",
    "Sure, take it! It's not the best class I've taken in the PSYC department, but it's definitely worthy, you learn plenty, you get close to the class and Arielle through the \"behavior change\" project (where you work to break one of your own addictive behaviors over the course of a semester). Lecture is at times boring but the assignments are straightforward and grading is generous.",
    "Take it!"
