   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Exactly what the title of the course says: elementary musicianship. Basic piano and singing skills.",
    "This class provided an amazing foundation in ear training, sight-singing, and dictations. I already had a fairly good background in these topics, but the class really solidified my understanding, and I certainly improved my skills in these areas. I look forward to taking more music theory classes over the next few semesters.",
    "I developed my listening and aural skills in terms of recognizing and replicating intervals, chord qualities, chord inversions, and general music theory.",
    "Prior to taking this class, I only knew how to play music, but not necessarily the theory or the reasons behind certain aspects of music. Through this class, I was able to learn more about rhythm, cadences, chord names, solfege, and become more skilled at sightsinging and dictation.",
    "I gained many practical skills such as being more familiar with major and minor intervals, gaining practical keyboard skills, and being able to dictate a musical expression.",
    "I had 0 familiarity with solfege before taking this course, so it was good to learn and use it in my musical repertoire."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good subject area and depth of content. More practice would have helped but really not a huge issue.",
    "Great for practicing musicianship skills",
    "There are many strengths of this course. In the small class setting, it is easy to ask questions and get personal attention so that no student falls behind. Also, each new topic was introduced very clearly and taught in depth. The keyboard lab was also a great strength of the course as it improved my skills in that area as well. There were no clear weaknesses of the course.",
    "It had an appropriate amount of work for a half credit course. I liked the piano lab, but I wish there could've been more one-on-one training for singing and listening.",
    "This course allowed students to become more familiar with the techniques of sight-singing and dictation, and it was really enjoyable and engaging. It could have been more structured in the way that class time was formatted.",
    "The course is really great for its ground-up technique building. The material is manageable and easy to understand, and class is fun. I think it would be challenging for people with less music background though, especially with the piano lab requirement. I think the course could benefit from a more focused syllabus and maybe more time devoted to listening exercises.",
    "Great course!"

   "comments": [
    "Great if you want to get more music practice in.",
    "I loved this class. It was a wonderful way to start the day with singing. My sight-reading abilities improved, and I can sing using solfege now. This class is lit, especially if you have Nathaniel Adam.",
    "Yes, it's very good if you'd like to improve on your musicianship skills, but it's also easy to not put a lot of effort or work into it if you're in a large class. You're not necessarily called out, but if you take the initiative to practice on your own as well then you will get something out of it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. While it will definitely be somewhat of a challenge for those with no background in music theory and ear training, it will still be an enjoyable and rewarding class. The workload is small, so it gives struggling students the opportunity to have a lot more time to practice and improve their skills. For anyone taking the class, regardless of prior experience, it will greatly strengthen their musicianship skills.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class. It's a low commitment was to maintain your music theory skills as well as develop your ear and vocal training. Given the low work load it's a doing 5th or 6th class.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their practical music theory skills in a casual setting.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to improve your sight-singing skills and take an enjoyable music class without stressing yourself too much.",
    "Absolutely, really fun.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone that has an interest in improving theory in the aural skills area."
