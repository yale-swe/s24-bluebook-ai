   "comments": [
    "It is a well taught course but sometimes we did not have great review for tests.",
    "The strengths of the class was the engagement of learning. It was an early class, but the professor made it more engaging to listen to and more willing to go to class early in the morning everyday.",
    "This course provided me with what I feel is a pleasing and solid first semester's worth of Italian knowledge. I feel I have grasped the language relatively quickly in the short time to which I have been exposed to it, and I credit the consistency and style of the class format for this. One major weakness of this course -- or perhaps simply my professor -- is the lack of organic Italian conversation between classmates which took place. I feel quite comfortable with the grammatical rules I have learned, and I am an adept listener of the language. But I feel that I would struggle to interact in an Italian-only setting because of how startlingly little practice I have had speaking. When the class did converse, it was in response to prompts and in pairs or small groups, in which few people actually participated or actively engaged. A far more effective method of engagement, in my view, would be student-teacher conversation (since the professor has far more knowledge of the language than the students; student-student conversation usually turned into a bumbling mess since neither of us existed on solid linguistic footing) and cold-calling. Direct and individualized engagement, when it was practiced one day by a substitute professor, was far, far more effective in maintaining my attention and sharpening my speaking skills than the typical format of the class.",
    "I think the course utilizes the textbook very well in a way that makes sense and is helpful for reviews. The structure of the class was good and helped encourage questions."
