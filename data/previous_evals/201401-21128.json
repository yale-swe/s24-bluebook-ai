   "comments": [
    "Good intro to a wide array of global health topics.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course if at all possible even if your interest in global health is only vague or developing.",
    "great introduction to what global health is. yes i would recommend the course to another student. you learn a lot throughout the course!",
    "A class that I think is a bit overrated. It focuses a lot on memorizing facts and other things that could be easily looked up\/are pretty intuitive. As a result, the course isn't very difficult, but I wish I learned more too, and that the course instead focused on methodologies and frameworks used in Global Health. Perhaps it's due to the course being an introductory one.",
    "This course will teach you more about global health than any other course at Yale. It will teach you how to write policy briefs, which is an immensely valuable and practical skill. The main weakness I found was that the exams are basically all about how well you can memorize random facts about pretty much any global health problem in the world (and by facts, I mean percentages, comparative statistics about regions of the world, etc.). Short answer exams, while they may have been harder to grade, would have been more fair -- or else, less of the exam should be focused on specific numbers. Otherwise, Professor Skolnik is an expert and it shows. If you work hard in his class, he will help you to achieve your goals in the field of global health -- whether that be through advice or through helping to set you up with future plans. However, he can come off as being very arrogant, and many students I know felt this was a detriment to the class. Try to see past it because he really is a good teacher who cares about his students.",
    "Definitely take if you can get in. They increased the number of sections to two, so it should be easier. Skolnik is a great lecturer and the class is really doable.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you have a deep interest in global health or have no background in global health. It provides a great introduction to the current field of global health. However, the lectures may have been redundant at times. The lectures were not very helpful for the exams, which focused a lot on the textbook. The group activities in the course were not extremely helpful either. I feel like the dynamic of the course may have changed this year since there were two classes, instead of one. Professor Skolnik works very hard to find opportunities with his student and is very accessible. Writing policy briefs is a very important technique that I believe every student should know. Professor Skolnik and his TAs provided a lot of feedback for the policy briefs.",
    "Take it. Without a doubt, one of the best classes I've had at Yale. The material is interesting, the instructors are awesome, and they actually help you learn. The material's a lot to memorize, though.",
    "Think carefully about what it is, and if it's what you want then take it!",
    "If you're interested in global health, take the course. It's a good intro class, and the policy briefs were fun to write. The midterm and finals, not so great. It's MC, which means that no partial points are given. The professor is a great man (and he knows it) who knows his material inside and out. He lectures in a way that doesn't feel like he's talking from the book, but that's a great thing. Don't forget to take notes.",
    "HLTH 230 is an interactive lecture class. You'll have a fair amount of reading to do every week, but if you're at all interested in global health the reading is interesting and enjoyable, and it always pays off to be prepared for class so that you can participate and get a lot more out of the lectures. Even though Professor Skolnik calls on people randomly, it's not at all intimidating, and in general the class atmosphere is laid-back. The workload is not too tough as long as you keep up with the syllabus and don't let readings pile up. I would definitely recommend this to someone who is curious about global health -- taking this class will let you known for sure whether you're fascinating by this stuff and excited to work in low-income countries, or whether you're easily bored by the material. And even if you end up not loving global health, which is what I realized a few weeks into the semester, you learn how to think critically and how to communicate effectively, which are both tremendously valuable skills. If anything, I wish I had put more effort into doing all the readings diligently and doing extra research in the branches of global health that interested me, because I would have enjoyed this class that much more.",
    "Lots of premeds who are doing global health because it seems \"the right thing to do.\" So for one of the tests, people literally corrected Professor Skolnik and he omitted 5 questions off of the test. This is understandable, but honestly I think the testing format should be changed. I learned SO MUCH by writing the policy briefs, and think it would be interesting to have 5 policy briefs instead of the midterm\/final. Some sort of other activity - I just think that multiple choice tests in Global Health are arbitrary and the students literally attacked Professor Skolnik about certain questions, which was uncalled for at times.",
    "Highly recommended, take it! Not too much work, multiple choice midterm and exams. Professor and TFs are great!",
    "GREAT class! Professor Skolnik is so passionate and funny and awesome. If you enjoy the subject (if you care about the health of people around the world at all), you'll learn a lot and have a great time. My only suggestion is to make a big effort to do the readings before class - that way you won't be worried about Skolnik calling on you, and you'll be able to pay attention fully, speak up in class, and ask more specific questions (Skolnik is an invaluable resource). Get to know the professor and your TA! Take this class for sure!!! It'll change how you think about the world and your career and goals.",
    "I thought this was a well-taught course about an important topic. Though I am not going into the medical field, I still felt like I learned a lot. It is fairly rigorous but it makes you a better writer and presenter.",
    "YES, especially if your interested in global health or public health. You look into a wide breadth of topics throughout the course and learn had to analytically tackle some of the most commons problems in different parts of the world.",
    "HLTH 230 is a great survey intro course to topics of global health. You won't learn specifics of TB or malaria in certain countries (unless you write about it for your policy memos), but you'll get a general understanding of how global health stands. Skolnik is amazing, but lectures aren't always the most helpful.",
    "Very amazing survey class. Skolnik is brilliant and has a lot of experience, and is also dedicated to his students. You learn a lot in the class but it's also not difficult so it's a fun, easy, rewarding class. Definitely take it.",
    "Definitely reccommend. You learn a lot. Not too challenging except for tests which studying more would help.",
    "A great intro to global health, take it if you can get in and think that global health might be a potential career path. And it's a writing credit!",
    "I think every student should take this class. It's an interesting introduction to global health. It's difficult to get a good, wide overview of development, I think, especially at the undergraduate level, and this class does exactly that (within the context of global health). This class is a little bit more technical than most classes, and it's certainly not a policy class - you learn about what pressing health problems affect which part of the world in what ways. This class gives you valuable knowledge on what you should know about the world you live in.",
    "Absolutely. HLTH 230 is THE introductory course to the field of global health. You will learn an extraordinary amount about global health to the point where the course material becomes second-nature. Professor Skolnik's teaching style is unlike anything you will get in any other course at Yale and he is an invaluable resource. The course exams and policy briefs are extremely fair, and the readings are very interesting!",
    "This course is a good intro to broad topics in global health and how to think about them and approach them. If you have taken GH classes before, this class might be a little frustrating because it definitely is broad. But I think it is valuable to be told how to think about these problems effectively- it might seem like common sense once it's said, but I'm not sure that most people would know how to approach the thinking without guidance.",
    "Skolnik's HLTH 230 is a great survey course in global health. It is quite amazing how much first-hand experience Skolnik has in the field and how excited he is to get students involved. The course uses the textbook that Skolnik wrote, so there is a lot of cohesion between the readings and the lectures which is good. The workload is manageable- 3 essays, a midterm, and a final. The exams are multiple choice and not very long but still worth a significant portion of the final grade. The policy brief style essays are very practical as a writing exercise, but I felt that there was a lack of consistency when three different TAs graded the papers.",
    "take it if you can get in!!! loved it so much. my favorite class this semester. would definitely recommend it. depends on your interest in health studies of course. but if you're interested, this course is a great overview. allows you to meet a professor and teaching staff willing to help you reach your goals and make connections in the field of global health. oh, and i actually enjoyed writing the policy briefs b\/c they gave me a chance to learn about health problems in different parts of the world.",
    "If you want a solid survey course of key issues in global health, this class is the class for you.",
    "I am not majoring in anything health related, but I think everyone can benefit from a working understanding of what people are affected from in the world. I highly recommend this class.",
    "intro to global health. gives you a broad overview."
