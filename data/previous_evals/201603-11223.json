    "I learned to differentiate, find limits, implicitly derive and other calculus skills.",
    "I learned about general calculus, such as derivatives, function graphing, integrals, differential equations, and the like.",
    "I relearned and reviewed concepts of introductory calculus that I had previously learned in AP Calculus in high school. However, there were some topics that I had never seem before. In this course, my mathematics skills were definitely strengthened. This class did an excellent job, I think, of preparing me for the next mathematics course. I feel like I have learned in depth all of the important concepts we covered.",
    "This course provided me with a much more comprehensive understanding of the topics covered than math classes I've taken in the past."

   "comments": [
    "I think class examples and instruction didn't mirror the homework problem sets very well. The material covered in class was relatively simple whereas the problems assigned were much more complex.",
    "Webassign is way too difficult. I find the psets easier to complete and more on level, but Webassign seems to be based on trick problems. It really needs to be improved. I found the psets more valuable for practice. It seems like Webassign was just another chore to do, and I don't think I learned much from it.",
    "The course could have better TA's.",
    "I think one of it's strengths was how it had many tutor\/review and office hour sessions.",
    "Strength of this course was the lecture style class. I feel like I learn mathematics much better than in a flipped classroom environment. However, the lecture style did get repetitive and sometimes I wished for more engagement. I liked that we would sometimes do problems on the black board and I wished that we could've done that with more frequency.",
    "The strengths of this course were its combination of reading materials on your own and going over topics in class, which ensured a thorough understanding of the materials. One thing that I disliked was the grading of WebAssign homework assignments on the basis of whether or not you entered the correct answer on the first try. Considering that the WebAssign questions are the first exposure we have to the new materials, that many students have had problems with credit being removed because answers were formatted differently, and that the weekly problem sets are graded, it seems reasonable for students to be able take a couple tries before credit is deducted from the WebAssign answers.",
    "Web assign is useless, I think it should be a problem set based homework grade. The teaching is not at all based towards the exams i had to relearn it all myself before each exam."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only if you've already been exposed to Calculus prior to taking the course. It moves very quickly and they expect you to figure out a lot of things on your own which is completely manageable if you already have a background with the work. In my opinion, without prior knowledge, it would be very difficult.",
    "Your standard calculus class. Nothing too engaging or interesting.",
    "Though it is technically the lowest calculus class at Yale, it is by no means easy. The average grade is a B-, and you're often curved against kids who have taken BC calc.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone else because Math112 does a very good job of teaching the important calculus concepts that you will need for higher math courses or science courses. I can see the application of the math in my science courses and I find that fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. I think most students who decide to take it need it as a prerequisite and don't therefore have much of a choice but to take it, but I still think it was a good course and that I gained a thorough understanding of the materials."
