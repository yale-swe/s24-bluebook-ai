   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it, take it. YOu don't learn much in the class but just read the book and pray that you have a good TA who can actually teach you",
    "Take it because it is required, but be prepared to teach yourself most of it.",
    "Econometrics and Data Analysis I with Professor Taisuke Otsu was a manageable class that tended to be a little bit boring during lecture. Professor Otsu does a really, really great job of providing resources for his students, and his lecture slides very clearly present the material, although his delivery is pretty dry. He makes his expectations really clear, his notes are very, very good, and he's really very friendly, helpful, and approachable. He can be extremely helpful in person. The class assigned a problem set a week with the optionof dropping one, and I feel that I'm leaving the course having received a decent instruction in introductory statistics.",
    "Take it because you have to, but ideally not with Otsu.",
    "I thought it was a good class. You probably need to take some econometrics for the econ major, so pick the higher levels if you want to go to grad school and take this one if you don't want to take the higher levels.",
    "Yes, take it in the spring it's easier.",
    "It's not an exciting course, but it's definitely doable as an econometrics course.",
    "Required for the major, not a bad class but requires mostly self-studying.",
    "When i was course shopping and reading these assessments, i didn't listen to what they told me. I thought, how could the professore be THAT bad, its econometrics, a requirement! I think I can deal with it.I was wrong. it is worth waiting for a better instructor. this class was absolutely hideous. poorly taught in such a thick accent that you can't even understand what is going on. the lectures and homework seem wildly disconnected. the homework is straightforward and easy, and the exams are straight out of left field. honestly, just wait.. i truly wish i did.",
    "It was good with Otsu, but since hes leaving good luck.",
    "It's a grind. Reeeeaaaally easy until chapter 12, but still a grind, and you'd better be paying attention once you get to chapter 12. No real need to go to lecture. This is the only class I've taken so far where that's been the case.Tai was not a good lecturer, but his slideshows and other online resources are very good. I feel like if I had ever gone to office hours, he would've been helpful, despite his imperfect English.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you need it to graduate or you have an interest in statistics related to econ. The class is pretty boring, but if you are interested in the material you might like it. The textbook is great at explaining everything so the class is pretty easy though.",
    "I think this course is absolutely essential. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Great class to learn very useful concepts such as regression.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you want to learn about statistics. Stats are super useful!",
    "Take it. It's useful.",
    "There are many reasons to avoid this class. If you've taken statistics in high school, it will largely be a review. If you like thrilling lectures, you will be disappointed by a professor you cannot understand. And if you want to walk away understanding what the word \"econometrics\" even means, you will be left disappointed.",
    "If you're going to be an econ major, take it. Otherwise, stay far, far away. This was maybe the worst class I've taken at Yale. It's not too much work though, and it's pretty easy. However, the easiness of the class makes the curve insane. A 94% on the midterm was a B+. It isn't that much work, and so this could be a 5th class for an econ major.",
    "If you are econ major, I would take it. When I was still an econ& math major, I took Econ 135 with Professor Otsu, and I ended up dropping it because I didn't do well on the midterm. Compared to Econ 135, Econ 131 is very boring and it seems like you only scratch the surface of econometrics. If you justwant the A, I would take Econ 131. If you're genuinely interested in the theory and proofs behind econometrics, definitely take Econ 135.",
    "Not too hard, specially if you have taken intro stats before. Going to lecture was not worth it (and I am the kind of person that never misses lecture...) but if you read the book, the psets won't be bad at all and you'll be fine.",
    "Boring. But you have to take it. Otsu is OK, but don't expect anything from this class.",
    "What you would expect from an econometrics class. Fairly dry but straightforward, with all the lecture presentations posted online.",
    "Statistics with applications.",
    "Basic statistics. I don't even know what the difference is between Econometrics and Statistics",
    "One of the easier Econ requirements. The lecture slides are very thorough and a great tool to review for exams. The exams were not that difficult especially because some of the problems came from the textbook so doing textbook problems as practice is a good idea. The class itself can get dry but you end up actually learning a lot even if you're teaching yourself with the slides. And I know a lot of people are hard on the professor for his accent but it really isn't that bad.",
    "This was a solid class which covers the basic link between statistics and economics. Professor Otsu is a kind, fun professor who helps keep his class interesting and informative. I recommend it to anyone who likes Statistics, and it is not excessively brutal.",
    "Only if you have to--the material is not super difficult, but it's dry and poorly taught.",
    "I took this course after dropping Kitamura's Econometrics course. This one was much better! Taisuke teaches using very clear powerpoints that are easy to follow, even if you fail to attend class.It's also pretty easy. I definitely recommend!Lastly, I feel that I learned a good amount about econometrics. Yay!",
    "Only take if you have to... Not that hard, but boring.",
    "This class sucks but you're probably only taking it because you have to. Midterm wasn't too hard. Shop around for TAs; one was amazing and the other was awful for us.",
    "Yes you have to do it. Just grin and bear it",
    "Go to class, or constantly read the book. Don't solely complete the problem sets.",
    "Econ 131 is a good introduction to the statistics and goes into some of the tools for economic analysis. Lectures were not particularly helpful, and Professor Otsu is a dry lecturer, but section was very helpful in preparing for the problem sets and answering questions that came up during lecture.",
    "Yes -- take it with Prof. Otsu. He was very fair in terms of assignments and tests, and he is kind of funny. You have to take it probably, and even if you don't it's worth taking.",
    "You probably need it for Econ so take it. Otherwise not too bad of an intro to stats course",
    "This class teaches important statistical concepts. It is pretty easy (with Otsu), but Otsu is not the best professor. His powerpoints are good, his teaching is poor.Otsu is better than Yuichi though, who seems almost scatterbrained."
