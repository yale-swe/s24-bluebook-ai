    "It was very helpful in helping me develop my research skills and the development of a research article. In addition it exposed me to a large amount of influential material I had not encountered before in my undergraduate studies.",
    "The focus on research methods was incredibly helpful. I also felt the focus on books that changed the conversation about Britain and the Empire, rather than just any \"good\" book, was helpful in thinking about how to structure future research projects.",
    "Primarily the course is about research design in writing an article length paper: 1. Crafting a why question. 2. Where to look for sources pertinent to your topic, and what bases of sources to use. 3. How to interact with the historiograhpy.",
    "I learned what the important components of a historical research paper should have."

   "comments": [
    "The research development portion of the sources was very strong and helpful to students. The readings were a little heavy at times and more time could have been left for students to work on their writings.",
    "Strengths--see above Weaknesses--we were often given a set of archival documents at the beginning of each class (laid out on the tables) but rarely got adequate time to interact with them. It would have been interesting to spend a bit more time with Beinecke documents that complemented our discussion topic each day.",
    "Overall I thought this course was really good but I thought we were reading for the class a little bit too long for a research seminar"

   "comments": [
    "Great, rigorous course. I got a lot out of it.",
    "I would definitely advise them to take this course if they were interested in the subject area and learning how to develop a strong research article, but advise them of the high workload of the course.",
    "Definitely. I was pushed harder than I was in my other courses this semester, but I produced a much better seminar paper and will retain a great deal more of our class discussions.",
    "Yes, it was hard but rewarding.",
    "I think this class is perfect for writing a paper that can possible be turned into an article. I thought the professor gave great advice during the research process and for that reason I would recommend this course to other students."
