    "This course is for people who know they enjoy English and know they enjoy Shakespeare. Reading a play each week is daunting, but it gets easier through the semester and, at the end, becomes really pleasant. It is also important to know, particularly for freshman, that lecture courses in English are fundamentally different in that they really require you to grapple with the text outside of class, as opposed to talking through ideas every day in class. Especially in Shakespeare, this can be hard. Still, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course and recommend Professor Nicholson...just know what you're getting into.",
    "This class made me see Shakespeare in a whole new light. Professor Nicholson is one of the most engaging, creative lecturers I have seen at Yale College. Definitely take it!",
    "ENGL 200 is a lovely, well-paced introduction to Shakespeare's comedies and romances. The workload is quite reasonable--you read a play a week, write three short essays, and take a midterm and final. There is, however, one particularly compelling reason to take this course: Cathy Nicholson! She's brilliant, funny, and inspiringly eloquent; it's worth taking the class just to hear her lectures, even if you're not sure about Shakespeare yet. (But you soon will be, because he's almost as great as her.)",
    "It was an interesting and fun class for the plays but not for the lectures themselves",
    "Nicholson is a great teacher engaging, brilliant, and a fast-talker! The plays are wonderful as well. Shop around for TA's. They grade your papers\/exams are differ WILDLY in their expectations.",
    "I would highly recommend ENGL 200 with Professor Nicholson. She is one of the more challenging lecturers I have had at Yale, and I had to really focus to follow and understand the arguments of her lectures, but I appreciated how much this class pushed me and tried to make the most out of material that varies in complexity and interest. Most of the plays we read were very good. This class is also an extremely manageable writing credit: there are three five page papers with one revision. I took this class for the writing credit, and I think it is the most fulfilling and informative use of a writing credit at Yale.",
    "Take this class. Professor Nicholson is one of the most passionate, interesting professors I have ever had here. She cares a ton about the material and gives incredible lectures that help you see all of the plays in a new light. Workload isn't too intense: 1 play each week, plus 3 5-page papers and a (very short and easy) midterm and final. Great for an easy, fun writing credit.",
    "If you're at all interested in Shakespeare, enough said. Take this course.",
    "Yes, take this class. Everyone wants to take Histories and Tragedies, but taking Comedies and Romances actually gives you more sophisticated tools to understand theater, Shakespeare, etc. Take this class because Nicholson is the best lecturer in the English department right now.",
    "I would recommend the class if you like Shakespeare, and are capable of writing English style essays.",
    "The lectures were very well-structured, clear, and interesting. This class is great at getting people who have previously not been exposed to Shakespeare very excited about his work, and it seemed like people who had already read a lot of Shakespeare were also given new, interesting things to think about. Professor Nicholson was fantastic and also sent out emails in a timely manner to clarify any logistics about the course that may have been unclear. Paper topics were flexible, but specific options were also given, which was really valuable in a Wr class. I was thankful to have a TA that gave extensive feedback on papers, although she returned them very late.",
    "This is an EXCELLENT class. Really. I cannot rave about it enough. Nicholson is one of the most engaging and fascinating lecturers I have ever encountered. The narratives she presents about each play will make you forget about whatever worries or anxieties you brought into the lecture hall. Every class was a joy, even if I hadn't read the play of the week. The plays themselves are provocative and rich, and deeply relevant to understanding Western literature and Western society as a whole today. Take this class!",
    "In ENGL 200, you read one Shakespeare play a week, but because they're the comedies and romances, they're not terribly taxing to get through (in fact, I actually loved doing reading for this course). I'd really only recommend this class if you're a Shakespeare fan, or you want to learn more about Shakespeare, because while Prof. Nicholson does an awesome job making the shows relatable and interesting, it could potentially get not as fun to read Shakespeare week after week. The assignments are manageable and the lectures incredible. I completely loved it and Professor Nicholson.",
    "This course is pretty straightforward: read one play each week (around 80-120 pages), go to section, write three 5 page papers, have a final exam. I had only read Shakespearean tragedies before this class, so it was good to different side of Shakespeare. Professor Nicholson is really earnest and fun to listen to. I liked the class.",
    "In my opinion, if you really want to read the plays, do it on your own. This was by no means a bad class, but I think that Nicholson needs five to ten years before this class will blow you away. Just judging from her improvement in lecturing from the beginning of the course to the end, she is going to be a GREAT lecturer; she just needs a bit more practice. Most of the lectures model the arguments written in the forewords to the plays in the Norton Shakespeare; if you read those, you will get the majority of what is talked about in class. As far as literature lectures go, if you really want an amazing one in the Spring, take Tolstoy. That will change how you read great literature.",
    "If this course is still a lecture, it's not worth your time. You can read all of these plays just as meaningfully on your own. Take it only if it's a seminar, in which case the discussions will make the coursework worthwhile. The workload of the course is not unbearable, and you'll get a good understanding of the plays you read if you have a quality lecturer like Professor Nicholson. Section attendance is mandatory, and it's really not very helpful. Also, know that the TAs grade your work, so the professor will likely never see your writing and you should be prepared for a mystery box of grades depending on who your TA is. I wouldn't advise taking this course unless there's no alternative Shakespeare course that fits your schedule or if you really need it for the English major. There are better courses to take for the WR credit.",
    "Professor Nicholson is an amazing lecturer and the course content is interesting and engaging. Would definitely recommend taking this.",
    "A cool survey of Shakespeare's comedies. The focus is much more on comedy than romance, although that's hardly a downside. Professor Nicholson is fantastic as as well--just make sure your section isn't led by a doofus like mine was.",
    "A solid class that gives a great overview of the plays read. Prof. Nicholson teaches with a lot of passion and knowledge.",
    "This is a wonderful course! Although the work load is a bit heavy, - you read a play a week - it is worth it, not to mention that reading the plays is absolutely essential for doing well on the exams. When Professor Catherine Nicholson is teaching it, take it! Professor Nicholson was a wonderful lecturer (she speaks a little fast though) and brought many interesting interpretations to the texts. The one thing that I found difficult though, was that lecturers were not so much about the plot and context of the plays, but rather were about additional research that had been done by either Professor Nicholson or Shakespearean scholars. While this was interesting and engaging, when it came time to review lecture notes for the final exams, I found it difficult to interpret what I had written down in relation to the play as a whole. Each lecture had a \"theme\" but I found that the themes were a bit abstract. When you are first learning how to read and write about Shakespeare, it is important to be able to understand the larger themes and motifs - not abstract ideas that Shakespearean scholars have spent their lives writing about. The exams are very reasonable, but in order to do well on the exams YOU MUST GO TO LECTURE! Much of what is talked about in lecture features external sources (history, Shakespearean critics, religious texts, images, etc.) and is featured on the exams, so make sure you pay attention!",
    "V appealing for English majors and non-majors alike. Readings cant be beat; even the problem plays and the obscurer ones are worth a read. Section is meh (per usual), but Professor Nicholson is a gem: friendly, knowledgeable, accessible, and incredibly articulate. Her love of Shakespeare and early modern English lit is contagious. She is super receptive to feedback and open to meeting outside of class. Take this class and go have lunch with her!",
    "This class is a great way to read and explore the comedies and romances. It also gives you a chance to sample plays outside of the most famous ones, which provides useful and interesting perspective. Nicholson is a huge boss, such a great lecturer. Take it!",
    "Professor Nicholson is an amazing lecturer. Class was always incredibly stimulating and thought-provoking. It's a lot of reading but very manageable and the plays are incredible.",
    "I'm a senior English major, and ENGL 200 was one of my favorite English classes at Yale. Professor Nicholson's lectures were always clear, engaging, thought-provoking, well-contextualized, and well-focused. The plays on the syllabus were fun to read and well-selected. Prof. Nicholson always expressed a genuine desire to get to know her students and went the extra mile to make them happy: she was responsive to midterm feedback, scheduled class lunches, and brought cookies on the last day. I'm only sorry I didn't get the chance to take more classes with her!",
    "Great class on Shakespeare. If you're interested take it.",
    "Take this course if you plan on actually taking advantage of the opportunity to read a great volume of Shakespeare plays. The section and the writing assignments are what you make of them, and the professor teaching the course changes from year to year.",
    "Catherine Nicholson is an incredible lecturer. If you like Shakespeare, this will be great. If you discover you don't like Shakespeare, it will be a long semester. A decent amount of work, but if you're used to reading and writing critical essays, it's not too bad. A good pre-1800.",
    "would highly reccomend, but there are a lot of books to read.",
    "This is a good survey of Shakespeare comedies\/romances, as you may have guessed from the title. Prof. Nicholson is wonderful but doesn't post lecture notes, so you need to make sure you are taking good notes for yourself. If you've already read all of these plays, you may not get as much out of it. Or maybe you will. There's a definite gap between people visiting the material for the first time and people who are already familiar with it.",
    "Yes, but know what you are getting into. You have to want to commit yourself to really reading each play every week in order to feel like you've actually gotten something out of this class.",
    "Pre-1800's requirement for English majors: check. This is a fun lecture course, and the workload is totally manageable. I'm so glad Manley is no longer teaching it, and from my understanding, the course has improved a lot under Nicholson. This is just another English class that reveres William Shakespeareand honestly, if you can take a seminar in another more obscure, less \"reverential\" author, do so. You will learn something new. But if you want to continue worshipping the English canon, take this.",
    "Yes! This is a fast-moving course where you read a play a week. There are three 5p paper s and short, low-stress midterm and final. The papers don't require any research, they're mostly close reading organized around prompts. In case you're afraid that you're not into the canon, Prof. Nicholson also incorporated newer theory\/interpretations with a visit to the Beinecke and interesting historical\/political context."
