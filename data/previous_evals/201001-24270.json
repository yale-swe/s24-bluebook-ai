   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have to. If you don't, don't- too much work",
    "You actually will learn a lot about inorganic chemistry in this course! Take it! Chemistry is fun. Also, I think the structure is better than Adv. Chem. Lab so if you are choosing between the two, go with 251.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only if you have extra time in your schedule to devote to writing long lab reports. It's definitely more challenging than orgo or gen. chem. labs, so be willing to put in the work if you want to do well.",
    "The inorganic lab is decent. I felt that some of the topics were a little advanced, but that was mostly because the topics were covered in lecture after the experiments were completed. I think a simple re-ordering of the material would help to solve this problem. While the lab reports must certainly be detailed and are held to rigorous standards, I did not think that the expectations were unreasonable and the lab reports seemed manageable.",
    "In this class we learn a lot about inorganic chemistry techniques, applying inorganic chemistry concept in a laboratory setting. I took it because of pre-med requirements (a second chemistry lab), and I am glad I did.",
    "Yes! If you are a chemistry major, take this class! Dr. Parr is an excellent instructor, and Kari the TA was also excellent! Dr. Parr is willing to meet with you several times before lab reports are due and talk about any specific questions regarding the lab, and he does an excellent job explaining things with crystal clarity. He's also willing to read drafts, but definitely take advantage of office hours and appointments, because they are very helpful. I've learned more in this lab than I did in general chemistry and organic chemistry lab. The lab reports are definitely more intense, but you always have two weeks after the lab to turn in the report, which is a good amount of time. I feel like my lab report writing skill has improved dramatically after taking this class. The experiments were also fun, and the class is very small and laid-back. Excellent class to take for a lab credit for the chemistry major!",
    "I totally recommend it; you really learn how to write, and the small class size means that you can get plenty of one-on-one time to really understand what's going on if you ask questions and make the effort.",
    "This lab was amazing. All of the labs were interesting and engaging, and Dr. Parr is a great teacher. Definitely take it!",
    "Inorganic Lab is cool. You synthesize a lot of colorful compounds and really learn about the chemistry at work since there are fewer labs.",
    "This class tends to be small, which makes for a nice lab experience. However, the labs can be pretty intense and there's a lot of writing, although Prof. Parr is good about telling you exactly what he wants in the reports.",
    "Although this class is a requirement, and labs are often not enjoyable for the amount of work that they entail, this lab was made tolerable by a great professor and an interesting topic. Although there are high expectations, it is possible to succeed. Overall, I would recommend this class because it really feels like you are learning something, rather than just repeating other people's work."
