    "One of the major issues I had with this course was with the amount of guest speakers we had, which disrupted the organization of the syllabus. We got to learn a great deal of interesting information about current practice, but lost the opportunity to discuss the actual mechanics and basic principles behind marketing. That said, when the class was in seminar\/discussion with just Naomi, we had very fruitful discussions and good insights. Her presentations were clear, and we were able to ask good questions along the way."

    "Naomi's presentations were clear, and in-depth enough to allow us to challenge our thought and have good discussion. That said, we never engaged with the instructional reading for the course, which might have been helpful for those in the room who were unfamiliar with the mechanics of marketing, and the principles that optimize marketing decisions."

    "All the visiting presenters were great and provided thorough, insightful information. I would appreciate some more diversity in the presenters, though. In addition to gender, race, and ethnicity, if the presenters had variety in geographic location (outside of New York), type of organization, and marketing focus, that would be beneficial for our learning purposes.",
    "Visitors were very helpful in the learning process.",
    "We had a lot of visitors to this course, and their presentations were all very interesting. It was too bad that the last visitor's presentation ended up taking the full class time, but the conversation was VERY fruitful and enlightining."

    "We did not discuss most of the readings in class. It would be helpful to connect the various chapters that were assigned each week to our class discussions and presentations. Similarly, many of our written assignments were given to us without being directly taught how to write them. If we could spend more time learning about writing either before or after submitting the written assignment, it would be easier to retain that information and learn the proper way to write for marketing.",
    "It would have been nice to have more examples to aid in the homework and final project. Other than that, the class was good.",
    "I wish the elements of each assignment were not completely new when we reached that assignment. For example, the class did very well on the press release assignment because we had discussed press releases in advance, and very poorly on the emails because we had no idea how to write good copy. Examples of - and maybe practice in - good copy writing would have been helpful. And part of the challenge of the final project was that we had no idea what most of the elements of a single ticket marketing plan were when we went and created them."
