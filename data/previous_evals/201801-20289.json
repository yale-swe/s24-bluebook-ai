   "comments": [
    "I learned a fair amount about how to approach large-scale issues or topics like \"oil\" from an anthropological perspective, which was very new. I also learned how to engage with these and others who approach them extremely differently. I feel like I have come away with a significantly better understanding of the global context surrounding oil.",
    "anthropological perspective on how the dynamics of oil affect the world around us, are present everywhere, and form many more parts of our daily interactions than may be initially perceived",
    "This excellent course taught me new ways of thinking about not only oil and fossil fuels but also the economy and daily politics in general. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "The seminar format, and the way Prof. Rogers runs it, means that you need to come to class prepared with something insightful to share. For me, this meant that I would try my best to complete and annotate the reasons, and come up with key themes. These are important skills. I can't say I did them well, but I tried.",
    "A grounding in anthropological perspectives on the cultural significance of oil. I enjoyed learning about different theories from economics, social studies of science, sociology, history and cultural studies. The course was developed in a way to make us think critically about the materials we were given and really challenge ourselves when reading the different articles and books to find out how the authors were in conversation with each other.",
    "This was such an amazing classwhere to begin? For starters, this is the sort of material that just completely colors your world view: it gets hard to look at almost anything, academic or otherwise, and not see vestiges of oil, neoliberalism, globalization, etc. all over it. I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of global forces and world-wide concerns. Additionally, I'm actually finding the anthropologic lens to be very helpful, which I wasn't necessarily expecting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the greatest strength of the class is the diversity of the students who make it up! I learned as much from the readings themselves as from my peers who came at every one with their unique interests and perspectives.",
    "Overall, a very good course. My only complaint is very minor and maybe unavoidable. At the end of the class, I had many new questions, but I felt like too few answers. At the risk of moving away from the open feeling of the class, I would have appreciated a more solid conclusion that moved a little bit closer to wrapping things in a metaphorical bow.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The strengths are that the subject matter is interesting, and Professor Rogers chooses readings that give different perspectives and frameworks to think about the material. I enjoyed that students from different majors brought their own experiences to class discussions. I looked forward to going to class every week.",
    "Strengths: class diversity Weaknesses: we did not really talk about climate change, which seems like a big oversight for an oil class",
    "Strengths: Excellent selection of readings that went together in a manner that facilitated class discussion easily. Structure of the course spread the workload evenly and made thematic sense. Improvements: Spend a little more time explaining anthropology theory that is central to some of the works discussed.",
    "Professor Rogers purposefully selects a diverse seminar of different years, degrees\/schools, work experiences, national and political backgrounds, etc. to create an incredibly lively and interesting discussion. I really, really enjoyed that aspect of the course. Readings were super, super interestingeach one was more eye-opening than the next, and I loved every minute of almost every reading, which is truly uncommon."

    "I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in better understanding how oil operates globally! How people move around it and react to it, in every sense--consumption, production, protest, support, etc.",
    "absolutely take this course--it will change the way you view oil in every aspect of your life, and prof. rogers is an incredibly responsive, engaged, committed, and thoughtful professor",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about anthropology, the economics of fossil fuels, or general knowledge about how people interact with a material that is quite ubiquitous.",
    "Yes! I had been wanting to take this course for a while, and it did not disappoint. Professor Rogers is a great professor and selects really interesting readings to discuss.",
    "Yes. Professor Rogers is really good, and he tends to select a really compelling class. We had grad students and undergrads from many different backgrounds.",
    "Yes! This is an outstanding seminar that is extremely eye-opening and engaging. You do not have to have background in anthropology or social theory - the class is in fact more exciting when there is a diversity of students. I learnt so much from having the readings push my perspective and listening to classmates.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Rogers is amazing, amazing, amazing, and I found the material to be wonderfully interesting and useful. Will definitely draw upon this course going forward in academic and professional work."
