   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - great variety of texts covered - useful to focus on just one text per class Weaknesses: - could have used more explicit guidelines for assignments",
    "I think the course and its syllabus were exceptionally well organized, so that the themes of the books and their disagreements flowed well from one another. I also found the reading of a complete book each week, rather than combining chapters or articles, to be effective for engaging such material. I also thought that the pre-circulated weekly presentations was a good way to structure the class, so that discussion questions followed easily from the presentations. Of all the books, I found Berardi's work to be the least compelling, so if the syllabus were being revised, I think that could be one of the books to go.",
    "Great reading list, generative in-class discussion, was unclear about what affect theory was at first and it became more clear as the class when along. I found it difficult to write a final paper without any parameters but it did allow for a more creative project. I also enjoy classes that push student to briefly write about the readings\/generate questions about the readings before class because I find that it generates more focused discussion sessions."
