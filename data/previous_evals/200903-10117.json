    "Yes.",
    "if this class is ever taught again by vikram mansharamani, take it. while the material is repetitive, it is interesting and the repetition is necessary in order to become familiar with the similarities of all financial extremes. unlike most other yale classes, what this class teaches is useful beyond academia. and who better to take a class like this than from a practitioner in the field. before taking the class, however, understand that depending on who teaches it (if a practicing professional) many students will suck up in way that can be just plain annoying. also, the guest lecturers and visitors were fantastic -- their ability to reproduce observations on the material that took us many readings to realize was particularly interesting. it goes to show that some professionals have learned this material from experience.",
    "This was the best class I've taken at Yale. Financial market cycles are especially relevant in today's economic environment, and the professor does an incredible job teaching us about theory, case studies, and investment strategy during boom and bust cycles.The workload is extremely manageable; the seminar format is fun; the guest speakers are incredible. This is not a class to miss out on.",
    "Fascinating. It's a wonder why it's not offered as a legit class at Yale.If you're interested in finance, this is the best place to jump right into the material.",
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to nearly any student interested in the financial markets, the stock market, the recent crisis, or any really just in general (were it to be offered again).",
    "The class presents to you solid reading material that helps you understand the current crisis and crises in general in a much more comprehensive and fulfilling manner. Class could be run slightly better. If we went over crises thematically rather than by book, I think the class would have been more formative in and of itself. Given the books that you read and the freedom that you're given in writing your reading responses, you will get out of the class what you put into it. If you keep up with the material and actually think about it, it will be an interesting class.",
    "I would recommend Booms and Busts to a student with a reasonable background in economics and finance. Not to say it should only be seniors in econ, but some familiarity is good. Shiller's financial markets class might be a useful, though not essentially, class. With some background I think this class becomes an incredibly interesting tour of the theories and history surrounding financial instability that any one interested in economics or finance should absolutely study.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would recommend the class if they have a strong economics background.",
    "Yes - definitely take the class.",
    "If Vikram ever teaches this seminar again, definitely take it! One of my favorite Yale classes ever. Well-taught and the discussions you have every week will change your preconceived notions about financial markets.",
    "YES. Prof M is great and the readings for the course are really interesting.The reading list is fun and interesting and the final paper is also cool just because you probably won't write one like it for any other course. Overall, it's a pretty chill course on something interesting - bubbles, busts, etc.One thing to consider though is that it attracts a lot of students who are already very fluent in financial language and concepts so if you're really really green to that kind of thing it might be harder (you might take a hit from the relative curve\/have to do more work than your peers to keep up). The class ended up not being as academic about finance because so many people were interested in finance careers that half the time discussions were about finance stuff and not as much about the texts or academic (as opposed to technical) approaches to understanding finance."
