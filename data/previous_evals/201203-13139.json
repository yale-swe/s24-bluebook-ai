   "comments": [
    "Unless you really enjoy both of the fields in the course name, I would not recommend. You can learn so much more in other courses at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the course only to students who are interested in both architecture and music and to students who already have a decent musical background.",
    "This class gave a broad overview of Jazz history, then Architecture theory, and then tried to connect Jazz and Architecture (mostly modern of both) by using Architecture words to describe Jazz and Jazz words to describe Architecture. It was interesting, and I feel like I got a better sense for them as separate disciplines. However, the connections between the two got very hazy and theoretical and esoteric. I would recommend this course with reservations--if you manage your expectations, you can get something out of it.",
    "This jazz and architecture seminar discusses a fascinating thought-provoking topic. It is valuable if you have a strong interest or desire to think very abstractly and conceptually about music and architecture.It requires having an open-mind because it will broaden or challenge your normal perspective. I would recommend it if the student has an interest in either music or art and is willing to think abstractly.",
    "It was very interesting and the connection between two fields was very impressive. Making the connections involved a lot of thinking and results were meaningful. It resulted in deeper perception of both fields. I would recommend it to someone involved in jazz especially.",
    "It is a very good course to take, if you are interested in either music or architecture. However, I am interested in neither -- while I still found the course to be interesting, I would have taken much more from it had I been aiming toward majoring in either music or architecture.",
    "Wonderful class that taught me a lot about appreciating both Jazz and architecture. One of those classes that provides a skill of appreciation that affects how you view the world the rest of your life; take it!",
    "If you have any interest in jazz or architecture, or if you are curious about how these two disciplines can combine then definitely take this class. As a freshman seminar, the work load is extremely manageable and this is a low stress class throughout the semester. Professor Veal is awesome and a really cool guy in general which makes the class more fun and interesting. You listen to some cool music, look at some cool buildings and talk about how they relate and build off of each other.",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend this course to students without a background in architecture or jazz. The material is difficult enough with some jazz training that it is likely near unapproachable without. Still, the course is rewarding and interesting, providing new insights into both art forms and the connections between them.",
    "A fun and interesting freshman seminar. If you are interested in jazz or architecture you should definitely take it. I had no previous exposure to either of them and learned a lot about them both. Professor Veal is great-- the type of person you come to Yale for. The class is lots of fun and not a lot of work. It is very intellectually challenging though, with lots of difficult concepts. If you try and really apply yourself to the concepts, you can learn a lot and it can be very rewarding. Its not really very taxing, but, like most things, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it."
