   "comments": [
    "At first, I was excited to take this class. The subject is incredibly topical and interesting, and there were only two papers. But by the end of the year, I dreaded going to class each Wednesday. Probably the worst seminar I've had at Yale. The readings that were assigned each week weren't the same ones as on the syllabus, and when it came time to actually discuss the readings, a different student each week would present the readings and lead discussion. This just meant that Professor Kane was never involved in the class. Roughly half the class wouldn't talk each time. If you want to take this class, go watch \"The Big Short\" and pick a different seminar. Seriously. It's not worth it.",
    "A close look at finance and leadership through an ethical lens.",
    "EP&E 420 covers many different topics related to the 2008 financial crisis including moral hazard, the role of modeling\/economics, prudent leadership, etc. You will learn a lot about the crisis from different angles, especially more theoretical ones than are commonly brought up in the media. I would definitely recommend EP&E 420 to another student if it is offered again. The seminar is very interesting and worthwhile.",
    "This course looks at different issues that led to the financial crisis and the challenges for leaders in dealing with them. It is comprehensive, in the sense that it looks at many sources for the pathologies that caused the financial crisis. It doesnt just look at regulation issues, but ideological and political issues that challenge leaders. The seminar experience may depend on the classmates willingness to discuss.",
    "Yes, take it. A little boring, but interesting subject. Granted, it is hard for the study of a historical financial event to be exciting. Overall, there is not a lot work and a great professor.",
    "Leadership, Ethics and Economic Crisis was a worthwhile class taught by professor who was exceptionally well-prepared to teach on such a subject. John Kane has a wealth of knowledge about leadership, ethics and economic crises and has compiled plenty of material on these topics over the past decades. If you're looking for a class that explores the role of moral imperative in the face of difficult circumstances, or are searching for sources to explore these topics for a senior thesis or special project, then take the class."
