    "great spanish course, especially if you have just taken L1",
    "Much harder and much more work than 110. Make sure to do well and every assignment. Organized better than 110. I took it with Tortora she was amazing and very kind and helpful. However, she graded a bit harder. I heard from other students that Ortega is an easier grader. Your welcome!",
    "Great course and great professor! If you want to enjoy a spanish class, take this section. Professor Trtora is the best and she will help you out so much.",
    "A lot of work but rewarding if you want to learn spanish",
    "Challenging and a lot of work",
    "This is a solid class.",
    "Provides a solid foundation of Spanish. However, the workload is very large; took me hours each night to finish the variety of types of homework, as well as to study for assessments that take place at least weekly.",
    "Yes i would recommend although you have to be committed to putting effort in everyday. Its a great language to get your requirement done."
