   "comments": [
    "I learned about a lot of interesting, current Public Health topics.",
    "The course was a great survey of global\/public health. We covered around every major issue in the past 50 years including its history, as well as issues of the future. Guest lectures were incredibly insightful.",
    "understood many broad topics in public health and how to brainstorm solutions to these issues",
    "This course, though a bit shaky in my opinion at first, has truly helped me uncover a passion for global\/public health that I only had an inkling of coming into Yale. I learned how to properly analyze and dissect global\/public health readings, consider the world around me, and present the world around me in a way that I would have never known and I would have never realized. Though, I admit, I thought this class was a bit disorganized and arbitrary going into it, it improved as the semester went on and I looked forward to the readings and learning more about medicine and global\/public health. It's opened so many more new passions I thought I would never come to foster, and it's recommended for those who are even slightly interested in public health and medicine.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze science writing, both scientific journal articles and clinical studies. In addition, I learned how to improve my writing to a level that better engages the reader.",
    "The information learned was very insightful and important as it applied to the current issues affecting our world.",
    "I was able to discuss a wide variety of health issues with my peers and received insight from our professor as well as visitors that came throughout the course. It was fast paced and very interesting.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about many public health issues--and i feel much more literate in medicine and scientific studies. I also learned a lot about how the media functions and how they effect public health issues.",
    "I learned how to thoroughly read articles, stories, and scientific research. The studies we focused on really turned my knowledge to the real world and its public health issues."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The content of the course is extremely interesting and elicits a lot of discussion. However, the way the course is run limits that discussion from the students, and focuses more on lectures from the professor.",
    "I felt sometimes we rushed through certain topics, and spent too long on others. The guest lectures were amazing, and the NBC\/CBS clips really aided in forming an accurate picture of the public health state of the past.",
    "The course covered lots of material but not in an organized fashion; we usually jumped from topic to topic with no connection, but it was interesting to learn about a wide variety of public health issues",
    "At the beginning of the course, I thought the class structure was quite disorganized. Readings assigned for the next class weren't always discussed, and the assigned textbook wasn't always used, which confused me and threw me in for a loop for a bit. But as the course progressed, I realized that one of its strengths was more of a free flowing discussion\/reading\/giving our own presentation format, which was good when discussing matters that didn't necessarily always have one strict answer. Another strength was also the variety of topics we covered, everyone found a niche somewhere (it made me realize what passion I had for women's health). Reading load could be heavy and dense sometimes with a fair share of scientific journals and articles, but it also had a good variety from popular magazines, newspapers, etc. Definitely good variety. Watched John Oliver a couple of times for homework and saw Professor Bazell report on major global\/public health issues in class so that was amazing. Strength was also the flexibility in writing papers: only a couple (I would say somewhere from 3-4) papers that, for the most part, you can choose the topic, which was great because I had the ability to write and research what I was most interested in which benefited greatly.",
    "I think the strength of this course was the large amount of content we covered and the professor's ability to help us understand all parts of it. I think a weakness of this course was the little time we had to spend on each topic.",
    "The homework prepared us well to discuss topics in class, and we were quite prepared to write the final paper from what we had learned.",
    "Strengths--covered a lot of topics, great teacher, really interesting discussions\/topics\/guest speakers weaknesses--monotonous class format, discussions were sometimes repetitive",
    "Allowing the students to teach the classes and really take in the information really helped me during this course. The book we read at the beginning was not very insightful and i did not see an exact point to it. The articles and readings assigned were so interesting and it really sparked my love for public health."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in Public Health, and who want to learn more about various topics in the sector.",
    "Yes, very interesting material",
    "If you are interested in public health and medicine, this is a great introduction! Other than weekly readings and some term papers, the workload isn't too bad",
    "Definitely take this class if you want an intro type of thing to global\/public health and if you're even remotely interested in medicine because it will expose you to different medical facets around the world and in the US; also take this class if you like to read medical things.",
    "I would recommend the course because the professor was knowledgable (an expert in the public health field) and the content was very interesting to me",
    "If you are able to take this course, it really is interesting and allows you to look at health issues that was developed over centuries as well as modern epidemics. It truly is an enjoyable class.",
    "Absolutely! A valuable class for any major!",
    "For students interested in public health issues, diseases, or controversy - i would highly recommend this class. Huge global health issues are brought up into detail and real life studies and situations are brought to our attention. I felt so engaged and important during discussions. I would highly recommend this class."
