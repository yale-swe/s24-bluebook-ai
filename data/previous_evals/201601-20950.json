   "comments": [
    "Great gut science credit.",
    "The class was straightforward and didn't require a ton of work, but you got to explore interesting topics and learn a lot.",
    "I honestly wouldn't recommend it. The material is mostly pretty straightforward but not always that interesting and classes involve a lot of tedious exercises. Grading seems arbitrary.",
    "Irrelevant since Edwards is leaving but interesting material, crappy structure",
    "If you need a science credit, this class can definitely fulfil that requirement in an interesting and engaging manner.",
    "The conceptual science is easy but some of the math involved can get complicated, though it is still only basic algebra. Overall not incredibly difficult but very interesting. Would recommend in order to cover science requirement.",
    "Much harder than people make it seem to be. If you're amazing at math and physics, go for it. But if not, don't do it to yourself. Psets are good but the tests are killer.",
    "Interesting and fairly easy science credit.",
    "A deceptively hard science gut. It's a low workload class with just 9 psets that take about 90 minutes each, but it's also very frustrating. There isn't a textbook and the online slides are not very useful. The exams are tough though and the material seemed too detailed for non science majors at times. 1\/3 of the class is particle physics stuff regarding dark matter. Learning the formulas and math stuff was fine but not very enjoyable or useful for a nonscience major. You kind of just go through the motions. Didn't learn as much as I had wished. If you want a fulfilling course take something else. This class was not very enjoyable and I regret taking it.",
    "N\/A since Prof. Edwards is leaving Yale. However, I would recommend students take a science class in the TEAL room, especially non-science majors who are looking for a way to enjoyable take a science credit.",
    "Fun class not too much work but sift for the tests which are graded harshly",
    "It's a relatively easy QR\/SC, not too much work, and with interesting material. The course is disorganized at times and a lot of time is wasted on irrelevant and unhelpful activities, but I enjoyed the course overall.",
    "The class focuses on three main topics in astrophysics. Each midterm focuses on each one of the topics. Study early for each midterm and go to section.",
    "Can be more challenging than expected. You are required to go to class and the class sessions are pretty boring. Overall though, it's not a terrible choice if you need a science credit and you are a non-science major.",
    "Would recommend it to anyone with little experience in science and is interested in physics.",
    "I think this is a pretty nice class if you wanted a semi-easy science\/QR credit or have interest in the subjects covered (black holes, dark matter, exoplanets, basics of astrophysics). That being said, when I took it (the instructor is leaving) it was rather confusing most of the time. Eventually you get to that \"Aha!\" moment but it took weeks of total confusion as the teacher meandered around various topics. I don't regret taking it at all, but its definitely not for everyone or the typical gut class it was painted out to be. Also, in terms of QR this is the easiest class ever, the math is super basic algebra and you always have a calculator. But a lot of people struggled with the scientific logic skills that were required as the class went on.",
    "This is an entertaining course which introduces some cool astrophysics concepts at a very basic level. I enjoyed it, mostly. I think the course is well designed in terms of material covered and the level of the math and science is good for non-STEM students. Definitely worth taking if you're curious about the universe. Just be careful on problem sets, they're often marked a bit carelessly.",
    "Hard class - not a gut. Louise Edwards is really rude. Class itself was incredibly interesting though and learned a lot.",
    "Good intro to Astrophysics that gives you a basic understanding of some of the most controversial topics in Physics right now. If your math skills are weaker (ie: you struggle in Calculus), I would not recommend this course. Otherwise, if you want a nice SC or QR credit with some interesting facts learnt, I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend as class for non science majors but it is very helpful to have taken an astronomy course before because it is hard to keep up without any science background at all.",
    "ASTR 160 is an outstanding overview of key topics in Astrophysics including Black Holes, Dark Matter, and Stars that will let you go to an observatory, interact with challenging topics, and expand your understanding of the universe. Please take it!",
    "even though I didn't enjoy doing the psets, the material is genuinely so so interesting!!",
    "A good science class for non-science majors",
    "An analysis of exoplanets, dark matter, black holes, and other phenomemons that perplex scientists daily.",
    "Not too difficult for anyone who has a decent math background, this was a fair and often interesting class. If you've already taken search for life in the universe with Debra Fischer, definitely take this.",
    "I recommend it but depends on the professor.",
    "Great class!",
    "Good sc credit. Has some interesting materials but don't expect to know a Lot after the class",
    "ASTR 160 is a pretty good SC credit for those who aren't science majors. I wouldn't exactly call it an easy A, but it wasn't hard by any means. The math doesn't go beyond very basic Trig.",
    "Don't do it",
    "Not my cup of tea. I was looking for a gut science and did not find it here. If you're into astrophysics, you may have a better and easier time than I did, but as someone who was under the impression that this class would be more discussion-based and less math\/science based, I didn't have the greatest time.",
    "Great material! Interesting class!",
    "Only take this class if you absolutely have to.",
    "Don't take it.",
    "Interesting astronomy class involving math, not necessarily easy.",
    "ASTR 160 was a very interesting course that provides a broad introduction to three topics at the frontier of astrophysics: exoplanets, black holes and dark matter. I really enjoyed the material, and I would recommend the course to another student. Some background in physics (like a high school physics course) is helpful. The course was successful in providing both breadth and depth, and I also appreciated the fact that we were able to discuss current research being conducted in the areas we studied. We even went to the planetarium, which was both informative and fun!",
    "Pretty easy :) you learn cool stuff",
    "No. Even though it's not at 9:00 AM as it was the year before, even though Louise Edwards is not teaching, I wouldn't recommend this byzantine, impossible class to anyone. I know one person who felt confident here: and he took three years off of college to study Physics in England. The rest of us were damned from the get-go.",
    "only Yes, because I think the topics are interesting.",
    "Astro 160 was an interesting way to learn about concepts such as black holes, solar systems, galaxies, and dark matter. The interactive lecture-style class is fun and engaging, and the trips to the observatory make some of the dryer concepts come to life. I definitely recommend if you are looking to knock out a science or QR credit.",
    "I would recommend this class for other students who need a manageable QR class. It is geared towards non-STEM majors, and has interesting subject matter presented in as accessible a way as possible.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone that is interested in the material. It isnt necessarily easy but it is very interesting and the teaching is excellent.",
    "I would summarize ASTR 160 as difficult, but doable. I would recommend it to another student because the concepts are interesting and the professor is super lovable! However, I would warn that it's not a class that someone can just breeze through (especially if you're a non-science person like me). It might take a lot of time outside of class, and even section, in order to fully grasp the lessons.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR EDWARDS. EVERYTHING IS GREAT ABOUT IT: PROFESSOR, TAs, MATERIAL! ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I TOOK AT YALE.",
    "A great course for someone interested in science fiction and with minimal background knowledge in physics. Since the course is all about the \"weird stuff\" in space, a lot of topics will end with the phrase \"we just don't know yet,\" which can be frustrating. But this also means that the field is constantly on the edge of discovery, and it's really exciting when things like gravity waves are detected and we can discuss it immediately in class.",
    "This is by far the worst class at yale. Do not be tricked into it by the reviews. It is NOT easy, and professor edwards is AWFUL.",
    "Not what it appears to be. Teacher is cool, but not effective.",
    "Definitely recommend if you want a fun and easy science credit!"
