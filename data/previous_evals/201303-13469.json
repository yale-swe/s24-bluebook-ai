    "This is a really great introduction to the mechanics of how to think about, structure, and write a college paper. It also gives you a basic understanding of the ideas of many of the formative people who were thinking about the role of mental illness in society over the past hundred years. The class is structured into different topicsrelating to madness, which keeps it moving and makes it interesting. Julia is a great teacher; she is knowledgeable, witty, and really relatable. There are 4 papers- each of which has one or two drafts, and a few short readings for every class. The work load is totally manageable, and I feel like the readings have really deepened the way I think about mental illness. Overall- this is a great class. TAKE IT.",
    "I would recommend english 114 to another student, especially someone who is worried about having a boring english class. This course is not boring and it's also small, so it's more personal than other classes and that can be enjoyable when your other classes are lectures. The workload is not overbearing. There's mostly reading and four papers total, which she gives plenty of time to write.",
    "This class was very thought provoking and discussion based, and the material was fascinating. The papers and grading were difficult, but overall I would recommend the course to all people interested in quickly improving their writing abilities--the feedback was extremely helpful, and I learned a lot in a very short period.",
    "If you want to learn more about a particular subject and get some practice in research and academic writing, it might be a good option. But I do not think it is particularly necessary, especially in the first semester of the freshman year.",
    "The Madness& Civilization section of ENGL 114 was my favorite class this semester. Professor Yost is wonderful and the readings are super interesting. The workload is very manageable and I would highly recommend this class!",
    "This is a great course to learn the proper structure of a college paper. The conversation in class is interesting and fun. I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Discussing insanity and what it means to be insane.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 114 30, especially if, beyond getting a writing credit, you want to improve your writing skills. Julia is great and the course material is very interesting. Overall, taking this course at the beginning of my four years at Yale was a great decision.",
    "It is a great English course. If you want to learn how to write academic papers then take it. I would recommend the course.",
    "Madness and Civilization is such an interesting section, especially if you are interested in psych. The readings are interesting and the class discussions are engaging. Yost is fun and fair. I definitely improved as a writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was a very interesting and engaging freshman writing seminar."
