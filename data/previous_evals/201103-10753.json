   "comments": [
    "This course is a good course to take if you are a management student who wants to have some exposure to political science and international relations. Unfortunately, for IR students the course material is too superficial to contribute to my understanding of the defense industry or international politics. Further, the business concepts outlined in the course materialwere not developed enough to make them applicable to my work as an IR student. Thus, I would recommend the course only to management students.",
    "I would NOT recommend it to anyone. It was a huge disappointment.",
    "Maybe\/depends. There is a lot of technical stuff that wouldn't be applicable for all majors or degrees.",
    "The online course summary is very accurate for this course -- it combines political science and international relations with an SOM perspective to cover issues of national security strategy and war in a very useful way. But beyond the very macro point of view, this course is a disappointment because of the professor's lack of organization, arcane testing strategies, and poor lectures. I would not recommend this course to another student unless it is precisely the type of material he\/she seeks to concentrate on in his\/her program. I only took this course because it is extremely closely related to my concentration, which involves defense policy and nuclear proliferation. If I had only a peripheral interestin the course material, I would have dropped it after the first day.",
    "Good course to learn facts, not analytical skills.",
    "No.",
    "Yes. I liked the business approach to defense issues.",
    "I would not recommend the course to another student because 1. it focuses on regurgitation of material, not synthesis, 2. the professor seems disjointed and confusing in his presentations, 3. there is no room for any point of view other than the professor's, and certainly no room for discussion (making it a difficult class to really learn much in).",
    "interesting course, great instructor, relevant material, and appropriate work load.",
    "If you did not do any Poly. Sc. courses in undergrad, take it.",
    "I strongly recommend the course because the material covered in the course are hard to learn outside the class."

   "comments": [
    "This course did not contribute to my research. I am glad that I received a basic understanding of organizational behavior, and I believe that this will perhaps be useful for future research.",
    "If anything, I feel less intelligent after having taken this class. As a serious international relations scholar, I found this class to be a joke. It in no way contributed to my intellectual growth.",
    "This course introduced me to a new perspective, which was beneficial for my future profession. But it was only a glancing introduction, rather than an in-depth exploration of core concepts.",
    "The course increased my understanding of strategic issues regarding security, which is an area I feel particularly inexperienced in.",
    "I learned bou thte defense sector",
    "it gave a lot of subject matter expertise on national security and really piqued my interest again!",
    "It really deepned my understanding of u.s. national security."
