   "comments": [
    "A much clearer and in-depth understanding of how international climate negotiations operate. I also think knowing the different coalitions (AOSIS, G77+China, LMDC, etc.) was very helpful.",
    "I have a significantly better understanding of the history of global climate change negotiations and the current agreements, how we got there. We also learned some really good negotiating techniques.",
    "Climate Change framework and actual negotiation on international agreement",
    "My favorite part of the course was the mock climate negotiations. Learning the tricks and insider details from an expert on climate negotiations was a fascinating insight into global environmental governance.",
    "A comprehensive understanding about the history and future of climate change negotiations.",
    "History of the UNFCCC including opportunities and challenges for improvement.",
    "Understanding of climate change negotiations",
    "good overview of what goes on at negotiations, Sue has un-paralleled experience, learn about negotiating tools. Just a positive.",
    "Better understanding of the details of various climate change agreements",
    "This course provided a great deal of valuable and interesting insights into the climate change negotiation process. I appreciate Professor Biniaz taking the time to share her expertise with the class.",
    "A great foundation in the global climate regime.",
    "I learned about the complexities of climate negotiations.",
    "This was a great crash course in the past 30 years of climate change negotiation history. I now know what the landmark moments were and when certain themes and statutes were introduced. The practicum which involved a mock negotiation was great preparation for when I try to go to COP next year.",
    "Overview of the international climate agreements, from the perspective of a key player in them.",
    "Excellent insight into the climate change negotiations! Sue Biniaz not only shares the history of the negotiations with you, but she also helps you understand how to read between the lines to examine countries' positions.",
    "Going into the class, I didn't know too much about the international climate regime. Coming out of the class I feel much more informed on the history, context, and trajectory of international climate policies.",
    "High level knowledge of UNFCCC conferences and important agreements. Great example of how international negotiations work that really prepared me well for COP.",
    "a history and context of the international climate negotiations.",
    "Basic first-hand understanding of the climate change negotiation process, both historically as well as in the context of issues that are still being confronted in present-day discussions.",
    "Considering that this was a one-credit course that only met one time, I learned an enormous amount about the international climate policy regime in this course. We were also able to apply that knowledge in a mock negotiation.",
    "A more comprehensive understanding of the history of the international climate change regime since its inception. Knowledge of procedures\/protocols in negotiation rooms\/settings. Very useful negotiation tools. An impression of what to expect from COP24 and immediate future conferences.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the Climate Change Negotiation Process and the key issues that are on the front burner- especially with respect to the Paris Agreement. Also, I was able to participate in a mock negotiation session to horn my skills on climate negotiations."

    "Very well",
    "Even better than expected.",
    "It was exactly what I expected.",
    "They were great. I was hoping to gain a-lot and learned relatively more than expected for a 1 credit course.",
    "It was short, so the overview style was expected. I appreciated how Sue drew comparisons between the agreements to show the evolution through Paris and what was at stake in this year's negotiations.",
    "Exceeded my expectations! Also, this class was incredibly helpful prep for COP.",
    "Very well.",
    "Very well!",
    "I appreciated the history, but would have liked more discussion of the current UNFCCC structures.",
    "Aligned very well. Three informative, detail-packed lectures + one interactive mock debate module was a terrific format.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations in terms of how much we were able to learn in the time allotted.",
    "Very Well.",
    "The knowledge from this class was quite helpful and up to date. The insights and skills provided a starting point for thinking about joining the global negotiation process."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Perhaps an earlier time of day--2 hours in the evening is ripe for inattention.",
    "Instructor is terrific, highly knowledgeable and has a great teaching style. I really enjoyed the mock negotiation. No weaknesses in my opinion. It's short but frankly the right amount of time for the content.",
    "The last session - mock negotiation was very good opportunity to learn how countries are taking their position for climate change negotiation.",
    "Well structured but felt like some actors in the mock negotiations did not have as big a role to play based on their negotiating position. As South Africa, I felt less engaged due to the positionality of their geopolitics.",
    "This course was great! Very organized lectures (I loved the chart that we filled out) and helpful assignments.",
    "Strengths are the depth of the professors knowledge. Weaknesses are that Professor Biniaz lectured for two hours with little student engagement.",
    "More material to be given to students in the form of slides etc.",
    "I know that Sue is busy, but maybe just capping the number of students at 25 or 30? Just felt massive with the number of interested folks. Nevertheless, learned a bit from it.",
    "Excellent coverage of various climate change covenants",
    "Strengths: readings, class lecture, assignments, mock negotiation.",
    "It was too quick but it made sense for a one credit course.",
    "Sue Biniaz is a great lecturer. She really knows her stuff and can speak about it at length off hand. I think it could have been helpful to have some type of visual material to complement the lecture series. It can be tricky for some to sit for 2 + hours without anything to look at. Maybe a digitized version of the matrix? I actually liked filling it out by hand... maybe provide a digitized one for reference after the class to have handy? It was really important stuff and in this day and age a piece of paper is just not going to stick around.",
    "Too fast paced. There should've been a greater level of training provided for the negotiation exercise which was part of the course.",
    "Strengths: Sue's lecture style, mock negotiation Weakness: size of the class. Wish there had been a bit more time for discussion or questions. The pace was quick!",
    "Strengths include: Sue's deep knowledge of the negotiations, the readings, the assignment which required you to read the agreements and decisions closely as well as the negotiations simulation at the end of the class. No weaknesses!",
    "Can't think of any way to improve it. But, more model debates would be fun.",
    "Sue moves very quickly. She is not the most engaging speaker but if you ask her questions she really opens up.",
    "Some of the lectures were hard to follow from the back of the room since Sue Biniaz would sit and read from notes. However, the chart comparing summits\/outcomes was helpful. The mock negotiation was incredibly helpful.",
    "Overall, thought the course format and content were terrific. Would have appreciated more involvement of developing country perspectives during the final mock debate module, as well as a bit more insight into other countries' negotiation tactics. (However, I do realize the class is set up to be relatively American-centric).",
    "Considering the length of the course, I thought this course was very successful.",
    "Sue's lectures were always captivating She presented a succinct but instructive overview of the history of the regime in a way that I had not encountered before, and allowed me to better understand the progression of developments with the regime.",
    "The class was very well organized, I would suggest that if it were possible to get some video sessions of former climate negotiations and use them as part of the teaching session it may be helpful to aid students deeper understanding."

   "comments": [
    "Engage with the readings, do them before class and pay attention to a terrific instructor. Ask her questions to get the most out of your opportunity to interact with her as she has an amazing background.",
    "This course and Dan Esty's class can be mandatory for any students who want learn basics of climate change",
    "Take this class if you want to learn more about the climate negotiating process!",
    "Do the reading to be prepared for the lecture.",
    "Interesting course",
    "Take the course! It's a one-credit & teaches you some good information from an expert. Don't expect it to completely upend your knowledge, but a worthwhile addition to a full course load.",
    "Fun class",
    "Be prepared to do a good amount of reading. The class only meets 4 times, but during that period you'll spend a fair amount of time on the class.",
    "Be very attentive- the classes go by quick!",
    "Amazing class. Its a great opportunity to learn from a true leader in the field who was a key player in many, if not all, of the referenced climate negotiations. I would recommend this to every student at F&ES. Its easy to find time to fit a 1 credit course in your schedule regardless of your specialization.",
    "Great 1 credit intro the agreements for those with little background in them.",
    "Incredibly helpful class to take for all those who want to attend COP or want a deeper understanding of the negotiations! Don't miss the opportunity to take a class from Sue.",
    "Can't think of anything.",
    "Go to office hours if you are interested in more nuances of the topics. Also note that she approaches things from a US perspective so it is interesting to think about things from the perspective of different countries which you get a little of in the mock negotiation but not a ton.",
    "Be ok for a largely traditional lecture format.",
    "Take detailed notes, preferably on a computer where you can record as much information as possible. Professor Biniaz's lectures are extremely informative and you won't be able to access her perspective from other sources.",
    "I would advise any student interested in climate policy, or any international negotiations\/policy issues, to take this course.",
    "Definitely a must if you (a) intend on attending any of the major UNFCCC process meetings or conferences and (b) if you have a strong interest in international climate policy.",
    "Intending students should be very clear on the areas of the Climate Negotiation Process that interests you and seek to focus on learning more about that."
