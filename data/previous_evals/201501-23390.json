   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: It was a very practical class where we learn leadership, team work, presentation skills and problem solving. These are definitely skills that I see myself using immediately in my new job post graduation. Weaknesses: Instructions for the paper, project were unclear. A bit disorganized when it came to deadline and the syllabus. Also it appeared that we never had enough time in class and some parts of the class went a bit too slow (e.g. going over simple rootcause models and acting out problematic teams) I don't agree that undergraduates should be in this class, they do not have sufficient work experience to contribute meaningfully during group work. The class size was too large and resulted in awkward silences during class.",
    "Strength in allowing us to practice strategic problem solving and presenting our ideas. Weak in that more time in the beginning working through strategic analysis of cases would have been useful.",
    "Betsy is amazing. Wish we gained more actual skills.",
    "group work was a plus practical applications were a plus emotional intelligence talks were a plus!",
    "Important content to learn but I wish it had been a real capstone for HCM students only (too many policy students and undergrads really took away the 'capstone feel' - I feel a little robbed of a true capstone experience. It was something we were all looking forward to)",
    "The course introduces concept of leadership. Topics include team dynamics and problem solving methodology. Case study was rarely involved in the course so it would be better to incorporate more case discussions.",
    "The capstone course is usually taught by Professor Nembhard, which will be a very different course than this one taught by Professor Bradley. We all know that Professor Bradley is an expert in global health systems, but many of us the class are not. I appreciated that she both domestic and global cases in the course, but the domestic cases are not that interesting, especially the D2Hawkeye Case. Professor Bradley is a great teacher but much of the content in this capstone, which is supposed to be an culmination of our 2 years here, is simple and straightforward. I wish we could have discussed the kinds of problems we would face as healthcare managers AND the solutions to solve them.",
    "Strengths - learning about how to write a strategy brief and how to present in front of a hostile audience Weaknesses - very narrow field in healthcare (it's either global health or hospitals), the syllabus needs to have actual dates instead of vague week numbers, did not feel like a capstone class for HCM because of the size and lack of specialization to the cohort",
    "Not sure how the assignments tied in with what we discussed in class",
    "Strengths: A lot of insight into groupwork and leadership Weaknesses: Don't know anything about operations management",
    "I really enjoyed this course.",
    "The course was useful for thinking through groupwork and team management, though that aspect of the class would have been much more useful during the first semester of the first year. This semester would have been more useful had we spent more time doing case studies that focused on business\/management issues at healthcare organizations and thinking through how they have (are being) solved. The group presentations were not helpful as it felt that the entire time we were being nitpicked for the sake of making us go through the exercise of being on the spot. That would have been a useful exercise on its own, but it diminished all the work that had been done leading up to the presentation (as the focus was on picking apart little pieces, rather than fully assessing the work done). The presentations were also diminished by the fact that both the panel and presenters were \"living\" in different realities (\"you say this is a problem but my friends tell me that they love it\"). It made (again) the presentations feel more like the emphasis was more on who could create the best answer out of thin air, rather than showcasing the actual work done. (Being in the hot seat would be a good exercise to go through and experience, but should not be coupled with a time-consuming group project).",
    "Course material seems haphazard at times, and does not go in depth at all to be particularly useful. Feedback also too succinct to be helpful. Emphasis on group work should come at beginning of graduate school and not at end.",
    "The course taught some useful skills that did not overlap with any other courses at YSPH or SOM. The only weakness of this course is that the class size was too large.",
    "This was a good course, but it was not the capstone experience it was supposed to be for health care management.",
    "Strengths: provides a rigorous methodology for strategic problem-solving Areas of improvement: increased use of cases in classroom discussion",
    "Strengths- group work, TA sessions, case discussions Weaknesses- dated cases for individual and group final assignments",
    "Strengths - This is a great leadership course and I personally feel like it is much more useful than the core MBA Leadership Development Course. I particularly liked that we got to assess our team dynamics. - I liked that we had the flexibility to pick projects we were interested in. - Loved the global outlook! Weaknesses - As a capstone course, I believe it should involve more practical, real-life and complex projects that we could work on as a team to culminate our experience here. The way it's taught right now makes it appear more like a course that should be taught at the beginning of our experience at Yale instead of at the end. I.e. at this point, we have had quite a bit of practice working in teams and preparing powerpoint presentations so why are we re-learning this at the end of the two years? - The simulated presentations were interesting, but I felt that the evaluators got too into their roles of trying to derail the presenters instead of actually listening to the content of the presentation. As a presenter I felt quite offended."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Strengths: Betsy is an excellent speaker and teacher. Weakness: I don't feel like she took the time to really know the students in the class, she is always rushing in and out. I wished she was more intimate with us personally.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Great facilitator, but maybe getting more definitive management strategies for certain situations, beyond a class group dynamic could have been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Love her!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0friendly, thoughtful and energetic!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy is very patient and a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Professor Bradley is a great and approachable professor. She can relay information in ways that we can all understand. The way she designed this capstone course is odd, however, as I was expecting it to be more of a practical course on how to identify and solve the problems we would face in the real world. Her in-class discussion of the readings is not always necessary as the message from the readings are quite clear. The level of questioning we all received in our first group presentation felt more like hazing, especially because we had absolutely no idea we needed to prepare for ridiculous questions and pestering that would not happen in the real world.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Weaknesses - her grading comments on the final PowerPoint were extremely different from the questions asked during the presentation, her insights right after the presentation, and Yuna's feedback. Seemed nit=picky and was not helpful Improvements - the simulated examples were not helpful, more practical workshops on how to have difficult conversations and conflict resolution practice would be more effective",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0She's clearly an expert but could've done a better job sharing her expertise - she expected us to know a lot about global health to complete assignments but I've never taken a global health class, and feel like that was unfair",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0VERY supportive and willing to help students but the class didn't deviate much from her leadership course",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0[submitted review on SOM registrar]",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy was very knowledgable and her personal experiences were very interesting. Her advice was so valuable and I wish that there was more of it!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Great professor. Very fun and engaging in front of the class. Was very nice to learn from.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Energetic but steamrolls over.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Great lecturer, made the material really interesting and relevant.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy brings a lot of energy into the classroom. I also like how she doesn't use Power Point but rather \"gets her hands dirty\" in the old traditional chalk and whiteboard approach. She has many years of managerial experience under her belt and she deploys this in the classroom to drive student learning.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Dr Bradley was great in leading discussion and providing feedback. I wish that she focused more on healthcare-specific management issues and strategies.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Strengths: Betsy is one of the nicest professors I know. She is extremely approachable, and I am happy that she brings in a global perspective to the healthcare management program."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended. I like it mostly for its very practical hands on learning approach and the fact that I will be using everything I learned from this class in my new job.",
    "I would overall recommend the course as an opportunity to practice skills in problem solving and group presentations.",
    "would like to see more talk about health tech and innovation",
    "Good class - would have preferred it to have been more of a capstone class for HCM rather than a general leadership course open to all.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. It is one of the best courses offered at School of Public Health.",
    "I was disappointed by this course because it could have been so much more. Professor Bradley is incredibly wise and has so much experience and advice to impart; I wish she could have imparted more. This capstone course was supposed to be the course that tests the skills we should have gained as future healthcare managers. I am not sure I am prepared for my future role as of yet.",
    "The way to write a strategy brief and how to present were the two things I learned.",
    "A good insight into general leadership, I sometimes thought there was a lack of tying the content to healthcare specific issues. The deliverables were healthcare related but really challenging and sometimes felt like we were set up to fail",
    "Definitely recommend taking any course with Betsy! so fortunate I got a chance during my time at yale to take this course!",
    "Interesting seminar about leadership and management in healthcare.",
    "Seems to be a lot of overlap with other leadership courses. Heavy emphasis on working in groups.",
    "This course will not exist in this format again, so that question is not relevant.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student seeking to learn how to manage health care organizations from a strategic perspective. Summary: MHCO lays the land of strategic management of health care organizations by walking students through a time-honored problem-solving methodology. It also guides students on the science of solution development and leadership",
    "This course gets into interesting leadership theory and the group projects are rewarding. However, there is less substantive discussion and current health care cases.",
    "It's a good leadership course, but it should be an introductory course instead of a capstone."
