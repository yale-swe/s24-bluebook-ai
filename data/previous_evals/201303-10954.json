    "This class is definitely recommended. It's been the best writing class I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "I would recommend this classto any student, but there is a caveat. You should have an avid interest in public health and medicine. That's not to say you need an extensive knowledge of science, but that this class will help you a lot more if you foresee yourself writing about such subjects in the future. You simply won't feel motivated to write about public health and medicine if you're not interested. ENGL 121 classes are aimed towards specific subject matter.",
    "More than just a research paper class-you learn to communicate some highly technical topics to a more general audience. I would recommend the class to students who aren't afraid of not having a structured syllabus, because I learned a lot. I think I've become more articulate in my writing.",
    "This was the first time the course was offered. It seemed less organized than other courses, but that was to be expected. However, Professor Shufro was wonderful. She brought in really great guest speakers, and I loved the assignments. The courseload wasn't overbearing, and this was my favorite class to go to all semester.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it if you're interested in science or medical journalism."
