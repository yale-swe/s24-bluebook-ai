   "comments": [
    "Personally, only if you really like French. Its just a ton of work. If you want to gain near fluency, though, take it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Your reading will really improve. A lot of work but manageable.",
    "Be prepared to dedicate the time to it each night but its certainly manageable. The books and movies are enjoyable. I feel like my writing and grammar improved but my speaking did not. Overall a good class.",
    "So first off, those things you've heard about French at Yale...they're true. It's one of the hardest and best departments. Don't expect an A. But definitely take French!Stop taking your classes for a grade.French is a big adjustment particularly for those whose high school classes spoke English and weren't just entirely conducted in French. However, you will get so much better so fast! Expect to not understand more than 3 words per class for awhile. It will kill your self-esteem and you may cry after the first test grades are released but it's such a good class, really. Classes are so small and you get to know everyone and your teacher gets to know you really well. I had Koundi and I was so scared of her for about half of the semester and then by the end I just realized she was being harsh because she wanted us to really learn the language and my French has improved by a landslide and I owe it all to her. Get a tutor during the first week if you have even the slightest bit of trouble. Tutors are awesome and you can meet with them as little as you like (I met mine right before every test for about an hour) and just go over any questions you have or have them review with you. It's super great. You will be reading three little novels in L3 and watching a few movies that have English subtitles. Grades will be the average of 4 out of 5 tests and then some participation and like 30% final. Take it if you like French. It's fun. It kills you a little, but it's really fun too and I highly recommend this class, especially with Koundi.",
    "If you like French, all you. If you just need the requirement, just be prepared to spend a solid 45 minutes every night - and the homework really is important for understanding the test questions",
    "There is a huge amount of work for this course but you do learn a lot of french. They ask a lot of you but if you put in work, it's not too bad. All the reading material is pretty interesting."
