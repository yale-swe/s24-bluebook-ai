    "Human Neuroscience has been my favorite course at Yale so far. It is extremely interesting and I have learned so much through the class. It is an excellent point of entry for anyone interested in neuroscience. I HIGHLY recommend it. Professor McCarthy is excellent! He is the most knowledgable and experienced professor I have ever encountered. He is an interesting lecturer and puts a lot of work into preparing each class. He is also very approachable and very willing to help students.",
    "I took psych 160 because I needed an Sc credit and also for the psych major. Warning: This is NOT an easy course!! It requires an insane amount of time and memorization. Only take if you are 100% committed to working very hard.",
    "Psych 160 is a fascinating but challenging class. If you put the work into studying though, it's incredibly rewarding and you will learn a ton. The professor knows so much and the material is fascinating. The tests are definitely challenging, but also fair and the review sessions are extremely helpful.",
    "This is a really interesting course that talks about the parts of the brain that are involved in many psychological disorders. If you think you might be interested in neuroscience but are more interested in the social aspects of neurological disorders, this is a great course. Beware that the tests are difficult and require a lot of studying.",
    "This is a solid class, but it isn't necessary for psyc majors that do not want to follow the neuroscience track. It's definitely quite interesting at times, though the lectures can sometimes drag on. Definitely take it if you can. It's not too much work beyond the tests.",
    "The only work besides midterms are a couple of reading responses, which are easy to do because the material is very interesting. Definitely take this class!",
    "This class gives the basis for further, more advanced neurosci classes. You learn the brain in detail and go into brain imaging techniques as well as brain deficits. If you're interested in the brain, take the class. If not, don't bother.",
    "Yes. I thought it was a really solid introductory course, and although there's a lot of information presented, I thought it was all really interesting, and interesting enough that I feel like the material I learned will stick with me for a long time. The exams can be hard just because they cover so much stuff, but definitely doable, and definitely fair.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and feel like I have a good foundation for future study. Professor McCarthy is enthusiastic, well organized, and a great lecturer. You cover a lot of material but it's manageable as long as you don't procrastinate too heavily. I would recommend spending a few hours early on getting down the basic anatomy so that when it comes up for the rest of the semester you will understand what's going on.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material is really interesting, cutting-edge, and you're getting it from one of the leaders in the field (almost half the studies he presents are his own -- and not out of hubris; it's just because he's that big in the field.) The lecture material is difficult, and Prof. McCarthy lectures very quickly. But between the textbook and office hours, it was very manageable. The workload isn't bad, either.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I thought it was interesting and well taught. Just have to keep up with the material and take good notes in order to do well.",
    "YES TAKE IT. Neuroscience is FASCINATING, and Professor McCarthy is great. It is not part of my major and I still enjoyed it immensely and was able to do well. Make sure you pay attention in lecture and take good notes-- this is where the test is drawn from.",
    "Take it if you're genuinely interested in Neuroscience, but if you're not, don't bother.",
    "If you have any interest in neuroscience or in areas of cognition, I'd definitely take this class. Professor McCarthy presents some really interesting information related to things like memory, emotion, and attention. Just be sure to pay extremely close attention during lectures. The midterms and final all come straight from the lectures, in which he explicitly lays out what you have to know. So there are no surprises or curveballs. The workload is really light, and you get to read some interesting current papers related to the course content.",
    "It is definitely a course worth taking if you have an interest not only in psychology, but in the structure and function of the brain. I really enjoyed the class, but I am also very interested in the subject. Since it does definitely require a lot of studying and reading, I would advise against taking it unless you truly are interested in the material and\/or are majoring in psychology.",
    "Lectures can be a little dry, but the material is very interesting. Be careful with the exams, they creep up on you and there is a lot of material (expect 70 slides per lecture at least).",
    "this class is not an easy lecture. a lot of material is presented during lecture and you are responsible for most. lecture isn't that fun either, but if you are interested, this is a good class. there is a lot of information that is covered.",
    "This class was a LOT of work around midterms\/finals - there is an intense amount of content covered in the course - but also extremely interesting. I never missed a lecture. Professor McCarthy is fantastic, and the course material is fascinating. If you're interested and willing to put in the time, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Psych 160 is a great very interesting course. It is veer challenging, but if you study hard it is definitely manageable. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in the brain.",
    "Human Neuroscience was a good class if you're interested in the material. I liked how the material built on each other. Understanding such a complicated entity like the brain can be intimidating, but the organization of the class made it seem doable. The technical material also was much more interesting and relatable through the lens of psychology and disorders. I'm really glad I took it, as the basic neuro knowledge that I've gained is enough to understand a lot in papers that I may read for later classes.",
    "Definitely take it. Very interesting material and McCarthy is an engaging lecturer. Exams are not a joke, but as long as you study what was taught in class you will be fine. Make sure you go to class -- powerpoint slides are posted online but are useless without class notes!",
    "Take it if you plan on majoring in the Neuroscience track, and are very interested in the human part of neuroscience and want to focus research in this field later. However, if you want a more holistic approach \/straightforward lecture-to-test examination, take 160.",
    "Take it, since it's really interesting and you will learn so much, without really realize you are learning. There's lots of info, but it's somehow presented in a way which is super conducive to learning. Not overwhelming at all, but make sure to really study the lecture slides and go to class.",
    "This was a great neuro class if you are interested in learning about the brain and especially mapping the brain out. I would absolutely recommend it, but warn students not to get too overwhelmed by all the information you need to know for the exam.",
    "An overview of human neuroscience, covering many different topics like memory, attention, motor control, etc. It's very interesting and overall a very good class. If you learn your brain regions and review the slides you'll be fine for exams.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. You leave the class with a thorough understanding of the functional organization of the brain. Prof McCarthy is an approachable and thorough lecturer. The tests are thorough and fair.",
    "Maybe I've come to realize I'm actually not much of a memorizer, but the 2 midterms with its structure of short responses with an emphasis on keywords definitely left me on the wrong end of the curve. It was very easy to lose points even if your answers were paraphrases that were pretty close to the answer key. Great lecturer, very knowledgeable in his field and always takes time to answer any of your queries. I especially liked how he would bring in new research ventures and tell how 20 years down the road what we have learnt might be entirely wrong. It definitely gives a lot of depth to what is supposed to be an intro class. Reading responses are graded pretty leniently so no need to fret over them."
