    "If you have to take it, take it. Not a great language class though.",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably have no choice.",
    "Professor Safille was a great professor that always made us feel that the classroom was a safe environment to practice the Spanish language and that it was okay to make mistakes. She understood that it is a learning process and encouraged us to take risks. She was always energetic and theatrical and wanted us to contribute in discussions. Ultimately, she wanted to see students making an effort to learn and displaying signs of progress. Solid course. You learn a lot. Very helpful.",
    "Safille is a pretty good professor to have for this class. You have to study for tests but they're definitely manageable, and you'll become more comfortable speaking in class.",
    "In spanish 120, you focus mostly in cementing your knowledge of the preterite and imperfect past tenses, then spend the of your time learning the different uses of the subjunctive mood. All this is done through the lens of different aspects of spanish-speaking culture, portrayed in the textbookI would recommend this course - I felt that my spanish skills improved dramatically, specifically in my spoken use of different tenses and moods.",
    "Standard level 2 Spanish class at Yale. If you can, take it with Professor Saffille. I can't speak for the other professors, but she's fantastic.",
    "It is a good course, but the daily activities revolve too much around rote book exercises."
