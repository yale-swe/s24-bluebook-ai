    "This course helped me develop insights into the challenges that multinational companies face while entering developing countries with poor institutions. It exposed me to some of the legislation that firms are subject to as well as current debates in CSR.",
    "Knowledge about the ethical dilemmas involved when considering multinational corporations. Also about initiatives taken by different groups to tackle and address some of these dilemmas.",
    "Knowledge about how businesses navigate questions about ethics in their various operations! I learned a lot about how the business world works (and the many different areas in which businesses are culpable for unethical behavior)",
    "Understanding problems large corporations face when dealing with different countries' laws, cultures, and business environments.",
    "I learned about the ethical problems surrounding businesses."

   "comments": [
    "I liked how each of us got to pick a firm for the semester- it really stimulated discussion and added structure to the seminar. The readings were very interesting.",
    "Strengths of the class was that the professor was really sweet and knowledgeable, she also responded to comments made in class with reasonable criticisms. Weaknesses that since there was generally a lack of accountability on class participation and the system was more of calling specific people, it felt sometimes that people were talking through each other and not constructing together.",
    "Strengths: very interesting and pertinent content in today's day and age. Weaknesses: many times during seminar, my classmates were not very engaged in the discussion.",
    "More case studies would be fun. Letting the students do the readings, learn about the issues, then trying to solve a problem in small groups. This class would benefit from that, rather than talking about individual companies or the readings.",
    "Professor Rose-Ackerman is very knowledgeble on this field, and gives interesting discussion questions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, very highly.",
    "It's a good EPE rationality core class. Professor Ackerman is sharp, knowledgeable and keeps the class engaged. The final paper can get to be a lot though so start early.",
    "Yes I learned a lot, especially concerning the ethical dilemmas that govern the business world.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend! However, I wish discussions delved deeper sometimes, rather than Professor Rose-Ackerman having to jump around and pretty quickly move between various facets of the topic (granted, I think this was because many times my classmates weren't very willing to contribute to the discussion). I also wish we'd spent more time discussing solutions to the many issues we'd discussed",
    "There are definitely better classes to take, but if you're interested in this kind of thing, it's fine. Not a lot of work. Sometimes great discussions in class (healthcare\/ big pharm) and sometimes it is not.",
    "I think understanding ethical issues is critical for Yale students who mostly choose to work at big corporations."
