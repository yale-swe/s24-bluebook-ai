    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Despite your religious beliefs of lack of beliefs, this class will introduce you to arguments you likely have not considered and will help you make or solidify beliefs of your own. If you already have solid beliefs, this class will force you to consider the opinions of others and develop skills that will serve you well throughout college and life.",
    "An OK course. Quite heavy work load and requires a bit of memorization.",
    "Excellent lectures, but quite a bit of reading, and it can be a little intimidating if it's your first philosophy class. I would recommend taking the course Credit\/D\/Fail so that you can absorb the interesting information in Prof. Hare's lectures without worrying about having to study small details for the quizzes.",
    "A broad survey of various philosophical approaches to religious topics such as the existence of a higher power, the afterlife, miracles, morality, etc. It is fascinating, and you will learn a lot.",
    "Big lecture class. Probably around 200 students. John Hare speaks very slowly but clearly. He has a healthy sense of humor. He gives his own opinion. I liked him a lot.The class covers interesting topics. We cover the arguments for the existence of God (like teleological, ontological, and cosmological), the interaction between faith and science, miracles, the afterlife, religious pluralism (e.g., why there are multiple religions and whether they all seek the same truth), evolution, and creation of the universe.The work load is very manageable - two papers, a weekly 50-minute section, four quizzes (of which your lowest grade is dropped), and a final exam (which I haven't taken yet). The four quizzes are in the format \"Answer 5 of the following 8 questions,\" where the questions are based off reading questions provided at the beginning of the semester. As long as you do the readings, go to class, go to section, and study a bit before quizzes, they are very reasonable. Even if you cram, like I did, you will still do pretty well on them (20\/25).You really need to do the reading and think it over thoroughly before going to sections. Otherwise, you will probably have little to say.Do not expect any answers in this course. It is a philosophy course. It will make you better informed on all the different perspectives on many different issues.Justin Khoo was my TA. He is this cool dude who lookslike a philosophy major: he is very thin and lanky, has dark-rimmed classes, has hair that hangs over his forehead, has lots of unshaven facial hair that looks pretty good on him, and wears these long-sleeve nondescript sweaters. He also speaks in a philosophical tone.He is pretty legit. He is definitely an analytic philosopher. He approaches every article we read with a very analytical mindset and blocks out arguments very clearly:(E1) ...(E2) ...(E3) ...etc.He prepares very good handouts for the sections. He gave good comments on my first paper and graded reasonably. I haven't gotten my second paper back yet.",
    "Take this course",
    "recommend- can be a dense work load- great ideas",
    "Take it, absolutely, especially if John Hare is teaching. He is a wonderful human being and a joy as a lecturer. You probably won't come out of this class with any change in your beliefs, but you will have a better idea of why you cling to the beliefs you do hold. Best class I took this semester.",
    "This class is great for anyone, regardless of your position on the religious belief spectrum. The course takes a look at all the major arguments for and against the existence of God, without attempting to establish a \"winner\". I would suggest this course for anyone interested in philosophy or theology.",
    "Take it if you're interested in it. Probably a good introduction to Philosophy if you've never taken a class before. You get to ask and think about religion in interesting ways. It was hard to make myself do the readings since we didn't really have to and they were mostly annoying excerpts from a textbook instead of whole works. Too many readings to satisfyingly delve into any one. We covered interesting topics and it wasn't that hard but I would have liked a more careful approach. You get what you pay for: a survey of the philosophy of religion.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in religion. I'm religious (non-Christian) and I found that the course challenged me to approach religion in a new way. The workload isn't that much (four quizzes, two short papers), although some of the reading is difficult.",
    "This class is a great survey course but you are getting is a survey course. Complex readings are reduced down to three sentence sound bites and essays don't provide that much space for free thought. If you do the readings it can be great but overall it was too watered down for my liking.",
    "This class is not about just about the problem of evil but a range of issues. Many people think it was the best class they took at Yale. Although generally good and interesting I would not go that far. Professor Hare is great professor and person but you shouldn't only base it on him.",
    "Its interesting, but deceptively difficult in grading. Test it credit D and see how the quizzes and first paper go.",
    "Philosophy of Religion is one the best courses at Yale and is an essential course in the traditional sense of the university. Looking at the major ideas of religion and philosophy is way better use of anyone's time than the more specialized courses. The class looks at a varied set of traditions and time periods within nine of the most important fields of philosophy of religion to examine the history of the arguments in each topic. And Hare is an amazing lecturer!!",
    "Great class, whether you're wanting a nice class to introduce you to Philosophy or whether you're wanting to work out some issues you have with your religion\/faith--or even if you're just wanting to be able to respond when people present you with arguments against yourfaith. There's a *lot* of reading, but Hare often reviews all of the readings in lecture, so if you can't read it all a few times, you'll survive. Also, if you understand the basic ideas of the readings and know what they're talking about, you should do fine on the quizzes, so don't let them scare you. I had a little bit of trouble with the papers, but I think that's because I was just learning to write philosophically.",
    "This course dazzled in the amount of learning taking place. After the course, you'll realize that you just went through most of the main arguments for\/against the existence of a God, and considered an enormous amount of objections to both sides.The problem with that is that with so much information a general picture is a little hard to hold. It pays to review the info a little over the summer, if you want to retain it.The course ends up, from what I hear and know personally, not radically changing your views but rather pushing you farther towards the extreme in whatever direction you were already in (atheist vs. theist). It essentially provides you with more proof\/evidence for your own conclusion. Try to take this with a grain of salt. Truly try to think objectively.Grading isn't too tough at all. With only some work, you should get around a B. So don't worry, take it to learn.",
    "Amazing. Incredibly thought-provoking. Take it.",
    "This basically runs through all the areas of contention between Christianity and atheism. Some of the arguments are technicalities, some of them are overly complicated and confusing. A lot of the arguments aren't terribly convincing but you'll find that you're more sympathetic to most of them. In short, it's typical philosophy applied to religion.I would definitely recommend taking this course, but Credit\/D it.",
    "Fair and broad survey of the subject. Rewarding and interesting. Highly recommended.",
    "Philosophy of Religion is an inherently fascinating subject, and the class remains interesting until the very end. I would recommend it to anyone considering it. It's also a fairly easy class if you've taken philosophy before. Yet this doesn't mean it won't be frustrating at times, especially when you're dealing with a subject on which various people have such strongly held as well as vastly opposing views on what are very personal and important questions. Hare doesn't force any one viewpoint on anybody; but he does have a clear agenda. Don't take the class thinking that it will be a completely impartial exposure to all different opposing perspectives. In some senses, Hare is a classic Christian apologist attempting to show that religious belief is rational and consistent with modern values of logical reasoning. He spends little time on, and puts little store by, the views (both of which I personally find interesting and valid) that religious belies is by nature an unjustifiable violation of rational intellectual obligation, or that faith is not and should not be judged bystandards of rationality at all because it is something altogether different and in some ways more wonderful. Hare strongly believes both that religious belief should be rational and can be.",
    "Good class. Konw that it's definitely philosophy, not just \"let's talk about religion\", and very western-focused. If you like philosophy or theology, though, John Hare is not one too miss. Not too much work (2 papers and a final, 4 quizzes), and you feel well versed in typical arguments related to religion.",
    "This course is excellent. It was especially great for me, a person who had been very interested in the philosophy of religion before taking a course but never had the time to read anything about it on my own. We learned the basic arguments for and against religion and the existence of God. For a person either with or without faith, the things we learned would be extremely valuable.",
    "Yes, though I wouldn't recommend you take it Credit D",
    "I had high expectations for this class, but it definitely didn't live up to them. The material seems really fascinating during reading period, but Professor Hare's lectures were consistently underwhelming and not clearly presented, and most of the readings are very dense - not just because they're philosophy, either...I like philosophy classes, generally. The only highlight was talking about the material in section, but that definitely isn't a reason to take the course. Interesting topic, but not a good class.",
    "I'd recommend it if you plan on taking it Credit\/D. Otherwise, it's not worth it. The readings are interesting, but you don't want to have to be obligated to do all of them and remember everything. I felt bad for those who took it for a grade.",
    "This class should have been great, but (for the most part) it was terrible. For a significant number of the lectures, it was unclear how the material related to religion at all. Professor Hare routinely got bogged down in specifics and totally lost track of the bigger philosophical questions. His lectures are painfully slow and dry, and I am inclined to think that it is his fault that the class is terrible. Every time we had a guest lecturer, the class was far more enjoyable. If someone other than Hare teaches the class next year, consider taking it. If not, stay away.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT. (But make sure you get a good TA.)",
    "This class takes a look at many important and fascinating philosophical questions about religion. The lectures are great, the readings are interesting and the topics are great to think about. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Take this class. John Hare is the best lecturer I've had during my four years at Yale.",
    "Excellent course. Challenging philosophical readings. Fascinating religious issues. Highlights of the course included the arguments about whether or not God exists, about whether or not one is justified in believing that others are wrong for holding different religious beliefs, about whether an afterlife exists, about whether miracles exist, about the relationship between morality and religion, about the relationship between science and religion, etc. Very rewarding.",
    "Great class. Take it if you can!",
    "I absolutely, wholeheartedly recommend this class. If religion interests you at all, you should take this class. It is fascinating from start to finish.",
    "Phil 326 is solid introduction to a very large topic. Take this course if you want to take a course that introduces you to philosophy as a discipline AND you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "A deluge of Christian apologist materials. Alternatives (of a truly varied nature) are basically lacking. If you are not a Christian, this class will piss you off.",
    "Great class, an ideal Yale class. You learn a lot and it's not too stressful. I think it was a great first Philosophy class to take as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It makes you question your own beliefs about religion in the context of learning how to critically assess philosophy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The material is great to think about for anyone, and Hare is a wonderful teacher. It really opens one up to novel viewpoints on a topic which is extremely important.",
    "It's an easy class. If you take it credit\/D it's a breeze and even for a letter grade it is fine.I would suggest attending every class ready to pay attention and take notes because if you do, the textbook is superfluous and you can save yourself both the money and the time spent reading the arguments.",
    "Good course, but not great. Could be great, but make sure your TA is chill, and don't expect it to change your life. And the work load is surprisingly annoying.",
    "You learn about arguments for God, counter arguments, and whether or not we should believe in miracles, etc.",
    "Yes!",
    "These are questions everyone should ask of themselves.",
    "Philosophy of Religion is honestly one of the worst courses I've taken in my four years at Yale. The class sounds so great, but it fails so hard. Prof. Hare's lectures meander without structure, and he fails to give appropriate analysis or critique of arguments. Oftentimes, he merely says that he disagrees with atheistic arguments without adequate justification, or provides wimpy, lackluster criticisms that fail to address the brunt of the arguments. I felt snookered that he would never delve into an argument in detail or construct a full critique. When I did attend lecture, I got viscerally angry at his teaching, and I always felt dumber afterwards than before. If you like yourself and you like philosophy, do yourself a favor and stay away from this course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in Philosophy. bUT NOT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN LIFE QUESTIONS. More about the former than the latter.",
    "Good class, but not the perfect class that I had heard of.",
    "A great class for asking tough questions.",
    "Philosophy of Religion is a very solid lecture course. I naturally think a lot about the sort of topics covered in the class, so I did not find the course \"revolutionary\" in terms of my thinking, but it did offer me a wonderful opportunity to really get clear on what I thought -- which in itself is very meaningful and the sort of thing that can subtly but importantly change how you look at things. Professor Hare is great -- he's wonderful to talk to because, while he has strongly held beliefs (he's a Christian), he is not dogmatic about them, and, in talking with him, I always felt like he was really responding to my questions and comments honestly. His lectures tend to be a review of the readings, so, while they were always enjoyable, I do wish he had spent a bit more time taking the discussion further than just juxtaposing different authors. I also had a wonderful section (my TA was Neil Arner).",
    "Perfect course for Cred\/D\/Fail especially if you know little about religion. You will learn a lot and not have to kill yourself studying the small details.",
    "Hard readings, profound questions. I would only recommend it if you're really into philosophy or used to it. not a good intro course.",
    "Definitely. Definitely.",
    "This is the best class I've ever taken, without a moment's hesitation. Absolutely take this class, even if you have no interest (or you think you have no interest) in philosophy or religion. The subject material is unlike any other class; it makes you think and stay up late at night, pondering. Professor Hare is awesome beyond words; brilliance just emanates out of every word from this man. He teaches difficult philosophies in easy-to-follow lectures, and offers his own humble, incredibly wise arguments and counter-arguments. Take this class before you graduate. It is amazing.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in religion at all.",
    "John Hare is brilliant and wonderful. It is good for anyone to spend time under his instruction! That being said, you're reading 5-6 short pieces of (mostly) *analytic* philosophy every week. Things can feel choppy. I didn't realize how heavily analytic the course would be going in, and this would have influenced my decision to take it.",
    "If you have any interest in religion at all, take this course. Period.",
    "I liked it a lot. The reading can be convoluted, so use it in conjunction with lecture and with section. No real answers to be found, but better and more intelligent ways of stating the questions. John Hare is a nice guy with an odd but amusing style, so if you're Ok with that, go for it.",
    "Only if you are the philosophy type: if you just think religion is interesting I would suggest something else",
    "A very interesting class, even if you don't have a philosophical or theological background. Might recommend it for Cred\/D.",
    "A solid survey of multiple perspectives of multiple debates in Religious Philosophy. The breadth comes, of course, at the expense of depth. John Hare is a very good lecturer.I recommend it if you haven't been exposed to many of the formal arguments for and against God, miracles, and pluralism. If you have, you probably won't get very much new information.",
    "Really interesting class. Thought-provoking readings, not a super-heavy reading load. Both sides of arguments often presented in readings and then given equal weight in lectures, which makes figuring out a concrete stance\/reaching a conclusion on things tough. But the class gives you a good starting point to figure that stuff out.Quizzes aren't too bad. Papers a little tough, but hey, it's philosophy.",
    "It was a fun way to discuss various aspects of religion but be prepared it sticks largely to Christianity.",
    "This is a fascinating survey course in philosophy, focusing on christian theism. John Hare is a captivating lecturer and, while some readings are dense, Hare and the TFs do a good job explaining them."
