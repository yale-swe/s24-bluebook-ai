    "This class is interesting and the work load is very low. You won't really learn much though. It is the end of the semester and I can't really tell you what we covered. However, lectures are entertaining and you will learn a bit about how archaeology works. Most of the people in the class are archaeology majors or graduate students, but the class is not difficult even if you don't have any background in archaeology.",
    "Dont do it. Waste of valuable procrastination time.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. I would caution them though, because it's more of a graduate course than an undergraduate course. The only two grades are two papers, and if you haven't ever written an archaeology paper before it's a bit daunting. But if archaeology is what you love, then this course is really rewarding.",
    "You will learn loads about an truly remarkable expanse of time, and McIntosh carefully covers many theory and practice evolutions and controversies as well as the actually progression of human occupation.",
    "A great survey of African archaeology to-date, with an awareness that the field is quickly evolving and that there is a tremendous amount still to be unearthed and understood about the past of this vast continent."
