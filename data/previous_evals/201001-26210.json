But I also think the hours\/wk would depend on how early the groups started working on the project and how easy the topics chosen were.",

    "Excellent teacher, excellent course",
    "The course was actually quite valuable, particularly for students who plan to work in clinical trials. The course involves a semester long group project where you to design a clinical trial and write a 10 page proposal. It is a very good learning experience. Another strength is the presentations at the end of the semester. Three experts come in and discuss your proposal. If you work or want to work on trials in the future, then you really shouldn't leave the program without taking this course.This being said, I do have a few suggestions. First, I don't think the instructor should designate one person the \"PI\". While this is how it works in real life, there are several problems with using this approach in the classroom setting. Specifically, it gives one person too much authority over the progress of the group, so if he\/she is not totally committed to the class it makes the group process overly stressful. In addition, it results in most of the group members having no say what the topic for the project is, because this is chosen by the PI and everyone else is assigned to a group. My second suggestion is to make the grading a little more objective. There were not that many homework assignments, and class participation was 25% of the grade. However, this was a lecture based course, so I'm not sure what this 25% was based on.",
    "I think the strengths of this class are not apparent until it is over. I think many of us complained about the group project because it was so time-consuming and we were placed into groups and didn't have a choice. I would advise that in the future, you can allow non-doctors to be the PI of the group projects. I think a lot of us (especially epidemiologists) felt that we would be capable of being the PI. Conversely, some of the doctors who were put in that leadership position felt that they did not have time and were not invested the project, which ultimately was a negative influence on the group dynamic. I also suggest letting people choose what group they want to be in because some of us had expertise that would've benefited other group's projects.",
    "(+) Good opportunity to have almost a real experience of carrying out a clinical trials as a group",
    "I really enjoyed the \"real world\" experience of creating our own clinical trial. I learned a lot through this process and would definitely recommend that this always be the class project.",
    "This class is attractive because we are exposed to real world practice. The final project is a great assignment in that we learn how to incorporate knowledge we learned into writing, and how to collaborate with other persons. One thing I would suggest to improve is: it's good to appoint a MD student as PI, but not necessary to have him\/her decide which trial the group should design. Other group members should be able to contribute ideas then let group make decision.",
    "Group projects were quite large, maybe make them smaller, and it would be more interesting. Also because the clinician picked the project, it was their interest, and not really one of mine.",
    "Strengths: very good simulation of how multicenter clinical trials are evaluatedWeaknesses: sometimes material was a little dry and statistics hard to follow without concrete examples",
    "Project was a valuable learning experience. Perhaps we could have had more feedback along the way. Also, it might be worth while to go over how to write a good hypothesis and objective since that is the starting point for the whole project.",
    "The biggest problem with this course was that it was too random in project design. Since so much of the course is dependent on the group project, grades were determined primarily by which group you were randomly assigned and who the PI would be. A poor PI pretty much meant that the entire group suffered regardless of how well they worked. Some more guidance by the instructors to look out for these kinds of dynamics and make sure that the project is going in the right direction would help.",
    "It was overall a good course. The instructur, Dr. Peduzzi, was good and understood what real clinical research was like. His experience showed and his own stories about the difficulties and challenges of clinical research was insightful. Maria was great and very knowledgeable."

    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr. Peduzzi has a great deal of experience working on clinical trials, and effectively incorporates these real life experiences into his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr. Peduzzi is a great speaker and is entertaining. I found his description of the challenges that he faces in real-life while designing clinical trials to be very valuable. I would suggest having classes that are timed better so that lectures don't carry on to other weeks and so that it is very clear what we will accomplish every time. Also, it would be great if there was more of an opportunity for participation, especially since it seems to be part of the final grade.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0(+) Knows what he is talking about. Rather than talking about small stuff, he focused on teaching us the most important things in our future career",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr.Peduzzi is a great lecturer, if not a bit long-winded, but he knows a lot about different types of clinical trials from his experience at the VA.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr. Peduzzi was a great professor. His lectures were interesting and informative. He was always available to answer any questions or help in any way.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Prof. Peduzzi is great instructor. He was able to make some dry lectures be interesting and attractive. The idea of final project is wonderful. We appreciate the comments from reviewers and enjoy the challenge of presentation.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0He sometimes gets side tracked, but he explains everything very clearly and is good at teaching.",
    "Instructor: Peter Natale Peduzzi \u00a0Dr. Peduzzi was an excellent instructor that has shown that he is very competent in conducting multicenter clinical trials. I would have appreciated more quantitative assignments to reinforce what was learned in the classroom.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes, would certainly recommend it",
    "I would recommend the course primarily for students who plan to work on clinical trials and want the practical experience of doing so, as this course allows to design a trial. You will also get very good feedback on your proposal. In this sense, it is the perfect follow-up course to the Fundamentals class taught in the Fall.For people who do not plan to work on trials, it is probably not worth taking, although the group project still provides a good opportunity to work in a group. This is a valuable experience that is not specific to clinical trials",
    "I think that if you want a basic understanding of clinical trials, I would actually recommend Dr. Makuch's class on the fundamentals of clinical trials. I found that Dr. Makuch's class served as a good foundation for what I learned in this class. I know that Dr. Makuch's class is not required for this class, but I think it would've been helpful. Not only could we move on to really learning new topics (quite a bit of this class was a review of Makuch's class) but also everyone would have the same fundamental understanding of clinical trials. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to experience the difficulties of working in a big group of people with different backgrounds to come up with a final goal. It is very difficult in ways that are hard to even anticipate and some of these lessons that I learned will be very valuable for my real-life work experience in the future.",
    "Yes. Good opportunity to learn the real environment of clinical trials",
    "I think the best part of this class was the final project - each person is assigned randomly to a team - the team has a PI, biostats, epi, and people of other concentrations. To me, this was very similar to how the real world works, in terms of being on clinical teams and working on a protocol (if we were on a steering committee). That said, the project is really dependent on who your PI is (meaning, how many MDs you have in the class, and their interests) - since the PI thinks of a topic for the clinical trial.Some of the readings overlap with the other clinical trials class (but that was fine, since I ended up skimming those articles)- but I definitely feel like this class emphasized learning several trials very well (again, this might be because Dr. Peduzzi is a long lecturer, who normally spend 1.5 classes to finish a lecture).",
    "excellent course to get the sense of the clinical trial.",
    "This course offer you an opportunity to know how multiple center clinical trial is run in real world. No matter which division you come from, you will find something you will use in future if you have chance to work on clinical trial.",
    "The course is basically just one project, and it is a good lesson in group projects. However, 1st semester 1st year, you have a lot of experience in group projects, so that this class may be tiresome. There is quite a lot of overlap between this class and the clinical trials class in the fall.",
    "This course is applicable to any student who wants to know more about phase III clinical trials. The students in this year's class came from many diverse backgrounds which made the group project a more realistic experience.",
    "I would recommend this course because the project was a valuable experience, and the lectures were interesting.",
    "It's very difficult to judge the value of this course. The lectures contain a lot of information, but little incentive to keep up with them. The group projects provide some experience in designing a clinical trial, but the luck factor and the lack of guidance make them less than worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this course. You will get the most from this course by working on the final project early on and making use of the TA and Prof early."
