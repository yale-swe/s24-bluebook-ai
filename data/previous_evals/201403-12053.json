   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Biweekly homeworks, a midterm, a final and a final paper. We started with tensors, moved on to the fundamentals of solving engineering problems: kinetics, force, balance relations, constitutive equations (and how to formulate them), boundary conditions. The exams are always fair but you need to work hard.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in biomechanics or continuum mechanics. Humphrey is the best professor in the biomedical engineering department and you learn so much about tensors, stresses, stretches, etc. in this course, which are useful in understanding motion, displacement, deformation, and mechanics. If you decide to take the course, go to office hours because the later lectures build on the earlier lectures and you do not want to fall behind.",
    "This class is challenging but a great foundation. I really enjoyed it and definitely recommend it. Without lots of assignments, it's best to at least try to keep up with the material through the whole semester, not just when preparing for exams, so be sure to allot enough time for this course."
