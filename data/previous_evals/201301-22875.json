    "Good stuff. Pay attention to Mill, Tocqueville, Burke.",
    "This class is a great introduction to political thought. However, it focuses on political theory at the expense of actual history. I would recommend it to a student interested in Political Science or Philosophy, but not necessarily to someone looking for a dedicated history course.",
    "It's DS, so you know the deal. Second semester H& P is much more straight political philosophy than first semester, and there's a nicely unified train of thought and dialogue between the authors. Lebron was very friendly and led section very well - discussions were natural and free-roaming but always got where they needed to go, and his particular approach to the text makes sure to get right at the key argument (which I found super useful for DS). He also really seems to be legitimately interested in your ideas, which is a nice ego boost at 9 in the morning. Don't bother switching -- he's your guy for sure.",
    "This is the best course of the second semester of DS. The books build on each other and have a clear arc. Prof. Lebron was very knowledgeable and helped guide us through the books to give us a good understanding of what were sometimes complicated ideas. He went for quality over quantity, preferring to focus on the difficult sections of works in class and leaving off more self-explanatory sections. He was friendly and took an interest in his students. My only complaint is he could have put more time into the class -- we sometimes ended early, he canceled a few classes, and he didn't seem to devote much time to grading the papers (the comments were scarce). Overall, I highly recommend DS H&P and I recommend Prof. Lebron.",
    "I would recommend it. It was probably my least favorite of the three DS tracks, but valuable and interesting nonetheless."
