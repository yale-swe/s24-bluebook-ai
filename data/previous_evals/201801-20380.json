   "comments": [
    "Really gained a new way of viewing the world and design. This was the best class I took this semester, and one of the best at Yale. I'm not an art major, but enjoyed the challenge of creating things in a new way, and I can even see the skills I learned being applied to my other subjects like History and Psych.",
    "I learned how to observe and critique graphic design. I also learned how to organize information in a way that is clear. Through this class, I was able to develop my own sensibilities toward design and develop a more detail oriented approach to my work.",
    "The \"eye\" for viewing design critically.",
    "Thinking visually through composition and critique.",
    "Visual thinking; basic typography; information hierarchy; composition",
    "I learned about graphic design and all the things designers take into consideration when making a design, such as hierarchy of information.",
    "This class is a crash course in Graphic Design. Get prepared to go crazy over margins, column widths, the distance between too small squares, and all the frustrating tools in Indesign. You leave having a greater understanding of the visual elements that coalesce to make someone feel something upon interacting with visual media, and often the type of questions and critique that should be employed in response to a design even if you don't know exactly how to solve the problems you bring up."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It can be tough to make it through the 2 hours every class. Sometimes may have been nice to split up and half the class talks with Yeju and half with Nate, so we could talk more about each person's work. weakness: time management. Buy a clock for the room!!",
    "The strength with the course is that we spend a lot of time critiquing each other's work, getting better at design through discussing it. However, I do sometimes wish we could spend more time being exposed to professional graphic design in order to see how professionals have learned to express ideas and thus gain insight and inspiration from them. This could also be done through more readings in the course.",
    "Strengths: high engagement, fun, learning by trial method Weaknesses: slight bit of repetitiveness, lack of learning structure, would like some more organized \"teaching\" rather than leaving the learning up to our \"feeling\"",
    "Critique-based classes were good for learning how to look critically at artwork, but more project-based learning would have given students more hands-on graphic design experience.",
    "The projects we did were extremely interesting, though perhaps prioritizing some over others would help students be less stressed and learn more easily. I also think it would be beneficial to do a more thorough instruction of InDesign so students who don't already have experience with it can learn, given that it is an intro class and not everyone should be expected to know how to use it already.",
    "Each class period is entirely dedicated to critique, which is both informative and draining. All\/most of the work is done outside of class. It would have been nice to have more opportunities to work in class, where we could have gotten direct feedback in the process of working on assignments.",
    "I think that the endless critique of this class while really important in fostering a knowledge of the fundamental questions and concerns of graphic design could've been better maintained by keeping some sort of loose time schedule so people didn't often have to go the next week as frequently happened. I also know this is difficult but I think they're should have probably just been less people in the class and that would have improved the quality of class and the amount and depth of feedback. Having a big class was interesting though to see the great variety in the work. I also think sometimes the largeness of assignments and when they were assigned was not always considered well, as though the class met Tues\/Thurs large projects were sometimes assigned on Tuesday for Thursday instead of on Thursday for the following Tuesday. I also liked when we looked at known graphic designers in class and talked about the tools they employed and wish we did more of that. The book project at the end was also my favorite part of the course and I wish there had been a few more projects where the design was self-driven in that way which made the necessary labor feel more worth it."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Go in with an open mindset, recognizing that this class is different from most classes you've probably taken.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in graphic design. Otherwise, I think it may be a bit to technical and time-consuming for someone who only wants a cursory understanding of design.",
    "Would recommend for almost anyone, as gaining this \"eye\" for design is invaluable",
    "Yes - learning the basics of graphic design is important. Only take this class if you are serious about design and have the time\/motivation to put a lot of effort into projects.",
    "Yes. Being surrounded by design 24\/7, many people find it hard to realize that design is a product of many conscious choices made to influence the way the viewer thinks. I found this course very enlightening and applicable to the real world.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student with a serious warning. I learnt a lot in this class but I did not consider it an overall enjoyable experience. It took copious amounts of time, paper, and printing funds, and was very often mentally exhausting sometimes with little payoff. While the final project was more self-directed which helped with motivation, a lot of what we learned was about grappling with minute intricacies that can really be frustrating. This class is extremely challenging."
