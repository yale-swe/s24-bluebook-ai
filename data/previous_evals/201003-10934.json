    "Take it with Prof. Guinnane your first semester! Otherwise, you might have to take it third year, with quals, presentations, and TAing duties. Then it can get difficult.",

    "Got me more interested in international trade and made me appreciate econ more since I did not do that much applied work. I was also an undergrad math major, so this backgroundmaterial really helped.Another plus of this course is that though I don't intend to study history, the topics were cool and, in some sense, provided inspiration for the study of economics. It made me appreciate the growth, demand, and repeated games models when I saw them applied.",
    "I am now more aware of economic history as a field of study and the course gave me a broad idea about important facts and debates inEuropean economic history."
