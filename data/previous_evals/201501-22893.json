    "A challenging but not overwhelming course. TAKE IT WITH MIKI. She makes things 1000% more palatable for her organization and her teaching ability. I honestly was not expecting to enjoy this class, but thanks to her I found the material to be surprisingly interesting. Weekly psets are not bad, and the review sessions before exams help a lot (though again, I found Miki's to be much more helpful). Don't underestimate the exams--you can and will get run over if you're not prepared.",
    "This was a great course. I don;t know how well I did in it, but that was due to external factors more than a reflection of the course.",
    "The subject material isn't that interesting but Miki teaches it as well as it can be taught.",
    "I believe that MATH 120 gives a solid foundation for multi-variable calculus. It is a difficult course, so only take this course if you are willing to work hard.",
    "A challenging math class that is nevertheless approachable for all sorts of students; I found it extremely rewarding and liked math more at the end than at the beginning. You'll need to study, but it will be worth it. You absolutely should take it with Miki--unfortunately you'll be at a disadvantage unless you have her.",
    "I would recommend Math 120, especially if you get Miki. The material is difficult and challenging, but not impossible, as long as you keep up with office hours.",
    "Don't take it if you don't need to",
    "I would recommend taking Math 120 with Miki Havlickova; she does an excellent job of teaching the course and making sure that her students understand each concept.",
    "Pretty standard math class; not terribly difficult but not trivial either. Do the psets and make sure not to fall behind, and you will get a lot out of the class."
