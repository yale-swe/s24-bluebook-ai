If she missed a lecture and you had a question about that lecture, that was just too bad. I would like to see her make more of an effort to understandthe material so that she can explain it correctly to us. On the other hand, Stephanie was very generous with her time and willing to try to help as much as possible. She just did not encourage a deep or thorough understanding of the material."
