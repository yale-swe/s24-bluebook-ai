    "The course premise is awesome (don't bother reading the syllabus, it's about 2% accurate). But the course implementation left a lot to be desired. We started out with some verilog, then did assembly, then C and python to program the TI chronos watch. It sounds really cool, and it was when things worked. Unfortunately the professor was entirely unfamiliar with the watch and didn't bother to familiarize himself much before our assignments. The verilog lab was the only one that went smoothly. The others were just hours and hours of headaches because something that should have worked didn't. (code he told us to use was set up on the wrong frequency, making it impossible to ever successfully transmit anything, no matter how perfect our code, pyserial is complete garbage and decides to read strings of numbers that it isn't actually receiving, making it impossible to separate real data from the garbage, etc.)Hopefully the course will be more organized next year. If he decides to change from the watch to another piece of new hardware, leave during shopping period. it won't be worth it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless it changes or you have to take it. It simply does not cover enough material to be worth the semester long investment.",
    "The material and lectures were very interesting. I had initially believed that the class would focus on the logic gate level of digital systems, but when I took the course with Savvides it focused quite a bit on programming digital components, such as a TI Launchpad board in higher level languages. This is not necessarily a negative aspect of the course, but I was simply a bit anxious that my experience in this class did not match previous years' students.Towards the end of the course the labs (which were a major portion of the course workload) the labs required students to do much more independent work than what I was used to. While this was a valuable learning experience, it also seemed that a few of the labs were under-prepared.The final project was very fun, and it was satisfying to see all of the individual group's components come together at the end."
