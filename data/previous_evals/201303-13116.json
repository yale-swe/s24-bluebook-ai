    "It's required and useful to figure out rotations",
    "This course is an overview of the research of many MB&B faculty members in short presentations (5-10 mins). It is very helpful in determining potential rotation advisors and getting an idea of the variety or research opportunities available in MB&B. I would definitely recommend this to another student because it, along with the retreat, is the best and easiest way to learn about the research opportunities and faculty members in MB&B.",
    "Yes, it was a good way to see multiple professors in a quick and interesting format.",
    "Good for an introduction",
    "You listen to really quick talks about different labs. Its semi helpful sometimes.",
    "Yes",
    "Even if we have to enroll in it (and even if it's only mandatory in name - no attendance was kept, and I don't think it should have been anyway), it's not a bad idea to show up for the course.The investment of time is relatively small compared to the potential benefits of going."

    "Learned about a variety of research, met professors who might have interesting research that I would like to work on",
    "This course taught me the variety of research opportunities available and techniques used in MB&B. This course may have helped me identify the faculty member that I would like to work with in graduate school.",
    "It helped me find research that I am interested in.",
    "It let me test my ability to evaluate research critically and think of questions to ask in relatively tiny bursts of time. This was great fun, needless to say.And yeah - the talks that I had following up with some professors changed the way I look at biology - so that's a pretty good positive."
