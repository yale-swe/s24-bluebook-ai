   "comments": [
    "Strength: The instructor was able to build many connections between the required readings and other philosophical and anthropological works, which embedded the required readings into rich contexts. Aspects to improve: Her approach of teaching is of great value for those who are already fairly familiar with the authors and the works that are related to the required readings. This is reflected from her mentioning in passing many authors and their works without giving detailed explanation or introduction to them. This approach, however, is perhaps a little bit challenging for the students who are not that conversant with the backgrounds of the readings to be discussed in class. As one of such students, I often got lost in the connections that the instructors tried to draw between the designated readings and some other works that I had never read, however much effort I had put in understanding the assigned readings themselves before the class. Perhaps that has been my problem, but it would be more effective to the students like me if the instructor would concentrate more on the assigned readings and give more detailed introduction to other works that might be drawn on to make sense of the assigned readings.",
    "I would be curious to hear more from the instructor about the course readings. Not that we need a lecture, but perhaps a bit more structure would guide the conversation more carefully. In any case, it was a great class."
