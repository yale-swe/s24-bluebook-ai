    "I learned a lot of new film techniques, and it was very helpful to immerse myself in the world of film for a semester. I found the parts of the course about lighting techniques and color correction especially helpful.",
    "Story development, pre production, lighting, production, post production",
    "Andrews' course is well laid out to learn the skills or a writer\/director for film. I developed useful skill levels necessary for good timing in drama and editing among other things (introductions to color correction and sound editing).",
    "Professor Andrews' class helped me with both my writing skills and with my ability to translate that writing into reality."

   "comments": [
    "I think the best way to improve the course might be to have more smaller projects rather than one small project and one big one. The class really was a lot of fun, especially at the beginning of the semester, but it started to drag a little once we entered the workshopping and critique process for the final films, which went on for a really long time and wasn't as productive for all the students in the room as it could have been. I think if we had had the chance to put each round of feedback into the next film, we would have been able to grow a little more as filmmakers, and each new class would have felt more fresh and exciting.",
    "Andrews has developed a good course that focuses attention well on the necessary tasks to complete it. The demands of such a course are high. Finding a way to promote greater collaboration among students could be useful. Also, finding ways to navigate the different levels of experience within the class.",
    "Strengths: It's a small class and you get a lot of detailed feedback on your work. Weaknesses: I guess there was a lot less helpful feedback on crafting narratives and characters in our screenplays. While I thought the demos and tutorials on different software and equipment was helpful, I also was more interested in the screenwriting part of this course, which I felt was lacking. We kept workshopping people's work, but after a while it got boring and tiresome seeing the same scripts or rough cuts week after week. I wish we had had more time to create throughout the semester-- maybe like 2 or 3 short films. It culminated one final project that felt stressful and frustrating because it was essentially the only chance to practice the skills that we had been learning throughout the semester.",
    "The workshop format of the class was beneficial to my creative process, and Jon always made sure to give plenty of useful, considered, and pointed feedback. My classmates lent me so much energy and inspired so many good ideas. The only weakness is the difficulty of having to make films without getting any kind of priority when it comes to renting equipment."

    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would add that it can be pretty exhausting and even frustrating at times. But it's definitely a good way to improve as a filmmaker, especially if you treat each project less as a film you want to be proud of and more as a way for you to learn.",
    "Yes.",
    "I highly recommend the course, primarily I like the instructor. I found it increasingly better than the intro course, well suited to today's budding filmmakers.",

    "Anyone interested in writing and directing films, or narrative visual arts in general, should take this course."
