    "Yes i recommend it",
    "Great opportunity to get a grasp on a time and a body of literature so you leave feeling you have learned something and know how to further your own study of it. This particular subject is not otherwise available at Yale so I would encourage others to take it when available.",
    "A great course to take, especially for junior English majors. It will open up your area of interest and force you to connect more radical literary styles to those that you are more comfortable. It also has great coverage of 20th century history, which is usually forgotten about in an English class. This is a class that is not to be missed!",
    "I don't know if it would be as good an experience for someone who didn't already love the material, but I would recommend it anyway!",
    "This is a very good course. There is a ton of reading. It is hard to keep up with Ulysses, because it's so difficult and there's so many pages to read.",
    "A delightful course if you've an interest in modernism. Beware of Ulysses. That book takes up about half the semester and if you're not a fan of Joyce, it can be tiring. Professor Cleary is a wonderful professor--knows the material and governs discussion well, but sometimes conversation digresses more than a little.",
    "Irish Modernism& Empire was a very good class, ranging from W.B. Yeats' poetry (and more) to Samuell Beckett. We covered fascinating and excellent writers from poetry to literature to plays to Ulysses. Professor Cleary gave helpful, if long, introductions each class and encouraged animated class discussions. We each did a presentation and there was a midterm paper and a final paper. Some of the material was very difficult, especially Ulysses, and we didn't have enough time to really cover everything. It was a great opportunity to read the Irish modernist writers but not too much depth into any except Yeats. I liked reading the abundance of writers we did, especially less common ones now like Synge and Elizabeth Bowen, but we really did go through Ulysses far too fast. This was also a class full of English majors, which could be a bit overwhelming\/irritating for a non-English major.",
    "I really enjoyed this class- it allowed me to look at an area of literature that isn't studied in most English classes. That being said, it is a LOT of reading- we read Ulysses in just about 5 weeks, which is intense. Make sure you have the time to commit to this class, otherwise you will probably feel lost. You'll need to devote a lot of time if you want to get the most out of it. Professor Cleary is very accessible and understanding, and I'd definitely take a class with him if he visits again!",
    "If you are interested in Irish anything, take the course. There are very few course offerings for students interested in this area, so take advantage. If Professor Cleary is teaching it, you should most definitely fit it in to your schedule. He is an Irish scholar who has lived and worked within the country and has a strong understanding of the cultural and political movements that motivated twentieth century Irish literature.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. The syllabus is well crafted, I'm happy to have read everything on it. It's an experience to read Ulysses, and I'm glad that I did so with the guidance of a class and Professor Cleary. He is a wonderful professor. Seminar was a great balance between brief lectures from Professor Cleary and then discussion. Professor Cleary really knows these works and the surrounding criticism well, but was still tremendously open to our novice insights. He was an excellent sounding board for papers, and offered useful, exciting advice for each of my papers. He also gave very thorough comments on our midterm paper. I enjoyed it all. Take it!",
    "Absolutely take it if you think you might be interested. The class is a great mix of literature, history, and criticism. Plus it's really, really cool to be able to see some incredibly talented writers puzzling out what an Irish national literature might be and mean, and you get to read some fantastic stuff (the chance to read Ulysses in this kind of context was really special). Professor Cleary runs a great discussion, has an astonishing wealth of knowledge about every text, and is brilliant and very kind."
