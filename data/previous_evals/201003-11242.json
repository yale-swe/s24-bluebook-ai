    "I would recommend this course. It definitely makes you read a paper differently, and I can already see the difference in how I approach writing a manuscript. It surprised me how much time I needed to put into reading the papers, and how much more I probably needed in order to see everything the instructors wanted us to see!",
    "I believe we have to take the course no matter what. It is really good chance to know the strength and weakness of your fellow classmates as well.",
    "The skills I learned in this course will be invaluable for reading\/understanding papers in the future.",
    "This is a must-have class if one wants to learn how to effectively read and communicate science. I would recommend this class to another student because it is a very useful class in anyone's future research career."

    "See above; this course was very helpful in learning both how to structure a research project and how to present the results from it. A lot of the specific details from the papers will probably not be used in my future research, but I don't think that really matters here.",
    "It shows me the logical and discrete way of molecular biology research, which is crucial to start a research career."
