    "Yes. Best poet.",
    "The course is a thorough reading of Stevens's poetry. There is very little time spent on criticism and secondary sources, although we did discuss Stevens's essays now and then. If you're considering the class, you are probably interested in modern poetry and willing to spend some time reading some very difficult and abstract poetry, in which case you really should take the course. Stevens's poetry is odd and sometimes just annoying, but it is also beautiful and Prof. Bromwich seems to enjoy trying to make sense of it with his students.",
    "yes",
    "A tremendous survey of Wallace Stevens' work. A great addendum\/alternative to the view of modern poetry given in \"Major English Poets\" and \"Modern Poetry.\" Really beautiful, thoughtful poetry."
