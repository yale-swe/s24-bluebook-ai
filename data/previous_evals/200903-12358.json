   "comments": [
    "This is a pretty great class with an extremely interesting (and cutting edge) subject matter taught by someone who knows about this stuff better than perhaps anyone. The class is taught under a philosophy which emphasizes a knowledge ofthe material rather than huge amounts of work, which is how more professor should teach. One weakness is that since the class has to cover so much material (i.e., the most interesting developments in applied science in the past sixty years) is that it is sometimes difficult to figure out what to focus on for the tests.",
    "This class was a very enjoyable freshman seminar. The problem set workload was light, there were only two tests, and the material was interesting. Even if you don't have an interest in pursuing nanoscience, take this class. Professor Reed is a really important guy in his field, but he is relaxed in class. Also, there is a high grade distribution in the class.",
    "If you are at all interested in science and technology, take this course. The concepts are difficult to grasp at times, but be persistent and it will pay off. The material is interesting and relevant and it can really pay off in the future.",
    "If you can stick it out through the first few weeks of tough math and science, it's absolutely worth taking. You'll get a serious feel for what the future of technology holds, from the mouth of the man who is making it happen.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is challenging enough yet still fun and engaging.",
    "Definitely take it if you are a non-science major interested in learning about nanoscience. Don't take it if you're planning on doing real quantum physics at any point in your future, unless you need to decide whether you like nano.",
    "Can't imagine having missed out on this class"
