    "It would be nice to have a class trip to GE to put things into perspective. Overall, Great Class! ThanksKris.",
    "This class was supposed to be about management and leadership, but it was only about corporate hierarchy. I think that there are many more aspects to leadership and management that could have been covered but were not.",
    "This was one of my two \"most relevant to my future\"\/\"best use of my time\" courses this semester. I didn't necessarily expect that an evening 1 credit course in Management would be so useful to me, but the lecturer, Kris Morico, was that good.Not only did she share really valuable insights into how corporations work, especially GE, but she gave a lot of her views from being on the management side, things that you can only know from a decade (or more? Sorry Kris!) of experience. It was also useful for women studying the sciences to see an FES alum who has really succeeded in engineering, and in corporate industry, not academia. The course should have been publicized better though.This course, more than any other resource thus far at FES made me realize the value of an FES degree as well as the FES alumni connections. Thanks for offering it and arranging for an outside speaker to come in every week."

    "The readings are brief and very illustrative. They're definitively worth the time.",
    "Morico's real world experience, she was also very passionate and compelling. She told stories well and related them to our current goals well.",
    "I feel very honored to have had such close access to someone with an amazing breadth of leadership experience like Kris. She was absolutely the best part of the course, and her own perspective and life experiences proved to be invaluable educational tools.",
    "Kris Morico--she has a wide wealth of experience in industry, and it was so helpful to hear how she moved up the ladder to her current position. Also, the guest lecturer from human resources (and subsequent Q&A) was uniquely helpful. My notes from what she said Human Resources looks for will be pulled out in exactly one year when I am interviewing for a job!"

    "There is need for a real course in management at F&ES, and this course just skimmed over key terms and ideas, with very little depth on anything useful.",
    "Exploring other aspects of leadership and management applicable to students outside of EHandS.",
    "I think the class should be redesigned. It lacks the innovative green thinking that one would expect.",
    "Generic powerpoints provided a good foundation for the class, but were also a bit painful to sit through. I also think we should have spent a little more time discussing the reading material (which would force student to actually read them).",
    "I enjoyed the last exercise we did, in exploring the CSR and global sustainability activities companies were doing. It would be a great idea to build this into the curriculum \u0096 maybe in the future each student could give a 10-15 minute presentation on a company, and this could take place over the duration of the course. It would help expose the class to a breadth of companies and their management structures.",

    "I do not anticipate that I will ever be able to take a cross-listed class at SOM, so this class fills in the gap nicely by providing exposure to how management and leadership work in the private sector without requiring a full 3-credit commitment. It is important to have this option since all FES students need to be exposed to these issues but many may not ever have the opportunity to build it into their schedule other than a 1-credit course option.",
    "PSCs help MEMs and MEScs to gain professional skills that they wouldn't otherwise have access to in typical courses. (Ok, I take primarily science courses at FES, so for me, these PSCs are the best way to prepare for a future in a professional (ie, non-academic) setting)I enjoy PSCs because it is information I would not otherwise have access to."

PSCs are some of the best offerings at FES, both for MEMs and MEScs, I feel really lucky to have been able to take this course and learn from an industry leader. It was especially inspiring that she is an FES grad."

It is very hard, and I can only hope that I can someday perform as gracefully as they did in a workplace setting.",

    "Yes, learned about management, learned more from Kris's stories from the workplace--how to approach negotiations, how to deal with problems in the workplace professionally, with personnel conflicts, etc. I feel better prepared to interact in a professional job after this course, and jotted down a lot of notes in the margins of Kris's tips on how she solved a problem at work, stuff that wasn't in the slides, but that I thought was more valuable."
