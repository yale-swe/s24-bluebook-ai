    "I would recommend it -- great way to explore some of your family history and walk away with a piece of which you're (hopefully) proud.",
    "Learn about writing. Learn about your family. TAKE THIS.",
    "Touch the Living, Wake the Dead is a part-workshop creative writing course that begins with some shorter assignments and readings in nonfiction, playwriting, poetry, and memoir, and then moves into a more traditional workshop format with a longer project in one of the genres. It also includes a transcription of an interview with a family member close to the midterm. If you are interested in writing about family history and this format sounds good to you, I highly recommend the course.",
    "A very personal class where you write inspired by your family. I would recommend it for outgoing people interested in playwrighting\/creative writing. Be ready to interview someone -- which can be uncomfortable but in the end very rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course for a very serious writer intent on working professionally and intently on their craft. Not an idle course, though the requirements are relatively lax. What makes this a good class is the presence of skilled, dedicated artists who want to come together to work and critique. Take this class if you are looking to provide support and encouragement for fellow writers.",
    "It's a good writing course for you to polish a long piece\/future writing sample. It taught me how to improve my research of and approach to personal matters, and how I can use my writing to engage with my past.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a fun class. I would not recommend it for serious writers."
