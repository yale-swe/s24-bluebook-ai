    "French 160 is a great class, although it is a lot of work. I took the class Cr\/D\/Fail and I couldn't be happier with my decision. I was able to skip an assignment here and there when the workload got a little too high (which happened every couple of weeks) without worrying about my grade. However, I still feel like I got a lot out of the class and my french speaking ability is way way better than before. Another thing to note is that, unlike french 130-150, there is NO literary discussion at all. 160 focuses solely on talking about issues in contemporary France, things that almost everyone has some kind of opinion on, which makes participating in class much, much better.",
    "An in-depth coverage of french culture with a focus on improving fluency in the language."
