    "Take it if you want to continue on to the higher level Chinese electives, because it is required. If you aren't planning on doing that or doing something significant in the future with your Chinese skills, don't bother taking the class. You don't learn that much material, it is very repetitive and my oral skills didn't improve that much. It is also deceptively a lot of work each night, and studying for tests is grueling.",
    "Pretty chill L5 course, good way to keep up your Mandarin. The topics covered in the first semester of this course sequence overlap more with the topics covered at HBA, Princeton in Beijing, etc. The workload is manageable- as with most Chinese courses at Yale, expect daily quizzes and assignments. However, this course only meets three times a week so that does help a lot if you're worried about \"burning out.\" Zhou is awesome, so sweet as a professor- tests can be tough but the final exams both semester were VERY nice.",
    "Yes, I would wholeheartedly recommend it!",
    "Advanced Chinese with a focus on the literary language. Highly recommended. The wonderful instructor makes all the difference."
