   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in spending an entire semester on a very narrow area of philosophy. Levinas is very repetitive, so the strength of the course is also its weakness.",
    "Take it! Levinas is a really important philosophical influence on other 20th century thinkers, and you'll actually understand the points he's trying to make by the end of the semester. Prof. Morgan is great, and will make sure you intuitively understand the material. Good and balanced workload with papers of just the right length and (obviously) deep and fascinating material. Absolutely worth every minute spent on it and more.",
    "If you are interested, its definitely a class work taking. very little work. the readings are short and we go over them in depth in class, so if you are intimidated by taking an upper level philosophy course, Professor Morgan definitely walks you through it step by step. Challenging material but not a challenging class. But levinas is fascinating! Even if you don't buy into everything he has to say, there are some extremely powerful and useful insights\/ way of viewing the world.",
    "Definitely, but have a lot of background in philosophy first. Heidegger would help."
