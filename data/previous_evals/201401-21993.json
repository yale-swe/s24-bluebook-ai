    "This course feels much less like a class and much more like a job (although lab meetings do involve weekly readings, and are sort of like casual sections with researchers and food). It is, however, a very enjoyable job, and I would recommend it to anyone who might end up working in the field of psychology (research or otherwise).",
    "Yes. Definitely best learning experience at Yale.",
    "Yes, do it. If it's your first time doing research for credit, start with a half credit so you can familiarize yourself with this type of work.",
    "Psych Lab experience - personal projects are encouraged.",
    "The course is an interesting survey of canine cognition, ranging from evolutionary study to comparative cognition. My recommendation would depend on how interested the person is in the type of material. For someone who only has a remote interest in the details of canine cognition, this might not be the right fit. For other people who really enjoy the specifics and the various intricacies, I would highly recommend this class!",
    "Working in CapLab is a really great introduction to working in behavioral cognitive research. The people with experience working in the lab are kind and helpful, and you will truly learn a lot.",
    "You have to do it anyway for the psych major...but doing actual research work is a great experience anyway. Very worth the effort you put in.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn more about how research works.",
    "This is a good class to take if you are planning to do research during the semester.",
    "When I talk to my science major friends who are pursuing research, they always bemoan the fact that their directed research classes are only offered full-credit and there is no way they can fit that time or that credit into their schedule. I thank the upper powers for this great offering in the psych department, for the opportunity to explore research opportunities without injecting too much of my soul into it in case it is not my cup of research tea, and for the opportunity to inject as much of my soul as I want into it if it is. Use this as a chance to explore an area of research you might be interested in, and know that it is not regrettable if you end up switching labs or not pursuing research at all, because this would have been a great learning experience in either case.",
    "An easy way to get credit for working in a psych lab. 495 is a great option is you can only put in around 5 hours each week. If you're doing going to write a paper for the senior writing requirement, make sure you know the deadlines for uploading."
