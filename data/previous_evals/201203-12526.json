   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone else. Its interesting to learn about Middle East with a good professor. Also, even if the readings are a lot, they are really useful.",
    "learn about the ME",
    "It's very interesting and a great way to learn more about this fascinating region. Definitely makes understanding current events easier! If you can, take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Ben Foster is INCREDIBLE! The class is not too difficult, but the material is presented in such a fascinating way. I loved this course.",
    "Professor Foster is excellent and knows his stuff, but so many facts are coming at you so quickly that it's difficult to keep up sometimes. And if you don't relish a 9 A.M. lecture, this one might not be for you--lots of information early in the morning. Take one of the optional sections to get out of writing the term paper, and if you need a writing credit, this is an easy one--just 3 short papers. Overall, a good introductory course to the Middle East that really helps you understand some important parts of history, particularly in the modern era. Lots of reading, much of it unnecessary (although the optional readings, which are required for section, are actually pretty interesting), and a lot of memorization for the midterm and final. Go to lecture, pay attention to the key terms on the board, and study hard for the exams.",
    "Intro to Middle East was a good introduction people\/cultures\/history of the Middle East. Obviously there is a huge amount of material to cover so its all sort of general and vague, but I am definitely in a position now to better understand what's going on in the Middle East now, which was the goal.",
    "Not too hard. Interesting. A lot of info to study for on exams.",
    "It's at 9am. Foster is very knowledgeable and I learned a lot-- good intro to a subject I knew virtually nothing about. Practical advice: I took the class in such a way that I did no writing and the grade was 50\/50 midterm\/final. I did all the required reading up to the midterm, took the midterm (all except two people got As and Bs) and realized the reading (at least for me) wasn't necessary. Read the Cleveland and Bunton book, though! If you're not going to read the course packet, don't buy it because it's crazy expensive. Also, there is a lot of date memorization for the tests, which is not my cup of tea and was probably the hardest part of the class.",
    "This course contains a lot of very interesting material although lectures are not particularly exciting. If you want to learn about the history of all the countries in the Middle East, this is a good class to take, as I feel like I did learn a lot.",
    "This course is a great introduction to the history of the Middle East \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it should really be called a History of the Middle East, not Intro. That being said, I really enjoyed this class. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever learned this much in a class at Yale, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a lot of work, either (especially if you go to the TA lectures which exempts you from the paper!). Professor Foster is great, I was never bored in lecture.",
    "Learn all the basics to the region and be prepared to learn a whole lot more should you choose. Take it.",
    "I thought that MMES 102 was both informative and engaging. The topics were incredibly relavent and the workload was very reasonable. It was a great history course and it only required three papers to fulfill the writing requirement. This a great course for anyone interested in the Middle East.",
    "I highly recommend it. Prof Foster is very good and worth getting up for at 9am. I feel much less ignorant about the region after this class.",
    "Very informative. The course clarified a region that had always seemed complex and fuzzy. It is easy to miss what Foster says, so be sure to stay on your toes during lecture. The course packet readings are interesting, but not necessary for the midterm or final. Be sure to study throughout the semester, rather than cram before the midterm and final (which is what I ended up doing). Definitely worth taking! Foster is intelligent and endearing.",
    "Great course, a lot of work. DON'T get behind on the readings or it will screw you over. Make sure you copy down the key words Foster writes on the board before each lecture, they will come up on the final. I found the IDs on the midterm\/final to be the killers of my grade so beware. Other than the fact that it's a lot of work, it really does give you a better overview of the Middle East, which is exactly what I wanted, so if you're interested in the material then go for it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - it's a good introduction; you'll learn a lot and come out of it knowing a lot more about the Middle East. It's a lot of reading and a lot to learn for the midterm and final, but if you do your work during the semester, it shoudln't be too bad.",
    "I would recommend HUMS 440 to another student but would suggest they take it CRD\/F. I took it CRD\/F and thus was able to enjoy doing the readings and even reviewing for the final exam since I wasn't worried about my grade.",
    "I would recommend Humanities 440. It is a good overview of the region. Ben Foster is a good lecturer and his tests are very fair.",
    "This is a good class if you want an overview of Middle Eastern history from Mohammed to the 1980s, but not great if you want to learn about some aspect in depth. Foster is a pretty good lecturer, and knows his stuff, especially the earlier history. The later history became very politics-centered and we went through it very quickly, and I didn't enjoy it as much as the earlier history. There are a couple ways to take the class, but the standard way is to take a midterm and a final and write a final paper, each of which are weighted evenly in your final grade.",
    "Take it if you want to know what is happening in the Middle East! Prof. Foster is a great lecturer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Very useful for life outside of Yale.",
    "good"
