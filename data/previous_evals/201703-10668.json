   "comments": [
    "A definite strength was in the way the course was set up, with grammar addressed, but rarely specifically taught, as most learning was done with the textbook. Saving the in class time for pertinent questions and for group translation was a smart and economical use of the time that we had. One weakness was the lack of relation between the quizzes and the material covered in the chapter. The quizzes often did not really address the grammar learned in the chapter that they were supposed to cover. A general improvement I would suggest is more long readings if possible, as those are what we need to actually be practicing for in the \"real world.\"",
    "I think the textbook was as confusing as it was helpful.",
    "This course is interesting, however it was very fast-paced. It was difficult to keep up with the pace of the course, despite keeping up with the work load."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Learning a language in this manner helps not just with Greek, but with a general study of Indo-European philology, and can unchain us from some of the assumptions we have with English.",
    "The only way that anyone would be able to make it through this course is if they have some interest or desire to learn ancient Greek. It is not an easy or just for fun course unless you have truly want to learn this language."
