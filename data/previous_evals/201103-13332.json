   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you enjoy reading about utopias and anarchies. If you genuinely enjoy the readings, you will genuinely enjoy the class. I found that a lot of people don't enjoy the topic though. I think the grading is difficult at first, but your grade should definitely improve as the semester progresses. It's a good introduction into collegiate writing.",
    "The class teaches both reading and writing skills. As a student who did not feel that high school sufficiently prepared her for college, this course helped me smoothly transition into college-level academic writing. There are four papers throughout the course, each distinctly different in style, which I found to be a big advantage. Also, there is a research paper. I found this particularly constructive because it forced me to go into the library and find books, something I would not have done otherwise. I would definitely recommend this to another student, particularly one who does not feel his or her writing is on the collegiate level.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you absolutely love taking about utopias for a whole semester. The class is not great and it does not help your writing. Take another section of 114.",
    "This class is an abstract summary of thought on utopia and anarchy, that is also a writing class. I don't think the subject is an effective one for an english 114 one. Take any other course if you are just trying to improve your writing. This class had interesting conversation, but did not make me feel as if my writing improved.",
    "This class does a good job teaching you to write an argumentative essay, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve his or her basic writing skills. You'll learn to think more about word choice and how other readers might view your essay. Make sure you take a section with a topic that interests you. Otherwise it could get really boring really fast, and you'll have a hard time motivating yourself to do the readings and write about them. Mr. Hurshman is a pretty good teacher, and I would recommend his section if it interests you. I personally felt Utopians and Anarchists got a bit redundant after a while, though.",
    "i would recommend this class, the discussions were good even though a few people did not participate in them",
    "English 114 is a great course for anyone student because it gets you ready to produce solid, argumentative papers. I would definitely recommend it because the topic was very interesting, the readings were enjoyable, and I really liked the small, discussion-based class."
