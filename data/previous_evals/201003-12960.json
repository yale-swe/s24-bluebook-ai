    "TAKE THIS CLASS. PERIOD. I am not a science person at all, and I was nervous about finding a class to help fulfill my last science requirement. But looking back, I would take this class (or any class taught by Kaury) again, even if I didn't need to.This class was everything that a class should be. I learned SO much information, but I never felt unnecessarily stressed. First of all, the basic subject matter was so interesting and relevant. People talk about hormones causally all the time, but it was so cool to actually learn the specific mechanisms that underlie important hormone pathways. As the semester went on, I found myself analyzing my behavior more and more in terms of what I had learned about my body. I took the class with some good friends, and I think we totally bored everybody else at the dinner table by talking about our hormones! The class also tackles topics beyond the strictly scientific, including health care, athletic integrity, funding for medical research, experimental ethics, and hormone disorder prevention.I may have actually learned more useful information in this class that any other at Yale.In addition, the workload of the class was a major plus. There wasn't any pointless busy work, and all of the major assignments were fun and completely manageable. There were weekly discussion quizzes, but they were all fair and nothing to stress over. In addition, there was an open-note midterm, a 5-pg. journal article review, a lab assignment, a 5-pg. research paper, and a take-home final. It's a great fifth class to take if the rest of your schedule is going to be killer.The structure of the class is also really great-- it's like a hybrid between a small lecture and a seminar. The class meets twice a week: the first meeting time is basically a lecture (where questions are encouraged and sometimes rewarded with cookies!), and the second meeting is a discussion. Not only did this make the information more accessible, but it also fostered a real sense of comfortable community.The best part about the class, however, is the professor. Kaury is awesome! She is so smart, down-to-earth, understanding... everything you'd want your professor to be! I was really sad when the class was over, mainly because I'm going to miss her!Bottom line: Take this class, whether or not you need it for a science credit! You'll learn a bunch and have a great time!",
    "YES. Even if you don't need an easy Science credit, the class is enjoyable and not a lot of work, but you still learn a lot.",
    "Yes. Take it if you're lucky enough to get into the class!",
    "Definitely a great class. Caters to seniors who have a lot to do outside this class. No busy work but still managed to learn a lot.",
    "This class covers the structure, function, and nature of the major hormones in the body. We also learned about the scientific method and how to critique published scientific work. It's a really fun and informative class, and I feel like I learned a lot without feeling stressed or crunched by the workload. I would recommend this class in a heartbeat.",
    "The Science of Human Hormones is an endocrinology class for non-science majors that will make your science major friends really jealous. Not only is it fascinating material that is so relevant to everyday life, but it's also a seminar, not a giant lecture. Professor Kucera is fantastic. The class was never stressful, but I learned so much. Professor Kucera would teach us about a particular hormone\/feedback system, and the following class meeting, we would take a quiz on said hormone, which was never too bad. After taking the quiz, we would discuss the reading, drawing from new york times articles and scientific journals alike to apply our knowledge to everyday life and relevant topics. This is exactly what a science credit should be - Professor Kucera has made me want to take another science course, though I've already fulfilled my requirements. IF YOU GET IN, TAKE IT.",
    "Yes! Take this course! The workload is very manageable and class is actually a lot of fun. Definitely a gem of a course.",
    "TAKE IT. Not only did this class fulfill a science credit, it was also really enjoyable to take, not an extreme amount of work, and kaury is the nicest professor ever. She would bring us cookies, extend deadlines if we needed, etc. I learned a lot of really useful information. So glad I took it!",
    "A great, low-stress introduction to the topic, especially if you aren't a science person. The material is so much more relevant than other classes people use to get the Sc credit out of the way. If you can get in, take it.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "Yes. This class is a gem. It's interesting, you learn a considerable amount (I knew a lot about human physiology ahead of time, but I still learned a ton), and Kaury is incredibly nice. Not a lot of work at all, if you pay attention in class.Take this class!",
    "Take it. It's a class on Human Hormones, the way they work, their influence, etc. -- A summary would go on for too long. Logistically speaking, the class met two days a week. First day was a lecture given by Professor Kucera, and the second day was the section--a class discussion (for which we had to prepare with readings from the textbook and other secondary articles she would assign).If you can, take it. If you need a science, take it. Even if you don't need a science credit, I'd say take it. Professor Kucera's so engaging and a lot of fun. Like I",
    "TAKE IT. The work is manageable for non-science people and it's SO MUCH FUN. You'll love going to class.",
    "Yes, because it is an excellent course."
