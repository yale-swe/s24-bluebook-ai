    "CS 150 addresses the question, is it possible to create a mind out of software? It questions the grand analogy that mind is to brain as software is to hardware. If you are not interested in this question, then the class is not for you. But if you have even the slightest interest in it (and the implications that such technology has for humanity), then you will find the course fascinating.The workload is not heavy, and some students definitely get away with doing a minimal amount of work. There are four 300-wordresponses plus a final 2000 word paper on top of a modest amount of readings. These 300-word assignments are definitely not easy, and Professor Gelernter grades them carefully - word by word - as that is the only way to improve the clarity of your writing.All in all this is an outstanding class with an incredible professor. It is unlike any other course I have come across at Yale.If you are looking for an easy distributional requirement then this class is not for you. If you are interested in philosophy of mind, computing, and becoming a better writer, then I can think of no better class.",
    "I loved this class. Basically, you go and listen to Professor Gelernter for 75 minutes, occasionally asking questions. Gelernter will occasionally ask questions of you. It's a great class if you like Gelernter and are interested in what he has to say. I was such a student, but if you don't like him or the first class during shopping period, don't take the class. Everyone says he grades harshly: he does a bit, but if you are a concise writer with a good grasp of cohesion and coherence, and follow the rules of English Professor Andrew Ehrgood, you will be fine.tldr; Awesome if Gelernter and the topic float your boat. Not awesome otherwise.",
    "I would recommend it. I initially wanted to take an easy writing credit, and was not too bothered by the harsh reviews of students in previous years. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by the class. His grading is a little particular, but not unreasonable like you might think from the reviews. If you can write clearly and concisely then you will be fine, just takes a little getting used to."
