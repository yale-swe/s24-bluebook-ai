   "comments": [
    "Definitely would recommend this course to anyone. It really sheds light on a not-much-discussed but still very important topic in today's society. The structure of the class lends itself to great experience in the classroom and developing curriculum with other teachers. You learn a lot about why we should care about early childhood education in this culture.",
    "Definitely take this class - you learn a lot about curriculum development and Professor Horwitz so clearly knows her stuff. Plus the observation is really fun!",
    "YES!!! If you actually care about children then this class will be an incredible experience. It is a bit time consuming (2.5 hr lecture and then 2.5-3 hr observations) compared to other Yale courses but what you gain out of it is unparalleled. The workload consists of 3 papers; 15, 25-35, and 20 pagers. Not as daunting as it seems; I do not enjoy writing but for this class the assignments were enjoyable and applied to exactly what we were learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class! I throughly enjoyed taking it and feel like I learned a lot from the class but even more from observation every week. If you have the time to fit it into your schedule, I would definitely try to take it. It's past science hill so it takes a while to get there. Also, you will have observation for 2-2.5 hours a week.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's so interesting, and will make you want to learn more about the politics and social effects of early childhood curricula. Professor Horwitz is extremely knowledgeable, and just listening to her speak for a few minutes will make you a more well-rounded citizen, capable of understanding the interplay of psychology, politics, education, and the economy as they all affect children's learning and development. The reading was interesting and not very long at all. The 2.5-3 hour observation outside of class is when I learned the most, all firsthand. Final paper at the end and two sets of journal entries to turn in. Take this class!",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it! Observing kids is very enjoyable and you'll get to learn about kids and yourself. (Flashbacks to your past is almost a certainty)",
    "Early Childhood Education is a great course. By the end of the semester, you learn a great deal about children's development, preschool education, and current policy on early childhood education. In addition to a small seminar style lecture where we discuss extensively about children's development in language, literacy, math, and science, you also get to observe first-hand how these skills develop by interacting with children at the day care center. If you're interested in children's intellectual, cognitive, social-emotional development and preschool education in general, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Good class. Really insightful!",
    "Definitely take it. You learn a lot about how children develop and learn, and the observations are great. Carla leads great discussions!",
    "This class is useful if you plan to have kids, become a teacher, or run your own early childhood education center. You will spend 3 hours in the school to play with kids and observe their behavior. Then you need to write a memo and discuss it with your classmates. It was a lot of fun. Don't expect that this will be business related though. This formal offers a healthy balance of both theory and practice."
