   "comments": [
    "What Dana taught aligned with what I expected. I learned most of what I hoped to learn in the beginning. However, I would like him to include designing \"app\" in Google Earth Engine.",
    "Very well. I expected to gain some exposure to computer languages and techniques related to geospatial software, and that certainly happened. I also expected to benefit from the unique and thoughtfully-crafted learning environment that Professor Tomlin creates in all of his classes, and that, too, was well met.",
    "Based on what I'd heard from students last year, I thought the class material would focus half of Javascript\/Google Earth Engine and half on ArcPy; it ended up being more like 1\/3 vs 2\/3. Which is fine--Dana told us about this change during shopping period. I believe I will use Python more frequently than Javascript\/GEE in my future career, so I was happy with that balance, but other students could have been disappointed with the relative shallowness with which we addressed GEE I regret not putting slightly more effort into this course, and I believe I could have walked away with more skills if I had tried harder.",
    "The course was what I expected, though perhaps a bit more advanced than I anticipated. I came in with zero-coding abilities and found that while it was possible to keep up in the class, it was challenging to create meaningful assignment submissions with my limited abilities.",
    "The course met my expectation - I have learned a lot."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "First, students have many opportunities to practice by working on their weekly assignments. Our TF TC and Dana are very engaging in helping with our issues posted online. The course can be further improved by providing more guidance throughout the projects. Since many materials about GEE are edge-cutting, it was hard to find additional guidance online. More instructions on weekly projects would help.",
    "Without question, the primary strength is Prof. Tomlin -- his clarity and eloquence during class, his responsiveness to student questions on Piazza and via email, his extreme generosity in understanding and accommodating unusual circumstances that inhibit a student's performance in the class, and more. It's truly astounding how much effort he puts into creating useful resources for his students to reference both out of class and after the course ends. Overall, Professor Tomlin is easily one of the best teachers I've ever had the pleasure and privilege of taking a class from. The weaknesses that come to mind are not actually under Prof. Tomlin's control... They're mostly related to some less-than-ideal documentation offered and unintuitive set-up created by Google and Esri in certain areas of their respective software.",
    "STRENGTHS - Dana's handouts are a fantastic resource. - Putting small, simple spatial datasets on the class Google Drive and encouraging students to base their homework assignments on them is great for alleviating the stress and time-suck of students finding their own datasets for the week (which some students may have little experience doing). Using a specified raster or vector dataset also makes debugging with instructors easier! I think a few more of the homework assignments could benefit from a simple \"play dataset\" being provided and students being nudged to use it, particularly during the GEE section of the class when imageCollections etc. are unfamiliar to almost everyone enrolled. WEAKNESSES - I felt sort of solitary \/ siloed from my peers throughout this class. While it is incumbent upon a student to reach out to other students for help \/ collaboration \/ commiseration, I wish the instructor made a few more deliberate attempts to get students sharing what they were working on with each other (beyond just a round-robin announcement of what everyone's project title is). I think it's unrealistic that students will read all their peer's project proposals beyond the abstract page, even if they are available on the shared Google Drive. An idea: perhaps when students complete their final project proposals ~midway through the term, part of a class period could be dedicated to each student give a verbal pitch or low-key presentation describing their ideas. The student audience can ask clarifying questions, provide feedback, and propose approaches or roadblocks that the presentee may not have considered. This exercise could also help students \"put a face to a name\" in some sense, and help build camaraderie in what's otherwise a very technical, solo class.",
    "Stelnghths: You gain skills that are marketable, applicable and even if you never use them again, coding is a challenging exercise that forces your brain to work in different exciting ways. Dana gives great lectures that break down the complex material into digestible ideas. Weaknesses: Also, the three-our block is not necessary for the class. We almost always finished within 1.5 hours. This was frustrating for me because the long schedule block made it difficult for me to find classes that did not conflict during shopping period. Other issues are that you receive NO feedback, and the homework assignments are fairly unstructured. I think it would be much more helpful to have assignments that are more like guided modules when we are new to the coding and the platforms, that walk us through the fundamentals."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Please prepare at least 8 hours per week for this class. You would only learn how to code if you contribute your time to learning it. Although taking the remote sensing class is not a pre-requisite, you would able to comprehend the class materials better if you have foundations on remote sensing.",
    "Don't hesitate to take advantage of all of the incredible resources offered in this course, including your classmates, past HW submissions, Prof. Tomlin's handouts and references, the TF, and, of course, Prof. Tomlin himself. If you have little or no experience coding, you might feel slightly behind initially, but it's no reason to fret because Prof. Tomlin goes over as much as possible from the ground up. What's more, he is very happy to answer any question you put forth, no matter how basic or elementary it may seem to you.",
    "- Look at the week's homework assignment at the start of each class session, and as you listen to the lecture about X method and Y process, start brainstorming what you wish to do for your homework assignment during class, using the methods being discussed. - Taking class notes on a laptop, in a file where you can jot down pseudo-code in Javascript or Python, means that by the end of the session you've already got a rough draft of your homework assignment! And you don't have to waste time converting handwritten code to typed code. - Piazza is helpful, but attending in-person office hours and meeting with instructors outside of class can help deepen your understanding of a subject and take you beyond \"knowing how to put a bandaid on a problem\"",
    "It is worth it if you think you will definitely use these skills in geospatial analysis. Or if you want to learn how to code (mostly by teaching yourself). You will improve a lot... but the class is not organized as well as it could be to help students learn and get feedback on their work (there is literally zero feedback throughout the semester, and nothing except a grade without explanation on the final project).",
    "The amount of time you put into this course determines how well and how much you learn."
