    "The End of Metaphysics is a heady, eclectic philosophy course exploring the biggest questions: what is there, and what does it mean? It's a challenging course even if you have some philosophy background, as Professor Levene is advancing a somewhat heretic (which is not to say incorrect!) view of much of the Western philosophical tradition.",
    "I would 100% reccommend this course to another student. Overall, this was a great course. I think the greatest strength of this course was the classroom environment: it was one in which true, purposeful discussion was able to thrive. This is something that many courses fail to do. One way that it might be improved is to sometimes moderate the pace of the discussion, as I feel that sometimes there was a drop-off point where the discussion would get beyond certain students. However, I think it would be difficult to do this without disturbing the discussion environment. I think Professor Levene was great, because she was the reason why we were able to have such a genuine discussion space - one that was purposeful, rather than just a 2-hour gathering for people to make disconnected comments. I really respected that she never \"dumbed down\" the material, and instead worked with us collectively and individually to understand the material and critically engage in our own way. This was done not just in relation to the discussions, but also with regard to the writing process - both in the planning and feedback stages. She is definitely intimidating, but honestly the experience is so worth it.",
    "This course deals with the \"fate\" of Western metaphysics through the ages, starting with Plato and the Bible and ending with contemporary thinkers like Heidegger and Zizek. The central question of the course is what metaphysics is, and how this may have changed throughout history. The teaching of the course emphasizes ways of engaging with the texts, ensuring that students avoid either uncritically accepting the authors' points or bending the narrative on the page to fit their own preconceptions.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone who wants to better understand how we got to where we are in the 21st century in terms of thought\/religion\/metaphysics\/atheism. At the end you'll begin to understand that there truly is nothing really new.",
    "If youre fascinated by the elusive divide between human and divide, or by the not-always-obvious intersection between religion and philosophy, especially in a world which treats them as two completely separate things, this is the class for you. The readings are hard, and the essays are tough, but they are well worth the pleasure youll get from being in class with Professor Levene and being a first-hand witness to her wrestling with these difficult texts alongside you. Take it!!!",
    "If you enjoy demanding freeform thought about abstract and confusing philosophical concepts, this class will probably suit you well. If you're a stickler for structure and need to come out of a class feeling like you learned something concrete that will help you get a job someday, this class probably isn't for you. But in that case, philosophy probably isn't for you. Also, maybe don't take this class if you can't stand continental philosophy. Otherwise, it's a great way to practice writing and critical thinking."
