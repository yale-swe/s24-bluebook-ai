    "This course will develop your skills depending on what project you do; very advisor specific. No matter what, it's a great forum to develop your stats and data science knoweldge.",
    "How to do research: How to have a timeline, how to narrow down a topic, what to do when you fail, etc.",
    "AmaZing",
    "I learned a lot about my thesis subject area and about how to write a research paper.",

    "There should be meetings every couple of weeks with the whole group of students doing theses so that we can have more of a community, learn about other peoples' theses, be held more accountable, and learn some skills along the way about various things related to the thesis process. Advisers should also be held more accountable to advising their students. They should be asked in advance to not take on students if they are too busy to meet with their students weekly and provide them with quality feedback on their work.",
    "I think that the department can do more to help standardize student experiences, which were highly variable depending on advisor.",
    "Improvements: Provide faculty and students with clearer guidelines about requirements and what constitutes a good project Develop stronger community between students throughout the process Supplementary workshops for framing and developing research, and the research process",
    "It was great in that I could get one-on-one guidance from my advisor to make progress with the project, but also use my independent judgment in conducting research.",
    "Again, very advisor specific; you have to submit a proposal, a poster, and a report to the DUS. This open-ended structure makes your learning very much up to your own focus and project management skills.",
    "Both strength and weakness: can set your own pace with your advisor.",
    "Amazing",
    "I thought the department did a great job of organizing things and being an available resource without adding too much additional work!"

    "Yes, it's the senior project in statistics.",
    "Yes! Please choose an advisor who cares. It matters so much.",
    "Amazing",
    "Definitely! A thesis is a lot of work but the S&DS department does a lot to facilitate the process.",
    "I would, because you get a sense of self-direction that you won't get from any other S&DS course."
