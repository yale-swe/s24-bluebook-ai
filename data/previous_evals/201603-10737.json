    "This is a necessary class for prospective English majors, and though I feel there may be some resentment because of the lack of diversity, nonetheless I felt it was an important introduction to canonical poetry. The course itself could feature more emphasis on the history of the periods studied, since that would have definitely informed my understanding of the poets further.",
    "I actually think the course itself is very sound, very well put together. I appreciate the inclusion of non-canonical poets, but I wish that if they are going to be included, then discussion around them be a little more structured and attend more critically to comparing them with the poets who we have \"canonized.\"",
    "This course allows students a great intro to great English poetry. The poets are challenging and interesting. Even though they are mainly canonical, they still have a lot to offer."

    "If you're taking this course, you are almost certainly taking it because it's a req for the major, so ultimately it's not a question of should you or should you not, but will you enjoy it. For all the fire which the introductory English sequence has come under, and understandably so, I do think the poets which the course covers really can surprise you. Chaucer is incredibly playful, Spenser is pretty unrivaled in his versification, and Donne has an incredible formal range (the Shakespearean sonnets didn't do it for me as much). You won't get to dive in nearly as deep as you might like because it is a survey course, but it is wonderful, difficult poetry.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student, but only if they were an English major."
