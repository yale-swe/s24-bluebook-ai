    "Yes it overall was a pleasant experience and you learn a lot.",
    "YES TAKE IT",
    "This is a pretty basic intro macro course. It is slightly more in-depth than the lecture and the curve is harder, but it's a good way to signal that you're serious about Econ to the department. I really liked it!",
    "Highly recommended. The material is interesting, Professor Simons is approachable and an engaging lecturer, the \"buzz groups\" are fun. Problem sets help revise the material quite thoroughly, but don't take too long. This course is slightly challenging, but well worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Interesting enough. Really intended for those actually interested in an econ\/ep&e major-- therefore not a good option for those just looking to casually take an econ class",
    "Katerina is not a great teacher. She struggles to explain things in a meaningful way, and her class is, simply put, boring. I taught most of what we learned to myself. I would recommend taking the lecture-- it's the lesser of evils.",
    "Takes you through the theoretical fundamentals of macro. Pretty useful",
    "This is a great class to take if you want to seriously engage with macroeconomics and really understand the topic. You will definitely need to put the work in to succeed by doing the reading and the problem sets, but they are manageable and if you do it you will get a lot more out of intro macro than you would in the lecture. I would recommend this.",
    "If you're serious about learning Macro, take this course vs. the lecture. Be warned that it's not a classic seminar - there's very little participation involved - it's basically just a capped lecture. The material is considerably more challenging than that in the lecture, and you'll have to depend more on personal growth and reading the book, with the absence of TFs and sections. If you want to add more depth to your personal study of economics, 111 is the class to take if you're eligible.",
    "Good intro class. Take it if you're considering the economics major, and after this course, you'll know if you want to continue studying economics or not.",
    "This is probably the best way to learn intro macro at Yale, but its still pretty weak and hardly an immersive learning experience as I've had in some seminars. I've had mixed feelings about this course-- some of which may concern economics more generally. At times, I've disliked the focus on mathematical models and trying to quantify macro-level human behavior. I feel like this misses some of the richness and nuance in understanding how we act for a false sense of rigor. At other times, I've really appreciated this quantitative focus and its explanatory power. But more to the point: I think this course could have been a lot better. Though we probably learned more than students of the huge intro lecture, we could have had a much more engaging and enriching experience. The small class still felt most always like a lecture (though one in which people often asked question). Still, Prof. Simons taught at such a fast pace-- largely because she used PowerPoint slides-- that I know most students struggled to actually encode the material and actively learn. We were just trying to keep up in class and often could not truly engage the material. To actually and deeply learn macroeconomics-- and not just blaze through it--- I and most of the students I talked to relied on reading the textbook. I think we would have found this course more rewarding it operated as a more active lecture. Though we touched on this with a few small group discussions and \"buzz group\" problem solving, the course could use a lot more. After most every topic, I think the instructor should incorporate an example that we solve together (or check together) and bigger questions to discuss that expand our thought on macroecon. I also would have liked if Prof Simons incorporated an anonymous feedback option on the Classes V2 page so that we could openly share our ideas to improve the course while we were still taking it. The absolute biggest weakness of the course was that Prof Simons taught it through PowerPoint slides-- slides that lend themselves to skipping through material without deeply engaging. To vigorously learn macro, I've found that it helps to actively work to on problems and engage the material-- not simply explain ideas and move on. But this weakness also offers the easiest fix: teach using the blackboard. By teaching on the blackboard, students can encode the material as its worked out and written and will not fall behind."
