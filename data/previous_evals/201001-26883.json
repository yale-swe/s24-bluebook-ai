    "Good seminar, regardless of interests. If inequality\/labor economics are your thing, all the better.",
    "This is a course that is low key and addresses some big issues related to the widening U.S. wage structure, like superstar wages and the effect of sex and race. I highly recommend it.",
    "ECON 458 is a very interesting class on the trends of US wages during the last 5 decades. The class requires you to read interesting papers that are not too hard to understand. Prof. Aaronson is really helpful at answering students' questions and she can explain interesting econometric issues very clearly. Workload includes: 3 reading responses per semester, 1 midterm paper (5 pages) and 1 final paper (10-15). The papers require you to argue for a particular theory explaining some trend in US wages based solely on evaluative analysis of academic papers, which was very interesting to do. Overall: a slightly low workload + interesting topics make this class worth taking.",
    "If you're interested in earnings inequality, take it."
