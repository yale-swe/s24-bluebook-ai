    "219 is basically a dictation, sight-singing, and figured bass class. Shop it to see if you like it. This year the different sections were taught by different teachers, so shop around and see who you like. Personally I preferred Sarita to Doug, but I thought they were both solid instructors. If you are taking this after 218, be warned that 219 is a big step up in difficulty. I really coasted through 218, but 219 was something of a struggle especially as the semester progressed."
