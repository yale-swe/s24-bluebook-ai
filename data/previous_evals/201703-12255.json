    "Classes are great, the teachers are great- the whole course is awesome. The only thing it lacked was a clear schedule and set deadlines. We were never penalized because of this, but it still would have been easier to know of schedules and due dates a tad bit more in advance than we did sometimes.",
    "The constant class activities keep everyone engaged and great a welcoming atmosphere that makes me excited to go to class in the morning. As for the weaknesses, I can't say I found any downsides to this class.",
    "I think the course is very good as the teacher is extremely entertaining and his class is very fun. I enjoyed going to his class everyday.",
    "The course wasnt organized that well, but we learned a lot about Indonesia and the Indonesian language",
    "weakness included not being familiar with indonesian",
    "It was easy and fun. Teachers are disorganized at times.",
    "Practicing verbally more"

    "Absolutely. It's the best language out there. The teachers are great and even bring food sometimes. I took it at 9:25 and it's, even though I had to get up kind of early every day (it's a language), it's 1.5 credits and a good class to start your day with.",
    "Indonesian class is a once in a life time experience. The TA's and teacher are awesome and want nothing but for you to do well.",
    "Yes - it was a fun course and provides an advanced look at a culture that not many people may be exposed to.",
    "Absolutely. This course taught a lot about a language that is not commonly taught in the United States (compared to Spanish, French, etc)",
    "Yes! Take the class.",
    "Wvery good experience and a good skill"
