    "It is a good crash course on statistics for clinical studies. I didn't think it was as applicable for simpler lab data.",
    "Excellent course, highly recommended for students looking to immediately apply statical tests to their data. Not for students looking to have an in-depth understanding of the math behind the statistical tests. Recommend that students have minimal other commitments during the two weeks of this course."

    "This course provided me with a good background in choosing the types of statistical analysis I need for drug trial research, but I don't think I'll be doing much of that for my research. In any case, it helped me to think more about the statistical tests I use for my own data analysis."
