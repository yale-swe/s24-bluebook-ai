    "If you've ever thought about learning Hebrew, or at least taking an introductory class to the language, take this class! Dina is great and so helpful, and the class is small and fun. I really did love coming to class each day.",
    "Course is good, standard, L-1 language. Dina is a bit harsh, gives a lot of work, but you learn a fantastic language.",
    "Hebrew is probably one of the more fun language classes offered at Yale. The workload is constant but not very large, and as long as you keep up with it, you'll be totally fine. You'll be reading and writing paragraphs in a couple of weeks!Dina designed the curriculum to be fun and interactive. I enjoyed going to Hebrew class 5 days a week and also made strong ties with my classmates. Take it!One word to people who had hebrew in day school: No matter how bad you think your hebrew is, you definitely do not belong in L1. It will be way to easy.",
    "A fun introduction to Modern Hebrew. Absolutely take it! Dina was wonderful.",
    "If you want to take Hebrew, you should go for it. Dina is perhaps not the best teacher, but she's pretty good and get's the job done. The work really piles up towards the end of the semester, and a number of the students have a day school background and, therefore, a head start, but overall the course was an enjoyable experience.",
    "It's what you'd expect, but I'd try to do it with Ayala rather than Dina if at all possible."
