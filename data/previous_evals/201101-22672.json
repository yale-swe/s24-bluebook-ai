    "This is a great 5th class to take. The workload is light - midterm and final papers and one reading response - and the readings are genuinely interesting. There are assigned movies as well, which are actually super fun to watch. You do have to actually do the readings, as the class is entirely driven by student participation, but that's not terribly difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It seems to attract a wide variety of majors, so if you're looking for pure literary analysis, this class is not what you're looking for. But if you want interesting discussions about language, disability, narrative, etc. with information from science, psychology, linguistics, religion, and more, then this class is for you.",
    "Take this class if disability in literature appeals. If you're more into learning about physical disability then take his 'Spectacles of Disability' class. I'm not an English major nor did I think I could ever like English but these classes were great. It's pretty cool and Berger's a nice guy.",
    "Take this class if you don't mind exploring the same concepts pertaining to disabilities and language for the whole semester. Also, if your class is small, make sure you do all the reading so you can have an engaging class; otherwise it will be a boring two hours.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're interested in psychology as well as english -- don't just take it as an English class if you don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the brain."
