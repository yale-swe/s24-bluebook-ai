    "Best readings of my life.",
    "Q.7: This course has helped me to re-think many of the management frameworks i knew before Yale for addressing conservation and development problems. The Professor through his critical and thought-provoking weekly analyzes of varied topics, has helped me view environmental problems\/solutions from a much more critical angle.",
    "This course was useful to MFers as a way to think about forestry in a new light. This class helps students develop the skills to not as why something is happening but why are we asking this question of the situation. It helps the students take a step back."

This course forced me to become a better thinker and researcher which is useful even if I will not become an academic.",
    "The group-lead discussions sessions",
    "the amount of writing and analytical skill set acquired in the course.",
    "The way our class discussions stemmed from the course readings. Interesting persepectives from different classmates was very beneficial.",
    "The format worked well (beginning with a lecture and then moving into a peer-facilitated discussion section). I think this format helped to push people to pay closer attention to the readings than they would have otherwise.",

I also attended a session that dealt with a review of the different readings assigned during the life of the course.The Professor always provided ready and helpful responses whenever i contacted him.",
    "Both the instructor and the TA were very responsive and gave constructive advice.",
    "Help was always available.",
    "They were both very helpful in offering advice. I really appreciated how Lauren organized so many events for the class, like the paper-writing workshop, etc.",
    "TA was very available but the instructor was harder to get time with, although he always did make time at some point."

    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time preparing for each week. The more you put in the more you get out. The readings and discussion are relevant to a wide range of topics. Lead discussions on weeks where the topics are of most interest to you, because it takes quite a while to prepare for discussion and you will reap the strongest benefits from the sections you lead.Give yourself time to digest. The course starts by establishing a framework for critical thinking that you may be challenging to appreciate all at once.",
    "Go for it and come prepared to have some of the \"business-as-usual\" models in conservation and development work questioned.",
    "Start your term paper early! Cannot stress this enough.",
    "At first you might find it frustrating if you are accustomed to producing \"solutions\"... this course is not really about that... the point of it is to take a step back and re-examine assumptions. As a result there will be more \"problems\" than \"solutions.\" The goal of this class is to examine the unexamined... If you stick with it you will find that this is a very valuable practice.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of reading. The readings are long but move quickly. Not all students will be equally prepared for the class discussions, it is very apparent, do the reading."
