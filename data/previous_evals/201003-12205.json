   "comments": [
    "Excellent course. Well taught, fun, interactive, a lot of work but always worth coming five times a week! Everyone in the class seemed to genuinely want to be there. I would definitely recommend!",
    "Italian 110 was a very challenging and rewarding class. The professor that I had, Griffin Oleynick was fantastic. He always made the class entertaining and fun, while at the same time teaching us a lot of Italian. I would suggest this class to anyone looking to fulfill their language requirement or wants to learn Italian for it's own sake. It's a fun language to learn, and it's not that difficult when you have such a good professor.",
    "I would recommend Italian 110 for anyone who has had background in the Romance languages. It might be challenging for people who aren't used to spoken languages because the class literally begins in Italian. Most people have had background in Italian before, but professors are generally understanding if you haven't.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Italian 110 to another student, although the popularity of the course suggests the department need not work too hard to find other interested students! The course is ideally designed to cover all bases of Italian grammar in a few short months, from verb tenses to the subjunctive to a myriad number of useful vocabulary words. The intimacy of each class offers the student the chance to speak often and have his or her thoughts be heard, and the smallness also generates a strong sense of class camaraderie and friendship through daily lessons. Students should expect to work on a daily basis, though the work is never unmanageable, and weekly compositions are also chosen with interesting topics in mind. Go Italian!",
    "TAKE IT, especially if you have Griffin. It is not too difficult and a very fun language to learn.",
    "Yes, the course is not particularly difficult but you will learn a lot of Italian throughout the semester."
