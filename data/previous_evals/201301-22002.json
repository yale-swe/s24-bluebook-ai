    "Harder than L1 just because Dina has higher expectations now that you're no longer in first semester. Typing is really time consuming, and Dina was a picky grader to be honest. Overall though, my Hebrew has improved at a stunning rate. Take it, be prepared to put in the extra hours -- the more you put in, the more you get out of the class.",
    "YES! Take it because Hebrew is a great language!",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "In l2 you learn past tense and more verbs and vocab. It's an extension on l1 however it is not nearly as enriching. Dina is not Ayala. Although you need it for credit and will probably take it if you're reading this review, plan for a heavy load at the end of the semester. With the shortened reading week this is really troublesome. Overall, you do learn a lot and get to practice hebrew. The work load is much much lighter and while this is a nice relief, I didn't learn as well.",
    "Depends on what you are looking to get out of this. I took it to learn more about jewish thought and culture and I think there could be a little bit more of that but perhaps higher levels of hebrew will provide us with more interesting texts. It is true that only one country speaks the language so it is not \"practical\" like say russian or chinese or arabic, especially you dont have relatives in Israel or are not planning on moving there. Still I would say do not be discouraged by that. It is really up to what you are looking to get out of a language. I have no interest in East, China, Japan, Korea etc. and no real interest in global economics to have a career in it so Chinese is really much less helpful in my case despite the fact that 1 billion people speak it",
    "Yes, L2 is great! Dina is very organized, and you will receive structured, beautiful worksheets laying out every topic covered. Overall it was less work than L1, which was nice for the rest of my schedule, though I don't think we learned quite as much."
