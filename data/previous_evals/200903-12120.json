    "Best course I've taken at Yale. Admittedly - What people say about Roemer's not facilitating much discussion is true (he'll tell you just as much on the first day of class). The class is largely lecture-based, but it is not impersonal. People ask questions and there is some discussion here and there. Thing is, you for the most part won't care that there's no discussion when you're listening to his lectures. Roemer's is an incredibly brilliant professor, and has really solid (and novel) arguments on most things your read for the course.One of the coolest things about the course is the variety you get. The first several weeks are pretty much just philosophy, then there are a few weeks of just straight-up econ, then a few weeks of applications of the econ to the philosophy, then a few weeks applying the philosophy to the real world and talking about some sociological issues. The readings likewise vary agood deal, from straight analytic philosophy to very mathematical policy proposal papers.Also, be ready for economics. I honestly think that's the best part of this course - you look at philosophical questions that you might have considered before, but from an economic viewpoint - but if you don't like economics, this will just waste your time. The econ isn't too hard in class, although the first problem set is a little devastating. There's only three problem sets though, and three short papers, so the workload is manageable.",
    "Equality is a mixture of both economics and political philosophy - if you like both, then it's a great class, but if you dislike either, it may be frustrating. Gives you an exposure to modern analytical philosophy that I hadn't seen before, I thought that was really valuable. The course is more a lecture than a discussion-based seminar, yeah, but I much prefered that; discussion-based econ seminars are silly and often devolve into a contest between people jockeying for participation points. Also, if you shop it and it's really boring the first day, don't worry, that was easily the least interesting lecture all year. It gets way better.",
    "More of a lecture than a seminar and a bit math heavy at times, but if you are interested in theories of resource distribution, then you will most likely enjoy this class.",
    "You can almost certainly find the appropriate seminar for you. For instance, if you like economics and moral philosophy, you will love this course.",
    "Take it!"
