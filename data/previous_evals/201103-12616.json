    "I would highly recommend Introduction to Verse Writing. Students write one poem a week in response to a prompt, and do at least two revisions to hand in. In class each week, three poems are workshopped. I would suggest starting the poem soon after getting the prompt so that you can work on it and revise throughout the week. As the semester went on, I found that I wanted to spend more and more time on the class and reading poetry.",
    "This course is definitely worthwhile to take if you're interested in improving your poetry. Louise Gluck is very helpful in revision--she's blunt enough to say what doesn't work, and though she definitely tends toward a certain style, she will admit when she's uncertain about things, and tell you what she loves. She's good at giving advice on where to take a poem, how to find ideas for revision. However, if you're interested in learning to write poetry, there isn't much lecturing--you just workshop the poems submitted for class. Louise doesn't teach you how to write a new poem or how to find great topics for poetry--but she does take what you've written and show you how to transform it and make it better. I would recommend the class, overall. It was sometimesfrustrating, but I enjoyed it. It's not the be all and end all of poetry classes, but it's very good for developing the craft.",
    "This course is great because you write a poem every week and Louise Gluck comments on it. It's not great because every week you have to listen to 14 students attempt to discuss poetry and please Louise.This isn't really an Introduction to Verse Writing because some knowledge of verse writing is expected coming in. More styles could be covered. Louise only seemed to like spare, modern free verse. That's what I write so she liked me but she was biased against others.My poetry really did improve over the span of the course but I'm nervous that it also narrowed to fit the expectations of Louise.However, take it if you get in. By far my favorite course at Yale yet.Spend a lotof time on your poems. It will be worth it. Also edit them once you get her comments and conference with her as much as you can.",
    "Absolutely, if you have the patience to spend 90% of class time workshopping others. It is nice to have a reason to write every week though.",
    "Intro to Verse Writing is a more challenging class than you'd expect. Be ready to take your work and your improvement into your own hands. Louise Gl\u00fcck is a difficult critic to please, but you can really learn a lot from her if you work hard to improve. Sometimes in-class time can feel a little random given the discussion dynamic of your class; especially if everyone is opinionated, but disagrees... Take advantage of Louise Gl\u00fcck as a resource and her incredible fountain of knowledge. Sign up for conferences with her-these are very helpful! Like any creative writing class, if you get in, take it! They are always rewarding, interesting, and so different than other classes you take at Yale!",
    "A truly excellent course. Gluck is an expert critic who relates to each of her students in a unique way; she knows what kind of feedback each individual needs, and seems to expend time and effort on every poem that crosses her desk. She will not force you to write any specific type of poem, but will instead identify and excavate the strengths of your own writing. The classes themselves (workshops) can run a little long, and discussion among students can flag - but they're worth it for Gluck's pronouncements, which emanate from a deeply held philosophy about the nature of creativity.",
    "Basically, you write a poem a week, and each week three poems are selected for a class critique. I recommend this class, because I think it is incredible to have the world of poetry opened up to you-- it's an abyss. At the same time, be sure you feel ready and mature to take this class, because it is not easy.",
    "Yes, I would. It can be hard to measure the value of a creative writing class against a more traditional English seminar, but Louise is a wonderful teacher, and you end up learning a lot.",
    "We were assigned to write or revise one poem per week and had a workshop each week where we discussed three student-written poems. What you get out of the class is symmetric to what you give. It wouldn't be difficult to write lackluster poems and feel on top of your work (though your poems would likely not make an appearance during workshops), but if you put in the effort this class can have an amazing impact on your writing. I would strongly recommend this class to anyone that is interested in writing poetry.",
    "A fantastic course. My favorite English class so far. The class discussions were great...the critiques are not too harsh (despite some rumors before I came to class) and they are really interesting. I am more excited about reading and writing poetry after this class. I didn't agree with everything Gluck said about my (and other people's) poetry, but she helped me look at my writing in a new way, and it was an honor to be in her class, and very helpful as a writer.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS IF YOU GET IN!!!!!"
