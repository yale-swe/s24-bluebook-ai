   "comments": [
    "It's a perfect class for the aspirational oil-driller, not only because we drill conjugations, but because Costya's knowledge and expertise can weather any blow of your BS. The teaching staff's total non-emphasis on discipline made for an adult community of learning rather than a redux of those dreary high school language courses where your French teacher breaks down and accidentally drops his toupee.",
    "YEZZZ just take it",
    "Take this class! That is, if you're reading this review, you probably have some obscure, specific reason to learn Russian -- I would imagine any course evaluation is pretty secondary to That Reason. Take the class. You'll learn Russian and Russian's a crazy, lovely language.",
    "If you want to learn Russian, take this class. It's one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale, and I will remember it for many years to come.",
    "Yes, if you plan to pursue a Russian-related project immediately after the class",
    "Slightly harder than the first semester of Intensive Russian. A word of advice: on the one hand, your homework doesn't count for much of your grade. On the other hand, it might have a lot to do with your proficiency. In general, I'm not completely convinced that the intensive route is the best way to learn the language, but if you've already started, you might as well stick with it. Kostya (Constantine) is great and funny, but your experience will also be defined by your TA, who you spend more time with.",
    "If you want to learn Russian, do the intensive track! It is a very doable workload and, as professor Muravnik says, Russian is one of the languages where intensive learning is the only way.",
    "I would highly recommend RUSS 145 to another student, because it has the best teachers in it.",
    "An unusual but incredible experience. Take it for sure!",
    "I highly, highly recommend this course for anyone who's serious about not just learning, but understanding the Russian language. It's definitely a lot of work, but it pays off."
