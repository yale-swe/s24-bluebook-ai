    "Class is well taught and thought-provoking. It provides a introduction to many kinds of models for analyzing policies. Topics cover a wide range of topics from public health to counterterrorism. Highly recommended. A good homework group is imperative. PhD problems on the problem sets can be challenging.",
    "Just go and take it.",
    "Gives a good foundation for problem solving using simple mathematical models.",
    "I would only recommend the course if the student is going into some kind of managerial\/supervisory\/consulting\/admin role. For someone on the front lines of their work, modeling processes and systems would not be useful. The course will teach you how to analyze systems of all shapes and sizes in order to create simple mathematical models to optimize the processes being used.",
    "Take it if you are interested in public policy modeling - great discussions and application of health policies"

    "Think about how to approach problems differently",
    "It did not deepen my knowledge of my discipline, but that's no fault of the course-it's just not very relevant to my dissertation\/research.",
    "Very appropriate - only worry is how much modeling is actually adopted in the health care policy and administration profession"
