   "comments": [
    "Again great course, but your Chinese will probably not see significant improvement unless you devote a lot of time to it on your own. just not enough time in class.",
    "Don't do it. Unless you're crazy about Chinese and willing to sacrifice your three or four other courses. Or you're just crazy.",
    "Yes. If you want to learn chinese and are serious about it, take it.",
    "Chinese 151 is a great continuation of a summer in Beijing on Light fellowship. At first I was frustrated by how weak my speech seemed to get with (comparatively) few opportunities for speech, but I realized this was because I learned so many more advanced concepts and vocab. If you're on the fence about continuing Chinese, absolutely take it with Li Laoshi and Wang Laoshi, it's worth it.",
    "A continuation of 151. Take the course. You might as well finish off the year, and it's easier than first semester (you get used to the structure of the course and its expections) with more interesting material. I felt this semester was a lot more meaningful. You finish with a sense of accomplishment, as material from the first semester (which at the time seemed overwhelming) has had time to sink in. Still few opportunities to speak, but your Chinese will degrade further if you don't take this class.",
    "It's a good class but a lot of work. There are tons of graded assignments which can either be really good for your grade or really bad (those 6's on quizzes really add up). Also, the policies are extremely strict in terms of attendance and grades, but it seems like most people come out with pretty high grades anyway - since this class is full of over-acheivers!I would say the hardest part can be the weekly essay, that really can take a long time if you try to use all of the vocab and grammar structures. Other than that, the work is manageable. This class is basically the same as 150, the fall term, but with a lot more difficult grammar...",
    "Yes. If you completed 150, you'll have pretty much the same workload.",
    "This is a great class. If you are ready to work a lot, take it! But beware, it is a LOT harder than last semester, so be ready to work twice as hard for the same grades...",
    "150 but harder.",
    "Chinese 151 is an intensive course, helpful for sustaining one's Chinese after returning from a language program in China. I can imagine that it would be rather difficult for a student who has had no intensive in-China Chinese experience. Be prepared to work a lot, particularly on Monday and Tuesday nights.",
    "yes. i am particularly grateful for the chance to practice my newspaper chinese.",
    "Chinese 151 builds on everything from Chinese 150. The topics are more interesting and broader than 150, and include movies, the economy, newspaper articles and literature. It made studying Chinese more interesting and even enjoyable.",
    "If you have made it this far go ahead and do it. Jia You!",
    "Take it--its a great third year course. You'll learn a lot. The work is typical for Chinese.",
    "If you want to keep learning Chinese at this point, there is no reason not to take this course. It is fun. It is good. The workload is tough, but not too bad. And the teachers are absolutely great. You learn Chinese, and you learn a lot about China as well because the textbook incorporates many aspects of Chinese society into the weekly lessons. No complaints.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you want to become proficient in mandarin this is a great class to take. It really improves your vocabulary and understanding of grammar. After taking this class you will be able to read a lot of newspaper articles and well on your way to fluency.",
    "You learn a lot of relevant vocabulary and grammar, but its really hard to keep up your fluency if you are coming back from the Light Fellowship. Class sizes are generally too large for you to speak very often.",
    "Pretty good Chinese course. It's the only one at this level so there really isn't an option.",
    "As long as you realize that after coming back from a summer in China, your Chinese is not going to improve at the same rate in this class.It's a good class and we touch up on a lot of useful topics. But don't expect to have a lot of opportunities to speak in class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Chinese 151 to another student.",
    "Great class! If you've taken the first semester with li and wang laoshi, you'll know what to expect. If you haven't, you'll find that the material is sometimes based on stuff you wouldn't even say in English, but in general a very good course.",
    "A must take Chinese course at Yale. It is a lot of work (1-2 hours per night), but it is definitely worth it and your Chinese WILL improve. The instructors are both great and they care a lot about the students.",
    "Chinese 151 is very similar in format to Chinese 150, but the lesson content focuses more abstractly on government, the arts, and media. The vocabulary and lesson content are considerably more difficult and I found that I had more trouble with this semester than the last. The class is capably taught and recommended if the student has the appropriate interest, preparation, and willingness to study a lot of Chinese.",
    "Take it. Even if you've spent the summer in Beijing, this course will help you strengthen what you've learned over summer and teach you how to apply your skills practically.",
    "I'm glad I took this class. People complain that Chinese is a lot of work but that's actually not true. You memorize new words just on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, then after that the homework for the rest of the weak is pretty lax. The two teachers are also wonderful people. Only reservation about this class is that there's not that much speaking opportunities. The class focuses more on reading and writing.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student ifthey were serious in Chinese. Although it is a lot of fun, it is also hard work and takes a lot of time. That said, the professors are excellent and you are bound to make a lot of improvement.",
    "I highly recommend Chinese 151, especially after the Fall term (Chinese 150), because the material covered, though generally more challenging, was so much more practical and useful in a day-to-day setting. For example, we learned how to read newspaper articles, and learned business language.",
    "CHNS L5 is a great course, I highly recommend it to any students considering continuing their Chinese work atYale.",
    "Yes, if you plan to continue pursuing your Chinese proficiency level.",
    "This semester, like the last, is all about building vocabulary, and to a lesser extent grammar\/sentence patterns. It culminates with the last two lessons in a push to prepare studentsto read basic news reports; this effort is not entirely successful, but does open the door for further self-directed work on that goal.Definitely take this class if 1) you are prepared to put the work in (2.5 hours a night for me with a day off on Friday, though I'm on the slower side where Chinese is concerned), and 2) you recognize that you will still not be proficient in Chinese at the end of it (if that is your goal, some plans to continue studying should be considered).",
    "I think in Chinese 151 (and 150) I gained the most conversational fluency. While it doesn't seem to progress as fast as the first year of Chinese, looking back I made a lot of progress.",
    "Chinese, Chinese, Chinese. Yes, the workload is great and will demand your other classes be put on the side. Yes, you will learn over a thousand characters, which will be hard to remember for the tests, since many of them are obscure and not practical in your spoken Chinese. Yes, how the oral tests work needs improvement. And yes, the classes are fairly large and your Chinese improvements won't be as noticeable as if you spent time in China. The teachers, however, were always enthusiastic and ran good sections, and the lessons were much more interesting than last semester, especially the unit on Chinese directors and the film Huozhe."
