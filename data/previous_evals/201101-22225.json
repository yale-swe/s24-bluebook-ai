    "It depends on what you're interested in. If you tend to read a lot of neurological studies and want to know more about how exactly they are conducted, this is a great class for you. If you're trying to fulfill your linguistics depth requirement in neurolinguistics\/langage and brain, this is a pretty painless way to do it.",
    "Tough class conceptually in a lot of ways. It was early in the morning and hard for me to stay awake, so I struggled to understand\/retain some of what we were discussing. Einar is great though, he's really willing to help you if you don't understand. Not too much work, a good 5th class I would say. Shame it doesn't count for any of the distributional requirements.",
    "Take it if your interested in the brain, psych, or linguistics! It covers very useful material and provides you with a greater understanding of the technologies that you read about all the time.",
    "The class pretty much is what it says it is--you learn about different ways to collect brain imaging data, with a focus on fMRI and MEG data, and some of the difficulties involving in data collection. The first classes are a bit dry, but it gets interesting towards the end and isn't a ton of work, although it's not a gut either. Prof. Mencl is very nice and accessible."
