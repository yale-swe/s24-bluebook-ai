    "Learning basic Mandarin, learning 300 characters (as said by the syllabus). An incredible amount of pronunciation, grammar, sentence structure. It's really amazing how much we learned in one semester.",
    "I learned basic Chinese listening, speaking, writing, and reading skills. If you try hard and go every day you really learn some!",
    "Course was effective in teaching the Chinese language.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the chinese language and a strong foundation to base further study upon.",
    "Basic Chinese, speaking, characters, etc.",
    "I did not have any experience with the Chinese language before this class. This class helped me significantly increase my knowledge of the Chinese language -- reading, writing, speaking, and listening.",
    "All in Chinese language",
    "I learned a lot of Chinese"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This Chinese class was, for me, so fun and so rewarding. I know actually a lot more Chinese (Mandarin) than I thought I would know by the end when I started this class. Prof. Zhang is so supportive and so nice. He's really the best. If there's any weakness, it is the constant work, but that should be a given with any language course.",
    "This class is generally well structured, forcing you to speak every day and allowing you one-on-one time with a tutor every week! However, sometimes the characters to memorize don't quite match up with the lessons which is hard.",
    "The course was very strong in drilling and practice, but I could be improved if there was more practice in the speaking component.",
    "The engagement and support from the faculty is a true strength in this course. One drawback is the work load. While it was instrumental in foster growth in the language, I believe the not having homework one day of the week will lighten the load.",
    "Covers a ton in one semester - during the final I was genuinely shocked by how much I knew! The converse of that is also that its really hard when you have a tough day or week to stay on top of Chinese. I get that its what you need to do in order to learn such a tough language, but still, a very tough workload.",
    "I think it would be better if students had more than one meeting per week with their Chinese tutor -- or if they at least had more opportunities to practice Chinese with someone who could correct their mistakes.",
    "It was actually a little too intense to take while taking other courses. I took different language courses but Chinese was twice as intense.. but I guess thats why I could improve my Chinese so much",
    "My professor was incredible. I really wish I was informed more about the work that was due. I didn't do any of the online homework until halfway through the semester, because I had no clue we had online homework as it was not through Canvas and we were never emailed about it."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!! Especially if you love language learning and\/or have an interest in learning East Asian languages. Chinese is really foundational for both Korean and Japanese. It was so fun and was definitely one of my favorite experiences at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course! It's fun to not know ANYTHING in a class for once. However, I'd only recommend it if you really want to learn Chinese, as it really does take a LOT of time and effort to learn the language well. Chinese has no verb conjugations so it's all memorization of vocab and grammar structures which felt a little whack to me but you know it depends on what's your jam",
    "Yes, the course is well structured and the instructors are willing to assist in the learning process.",
    "Yes. For someone who wants to peruse Chinese this course is a great start.",
    "Yes. But that's me personally - I think that many more Americans just need to learn Chinese, even though it feels like its impossible",
    "Yes. The class is well structured to help committed students learn Chinese at a significant level -- and pace.",
    "Yes! The professor was incredible, and I feel like I learned a lot."
