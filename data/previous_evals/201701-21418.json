   "comments": [
    "If you're taking this class, you've already read Paradise Lost--but you'll learn so much by reading it again (and again...and again). As DSK says, and it's true: Milton makes you smarter.",
    "This class taught me a lot about reading and reading slowly. It was an amazing capstone to my senior year.",
    "I became a much better reader of poetry and learned how to hold sustained and challenged interest in a piece of literature",
    "I learned how to read (again, and for the future) the greatest English language poem of all time.",
    "I would say I got some more experience thinking flexibly about John Milton's Paradise Lost.",
    "No single course at Yale has delved as deeply into a single work of literature - a very important read for any English major, at that - like Professor Kastan's \"Milton's Paradise Lost.\" This is not a course to be taken lightly - the workload may seem light, but the intellectual challenge of the work is great - you'll change the way you look at the world after taking in some of Professor Kastan's manic glossing assignments. If you're up for the challenge and up for a highly rewarding, enjoyable end to senior year delving into a *dense* (doesn't begin to characterize PL) poem, take it and have fun with it. Reach out to Professor Kastan, who is an excellent resource on all things Milton."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved the course for its laser-like focus on PL--it's lovely to have the semester to luxuriously make one's way through the poem at the rate of about a book a week. I sometimes wished we could have spent more time on Milton's prose and the secondary critical readings, but possibly this would have undermined that sense of semi-monastic, obsessive focus? And perhaps people are already getting that broader perspective in the lecture course with John Rogers? So it's hard to pinpoint a weakness; I do think it could be interesting to open up the course a bit--to other readings (historical and contemporary), and to other Milton writings--but wouldn't want to lose the attention to detail allowed by that slow, granular reading of the poem.",
    "The strengths of this course were being able to focus on one single book for an entire semester, and working with Professor Kastan, who's brilliant and knowledgeable. I left every week feeling like I had gained some really valuable knowledge.",
    "Spending the whole semester on Paradise Lost was a delight and, I'm convinced, the only way to read the poem. Although Milton's text bears the load of such heavy scrutiny perhaps uniquely well, I'd love to see more classes try something like this. There's something lost in classes that practice only fast reading, I think.",
    "The main strength is the chance to dive deeply into Paradise Lost and spend 13 weeks trying to unpack its complexities. I've never been in another English course that has allowed me to practice my reading skills so thoroughly",
    "It's Paradise Lost. If you've read it at least once or twice before (but preferably more) you will become even more obsessed than you should already be upon taking it. Either the best or second best class I've ever taken.",
    "It might have been nice to have a more systematic approach to the class. But in general I liked it.",
    "This course is great in that David Kastan is brilliant and wonderful to listen to, but I think it could be improved with a little more structured student conversation.",
    "To be honest, Professor Kastan has taught this class for such a long time that he's pretty much mastered the thoughtful syllabus-prep and assignments. At the same time, a course that only covers one poem is simple to structure - reading a book a week. Yet the discussion with Professor Kastan, picking his brain for all of the insights he's gathered from many years of reading and working through this poem, are really special. I would say to him that he's doing a great job with the course and it can be enjoyed by any seasoned reader who is willing to engage with Paradise Lost for hours and hours."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take it when it's offered again! The workload is very reasonable: at a book of Paradise Lost a week, it's more about attention and perceptiveness than plowing through volumes of text. David Kastan is a wonderful discussion leader, and it's bound to be an interesting group of people drawn to this material--our seminar was really warm and smart, and I can't imagine this would be vastly different in another year.",
    "Yes, for any English major who's already read the book. If you hadn't it might have been a bit challenging.",
    "Of course, if only for the chance to study with Professor Kastan. A nicer, kinder, more questioning man has never taught at Yale.",
    "A fantastic senior semesterrelaxed yet endlessly interesting, and a great distraction from the impending doom of real life. Kastan is funny, warm, and perceptive. Take it!",
    "If you are really interested in the intense work of really understanding (or at least understanding how you don't understand) a work of literature then this is a great class for that",
    "Absolutely. It's the greatest poem in the English language.",
    "Good class if you like Paradise Lost, probably wouldn't be very much fun otherwise. Professor Kastan is very personable and of course smart.",
    "Very relaxed senior English seminar. Enjoyable, Prof Kastan is an entertaining and engaging class leader.",
    "This is a great course for anyone who is looking to understand Milton on a deeper level. It's wonderful to devote an entire class to a single book, though even one semester feels like too little time to spend on this poem.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you are prepared for the challenge. Professor Kastan is one of a kind and has some of the most interesting insights on Paradise Lost, gathered over many runs at reading through it and grappling with Milton's art. Do not misjudge the *light* workload - you may have to read each Book multiple times to gather substantive points for discussion, because you'll be expected to be familiar with the poem and its basics as a given. Getting to what's underneath that surface-level reading is what this seminar is all about. Senior English majors, take it!"
