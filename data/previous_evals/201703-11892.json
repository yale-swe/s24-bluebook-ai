   "comments": [
    "I developed a thorough understanding of political philosophy over time and the arguments constructed by various influential philosophers. I developed my ability to analyze and formulate complex arguments.",
    "Developed knowledge of political philosophy canon. Developed philosophical writing skills.",
    "I had essentially no understanding of philosophy (political or otherwise) going into this course, and I felt that I had developed a much stronger understanding by the time it ended. I learned a lot of useful terminology and we covered a massive amount of ground incredibly efficiently. I feel like my knowledge base has expanded substantially as a result of this class.",
    "A survey of Western political philosophy from Plato to Rawls, with more a bit more in-depth treatment of Hobbes, Marx, and Rawls. Insights into not only the political ideas of these authors, but also to a little bit of moral philosophy, philosophy of history, and meta-physics,",
    "This course was truly wonderful. I gained a tremendous framework for understanding different political philosophies. More than anything, I believe this course gave me analytical thinking tools which are rigorous and will enable me to think about a wide variety of contemporary issues.",
    "The ability to write a philosophical essay and summarize complex texts.",
    "Philosophical writing and analysis",
    "I learned so much about Western political philosophy.",
    "I learned as the course suggested the overarching canon of political philosophy from ancient times to present. I was forced to confront my own political upbringing and its underlying moral code and the rational behind it.",
    "I learned how to evaluate philosophical arguments and how to sift through a large amount of material quickly."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course covered a very ambitious quantity of material in an effective manner. I felt that more an additional lecture devoted to the Greek philosophers would have been appropriate, with perhaps slightly less time spent on Rawls. Some of the readings seemed slightly tangential or unnecessary(some Kant, Hegel) but most ( ~90%) were valuable.",
    "Lectures were good. Essay topics felt relevant, but the final questions seemed somewhat arbitrary.",
    "I thought most of this course was very strong. The reading was interesting and engaging, the lectures were great. The one thing I wish had been a little different was preparation for the final. We weren't given a clear idea of how it worked and that made it a little more difficult to study we could review the material but we couldn't really practice specific skills. Other than that, nothing in particular was a problem.",
    "The course provides a very extensive overview for the interested student and provides rich opportunities for developing original thought. Professor Pogge is very liberal when it comes to the ideas for your papers, and will discuss your ideas at length regardless of whether they are very abstract or more practical. Weakness: covering 11 authors in one term is an incredibly ambitious goal on its own, but I thought that this challenge was made even more daunting by the way in which Professor Pogge decided to broach many aspects beyond just *political* philosophy. Sure, it makes sense that one needs familiarity with Kants moral philosophy to understand his political ideas, but by covering so many different philosophical topics, theres a risk of not providing a fully comprehensible account of either.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Pogge himself. He's a wonderful professor and incredibly engaging.",
    "Strengths include the level of engagement one has with the professor and the skills attained from the constant assignments and expected participation. We also didn't have a TA and a small class so we were able to engage directly with the Professor himself. Weaknesses include its broad assignments- for example, for our writing assignments we had to formulate our own topics ( with guidance if needed), however I believe those were really high expectations for an intro political philosophy class.",
    "I found the reading list to be overly ambitious. It seemed that most students did not complete the readings. I think it would be more productive to assign a narrower part of the text, rather than a 400 word book for one week.",
    "Instruction in material is poor and hard to understand. Final exam is also not good way to test students",
    "The lectures are fantastic and the readings are great. However, the course could be improved by having a section even for the small class to help reinforce the material.",
    "I would suggest that the professor explain a little more the format of a philosophical paper in class. Sometimes with some of the essays where we had to essentially prompt ourselves, I felt a little lost both in content and in format. I also wish there had been a section where we could ask question of either the professor or a TA\/TF and have a more open discussion.",
    "Other than the two lectures per week, my engagement with this class was very low. I felt like I did not glean as much from the material as I could have."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I felt this class to be incredibly informative experience which facilitated great development of my analytical abilities and knowledge of philosophy.",
    "Probably not, unless they really wanted to read many political philosophy texts with minimum other workload.",
    "I would. The lectures are great and easy to understand. Even if you don't have much of a background in philosophy, you can learn a lot about numerous authors in very little time. Though there's a lot of reading, if you pace yourself it's totally manageable, and the other assignments (like essays) are not particularly burdensome. I would really recommend this class.",
    "I would absolutely 110% recommend this course to another student if Professor Pogge is teaching it. There's probably not another course where the teacher will be so dedicated. I handed in a 10-page midterm paper, and he returned it with a full page of comments in less than a day.",
    "Yes, especially if you want to learn about influential western thinkers and improve your writing.",
    "You should try reading some political philosophy texts before taking this class. I am interested in politics and in philosophy, so naturally I thought that I would like this course. Ultimately, and too late, I found that I wasn't very interested in the material covered in the class.",
    "No, only take if required",
    "Yes, this class really teaches you a lot and challenges you to write papers in the philosophy style. I felt like I became a lot smarter and a much better thinker after having taken the course.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who is deeply interested in philosophy and would like to explore the more specific field of political philosophy."
