    "Gut.",
    "Take the class",
    "YES! I would 100% take it. Not only because it is something unique in Yale's many classes (talking about food in a gender context) but because you will probably leave the course a better person. I learned so much about housework, food history, and women in the kitchen that is useful to know to be a conscious and considerate human being (whether male or female). A really fantastic course!",
    "Yes. Lecture is unnecessary, section is enjoyable, and the 4 papers are short (5 pages) and easy to write. For the first one you give the history of a foodstuff (anything you want), for the second you analyze a cookbook, thirdly you analyze some kitchen\/agriculture photographs\/art, and for the fourth you interview a woman about her relationship to food. Basically, all the papers are fairly open ended cuz you're essentially choosing what you want to write about, and they are kind of interesting. Take this class.",
    "I would recommend it if you want an A-, but if you're like me an you take guts in order to get a straight A, it's impossible (unless you're a girl, because then it's less obvious you're taking it as a gut).",
    "Definitely.",
    "Great class for people who have never taken a WGSS class before. A small background in feminist ideas would be helpful but not pertinent. Only 4 small papers and a section grade.",
    "Interesting class. The work load is very light so take it if you want to learn about the material and want a relatively easy class. Easy to get a B+\/A-, hard to get an A.",
    "minimal work, fun essays to write. four 5-pagers, that's it.",
    "This class is not difficult, but it is fun and you learn a lot. I would recommend it to others.",
    "It's an okay class, not wonderful. The four papers are creative, and not too difficult. You'll start the class very excited, and end up underwhelmed. If you're just looking for a paper-writing class, this one is fine, but I'd search for a course you'd actually enjoy first.",
    "YES.",
    "You know whether you should take this or not. It's very easy, with interesting assignments, and there's virtually no accountability for anything besides the essays, which, as I said, are interesting. I don't know if the readings are interesting because I didn't do them. I actually did go to a fair amount of lectures (more than is responsible) because I felt guilty about it, and they're largely unhelpful, not nuanced, and provide superficial analysis of the topics we deal with. I am all for food studies as an academic pursuit, but I think this course would work better if it focused on history, or sociology, or something. Now, it's too interdisciplinary to matter, which is good if you want an essay course (that also, it bears mentioning, involves some eating).",
    "Easy credit and a good intro to WGSS!",
    "Take it. It covers really cool stuff you're just not going to learn about in any other course.",
    "This class was enjoyable to participate in, but wasn't taken very seriously in general. I would recommend to take it if a class is needed to balance a schedule.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Engaging and interesting. Enabled me to gain a new perspective on a lot of feministic issues. definitely recommend it",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others. It is a very light-load course and is very interesting.",
    "Wonderful, relaxing, a great 5th class to take if you want to sit back and breathe during class, instead of stress.",
    "This class is pretty interesting. Lectures can get boring sometimes. I would recommend it though.",
    "Take it! Really interesting class and it's only 4 5-page papers. EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student!",
    "looking at the interplay between women, the food we eat and the cultures we live in through a multidisciplinary approach.",
    "If you are looking for a gut class and have no background in food: take this class. If you have a sincere interest in food and already have taken any other food class at Yale: don't bother. There is very little new material here for you; you'll spend the first month wondering when the gender studies part is gonna start.",
    "I would recommend the class as it is different from all other classes at Yale.",
    "I loved it - you should take it!",
    "It is a great class. There is not too much reading each week, no tests, and five interesting (creative) essays. Section was my favorite part of each week because the discussions were so fascinating and my TA was fun and created a very relaxed environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a venue for engagement with the sort of issues that are often sidelined at Yale, and readings are relevant and stimulating.",
    "This is a gut. 5 papers. Need to show up to section. Lectures have nothing to do with section, which in turn has little to do with assignments. No final exam. Easy So credit, relatively interesting. Section is a joke.",
    "It is a good class and the work load is nothing to be afraid of.",
    "Low workload, biased TA, very judgemental TA, easy class. Would recommend for someone who has a high workload in other classes.",
    "You learn a fair bit but more importantly you become aware of more gender \"norms\" that exist in society. You'll definitely gain some new perspective.",
    "Yeah--great papers, interesting information.",
    "low workload. different focus. mainly writing",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. Some people call it a gut class. The workload isn't that heavy but the mental strain on how frustrating and random the topics discussed are is.",
    "definitely!!",
    "The course is exactly what the title suggests, combines women food and culture and talks about its applications. I would recommend it as a fifth class, not too much work and fairly interesting.",
    "Interesting class that covers topics that you may not cover in other classes. Take if you are interested in learning about the themes mentioned in the syllabus. Some of the papers were really fun to write also!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Fun, not too much work, and really interesting!",
    "Women, Food, and Culture wound up being one of my favorite classes this semester. Fascinating topic, very manageable workload, great section discussions. I'd say the class makeup is a hefty chunk of athletes\/bros, a small minority of super intense WGSS folk, and the rest are people (mostly girls) who like food and small lecture classes. However, everyone can find something to relate to within this class, whether it's maintaining the right diet to beat Harvard in football or delving into the cult of domesticity and the second shift.Professor Trumpler is a fascinating person and a fantastic lecturer. She once had a cheese farm, enough said. (She even brought in homemade cheeses for us to eat). She also doesn't believe in the ability of midterms to test what you know, so your entire grade is based on four 5 page essays (one a food portrait, one about a cookbook, one about photographs, and the last an interview) and section participation. My section was awesome; the TA made us pie, people brought in food every week, and we had a chocolate tasting. Readings were pretty much optional, but the books were good, so if you have a spare moment when you're not struggling with work for other classes, read 'em. Be warned, however: some TAs grade much more harshly than others. Overall, all of my friends were jealous that they didn't take this class with me.",
    "A great introductory course and if it is made into a writing credit a must take.",
    "If you like writing and you're looking for a low key, low stress class, absolutely take Women, Food and Culture. The assignments consist of four five page papers, all of which are relatively flexible. Going to lecture is basically optional, as there is no midterm or final and the papers aren't really based on the material, and sections are basically conservations about your own relationships and upbringing with food. Definitely take it if you have a heavy courseload and need a breather in one of your classes.",
    "This is a very enjoyable class. Don't take it if you aren't interested in the topic--it's more fun for everyone if those in discussion are all engaged by the material. If you are interested, you'll find that the readings are pleasant break from the rest of your homework, the papers are a fun excuse to get creative, and the lectures aren't 50 minutes to be suffered through, but a rare opportunity to sit back and learn in a stress-free way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was probably the least stressful class I've taken at Yale. It covers some very important topics and the papers are actually fun to write (well, 3 of the 4 were). I never felt overwhelmed by the work but I still felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Easy. Lecture is entirely optional. Truly the gut-iest of guts.",
    "Yes, there are some interesting topics and very minimal work. Plus you get to eat a lot!",
    "Take this class! Even if you're not a woman, or if you don't eat food, or if you don't feel particularly cultured: WGSS 120 addresses all of these topics, and will make you think about them differently. It's a great interdisciplinary class, and leaves you feeling like you really know something about a variety of fields.",
    "This class was a really relaxed, interesting way to learn about topics and issues that I previously had little to no experience with. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a fun, interesting 5th class.",
    "I would reccomend this course to another student. This course is good for anyone interested in women or food. I learned a lot about food in general, and I am glad that I took the course.",
    "take it. Easy class, optional lecture, interesting topic.",
    "Awesome 5th class. Lectures are interesting, but you don't really have to go because you're not responsible for lecture material. That being said, I regret not going very often because I would have gotten more out of the class. 4 5-page, fairly open-ended assignments.",
    "I would recommend Women, Food and Culture because it offers an interesting perspective about the topic that you may not have considered prior to the class. The papers are all very interesting and force you to look at gender and women in society from a new angle- for example: the cookbook paper and the photography paper. Since your grade is based on 4 papers and section participation, you do not have the pressure of memorizing facts from lecture and its really a class where you can learn and reflect in your papers.",
    "This class has a lot less women\/gender studies than I was expecting. The class just kind of gives you a bunch of random knowledge about various foods and some kind of obvious stuff about complexes between women and food. Pretty easy, but not all that substantive if you've already been exposed to a lot of WGSS stuff.",
    "I would recommend it. The papers and easy and interesting. Lectures are engaging. Section is hit or miss so choose wisely, not just the TA but the people in the section.",
    "This is a GREAT class, everyone should take it. Lectures are really fun because you don't actually get tested on it but I never missed a single one because they were all so interesting. Trumpler is a great lecturer and knows so much about the topic...you learn a lot of really interesting perspectives behind food and have a chance to talk about them. Not a lot of work, good class to add just for fun.",
    "Women, Food, And Culture is a great class. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning a historical perspective of food from a woman's point of view. Its fascinating for sure, and lectures are not necessary to attend, though highly encouraged. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who enjoys quality lecturing, engaging sections, and a very doable amount of work\/readings.",
    "Take this class if you want to eat food in class and get an education in something that is extremely relevant to everyone's lives. The lectures were a little boring but in section I got to eat fancy cheese and see some bros come extremely close to finding their feminist consciousnesses, which was priceless.",
    "interdisciplinary look at issues relating to women and food - very relevant to current feminist and food movements.",
    "Good course",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to gain a greater knowledge of the culture of women in our society",
    "Women, Food and Culture--is exactly what the name states--but wraps these three topics up in to one fantastic course. It is amazing how interwoven the topics are in life, and the course will teach you to examine the world around you and every day decisions from a totally different perspective.",
    "Definitely!! This is a class everyone should take regardless of your major!",
    "Pleasant and not at all rigorous: you write four extremely enjoyable, creative papers. The material was not as fascinating as I hoped it would be -- like many interdisciplinary, topically-grouped classes, it sacrifices depth for breadth -- but I imagine it would be possible to dive more deeply into the course if you want more out of it than a SO. Professor Trumpler is a brilliant woman who makes wonderful cheese."
