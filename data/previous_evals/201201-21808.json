    "yes, it was awesome to have professor Thachil as a teacher",
    "Take it, but you need to be willing to critically examine the readings. You can't come to class unprepared, so be ready to put in a couple of hours each week reading the pieces assigned closely. If you do that, you should be set!",
    "Lots of reading, high level discussion, but well worth taking!",
    "Take this class if you are interested in India - democracy and development. It is one of the best classes i've taken at Yale.",
    "Very interesting class! Would recommend it to those interested. But be prepared to talk a lot in class. It's hard to get by without doing the readings.",
    "YES! This was one of the best South Asian Studies classes I have taken. The strengths are an amazing professor who really provides pushback and shapes discussion. The syllabus is also airtight with very specific themes. The assignments are manageable and not busy work--only 3! You cover themes from gender and equality to the military to colonial development to initial conditions for growth!",
    "Yes, take it! Awesome seminar about development, South Asia, the link between growth and development, colonial factors in development. It's actually an extremely comprehensive class, and overall you don't need to know much or anything about the region to know what's going on. Professor Thachil is probably one of the best professors at Yale, and though his grading can feel tough, he really does care about improving your critical thinking skills and arguments. The reading and workload are very, very manageable, and participation is key to succeeding. Though, because Prof. Thachil is so welcoming and encouraging, you will have no problem speaking up in class. Really, just take it.",
    "A good introduction to issues surrounding development in a South Asian context. Take it if you're interested in development from a political-economy perspective and if you want to learn more about processes of development in India\/Pakistan\/Bangladesh. Don't take it if you're looking for a rigorous quant-based course (this is why it's in poli sci, not econ).",
    "Absolutely take this, whether you have an interest in the subject or not. Professor Thachil is wonderful. The two hours fly by each week because the discussions are so interesting. And you'll learn a ton.",
    "This is an excellent class for those looking to study development in any country because it really targets some of the key issues that come up in relation to economic growth, institutions, democracy, etc. It uses India as its mean case study which is excellent because you really get to know one area very well while being able to compare it to other relatable countries sprinkled throughout the course."
