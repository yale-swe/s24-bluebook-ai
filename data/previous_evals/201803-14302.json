    "I learned about Marxist theory of revolution and the philosophy of nonviolence through reading a variety of 20th century thinkers such as Lenin, Luxemburg, Sorel, Weber, Gandhi, and MLK.",
    "Not sure. I expected a lot from the class, but after taking it, I'm left wanting.",
    "I gained knowledge of how different theorists have interpreted Marxist thought for social revolutionary action, criticisms of political action, tensions between the use of violence and nonviolence, and the like.",
    "This class provided me with an overview of how political philosophers thought about revolution and civil disobedience throughout the twentieth-century. We read them in roughly chronological order so I developed an understanding of how political thought evolved over time. This was the first political philosophy class I had taken, so personally I learned a lot about how to write a political theory paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are its enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor and its fascinating texts written by influential Marxist and nonviolent thinkers. One weakness of this course is that class discussions are sometimes unbalanced, with either too much or too little student participation.",
    "The readings were cool. Weaknesses include the extent to how little students were allowed to engage with the material outside of discussions and presentations. I wish there would have been something more. Also, I would have liked to see clearer feedback about assignments in a more timely manner.",
    "The course presents students with an incredible array of texts to read and analyze. The syllabus is constructed so students have the chance to see how different theorists build off of, responded to, and critiqued one another. With a wide array of schools of thought, the syllabus critically challenges students to draw connections between different texts and always allowed for fruitful discussion. The seminar format worked perfectly for discussion purposes.",
    "I loved the exclusive focus on primary texts and Professor Mantena is incredibly smart and kind. However, the structure of the class, where four pre-selected students would answer assigned classes, left frustratingly little time for real debates or conversations between the class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the theory of violent and nonviolent political action and excited to read texts from influential thinkers of the 20th century.",
    "I wouldn't. It's not worth your time.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to other students. If you're at all interested in social-revolutionary political thought, Marxism, and\/or any of the thinkers on the syllabus, I would highly recommend the course. Professor Mantena has an incredible knowledge of each of the texts you'll read and raises the standard for in class discussion. If you do prefer somewhat more organic conversation, I would just warn that class discussion is usually centered around questions she sends out in advance. I appreciated the questions as it helped me narrow my reading focus, but I know some students prefer to have their discussion be more open ended. This isn't to say that Professor Mantena won't answer or take seriously any question you do raise, but it does mean that discussion is already more or less set up by the time you get to class.",
    "If you are interested in political action, it is truly fascinating to read all of these intellectuals. That being said, the course could be organized in a more engaging way. Professor Mantena is also truly wonderful."
