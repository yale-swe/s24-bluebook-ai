   "comments": [
    "It's a fantastic class for anyone who is not very familiar with calculus \/ needs some review of math before moving on to the higher-level math courses at Yale. It has been incredibly helpful to me.",
    "I'm not sure if it will be offered again but if it is I would recommend it beyond a shadow of a doubt.",
    "It's math without the headache that usually comes with math. Take it. Take it before it's too late. Seriously, the only thing I really like doing is reading books and I didn't dislike this class. That is saying A LOT.",
    "It was an absolute amazing course Frame is a legend and I'm glad I took the course!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that might be a little scared by math. I thought it was a little easy in the beginning, but it began to pick up and I found myself thinking about the concepts often outside of class. Really recommend it!",
    "A math class for people who are bad at math. Definitely take it if you need to get a QR out of the way. You just might learn something!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a great way to learn how applicable math is in nature. Very interesting course.",
    "Math 101 is a great class that introduces students who did not take higher level math classes, to interesting concepts in math and geometry that are easily accessible.",
    "To summarize: Math 101 is a fascinating, accessible, manageable math course for those without calculus experience and often those not on the track of a mathematics-based major, and the professor is wonderful.",
    "Highly recommend to anyone, mathy or not.",
    "Math 101 is a great class that I would recommend especially to people to whom math is not intuitive. We learned how to apply geometry to many different features in nature. I also learned a lot of fun math history (some of it is gruesome) and of course cheesy jokes."
