    "I would definitely recommend this course to any serious musician wishing to continue performance study. Obviously, a significant amount of outside practice is necessary, but you definitely get out what you put in. My instructor was very skilled and working with her has been a fantastic experience; I feel we have gotten to know each other well on both a musical and personal level.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is nice to get credit for taking lessons.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any violinist who wants the best instruction from the best teachers and professors. My professor was able to fix all of the problems I was struggling to fix for years in less than a month, and she is incredibly encouraging and friendly."
