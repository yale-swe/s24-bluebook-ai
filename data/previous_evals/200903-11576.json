    "You pretty much have to do this if you are a Chemistry major, but even if you weren't required you would want to. You learn a ton (more than you do in lectures!), and it is all practical knowledge that is absolutely indispensable for getting you ready for graduate school. Definitely do this!! My only regret is that I did not take it in my Junior year as well."
