   "comments": [
    "The class is well summed up in its title, Shakespeare and Music. If you're interested in either of those things, I would recommend it, but if you need a very structured class, maybe not. (I think the flexibility is a nice change from some other classes.) You get to explore all different kinds of musical adaptations, linked by the familiar plots of Shakespeare. If you enjoy opera, this is definitely a great class for you-- my group even got to go to the Metropolitan opera.",
    "Fun class if you like classical music or are interested in learning more about it. Uneven workload -- usually not much, but has occasional spikes.",
    "All fans of Shakespeare should take this class, not just musicians. It offers insight into Shakespeare as he was meant to be consumed: as theater.",
    "This class is for the more musically inclined, although knowledge of music is not necessary you must have some sort of appreciation for music. Be able to discuss literary merit as well as dramatic and musical.",
    "This course was great! The workload was light, and the work we had to do was enjoyable. I would take this class every semester if I could!",
    "There is no reason you shouldn't take this class. Do whatever you have to in order to enroll. Even if you have no interest in Shakespeare or Music, the opportunities and experiences in this class are astounding (free trip to the Met, learning to play medieval instruments, reading from texts written 400+ years ago, classes held in the Elizabethan Club, &c.). I cannot emphasize this enough: This is one of the greatest classes at Yale and should be taken at any cost."
