    "I developed an understanding of the aesthetic value of Chinese painting and a growing appreciation of the different forms of scrolls. I enjoyed the course and can now identify motifs in historical paintings.",
    "Deep engagement with complex art historical sources, close viewing of scrolls and paintings, history of China told through the history of their painting tradition.",
    "I learned about critical analysis of paintings and explored the rich history of Chinese art.",
    "I learned how to analyze Chinese paintings and understand how they reflect the socioeconomic status of China at the time.",
    "Learned about chinese painting from Gu Kaizhi through the Qing Dynasty"

   "comments": [
    "The course content was incredibly interesting and I enjoyed seeing scrolls in person during trips. Those activities made me feel a deeper connection to the content of the course. I wish I had more guidance on what readers were optional and which readings we were expected to actually read. Also, I wished we had more guidance on the final essay and midterm assignments.",
    "Strengths: Small class size and personalized attention. Class becomes a community and you get very comfortable with the professor. Greatly improves your ability to engage with high level texts and to discuss ancient traditions.",
    "The topics were interesting and engaging. However, sometimes the workload was unclear in that we didnt know how mandatory the readings\/assignments were.",
    "Strengths: Provides a comprehensive introduction to Chinese art; we explored art from all dynasties, learned about different types of techniques, and contextualized the artwork, and related these pieces of artwork to modern times. Weaknesses: More guidance on the final project. It was also difficult at times to participate in discussion at the beginning because it was not made clear all students should skim the readings, not just the students who were presenting the readings.",
    "Strengths; extremely knowledgable and helpful professor, plenty of guidance for final paper weaknesses: it would be helpful if each text came with a brief description of what the focus was to make reading the texts easier i.e. (taoism in the yuan dynasty -- focus on iconography, religious background)",
    "The homework was usually not relevant to class time"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course for those interested in developing a beginning understanding of Chinese art and those who likely would want to embark into a deeper dive into chinese culture. Even for those not on a humanities track, the course provides a nice introduction to those topics.",
    "Yes. It is a fun class environment and Quincy can be really funny sometimes. Especially great when visiting the Yale art museum or Library when you get to look at paintings personally. The workload is manageable and because it is a small class, the readings are shared and the workload is balanced with your classmates. Midterm assessment is an in-class essay which can be challenging, but with strategic studying was very manageable. Final paper is long and requires a high level of intellectual and individual commitment, but was rewarding when completed.",
    "I would recommend this course because the professor is passionate about the subject and the art is interesting to examine.",
    "Yes,. I learned a lot from this course and Quincy is phenomenal!",
    "100% Quincy is a gem and the art is incredible",
    "I would only if the student was passionate about the course material."
