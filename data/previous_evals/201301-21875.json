    "It was an awesome class. You do learn a lot over the semester.",
    "No it has too much work even though it isn't a very difficult course.",
    "French 130 is a focused on reviewing some low level french literature and learning small grammar rules. In general, the class is about developing one's fluency in French, rather than learning the basics of French.",
    "Love Madame Koundi. Great professor. Good course. You know exactly what to expect. They give you great study guides to get you prepared for the tests. All of the exercises they make you do are helpful. You learn a lot of French.",
    "Very difficult, especially if listening and oral skills are your weaknesses. Besides that though, you read some very interesting books, and are totally submerged in the language.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend the class to another student because even though it is very demanding, I learned a lot."
