   "comments": [
    "A great intro to comp sci. Great for freshman.",
    "Definitely a manageable math course for those that want to get a brief, yet succinct introduction into a variety of math topics useful for CS (we covered discrete math, induction, linear algebra, number theory, logic, etc. -- each one of which could obviously not have justice done to it without taking a full course). Professor Angluin definitely makes the course manageable with her problem solving sessions and general availability, and it's definitely a good fit with another difficult CS course, such as 323.",
    "If you did competition math in middle school and high school, this course will be a breeze. Topics like combinatorics\/probability, set theory, Boolean logic, etc are covered in relatively shallow detail. Psets take max 3-4 hours and are a good balance between hard enough to be interesting and easy enough to be doable. Professor Angluin is a slow lecturer so you may find yourself nodding off. Good material, mediocre presentation.",
    "202's a pretty solid class. It's well taught, not too much work, and covers a variety of important topics (although none in much detail). Dana's a great professor that I definitely recommend going to for help since she takes an interest in all of her students' learning. Keep in mind, if you've taken a statistics class or a linear algebra class, a lot of the material will probably be review.",
    "Great survey of fields in mathematics that don't typically get covered in high school. Even for a non-computer science major I would recommend the class as a manageable way to get exposure to a lot of interesting topics.",
    "202 is pretty interesting. It's a wide survey of a bunch of different areas of Math, with emphasis on proofs. The psets are fairly difficult and take about 9-12 hours each, with one due every week. I spent a ton of time at office hours, as do many people in the class. I'd be shocked if anyone in the class was able to figure out certain problems by themselves... some require some prompting. Professor Angluin holds a problem session every Friday from 3-4pm, and I'd recommend going to that.",
    "Great introduction to discrete math if you have no experience. If looking for more of a challenge with deeper math concepts and proofs, I heard Math244 is a better experience.",
    "Mediocre teaching complemented by great resources (very good notes coupled with almost daily TA office hours). Makes the psets very doable. Exams are reasonable. No idea what the curve is like. Might be more work than you expected if you are applied math and thought this would be easy.",
    "It's a core course, so if you're CS you don't get a choice. It's a good one, though. Covers a lot of topics, but doesn't expect you to be crazy good at any of them. Chances are, depending on your math background, about half the subjects will be at least partially review, so take it easy those weeks but be ready for the things you've never seen before to hit harder. Workload is nicely consistent week-to-week, and there's a lot of help hours available.",
    "This or 244 is required so you have to take one. I don't think this was related to programming or other things in computer science. This class is a lot of proof based work in this class which I did not enjoy. Dana is good and some of the concepts are interesting.",
    "Yes, if you need it for your major. It is a nice overview of the topics. It can be challenging at points but feels worth while. The last couple of weeks feel more cursory than the others.",
    "I know nothing about the course as it has been taught previously, but Dana Angluin is a fantastically clear and helpful instructor and you will appreciate the chance to learn things from her.",
    "Honestly a really interesting class. The class is structured so you cover a new topic every one to two weeks, and so you never go into too much depth - there are always exciting new concepts to discuss. I'd never done any discrete math before and found it fascinating. The problem sets are much harder than the content in lecture\/the notes but they're always doable with some effort, and help solidify the learning.",
    "A pretty standard intro discrete math course that covers a range of topics including first-order logic, induction, graph theory, combinatorics\/probability theory, linear algebra, and so on. Definitely interesting, although if you've done a lot of math (or maybe even an above average amount) -- problems on your own time, or math team, or something of the sort-- you'll be bored and might want to consider taking the math department's discrete offering. Some pretty interesting pset problems, however... tl;dr If you're not really a math person but are doing compsci: take it. If you're a math person regardless of whether you're doing compsci: do 244 or a higher class.",
    "A fast paced and proof-based survey course for the types of math you may deal with in computer science. Mostly discrete (set\/number\/graph theory), with a dabble of linear algebra and probability at the end. Much, much easier than MATH244. Exams are easy (and very similar to the practice exams), but problem sets were tricky.",
    "I would recommend 202 over 244, if you view math as being more of part of your academics rather than the core of them, and if you haven't done any competitive math or similar things in the past. The teaching in 202 by Professor Angluin is great, and same goes for the structure of the homeworks and tests, so the course itself is a great ride.",
    "Dana is an amazing teacher! The material is also quite interesting, but covered on a somewhat superficial level due to time constraints.",
    "Dana is a superb teacher, take it with her if you can! The class moves very fast but that's the nature of the topic.",
    "Great class if you want to pursue a computer science major.",
    "A hard math based CS course. I recommend you start your assignments early for a better and smoother experience.",
    "This course is designed to introduce you to a wide range of mathematical concepts which will be used later on in higher up computer science classes to potentially \"cut corners\" in being able to prove certain things without having to test them thousands of times. This course is good for non compsci people as well in that the math is very different from most other courses and often very interesting. I would definitely recommend this course for people interested in discrete math, but if proofs aren't for you this maybe isn't the right class as there are lots and lots of them.",
    "It is an introduction to a wide variety of non-calculus math. If you like math problems that are like puzzles, and want to learn more about proofs, take this class. There is very little direct application to computer science, so even if you are not a comp sci person, take it! I wasn't.",
    "'twas a phenomenal course, and one of the best I've taken at Yale. An introduction to creative math, with a welcome focus on proofs not computation. It was really beautiful material. Professor Angluin made this class as wonderful as it was. I often thought I wouldn't have enjoyed it-- let alone loved it-- if it weren't for her compassion and deep care for teaching. We're very lucky to have learned from someone who puts this first, which is rare. She went above and beyond to make herself available, with extra problem solving sessions, reviews, and office hours. I never liked math before, but listen: Discrete math is beautiful.",
    "Dana is the absolute best. This course was well organized and straightforward, and all expectations were clearly laid out.",
    "Great class if you're taking with Dana. Really any class with Dana, go for it",
    "Exploring different topics in math, not too difficult but the psets can take a fair amount of time, utilize office hours",
    "If you can get Professor Angluin, CPSC 202 will be a fun and relatively low-stress class. The problem sets are not too bad if you start early and go to help hours with any questions. The midterm and final were challenging, but very fair.",
    "A great class if you need to take it, especially with discrete math in the math dept as an alternative. Professor Angluin is a lovely and wonderful professor. She is extremely clear when teaching material and provides ample resources for you to succeed in the class.",
    "A very solid class. If you like math and algorithms, you'll probably find it enjoyable. Professor Angluin is absolutely amazing when it comes to answering questions, regrading exams, etc., but lectures can be a bit dry at times. She definitely tries to spice it up with the occasional story, but it's not a super exciting topic.",
    "It's Discrete Mathematics. It's some math with lots of logic. Take it only if you have to take it which should just be CS majors. Dana knows how to do her job and doesn't make learning difficult but throughout the entire course I was very confused as to what was the point of me learning all of the seemingly random things I learned in this class. They didn't connect it to topics in Computer Science or Programming as well as I'd hoped. More for those research-type majors.",
    "Take this class with Dana if you get the chance.",
    "If you are a Computer Science student, you'll need to take it and should take it with Dana. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.",
    "Challenging introduction to a range of topics in discrete math. Would recommend as math foundation for computer science majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you wish the swiftly browse through math needed in computer science. However, if you wish to learn more in depth, math 244 may be your choice.",
    "CPSC 202 is great for students interested in computer science - I would heartily recommend over MATH 244. Take this class with Prof. Angluin! She makes the class lively, funny, exciting, and interesting. Psets are hard and take up a lot of time, but they are super important and will help you on exams. They can even be fun, if you start early! Take advantage of the peer tutor hours too. If you keep up with \/ stay ahead in terms of reading, you'll do really well in class and will enjoy lectures.",
    "Take this class if you're not as strong in math. It covers a lot of different topics and you won't go too in depth for anything. There are weekly psets on the material and a lot of learning is supposed to take place in the reading. Do not take it with other comp sci classes unless you're schedule frees up the time. It's challenging and look for the extra support early on if you need.",
    "This is a course on discrete math in which everything relates back to computer science. Although there are no formal prerequisites, I found myself behind most students taking this course without any coding experience. However, this is a great class to stretch yourself with fun problem sets and interesting topics.",
    "A survey course that really is just not up to par.",
    "Aim of the class is unclear. The lectures are generally friendly for students who have traumas about mathematical theory. Yet, the course \"book\" is mostly theoretical and we had too few solved example problems to illustrate the theory. The homework problems were fairly non-trivial, especially given how little time we had for each topic. But again, for lacking graders, we didn't get answers to the problems until we had forgotten what we had done. Grading was the most frustrating part of the course, with median scores around 97\/100 for every homework. The homework problems (without given answers) were not worth going through several times just to check for little errors, so I don't feel like the scores and grades at the A-\/A or even B+ level would measure actual mathematical skill and maturity. Dana is amazing. She keeps track of unanswered questions and what we can be assumed to know for each problem. During problem sessions, she points out some of her design intentions with the questions, which helps to understand the learning goal. She is aware of the different needs of students of different levels and she shows motherly patience when students fail to clarify their own question. In short, she is one of the pillars that maintain my faith in Yale STEM education.",
    "I would recommend if you need the course for the major or are interested in discrete mathematics. A well-taught course, not easy though. I would recommend going to pset help hours.",
    "Take this class with Professor Angluin: she does an excellent job explaining the topics. Throughout the course of a semester, you cover a spattering of a large variety of topics. The problem sets are reasonable and the exams are fair. Professor Angluin actively encourages participation and makes a genuine effort to learn your name: something that makes a large lecture feel small. On the whole, I would highly recommend the class: it moves at a reasonable pace and you'll learn a lot!",
    "Overall I think this is a great course. I took it with Dana and she's amazing. The course tries to cover a lot in one semester so it was not able to go very deep in each topic. The workload is very manageable and exams are fair."
