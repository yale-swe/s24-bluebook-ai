   "comments": [
    "Wanted to love this class, because I love the subject matter and the reading lists. And the professor is amazing-- he knows so so much about Ellison and all the related writers and artists etc. Problem is, the discussions just were not very good. Stepto would generally have us read interesting passages and then he would speak on them or maybe let one person make one comment. There was never any dialogue or back and forth, just people pontificating on a paragraph and moving right along. Take it to do the reading, because Invisible Man is one of the greatest novels-- I won't say ever-- I've ever read. But expect seminar to be a drag. I'll give the class a B for the reading list alone.",
    "Take this only if you're willing to push yourself with the final project. Class discussions were utterly forgettable.",
    "This is a great class, especially to fulfill one's senior requirement for the American Studies major. Prof. Stepto really makes the class wonderful, and is one of the most personable and dedicated professors I have had.",
    "ENGL 445 focuses primarily on a reading of Ellison's Invisible Man. Although the first few weeks and last few weeks are dedicated to reading some of Ellison's shorter pieces and essays, the bulk of memorable discussions are tied to the novel. Definitely come to this class prepared to bring in your own unique interest as it ties to Ellison. Both a presentation in the middle of the semester and a final paper requires you to place Ellison in the context of some other literary, cultural, or historic influence. Although this independent work requires each student to direct their own course of study, the result is a satisfying semester in the end.",
    "The class teaches you a lot but know that class is basically a lecture around a seminar table. But Stepto was a personal friend of Ellison's and uses anecdotes from his time with the author to enhance our reading of his work.",
    "I wouldn't take this course, as there is limited class discussion."
