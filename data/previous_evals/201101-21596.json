   "comments": [
    "I think this is a good class that both effectively captures the complexities within the region that have existed through it's history, and provides a solid background for things that happen today. Konstantina does a good job at leading discussion, and the material is both fascinating and enriching.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in the Balkans, but it would probably be good to have some prior exposure to at least 1 or 2 Balkan countries since the course takes a very comparative approach to the subject. I'm not a history major so I thought the reading load was kind of hefty, but history majors will probably be used to it. The movies were quite good, the presentations were low-stress and fairly casual and conversational, and the final paper was very open-ended. One critique I have of the course is that I wish it would be more like half lecture and half discussion as opposed to entirely discussion, but other than that, I enjoyed it. Konstantina is also very nice and helpful, and employs and feedback or constructive criticism her students give her.",
    "I would recommend it if you have a passionate interest in all of the Balkan countries. If you are interested in a particular country or region, it is not focused enough for you.",
    "History 248j focuses on recent Balkan history, primarily in the 20th century, but spanningfrom the Balkan independence movements in the 19th and early 20th century through today. I absolutely recommend this class, and although \"Balkan instability\" may seem like a daunting topic, this class provides a great overview of developments both within individual countries and across the region. If you have any interest in the Balkans, or have ever wondered about the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, I wholeheartedly recommend this class."
