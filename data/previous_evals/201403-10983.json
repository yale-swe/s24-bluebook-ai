   "comments": [
    "The material for the class looks at medieval and early modern Europe, but with themes really applicable to economic or developmental history, its broad enough to be of use to students who might not have much familiarity with the period.",
    "Overview of changes in European society from 1400-1700. Focus on economics, but largely theoretical economics, not the American style of economic analysis. I find this to be a very interesting change of perspective, worthwhile for anyone who believes that they are passionate about the subject. It becomes very specific and detail-oriented, and the average student will become bored by the apparent lack of 21st century relevance. Definitely for the serious student.",
    "I would recommend any class that Professor Trivellato is teaching, as she makes the course what it is.",
    "It is a great introduction to the topic and I would recommend it.",
    "It is a hard class in economic history - I would reccomend it",
    "I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in the subject."

   "comments": [
    "Im not a medievalist, but what I did take away from this class was that problems such as dealing with risk or organizing different corporate forms are fundamental to economic history in all periods. I also came to recognize that many of the institutional arrangements that I study in my own work have previously appeared and functioned in analogous (or dissimilar) situations, which has led me to focus in my own work less on the forms themselves and more on the process of selection, development, and implementation.",
    "better versed in theories of economics outside of rational-choice theory",
    "I had little background in economic history before this class. Now I feel that I have a decent grasp of the literature and can expand my knowledge where needed.",
    "It may be very helpfuk for my dissertation"
