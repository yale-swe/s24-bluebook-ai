   "comments": [
    "If you need it or will do sciencey things, take it. Otherwise, logic or algebra is a more useful math and their are plenty of even less taxing QRs",
    "Yes if you want a good calc course. Much better than Math 115. Need to do the work to stay ahead of it, though.",
    "I recommend it to anyone who feels comfortable with calculus. This course may need some additional help from students\/instructors for a better understanding, but the concepts are generally understandable.",
    "Math120 has a bad reputation in some circles whether it is due to a bad TA or the curve, but it really is not as awful as some people may say that it is. The workload is manageable, and the tests are straightforward. Just take a couple of days to get your key concepts down before the exam, and you should be fine. The final three weeks are supposed to be the most difficult, but it progresses very nicely as long as you keep up with the material. All in all, it's really no different from any other math class you've taken in your life.",
    "I guess I would say the biggest pet peeve is the tricks they put on thr tests, the more \"conceptual\" questions. The vast majority of the time, I would finish thr first 90% of the test super quickly only to gey stuck at the last one or two questions for an hour. T's ftustrating to think that you understand the material only to do badly because you lost 15 or so points on one question, but I suppose they have to set a curve somehow right? It could also be I didn't know the material as well as I thought I did, so just take the class and see for yourself.",
    "This class interesting although difficult. It has a wide range of information that sometimes appears unrelated but essentially builds on concepts learned earlier. However, this class, if you get behind in it is very difficult to correct the downward spiral as there isn't a lot of opportunity to make up the grades. I would still recommend this class though as it is a good math class overall.",
    "Math 120 is a good course and it gets you to think in ways which you may not be accustomed to because of the introduction of a third dimension.",
    "Recommended for someone who doesn't mind the rote memorization of techniques out of the book. Not recommended for someone who likes a chance to be evalutaed through creative work on projects or tests.",
    "If you have to take math 120, then take it. unless you are lucky, all tas will suck and it will not matter which one you choose. Calinescu is at least far more willing to help. But if you are like me, just get the textbook, study and you will be fine."
