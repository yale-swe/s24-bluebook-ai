   "comments": [
    "This course was a great overview of all the types of research that might occur in a neuro lab. I didn't get much insight into the molecular aspects of neuro research, but this is the kind of thing I learned in biochem lab so it wasn't a big deal.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of neurobiological concepts by producing real action potentials, examining the structures of worm vs frog neurons, and recording EJP's on an oscilloscope.",
    "This class was amazing!!! There is no better way of understanding difficult concepts than by seeing them directly through a lab course.",
    "Neurobio lab was a really great opportunity to learn the basics of electrophysiology -- both intracellular and extracellular recording. Since that isn't something that you often get to experience in other labs\/contexts, it's a pretty cool class.",
    "Working understanding of electrophysiology.",
    "This lab was an excellent complement that reinforced the concepts taught in the MCDB 320 course, and I'm glad that I took them concurrently.",
    "I learned a fair amount about how the electrophysiological data we discussed in class was actually obtained. It was both cool and clarifying to conduct some of the classic experiments in neurobiology ourselves.",
    "This course was a very helpful supplement to MCDB 320 (Neurobiology). We learned to actually perform some of the experiments and procedures discussed during lecture. I learned some new techniques including using electrophysiology equipment and performing skillful dissections. I feel that I benefited a lot from this course, because it solidified my knowledge of neurobiology and taught me techniques that I might use in the future.",
    "It is one thing to learn about the classic\/ pioneer experiments that led to a better understanding of neurobiology in class, but it is an entirely different story to be able to perform those and other similar experiments on living organisms, which is what this laboratory allowed me to do. This lab enhanced my knowledge of critical elements in neurobiology including the electrophysiological basis of the action potential and communication between neurons in the nervous system as well as the anatomy of these elements through interesting labs that relied on thorough experimentation and critical reasoning to understand.",
    "This course taught me about a variety of skill sets in neuroscience research, from macroscopic dissection techniques to macro-level analysis of structure. I also learned about how to operate an oscilloscope properly with several amplifiers to obtain a readable signal. These various techniques will be useful in future neuroscience research settings.",
    "I've always been interested in neurobiology and even work in a systems neuroscience lab, but this course offered me the opportunity to become familiar with a lot of other techniques used in the field of neurobiology.",
    "We learned a great amount of information on the different ways to experiment in neurobiology.",
    "Great overview of neurobiology and basic laboratory techniques in neurobiology.",
    "Whenever I learn about an experimental technique in a biology class, I always think, \"It can't actually be that easy.\" Although I've worked in a cell biology lab for two years and this isn't my first lab course at Yale, many biological experiments seem completely out of reach. I understand how they work, I can propose them in answer to an exam question--but if you put me in a lab and gave me all the necessary equipment, I would have no idea where to start. The neurobiology lab taught me what it really means to use many of the techniques we studied in class, especially the ones we learned in the first part of the course. We saw voltage vs. time plots from intracellular recording in class, and then were actually able to replicate them in the labs! Not only did I gain some perspective on how the experiments were really performed (and how difficult some of them could be), but the lab also helped reinforce many of the concepts we studied in the lecture course. Thanks to the lab course, I had a very easy time with facilitation, the effect of extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ on muscle action potentials, the relationship between nerve diameter and conduction speed, and much more. I also learned quite a bit about anatomy (especially the anatomy of the spinal cord), and gained useful experience working with several different model organisms I had never previously touched (frogs, Drosophila, earthworms, grasshoppers). As a cell biologist\/biochemist, this course removed a lot of the fear I had about working with macroscopic animals. Since I've previously done research and have written several essays about my work (although it's not yet published), I already had some idea about how to design an experiment and how to write a scientific paper, but this course would be an excellent introduction to that for someone with no research experience. The lab reports felt much more like scientific writing than those in previous laboratory courses I've taken, such as the Organic Chemistry lab. Finally, we learned some very interesting tidbits from Prof. Wyman's first lecture, including a review of electromagnetism, how electrical outlets are grounded, and the neurobiological inspiration behind Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Although some people found it a bit disjointed, I thought it tied in nicely with this course's focus on how to apply the abstract concepts we study in lecture to the real world.",
    "This class provided the opportunity to re-create some of the classic experiments from neurobiology and explore different approaches to neuro research.",
    "I learned a lot of hands on techniques for analyzing the nervous system at the electrical, molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. I liked that we looked at these various different modes of information transmission in neurobiology. I also learned how complicated neurobiology lab work actually is, and the huge amount of trial and error that is required to get the equipment and set-ups to work properly."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the professors were great and it was well organized in terms of flow of the course, but I think that the experimental design had some room for improvement. Most of the time the experiments only worked for one group at most, so it was really difficult to sit in lab for almost five hours when nothing was working. I also think more than one TA was necessary, because there was only one professor and one TA circulating, and when nothing was working for anyone this meant that most groups were sitting doing nothing while waiting for a professor\/TA to become available.",
    "The strengths are the professors and their clear dedication to this course and their students. They are all very knowledgeable, approachable, and passionate. The only weakness of this course is the length. Most labs go until 6 or 6:30 and most of that time is devoted to tedious tasks like trying to get your oscilloscope to work.",
    "I don't think there was anything I would change about this course. A weakness was that a lot of time was spent making the equipment function properly, but this prepares you for real life when things rarely, if ever, go as planned. On the plus side, I know so much about recording machines and electrical connections and troubleshooting during experiments now.",
    "The first labs run by Bob were not efficient at all. We spent way too much time trying to answer theoretical questions that did not improve our understanding of the material. The lab definitely improved once Bob left, but it still felt like pre-lab lectures and demos took took long. I understand sometimes the length of the demos are out of the instructors' controls due to equipment failure, but explanations were often drawn out to an unnecessary degree. I wish Fernando had done more of the lectures and demos as he was very fast, efficient, and conveyed all the pertinent information.",
    "strengths - makes you practice dissections, oscilloscope recordings, mounting electrodes, so you can solve problems in a real lab setting; also, shows you how the original insights in fundamental neurobiology were discovered and gives you the cool experience of replicating them weaknesses - you don't really do anything novel or \"fascinating\" - most of the time is spent wasted on getting equipment to work",
    "I think that more detailed instructions on how to use the oscilloscope, and how to properly ground all the cables and equipment would be really helpful. Some labs, half the time was spent troubleshooting noise and equipment issues, and I think that could be avoided if early on, we learned how to use the oscilloscope properly.",
    "Overall, the course was organized, well taught, and well designed. The professors were engaging and helpful. Things that could be improved in the future: -At the beginning of the course with Professor Wyman, the lectures were extremely lengthy. We would have benefited from more lab work and less waiting around. -Later on, many of the experiments were challenging and sometimes, only one or two people in the class could get it to work. Perhaps more guidance or slightly simplifying a couple of the experiments would help.",
    "This course is excellent when it comes to both the instructors as well as the experiments designed for (and in some cases, designed by) students. The only recurring issue with the laboratory was the presence of electrical noise in the room, which sometimes interfered with oscilloscope recordings.",
    "The course included lab experiments that covered several areas of neuroscience, from neuromuscular junction analysis to observation and analysis of prepared brain slices, and as a result was incredibly comprehensive. Although the experiments were stimulating and informative, they sometimes took a very long time, especially in setting up the experimental apparatus.",
    "It would be nice to receive our quiz grades.",
    "The lab is long, but you learn a good amount.",
    "I really enjoyed all of the experiments. Sometimes the pre-lab lectures were a bit too long but overall, very interesting and informative.",
    "Great lab course! It pairs nicely with the neurobio course and helps synthesize the material. Definitely take it if you are also taking the class.",
    "This is an excellent class. The material is fascinating, the labs are well-designed and practical, and I learned an incredible amount from it. Unlike many other Yale labs, it's a very good complement to the lecture course, and helped reinforce the concepts I learned in lecture. The professors all did a spectacular job. The lab felt like a real research lab, in which the students and professors were on the same side, all working together to solve interesting scientific problems. The professors sometimes brought cookies, gave us extensive individual help, and stayed until we were all satisfied with our results (sometimes until 7:30!). To be honest, it was almost like being part of a family, albeit a family that enjoyed anesthetizing earthworms and dissecting the frog sartorius muscle. There is really very little I would change. The only suggestion I have is to make the expectations a bit more clear for the labs and the reports. Often, many more potential experiments are listed in the packet than are feasible to conduct--which is great, since it gives us choice and room to play around. However, it would probably be good to highlight the experiments we should be absolutely sure to perform. Also, maybe you could provide the class with a couple of sample lab reports at the beginning of the course. I didn't have too much trouble with them, but some of my friends who had less lab experience than I did had more difficulty. Make sure, however, that you don't change the format of the lab reports--they are a great introduction to writing a scientific paper.",
    "Strength: the labs were generally fun and unique Weakness: the length of some of the weeks could be shortened; in general, the ~4.5 hour block that this course took up felt fairly excessive",
    "The course gave us a lot of responsibility in figuring out how to get the set-ups to work, which actually did lead to a lot of learning and understanding on a deeper level. You had to understand the reasoning behind everything you were doing to be able to get it to work, so I feel like I benefitted from the course a lot. The main weakness would be the huge amount of trial and error that is required to get some neurobiology instruments to work, which is often based on experience, and led to us having to stay at lab very late sometimes if things were not working. I think more help in gathering some of the readings and shortening some of the labs would improve the course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course if you need a bio lab, since compared to most bio labs it's reasonably low workload and it's not terribly difficult to understand the material. However, be warned that you will be here the full time, often past 6pm, for most labs. Additionally, be prepared to be frustrated when a lot of the experiments don't work and you end up sitting around and just using other groups' data. However, even when things don't work, you still learn a lot, and the professors were great so you learn a lot from their pre-lab lectures.",
    "If you want to see the concepts you learn in Neurobiology actually come to life and be applied, you should definitely take this course. Before this, I thought I had a pretty good grasp on action potentials, EJP's, neurotransmitters, etc but after taking this lab, I realized there were a lot of gaps in my knowledge. I also gained a deep appreciation for how scientists discovered these concepts that, when summarized in a textbook, can easily be taken for granted.",
    "100% THIS COURSE WAS GREAT!! So cool, and I learned a ton.",
    "All things considered, this is a very good MCDB lab, and if you're interested in neurobio (i.e. interested enough to take the lecture) it's a great one to do. All of the professors who teach it are super nice, knowledgable (Keshishian is a wizard with the electrophysiology setup), and approachable. The lab compliments the lecture very well, and you'll find that by the time the lecture final comes around, there's a lot of stuff that you don't even need to study since you've been doing it every week in lab. Work-wise, it's just a one to two page lab writeup plus figures every 1-2 weeks -- so not too bad compared to other labs. It's also nice that the work you're doing -- mostly extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological recording -- is not something you get to do in most teaching labs. By the time you finish the course, you realize you've been exposed to a range of approaches (behavioral, anatomical, genetic, pharmacological, physiological, molecular) in neuroscience. The only potential pitfall is that you should be prepared to stay close to the full 4.5 hours most weeks, but the lab environment is really quite pleasant so that's usually not an issue. Overall, this is definitely one of your best bets for half-credit MCDB labs.",
    "If you could take another lab for the MCDB requirement, please do it. We always got out of lab extremely late (post 6 pm) on a consistent basis, and some of the instructors did not seem to be considerate of our time. The labs themselves were ok but only focused on electrophysiology so if this doesn't interest you, you might be bored.",
    "I am indifferent. The write-ups are tedious and not really fruitful for intellectual reflection. It does slightly complement classroom learning, but not immensely. Take it if you want to see for yourself how it is like to be a biologist, and to apply theoretical principles of neurobiology to real-world model organisms.",
    "This lab was the best one I've taken at Yale by far. You get to apply the concepts taught in the lecture, so it really reinforces what you're learning. Also, the workload\/grading of this course was pretty reasonable, because there's a two page lab report per lab, but no final exam.",
    "I had a very mixed experience in this class. Ill start off with the positives. There are so many lab courses at Yale that are tedious because 1) youre doing experiments for the sake of building a skill and not because the experiments are cool or productive and 2) you write up incredibly boring lab reports or lab preps that will probably bore your TAs even more. In this class, you actually do experiments that are classic neurobiology experiments. You get to dissect frog legs and modify the firing rate of the sartorius muscle! You measure action potentials from drosophila photoreceptors and neurons in grasshoppers. I was a bit disgusted by the vivisections that we would do, or the other ways we would maim or torture the animals. It was disturbingbut it was also cool. Also, the lab reports were super easy, really easily graded. The lab is also pretty laid back. You have quizzes at the start, but they say they only matter if youre on the edge of a grade. I dont think anyone did particularly well on the quizzesyou should study for them so you know the labs, but theyre not super important. Now to the downsides. Youre there till 6 pretty much every day. Just accept it. Itll make it easier. For the first 3 or 4 labs, Proessor Wyman is teaching the course. Youll spend about 30 minutes to an hour and a half doing the lab and the rest of the time (and by the rest of the time I mean until 6 or 6:30) listening to him talk about the concepts behind the experiment, related concepts, stories about Fineman, rather dubious art history, and pseudointellectual philosophy. It can be fun if youre fine with relaxing for those several hours. But I found it to be frustrating (if that wasnt obvious by my narration). When Professor Keshishian and Professor Van Hoff are more in charge, more time is spent on the lab itself. That being said, a lot of time is spent sitting around and waiting for one of the professors to come over and help you figure out the kinks in your oscilloscope. For a lot of the labs, only 1-3 groups get good data. Its rather frustrating. When your tools work and your subjects cooperate, it can be a lot of fun and you get a lot of cool stuff done! But a lot a lot a lot of time is wasted just sitting around, talking, going on facebook, tinder, whatever. Its a pretty easy lab, you do some cool experiments, but it is abusive to animals, its a time drain, and your equipment often doesnt work.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this lab, especially if you're taking the Neurobiology lecture. The experiments are all very interesting and will heighten your understanding of material from lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a great deal about the electrophysiology basis of the action potential as well as about neuron to neuron communication that is not easily done by taking the class alone, and the experiments\/ model organisms were always interesting to perform\/ work with.",
    "For students taking the neurobiology lecture, the lab class is a good way of supplementing lecture material with experiments. You also get to perform several dissections which are challenging but also highly rewarding when you are able to get a good reading.",
    "If you are interested in neurobiology and need a relatively easy (aka not too time consuming) MCDB lab, you should definitely take this course.",
    "This lab is informative and not too stressful, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Absolutely rake this course!! Not a ton of work - very laid back but very informative. Not super helpful for the lecture portion of the class.",
    "I really couldn't recommend this class more. From a practical point of view, this lab actually corresponds well with the lecture course and it will make it much, much easier for you to learn the lecture material. The lecture doesn't have much in the way of homework or practice, so one of the best ways to cement some of the key concepts in your memory is by applying them in lab. The neurobiology lab covers some incredibly interesting material. I work in a cell biology\/biochemistry lab, and I had never seen any of the techniques we used. Among other things, you'll learn how to record muscle action potentials (both extracellularly and intracellularly), how to dissect the sartorius muscle of a frog, and how to observe the electrical signal from the reflex that results when grasshoppers detect a moving predator. Largely because of the difficult techniques and the precision required to operate the equipment, this lab isn't easy. You'll often stay late (usually it's about 1:30 to 6, but I stayed until 7 a few times) and there will be a few days when it seems like nothing is ever going to work. Fortunately, this lab gives you all the resources you'll need to succeed. You're paired up with a partner, and the two of you will receive more individual attention in this lab than in any other lab at Yale. At any given moment, two professors and a TA will be on call and ready to help--and that's for a class of maybe twelve students. All of the professors are wonderful in their own way. Prof. Wyman teaches the first three labs, and is one of the most interesting people you'll ever encounter at Yale. He's a true Renaissance man and places a unique emphasis on how science relates to the rest of the world. I don't think there's another class in which you'll learn how electrical outlets are grounded, or how Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam is actually based on a human brain (as Prof. Wyman said, \"Art historians hate this!\"). I recommend you take this class before he retires. Prof. Keshishian and Prof. Vonhoff team-teach the remaining labs, and they make a fantastic team. Prof. Vonhoff is the hardest-working professor in MCDB--he's always there when you arrive and is still cleaning up when you leave. Prof. Keshishian is a magical neurobiology wizard who can fix any piece of lab equipment under the sun. They both know a ton of neurobiology and are always happy to answer your questions. Your grade is based on three things: quizzes (at the start of class, on the reading), participation, and lab reports, where lab reports make up the vast majority. The expectations for the lab reports are somewhat vague, but basically you're supposed to report your findings as you would in a scientific paper. There's a lot of flexibility both in the labs and in the reports--many possible experiments are suggested in the packet, and (to a degree) you're free to perform and write up the ones that interest you. The best part of this class is definitely the community. Unlike in a lecture course, the students and professors are unquestionably on the same side. It's like a real research lab, in which the students and professors work together to solve scientific problems. The professors even bring cookies sometimes. By the end of the semester, you'll get to know the professors and your peers on a personal level. To be honest, it was almost like being part of a family, albeit a family that enjoys anesthetizing earthworms and making detached muscles twitch in a saline\/calcium bath.",
    "Yes - this was a pretty good MCDB lab.",
    "I would recommend this course, as long as you are aware that it is a long lab, and you are often there past 6pm. It requires a lot of perseverance and trial and error to get good recordings often, so you can't get discouraged. I wouldn't recommend it if you are not interested in electrophysiology, because the labs are primarily based on that."
