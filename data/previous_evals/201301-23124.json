    "Each section differs depending on the professor - this year, Dushko did A LOT with building things out of paper\/cardboard and tape, and drawing dinosaurs that we'd built. I think it's going to be different next year though. Not too much work, and class goes by pretty quickly. Dushko is a great professor to have though, and generally really funny.",
    "Take it. It's a great class. It does involve a lot of work (not unreasonable) but it is rewarding, humbling, motivating, and just plain fun in a way many classes at Yale aren't. Dushko is a great instructor and keeps the class engaged. The exercises are interesting and not the typical draw-your-desk type of assignments. The class sometimes gets a little tedious in the name of honing technical ability, but the pay-off and the overall dynamism of the class is worth it! The fact that there are around 15 people in each class allows you to develop a great class relationship with peers.",
    "A sizeable amount of work; a sizeable amount of progress in drawing ability. Take it if you like drawing; I think whatever level of experience you have, you'll get feedback helpful to you from your teacher.",
    "I recommend it. Fun. You'll get better.",
    "if you are a beginner, and you dont mind getting bad grades, it is A GREAT CLASS to quickly learn drawing and get a different perspective (about lines, space, ...). but, there a good amount of work too. 1 take-home assignment every week, which at first will take you forever to finish (until you get the hang of time efficiency).",
    "Yes. All of the drawing is observational, so it is easy to see improvement. Every member of the class progressed immensely, even those who were already talented draftsmen. I think that every student should consider an art class, but I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in architecture. This course makes you into an efficient and accurate draftsman and introduces you to the crit process.",
    "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your call, of course, but honestly, no. I did not have fun, nor did my drawing skills improve. It was just very frustrating and tiring and I never looked forward to coming to class. The assignments weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t helpful and it seemed like they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assigned to improve your drawing skills, just to frustrate you and take up a lot of your time.",
    "Yes, great class, but a lot of work depending on yoyr instructor. A lot of work means improvement though.",
    "I'd recommend taking this class with Dushko if you're serious about art and willing to put in time for each assignment. If you're just looking for an easy going drawing class, consider a different section. That being said, Dushko is awesome! And quite funny (he shared a lot of stories of his undergrad days) and you'll definitely learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend taking one of the other basic drawing classes with a more interesting curriculum",
    "The class is work intensive, and certainly one that requires a serious commitment if you want to get a lot out of the class. A lot of the class focused on more abstract assignments such as building objects out of cardboard or paper and tape, and then using those as models for drawing. The class, if taken seriously, will teach you how to draw, but has significantly less freedom than you might expect from an art class. The assignments have very strict guidelines, and the subjects of the drawings were not very varied. However, the professor brought in a lot of knowledge and lessons about artists and other related topics that made the class about more than just the drawing. I would definitely recommend taking basic drawing, however be aware that the class varies widely depending on the professor. This class is good for someone good with building and with a focus on line drawing, and probably not so good for someone looking to do more abstract work."
