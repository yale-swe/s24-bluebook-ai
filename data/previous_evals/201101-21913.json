    "This class if for people that are really into this stuff; I wasn't, and was therefore not into this class. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like the topic, because the class is very unstructured and assumes some familiarity with the material. If you don't like the material, you'll die halfway through reading Celsus.",
    "Ancient Greek Medicine is an interesting overview from Hippocrates to Galen. I suggest it to HSHM majors who want the aspect of medical history.",
    "This isn't the best seminar in HSHM; however, there isn't much work to do and little participation in class is required.",
    "Yes. Definitely Take!",
    "Almost no one in the class read Greek or Latin, which was kind of weird. Take it if you want to read the texts-- Hippocrates, Galen-- which frankly aren't that illuminating on their own. If that material doesn't interest you, then no.",
    "HIST 217J offers a great introduction into the History of Ancient Greek and Roman medicine, like the class' title. The class requires only one take home midterm and a final 10-15 page paper. The grading is fairly lenient and Dr. Grimm is very helpful. Her teaching style is sometimes confusing because she goes off on many tangents, but she gives out weekly outlines which help narrow down what we need to know from what she says in class. I definitely recommended.",
    "Focus on the Hippocratic corpus and then a bit on Roman medicine. A little disorganized, professor is repetitive and I did not feel I took away a whole lot from this class. Potential to be a great class.",
    "Professor Grimm is awesome, and this is a wonderful class. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Know up front that this might be called a Junior seminar, but it's really a lecture. Professor Grimm lectures every class and often interrupts when we were given the chance to talk. If that's what you're looking for, fine. The course was interesting, just not exceptionally fascinating.",
    "yes, if you want to learn some about ancient medicine without too much rigor"
