   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to fellow student. If you want to improve your creative writing in general, and if you want to explore Spanish literature and your analyzation of that literature, and also perfect your language skills, this is the class for you. It's not exclusively a \"workshop\" where you read each other's writing and then share critiques, but it's also a class where you read and analyze Latin American literature. By far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Fun class, manageable workload, but prepare to be confused at times. Your Spanish will not improve greatly, but your ability to write in Spanish will definitely become stronger.",
    "It's a great class but don't think it's just another language course. It really is a creative writing course, but in Spanish. Make sure you are confident enough in your ability to write in Spanish that you can treat the class as you would an English writing course.",
    "Wonderful creative outlet. Workload not too bad-builds up sometimes but handing in a portfolio instead of taking a final really takes the pressure off. Maria was very involved in our personal growth as students and always available to talk one on one. This course gave me an opportunity to channel personal thoughts, and honestly helped keep me sane this semester.",
    "I would recommend Spanish Creative Writing to anyone who is eligible to take L5 Spanish and is not afraid to go a little bit out of their comfort zone.",
    "Yes I would recommend it both to native and non-native speakers. For natives, you learn how to writ creatively and improve your style. For non-natives, it allows you to improve your Spanish skills in a fun way.",
    "One develops their own skill in creative writing while challenging yourself in composing in what is most likely a second language.",
    "Classes on Tuesday and Thursday - you will be reading and writing for each. The class gets molded by what the students produce and choose to focus on. I recommend this class to any student who wishes to improve on their reading and writing in Spanish, or to practice their Spanish and expand their vocabulary.",
    "Would recommend it 100%. And describe it as a fun course where you will learn different writing techniques and be able to use that creative part of your brain that was sleeping for a long time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was satisfactory in that it provided all the things I hoped it would. I had hoped that continued exposure to Spanish would prevent me from losing skills due to underuse, and this class served that purpose well. There was a good mix of conversation, reading, and writing that helped me keep up my skills in those areas. I was also hoping to challenge myself by learning a type of writing that was outside my comfort zone (in any language). This class was a good introduction to various techniques for creative writing. It catered to people of different ability levels both with the Spanish language, and with creative writing. In addition, Profesora Jordan is a great professor, who's very good at what she does. This class also has the advantage of being smaller than some of the other classes in the department."
