    "The strength of the course is in its organization, structure, and this semester's iteration of classmate dynamics; I never felt lost for a second in spite of how sprawling the topics covered tend to be. The course could be improved by more overtly foregrounding in discussion people's individual interests and the utility of sound studies to their practice\/work, i.e. an addition to each class where there's a tiny recap of what people find most interesting\/difficult\/salient, versus at the end of the semester."

Do speak up and fumble; it makes the world go round, and Sound Studies, as dense as it gets at times, is no exception.",
