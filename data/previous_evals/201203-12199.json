   "comments": [
    "If you haven't taken Econ before, be prepared to have to study and do way more work than other people in the class. If you're taking this course with other very difficult courses and have never taken Econ before, it will be very difficult to keep up. If you have taken Econ before (and done well), however, you'll be fine.",
    "This is a hard class. Your grades are derived from your scores on the midterm, the final, and 5 problem sets. The class is graded on a curve, so it is extremely competitive. I wish I had not taken this class because I did not have a strong foundation in Economics like other kids in the class had from high school. Only 20% of this class will get A's, whereas 50% of the class in the Intro Micro Lecture will get A's. Only take this class if you're confidant you can outperform other Yalies. The problem sets are easy. Go to office hours and ask questions about the problem sets. The midterm and the final are very hard.",
    "ECON 110 is a course to take if you're looking to major in Econ or if you would like to challenge yourself. Obviously it's tougher than lecture but it is 100% worth the time and effort if you're actually looking to challenge yourself and learn in a more intimate setting. You cover the same information as lecture-- it is intro to micro-- but you will be forced to work harder since most kids in the class are potential econ majors. I would definitely recommend this class with Tolga-- he's engaging and keeps us awake.",
    "Definitely take this over the lecture. The curve isn't as bad as some might tell you and Tolga can actually explain concepts in an easy to understand way. Being an intro, obviously we didn't go deep into the material but I feel that it prepares you well for intermediate courses. I would recommend taking it.",
    "Econ 110 is a good, quick overview of microeconomic principle. I would recommend the class to another student if he\/she is interested in majoring for econ, or wants to satisfy a QR of SO requirement.",
    "Econ 110 is a difficult class, not necessarily in terms of work-load, but simply in terms of the concepts covered. Each week expect to have 50-70 pages of textbook reading. There is a problem set every other week but he goes over all the questions in his office hours. Other than the PSets, the only other grades are the midterm and the final. The seminar seems to go much more in depth into many of the concepts the lecture covers, and covers ideas that the lecture does not even touch upon. Also, the curve for the seminar is steeper than the curve for the lecture. That said, I would recommend this course. It does require you actuallyread the book if you want to get an A because he does not cover all the topics in class, but you really do learn a lot from the class. I would also caution that the two teachers seem to have very different teaching styles, but I would recommend trying to get Dr. Koker.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it because of the teacher.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to have a solid foundation in introductory microeconomics. Tolga is a great teacher and every class is a lot of fun, and you still learn a lot. It's not an easy class though, the curve is harder than Econ 115 and you have to read the 500 page textbook to have a shot at an A. Tolga himself will say that the material he covers in class will only get you a B on the exams.",
    "Econ 110 is a great class for an introduction to micro. Tolga is a really great professor, gets the material across to you, and cares about his students. However, this class is difficult. It relies a lot on math and the midterm and final are difficult. Think about what you want to get out of an intro econ class. Econ 110 is more in-depth and engaging than Econ 115 but the exams and grading are harder.",
    "If you're going to take microeconomics, I would suggest the seminar, and I would suggest Tolga.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Tolga does a great job of explaining concepts, and his jokes and stories keep class interesting. Having a small seminar as opposed to a large lecture course is also nice, especially since you'll be less tempted to doze off. The course can be pretty fast-paced at times, so make sure you stay on top of the reading.",
    "NOT intro. Many kids in the class had prior exposure to micro (unlike myself) which made for a very challenging and stressful class. So much reading, and it moves really quickly. Strict curve, makes it slightly competitive in the sense that it's a relatively small class with all potential econ majors.",
    "Great course! If you are at all interested in Econ, take the course and try your best to take it with Tolga! Also, please do the reading before class--you will get so much more out of the class.",
    "ECON110 is introductory microeconomics at an accelerated pace, with what many consider a borderline intermediate-level textbook. I would recommend it to students who have taken AP Micro and wish to revisit its concepts. I would not recommend it to students who have not taken economics at all, or to those who have only taken AP Macro. They should consider the lecture instead. This class is EXTREMELY competitive, and the curve is very unforgiving.",
    "Tough class but if you pay attention and take good notes its manageable.",
    "A great course that teaches you to look at the economic world a little differently. I would definitely recommend it as I've learned a lot about how and why things are going on in our economy.",
    "great intro econ class at Yale. Tolga is a great instructor who makes the class funny and educational",
    "I would recommend it over the lecture \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I seemed to enjoy my economics class much more than they did and I seem to have learned concepts that they did not.",
    "Tolga is the loosest of all time. He's hilarious, even though sometimes his Turkish humor might come across as absolutely incoherent. Anyways, he means incredibly well, and will brighten your day. Tolga gives rather unorthodox life advice, but he tries, I guess. He loves his students, and is incredibly informal. I will truly miss the stories of his failed relationships. Take the seminar! Yes, it is probably a bit harder and more intensive than the lecture, but it really isn't that hard getting at least an A- if you put some work into it. A lot of people take it with DS, for example, and aren't able to put necessary time into the seminar. But if you can, the payoff is great. You learn a lot, get to do some stuff with behavioral econ (which you don't do in the lecture), and get to meet the man, the legend, who is Tolga Koker.",
    "A more intimate introduction to micro than the lecture, with, based on my semester, a better learning experience. Tolga is a great professor, motivated and motivating, funny but learning-driven who is always accessible. Definitely recommend this course to all those that want to do micro! As a side note though, it is harder, in my belief than the lecture, and most students that will do the seminar have done econ in high school before hand.",
    "I would recommend ECON 110, but not incredibly strongly. It's not going to change the way you look at life or anything, but you will definitely learn. It's a solid class, but probably not interesting enough to warrant the huge amount of students that sign up for it. Not a ton of work, just mostly independent textbook studying."
