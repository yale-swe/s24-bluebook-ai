    "Great continuation of the first semester if you have a thoughtful advisor.",
    "My senior essay was the bane of my existence until about a month before the due date, when my topic finally clicked and everything came together. Even then, it was still a steep, uphill climb. Don't do this senior essay unless you personally want to and you're willing to buckle down and go \"balls to the wall,\" as my advisor described it. That all said, I'm grateful I went through this process. If you're on the fence, take the plunge--you'll be glad you did. If you're considering the senior essay for other reasons (like your parents want you to write one), think twice.",
    "Writing an Econ thesis was for me a very rewarding experience. Of course, it's going to require a much higher level of analysis than your other Econ courses expect. You definitely need to take at least Econ 132 beforehand. Writing a thesis is something only a small number of people in the major will or should do. And you should really only do it if you have a good reason, like you are considering grad school, you really enjoy original research, or you really want to challenge yourself. One of the hardest parts about writing a thesis is finding a good thesis advisor, and I honestly wish I had good advice for you. The best I can say is start early. Reach out to professors who have good reviews in the classes they teach, because that can be a good predictor of a helpful advisor. When you reach out to them, make sure you have the basics of a plan for what you will do. Doing original research is the hardest part--I wrote the bulk of my thesis in two weeks but had been doing data analysis for months. Be disciplined and set goals for yourself (having a completed first draft before spring break made my life so much easier). Good luck!",
    "Totally depends on your initiative, and the quality of your adviser.",
    "You have to make sure you get an early start and find data easily, but I think it is an invaluable process and prepares you for open ended projects in the real world.",
    "Absolutely!! I loved writing my thesis",
    "Econ 492 is best for students who have strong internal motivation and will be able to undertake a lot of their work without direct oversight. If you are that type of person, or somebody who would like to produce one high watermark of work in your collegiate Economics career, I would heartily recommend it.",
    "I would recommend doing a senior essay if you're at all interested in economics research in the future. Doing independent research was a one-of-a-kind experience for me. Unlike pset\/exam-based courses, you set your own standards and goals. This freedom can be both daunting but liberating, especially when your work comes together at the end of the year. I would advise reaching out to both grad students and professors for advice, as they are both valuable resources.",
    "Writing a senior essay is intimidating at times, but definitely a worthwhile experience!",
    "It is what you make of it. Your thesis experience can be great if you reach out to your adviser and are on top of your work, but it can also be badly if you don't.",
    "Senior essay. You do your own research.",
    "Great way to cap off your economics education",
    "Amazing, rewarding; you learn a lot about yourself. It's great to have an undergraduate capstone project in which you can explore your own interests and hone your skills to a level that ordinary classes do not enable you to do. It's liberating to be able to control your own work and be proud of your output. Definitely recommend, but be warned -- this class is only rewarding if you work hard.",
    "I would definitely advise everyone to write a senior essay, even though it is not a requirement!",
    "Do it! If you pick a topic with a good data set, there is no reason not to try for this thesis. It especially helps if you get your background reading and data cleaning out of the way by the fall semester.",
    "You get what you put in. Be proactive, start early.",
    "This is a good course to develop one's research abilities. It is entirely up to you how much you want to get out of it.",
    "Yes. And start early",
    "Yes, absolutely. Make sure you have a topic you think you could research endlessly. Be creative. Definitely not too much work as long as you work regurlarly until Spring break and the deadline when stuff heats up.",
    "Take it if you must, don't if you don't need to."
