    "great class, wonderful professor, attracts a disproportionate share of pre-wall street kids, but if you can deal with that then you should definitely do it.",
    "Overall, ECON 457 is a relatively laid-back treatment of various historical financial events from an aesthetic perspective. It is not analytical, and it does not provide a way to understand the world.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class if you're interested in learning and if you want a professor who seems to care.",
    "This was a great course. Professor Goetzmann makes learning about this history of finance, from its roots to its current state, very interesting. The readings are not too long or numerous, but still help create a solid foundation for discussion"
