   "comments": [
    "This is a great class! It was a good overview of the components of intelligence as manifest in our nearest living relatives. Strengths: wide and comprehensive survey of primates and the selective pressures that affect their intelligence, insightful and well cross-referenced analysis of the research that has been done, an involved, approachable professor with a wealth of knowledge that he was eager to share, fair and thoughtful assignments.",
    "I would recommend ANTH 280 for students who are very interested in the evolution of primate intelligence (many aspects and perspectives of this subject are covered in this course). However, you need to be REALLY interested in the subject in order to get through the often times passive (due to the lack of student engagement) classes. It's also a course where you can do well without actually attending class.",
    "yes definitely take this class. it was my favorite this semester. the material is well organized and very interesting even to a layman like myself. primate intelligence might seem a little esoteric, but it's a rich and relevant topic that includes questions of not only anthropology, but also philosophy\/ethics, psychology\/cognitive science, biology, and sociology. watts is a great lecturer and a helpful guide. plus his knowledge of the subject is virtually encyclopedic",
    "Take it!",
    "Would not really recommend. Fine as a SO distribution credit.",
    "ANTH 280 is a course definitely worth taking. It delves into a topic that most people do not think much about, and that topic is the exact differences between humans and non-human primates. Although there are many experiments showing the vast separation between humans and non-human primates, there are also other experiments that suggest there are more similarities than is commonly thought. Every lecture was engaging and fun.",
    "If you are interested in primates, cognition, or both, you should take the course. Its not an absolutely fantastic course, but it gives you a basic understanding of the cognitive abilities of various primates. The lectures can be a bit dull, but the readings are generally very interesting. The class is also rather easy. If you do the work, youll get a good grade, simple as that. The major downside to the course is that lectures can be rather boring, but Evolution to Primate Intelligence was still a pretty solid course."
