    "Multivariate Statistics is a foundational course for anyone interested in Psychology. Provides a great overview of tools for the field. Jack is an amazing instructor, who not only is a giant in the field, but actually enjoys teaching statistics...and it shows. The only way to learn statistics is with someone as excited as Jack.",
    "Busy work isn't uncommon. However, it helps solidify the material. It's worth investing the time to master the basics in order to build advanced skill sets.",
    "I would say that PSYC 518 is the rare degree requirement course that you will absolutely enjoy. It's definitely not the easiest course in the world, but I think the weekly assignments and the in-class participation really force you to get comfortable with the method and theory in a way that prepares you *so* well to do statistical analyses thoughtfully, ethically, and professionally.",
    "I very much enjoyed intro statistics, and found it very useful for my research as well. I would very much recommend it to another student and I am glad it is required of all first year students, as it provides a base of information from which students can grow. I found it helpful to have a grounding in what was expected for me to know at this point in my training.",
    "it is compulsory for grads anyways, so this question doesn't really make sense. if you are an undergrad trying to look cool by taking graduate-level statistics courses, then go for it."

    "Statistics serves as the foundation of psychology.",
    "Yes. I came in without have used stats for 15 years and felt I learned more from this course than any of my other quant courses.",
    "This course helped me gain a base of knowledge of statistics, and I wish there was a part two to this course offered in the spring. The assignments in the course were very effective at solidifying my knowledge, and the take-home finals in particular were helpful for applying our knowledge and seeing direct feedback on analysis in our own research, something that is probably very difficult to get outside of this context.",
