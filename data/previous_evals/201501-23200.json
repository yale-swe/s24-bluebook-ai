    "Great seminar on an incredibly interesting and important topic that no one seems to know anyone about. Entering the course, I knew absolutely nothing of Latin American fiction beyond a short story here and there by Borges or Marquez. I couldn't read Spanish or Portuguese, something totally unneeded for the class. Exiting, I can rattle off more names and stories than will ever be practical, and that makes me incredibly excited. Contrary to what we insular American readers think, Latin American fiction is an enormously rich field of incredible depth and merit. Really, some of the stories and writers are so wonderful you can't help but sit amazed how few Westerners seem to appreciate or even know of them. Paulo, the instructor, is a brilliant, brilliant man. If you have any doubts that a Brazilian-born humanities professor will be a detraction from the course, shop the class once to have your misconceptions dispelled. Paulo's English is better than 99% of natives'. Hell, it's better than mine most mornings. His intelligence is extraordinary. He can read every story in Spanish, Portuguese, and English, translating to any of the languages freely. Really, it's pretty inspiring. So if you want a great humanities course, an awesome experience in literature, or just a fun cultural immersion in the Americas outside the U.S., take this course. There's no way you'll be reading every single story every night all the time. But even if you do only 75% of the readings, you'll get a ton out of the course day in and day out.",
    "This was one of the best decisions I made my freshman year. Everyone I mentioned this class to would say something like, \"That's so random!\" And that's part of what makes the class so great - Latin American short fiction is a genre that gets basically no exposure in broader culture\/education. Being able to dive deep into this genre has been intellectually rewarding, and it of course helped that the class had such a great dynamic. Six people + a professor who really knows whats up = a great time.",
    "It is the study of countless interesting and fun-to-read fiction short stories from Latin America in a seminar where entire cultures are examined in historical context to generate a deeper understanding of latinos and their literature in the world. I would definitely recommend to another student, simply for how much I enjoyed being in the class and reading the material.",
    "This is a great class! The readings are a lot of fun, and Paulo is a fantastic professor who draws in historical context, cultural context, biographical information, and etymology to make the stories more meaningful and interesting. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in Latin American culture and fiction and who loves literature classes with in-depth, open-minded discussion."
