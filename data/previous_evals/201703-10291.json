    "I developed a deep understanding of and appreciation for the politics and experiences of the post-Reconstruction American South, as depicted by some of the best black literary figures in the canon.",
    "I gained familiarity with a truly incredible curriculum of books. We had stimulating conversations every class, and the two essays were a good exercise in analytical writing.",
    "I learned about the major themes that Black Southern authors write. My understanding of how to read and interpret poetry increased.",
    "Deep analysis of texts.",
    "I read lots of amazing literature and learned how to write analytical essays about more modern texts.",
    "Exposed my self to a canon I did not know before.",
    "I gained valuable insight into the cultural consciousness of the black South and the interactions between black southern authors. I got great feedback on papers and worked to improve verbal communication skills in class.",
    "My close reading skills imprived significantly this semester!",
    "I learned about the black south! Such an amazing class where you read important books and learn about a period of time\/ specific culture.",
    "New way to think about literature, how to communicate my thoughts more effectively in a written and oral format, and a new way of seeing how the black south has manifested in its literature.",
    "In this class, I gained familiarity with a canon of literature I also learned to think more abstractly about the idea of canonization, both generally and with regards to the specific texts we studied; I had read some of the works on the syllabus before taking the class, but reading them in the context of each other was really helpful and interesting. I have, in the past, felt frustrated sometimes with classes that focus on literary history at the expense of close reading of the texts, but here, the balance between the two felt perfect and enriching of the overall experience. This class also pushed me to become a better participant in class discussion, and a better writer.",
