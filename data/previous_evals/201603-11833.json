    "I greatly improved my ability to read Latin as well as studied three different invectives of Cicero, while focusing on his topoi of abuse and his rhetorical techniques.",
    "My ability to read and translate Latin was greatly improved, and I developed a new focus of analyzing the language of the Latin passages we read.",
    "I learned some elements of invective rhetoric, as well as about Cicero's style and the rhetorical techniques he uses to make his speeches effective. A fascinating course.",
    "I learned to analyze Latin and oratory from a much more rhetorical perspective than ever before. I learned to much better analyze how use of specific verb tenses can imply numerous different things about the subjects and objects of the verbs in question. I learned how different tropes of invective are interwoven and connected."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I would have liked to have spent more time on analysis of the text and less time on translating, but on the other hand the large amount of reading we did was very helpful in improving my Latin skills.",
    "I think the fundamental flaw with Latin instruction is that it focuses too much on memorization of passages and not enough on sight translation. If the class focused more on teaching how to translate and not simply what the translations are for the passages we read, we could develop the more useful skill of translating new Latin passages by sight.",
    "An interesting, engaging course that teaches history, rhetoric, and Latin. No complaints.",
    "The class was excellent due to its covering of several different invectives throughout Cicero's career. The selection allowed us to compare his use of rhetorical devices over a broad stretch of time. The articles provided were very insightful and provided me with a lot of supplementary information about pertinent themes. The time divided between the different texts was somewhat unbalanced, however. Much more time was devoted to the Second Philippic than to the other two."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely would! Cicero's invective is a really interesting subject and a great way to improve your prose-reading skills.",
    "I would recommend it if the student were looking for a challenging course, but not to a student merely looking to fulfill a language requirement.",
    "Both fascinating and relevant, especially when you think of all the invective present in political discourse today!",
    "This course is excellent for anyone suitably advanced in Latin who would like to strengthen its connection to branches such as politics and oratory. I would certainly, however, recommend this to anyone capable of fulfilling all prerequisites and demands of the course."
