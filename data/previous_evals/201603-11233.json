   "comments": [
    "I learned many new math tools.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of calc 2.",
    "I gained insight on the formation of power series and Maclaurin\/Taylor Series. I also learned about different tests to see if series converged or not.",
    "A stronger control of calculus and a significantly improved conceptual understanding of all the material. Also, insight into how one should go about QRs at Yale.",
    "Since I had taken a similar (but much less rigorous) course in high school, this course really solidified my understanding of calculus and made me truly understand the fundamentals behind integral calculus.",
    "I learned the basics of calculus and how to build off of those basics to solve real-world problems.",
    "This was a super useful course - it equipped me with a very great foundation in Mathematics. It was taught in a really great manner and the Coursera videos were always clear.",
    "I learned how to critical think and apply math concepts in many different ways",
    "I developed an understanding of the theories and problems related to the fundamental theory of calculus. Additionally, I honed my problem solving skills.",
    "I learned concepts about integration, series, sequences and differential equations",
    "I developed an understanding of fundamental calculus and its applications to the real world.",
    "I developed my skills in calculus.",
    "I learned many different skills within the world of mathematics. Especially Taylor Series and differential equations because those two skills felt most applicable to the real world.",
    "I learned calculus.",
    "I learned more mathematical concepts and what can be done with math.",
    "I learned a lot about integration and series and error from this course. I felt like all of the concepts were well taught, and there were few concepts that I did not understand after both the videos and the class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The flip lecture style was annoying.",
    "I think this is a great class teaching all of the skills needed to master calculus 2.",
    "I like how the course uses psets, but I don't think coursera was that helpful.",
    "This courses weakness is the prep problem videos that students complete for each class period. I do not think the prep problems facilitated the teaching. I believe they actually confused students more. If students instead were assigned to read the chapter, the course could be improved.",
    "There was significant help available and a large emphasis was placed on conceptual understanding. Con - many of my classmates had already done relatively advanced calculus but the calculus below this one would've been too much review.",
    "Strengths: I like that because the course is so commonly taken, there are many resources available to study and learn material, such as lecture videos, previous exams (probably the most helpful), and many peer tutors and fellow classmates to help out with conceptual questions. Weaknesses: because there are so many sections, it seems like each section learns in a slightly different way, which can sometimes make collaboration for studying, etc. be difficult.",
    "The main weakness of the course is the way it is designed (flipped classroom).",
    "The strengths of the course were the resources it provided outside the classroom, however, I believe with the flipped classroom approach, the videos did not completely match what we were doing or were not very helpful with learning the material.",
    "The strengths are that the continuous feedback we provide following the Coursera videos are taken into account and the instructor designs the days material based on those questions we have. This makes the classes really interactive. Moreover, the instructor was always there for us during office hours.",
    "The video lectures are not very helpful",
    "The videos were helpful, but one weakness was that there wasn't enough example problems.",
    "I disliked the flipped classroom component. It felt a bit redundant to me since Brett (my professor) did a great job teaching the topics in class.",
    "I thought that the assigned videos were helpful and gave structure to the class. However, the class would benefit from more review on problems that would appear in p-sets and exams.",
    "This class is flipped, meaning that most of the material is learned through assigned videos. Sometimes the videos are not very clear so it could be tricky to follow in section unless you ask questions.",
    "Both the strength and weakness of this course are the same. This course covers a very large amount of material. This is great because my knowledge of mathematics significantly expanded. However, at the same time, this course spends very little time going over any concepts that confuse the class.",
    "The course was well designed and carried out in that we were introduced to the material through online videos, and then became familiar with them through practice problems and Brett's explanations in class. I thought it worked very well, since it prevented wasted time in class and gave us the time to go over anything that was confusing in depth. I learned well from this course",
    "The course excels in its encouragement of individual development; the requirement to watch the videos on Coursera allows for students to develop fundamental knowledge of the mathematics covered during class time. However, the video lessons and what is taught in class overlap, which makes the videos seem obsolete in practice. Also, I believe that too much class time is dedicated toward just developing the foundations for topics. I do not reject the idea of establishing those foundations, but I feel that it can be done in a much shorter amount of time. Thus, the time students have in class can be spent on actually implementing the topics in actual math problems, which would in turn be a more efficient use of the time.",
    "It has too much work as in it involves watching videos and doing prep problems before class, going to class and doing homework. This could work, but for that class time shouldn't be used to teach the same thing that is already in the videos unless the students ask for help in that field.",
    "Material was not thoroughly explained.",
    "1 on 1 meetings with the professor were very helpful. The problem sets were a bit easy which made the tests a lot harder. They didn't challenge the knowledge of the concepts. just the motion of solving the problem.",
    "The flipped class structure sometimes made new concepts difficult to learn but overall this was a very well taught class. The videos were very good."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they already have some background in calc 2 (ex: if they have taken AP calculus BC) because the course takes the same concepts and reinvents them so that they are truly understood and internalized.",
    "Yes! This is a great math class.",
    "Yes, my teacher (Brett Smith) was phenomenal and I had a great time.",
    "Yes, but work hard consistently and not just at testing time (in all classes, but especially this one).",
    "Yes, even if you have taken calc BC in high school and did well, you will still learn a lot and come out of the course with a better understanding of calculus.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it covers the basics you would need for any higher level math course.",
    "I think this course is taught in a very insightful manner. It answers many of the questions you have in maths and approaches if from a very intuitive angle. Even though I knew certain formulas beforehand, this course taught me the background behind why such formulas exist and how to derive them. That boosted my intellectual curiosity and always made me look forward to the next class!",
    "Yes if you are interested in math.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. I think it did a great job developing the basic skills that I will need in future math and stem classes.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, the class provides students with basic knowledge of calculus and helps them think critically in the realm of mathematics without challenging them too much.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is very straightforward and it is taught pretty well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. However, I would only recommend this course to another student if they are prepared to really challenge themselves in math.",
    "If you need\/want a QR credit and\/or need to take calculus as a prereq, I would recommend this course. Brett is a really good teacher and I never felt bored or lost. The only reason I wouldn't take this course is if I was only taking it for a QR credit and there was some other QR class that was less vanilla.",
    "no",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I thought that through the problem sets and classes all of the concepts were pretty clear. If you do all the assignments, the material is not that bad."
