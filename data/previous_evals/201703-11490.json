   "comments": [
    "I left the course with a basic yet comprehensive understanding of linguistics as a field of study. I learned about the different categories in syntax and how to analyze the syntax of sentences. I learned the International Phonetics Alphabet, and about different types of morphology. The class also taught me about some cognitive disorders related to language, and how research is done on cognitive function and language.",
    "Where do I start?! Virtually every single meeting (a nice mix between lecture and seminar) was FILLED with exciting light-bulb moments. Big idea wise, being introduced to the cognitive perspective on language fundamentally changed the way I think about language definitely for the better. I also learned a lot about scientific methodologies and the approaches linguists take to develop this enterprise as the course also involved a significant amount of close reading of linguistics papers, especially in the second half.",
    "Good thinking skills about science and what sort of things we can use to study the mind.",
    "This class gave me my first look into linguistics and gave me basic skills for analysis in syntax, semantics, phonetics, and morphology. More importantly, it built the foundations of linguistics as an inherently cognitive study and introduced me to looking at how language and mind are interwoven.",
    "This course changed my outlook on language and how we use it. In addition to the actual course content, I picked up useful student skills: how to give concise answers to questions, how to know when an assignment is complete, and how to ask questions in class. None of this was taught explicitly, but it was impossible not to pick up due to the nature of the teaching. Everything was very thorough. We had a lot of practice."

   "comments": [
    "This course is wonderful as a seminar-- the class environment was warm and engaging. Our professor and TA were both passionate and personable; their dedication to the personal growth and general needs of each student was exemplary. I really appreciated how the three quizzes of the class were all treated cumulatively-- this made the final exam a lot more pleasant and manageable to both study for and take. Although we had a lot of active discussion in section, most seminars were lecture-driven. Although the lecture structure worked, I found that in some classes, we would spend more time than necessary on a single section of a handout-- for example, the day that we spent the entire class looking at the one paragraph of the handout on acquisition types didn't really help me feel like I understood the topic all that much better. I appreciated the regularity of the homework assignments-- a steady workload was very much appreciated. It did take a while to get assignments back, but that was very understandable given time constraints of the professor and TA.",
    "The course is structured really well as it first introduces the diamond structure of the lexical item as the fundamental framework, then explores each of the four foci, and finally zooms back out to show how everything comes together in processing and acquisition. The only thing that is close to a weakness would probably be the lack of timeliness in turns of getting feedback on homework assignments and assessments that said, the answer sheets were always very thorough and incredibly helpful when they were finally posted.",
    "I think some people in the class found the way it was set up a bit disorganized (homework every week often had variable difficulty level, the format of the exams wasn't clear etc.), but personally, I thought it was very well done and I liked the slow-but-steady pacing.",
    "This course was fascinating, and Professor Pinango is wonderful and knowledgeable. Sometimes things seemed a little confusing and disorganized, but everything always worked out soon enough.",
    "This course demanded a high level of engagement, which was great. I think we all rose to the occasion. The handouts were helpful, and you could tell Professor Piango really cared about our learning. Overall an excellent class. I wish I could think of some improvements, but the only thing I'd want is more time in class or section to go through the material together (and that's not possible, right?). I learned so much in this class in such a short period of time."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to explore linguistics as a topic. I find that the seminar style worked really well for first-time exposure to linguistics, and Professor Piango was very dedicated to the learning of every student.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes! You learn a ton about language, but also about the mind, science, and even life in general--would be a good credit\/d probably, that way you could just sit back and enjoy the intellectual journey.",
    "This is a fantastic course, especially with Professor Pinango. It will make you love linguistics and is very accessible to nonmajors.",
    "Absolutely; take this class."
