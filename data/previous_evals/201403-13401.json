   "comments": [
    "Absolutely awful. Do not take it unless you have to (and if you have to, chances are you can take STAT 230 instead and that is a MUCH better idea). The professor's lectures were unclear and the homework assignments were confusing. A complete waste of time.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT!!! This class was absolutely HORRIBLE. Prof. Bakar struggled a lot (and we struggled with him). He was very bad at replying to emails, he once missed his office hours, did not clearly outline his homework expectations from us. Very, very, very bad class and professor.",
    "I really wish this class had been structured and taught better. It teaches incredibly important skills. Sadly, the lectures and lecture notes were incomprehensible (half because of the professor's poor grasp of English, half because he just did not know how to present information coherently, and instead spent most of his time running code that was online anyway on a projector). The pset instructions were so vague nobody ever had any idea what they were supposed to do and we were playing \"guess what the professor wants\" rather than learning. Honestly, I feel like most of the little I learned in this course was due to me furiously googling concepts while doing problem sets because I did not understand what I was doing. Don't take this class if Professor Bakar is teaching it. Just don't. Buy a good textbook if you wanna learn the subject matter. If you want to fulfill a requirement take 238.",
    "This had the potential to be a really cool course. However, the lectures were scattered, and were essentially just running through long R scripts with little theoretical motivation. The assignments were somewhat unclear, and I know a lot of people in the course were confused by the grading scheme. Only take it if you have to, or if they rethink how this course is taught.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Not a huge amount of work (7 p sets, final project, no tests), but assignments with Shuvo were extremely vague, and somewhat unrelated to class material.",
    "The material of the class seems interesting, but the class was so poorly taught that this subject has been quite ruined for me.",
    "Avoid if at all possible. Poorly taught.",
    "A heads up: this is a long review. TL;DR version: worst class ever, -infinity\/10, do not take, unless you have to, in which case sorry for you. I had to, so sorry for me. This is the worst course I have taken in my lifetime, which includes all my years of schooling in a country with a severely deficient education system, particularly in mathematics and science. I was originally going to write 30000 words in this review: one word for every dollar of tuition wasted on this class, but there is a 4000 character limit. At the beginning of the semester, my adviser asked me why I was taking this course when I could learn the material by reading a textbook on my own; unfortunately, STAT 361 is required for the applied math major. I definitely feel like I would've learned a lot more about data analysis if I had just picked up a book and casually read it in my spare time. As it were, this class felt like taking a random data analysis textbook written in Korean, copy-pasting it into Google Translate to get an English translation, then rolling a many-sided die to determine which page to turn to, and finally trying to make sense of the non-contextualized gibberish that then confronted me. There are some classic examples of woeful \"English\" in this course. For example, in the note entitled \"_lec_regularisation_.pdf\" (I know, a SUPER descriptive title), it said: \"We can centerised the response and also standardised the predictors.\" From the same note, we read, \"Some notes on ridge regression: it is suitable when (5) it shrink coefficients to zero but cannot produce a parsimonious model.\" Try as I might, I still cannot decipher what is being said in this last point. This list doesn't even include the stuff that was said in lecture - these are WRITTEN NOTES which were clearly never proofread by anybody with a semblance of English proficiency. Psets and grades in this class were a joke. The first pset said our \"client\" wants to know about Rainfall somewhere, and we were to make a report and \"make them Happy!\" We were provided no guidance on what we actually had to do \/ how we would be graded. The TA graded our psets arbitrarily, and then gave us commentary on the psets in broad, sweeping statements using the classesv2 announcement page. Unless you made those mistakes, the comments were unhelpful. Comments on the hard copy of my actual pset were often very brief, stating that I had done something incorrectly without providing guidance as to how to correct it. There was a 5% participation grade, but out of around 50 people, only 12 showed up to the final lecture (and nobody clapped at the end, which the professor deserved). There was a 5% grade for an in-class presentation on one of the psets but nobody actually did an in class presentation, and nobody was told to do so, so what happened to those grades? What a farce. Obviously we couldn't learn from the psets, but maybe we could open the door to learning with the notes? Unfortunately, this door was promptly placed in a hall of mirrors, leaving us to stumble around aimlessly looking for the real thing in a sea of obscurity. Besides the broken English, the notes were awful and difficult to follow, even incorrect, and although the syllabus promised a skeleton of structure, this was not adhered to in the class. The in-class experience felt like the IQ test in the movie \"Idiocracy\". It was basically a computer-literacy class. Load up R package, type up R code, press shift+enter, then if p-value = x, conclude y. This is what we spent hours and hours watching the professor do (unless you were smart and did something more constructive during the lecture, like play a video game and analyze the data of the game). All in all, I wouldn't recommend this class in the first place, unless it is a requirement. You're far better off reading a textbook on your own. If you do have to take this class, never ever take it with Khandoker Shuvo Bakar."
