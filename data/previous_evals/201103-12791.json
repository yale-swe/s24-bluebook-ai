    "TAKE IT. You cannot be an English major and not read these poets at least once. And Professor Brisman is uniquely wonderful.",
    "Leslie Brisman is unlike any other Professor at Yale. He is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the material, and he cares intensely for his students. The only thing you can ask of him is to occasionally be more forthcoming with his interpretations. He very much tries to lead discussion, and so if the class did not understand a poem you occasionally leave feeling as though you just missed enjoying some profound insight into the poems. But taking the class will give you a MUCH better sense of Romantic Poetry than English 126, and if you want to study Romanticism anywhere, you really should do it at Yale! Also, be prepared to spend more time writing his essays than essays for any other class. Writing for Professor Brisman requires much more thought than writing a standard, formulaic English essay. Don't be tricked by the light reading load!",
    "Challenging but rewarding course, with a varied reading list (Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Byron). Professor Brisman is extremely knowledgeable; he skillfully balanced lecture with directed discussion, and managed to address the poems for the day in terms of both close reading and the larger context of the syllabus. He was also very accessible and helpful in office hours. The trajectory from Blake to Byron, while difficult at times, was thoughtfully and articulately presented. A very enjoyable introduction to Romantic Poetry.",
    "Only take this class if you're really interesting in the poetry itself.",
    "I took the class to fulfill the ENGL 126 substitution requirement. My take-aways: Professor Brisman is an incredibly intelligent and gentle professor, but also one with very firm ideas about \"right\" and \"wrong\" readings of each poem. He's decidedly a formalist reader; each poem is distilled for the possible philosophic truths contained within. Take the class if you need it or love the Romantic Poets; avoid it if you want a more complex, personal, or historical understanding of the poems. Overall, a good course.",
    "This course is a good overview of the major Romantic Poets. It's a very solid, upper-level English class, particularly great for anyone interested in poetry, British literature, or religious themes in literary texts. The discussion dynamic of your specific class makes or breaks the class. Professor Brisman is soft-spoken, but asks great questions tolead the discussion. There are three papers well-spaced over the course of the semester and the reading load is always consistently doable. You come away from the class with a good feeling for the major Romantic Poets' work, enriched by an understanding of each poet's character, his style, and the themes he emphasized in his work.",
    "Take this class!The high Romantics are wonderful (esp Shelley and Keats)! The reading is quite manageable and always delightful. Brisman is just excellent in section. The discussions are insightful and interesting! One of the best classes I've taken at yale.",
    "This is a good, thoughtful class. Personally, I got a little tired of endless Wordsworth, so make sure you feel ready to endure that. It's worth it to get to Shelley and Keats. The papers are not long assignments, but they require a good deal of thought and revision. Brisman can be a very supportive teacher, but you have to be proactive in asking for help.",
    "Romantic Poetry, especially if Professor Brisman is teaching it, is exquisite. You read some of the most beautiful poetry and really get a sense of what's going on in each poem. If the material speaks to you, or if you think it might speak to you, take this course!"
