   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend taking this class at Yale. Writing creative works is far more enjoyable than writing analytical works. At times, having a paper due every week is hectic, but, no worries, the course slows down a lot during the last 4 weeks of the semester.",
    "Great\/enjoyable class, low stress",
    "120 will help you with your writing no matter what level you are, and it will expose you to a wide variety of authors and texts you may not have read before. Professor Hopper is awesome, totally take this class from her! She led incredible class discussions and really pushed you to reach the next level. People say 120 is a lot of work, but if you like to read and write even a little bit this class will be fun. 120 was one of the best parts of my week, and I thought of it more as a time to spend discussing literature with my friends and a great moderator than an actual class.",
    "I would recommend English 120 to anyone serious about improving their writing. Students write 5 essays on widely different topics, all creative nonfiction. If nothing else, 120 would be valuable as an introduction to different types of writing.",
    "Take it, but perhaps not with Professor Hopper. Granted, she is a very nice teacher, but she is not a \"life-changing\" teacher nor will she imrpove your writing very much. I loved the class for the individuals in it (we had a great group); Prof Hopper was ok. Additionally, her grading often seems very arbitrary, and effort does not feel particularly rewarded in the class.",
    "A difficult, but rewarding course. It definitely makes you a better writer. Classes are engaging and fun, and discussions are great. You write 5 essays in total, in draft and revision format, which is quite a bit of work, but its worth it. This is a course everyone at Yale should take.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in writing. You learn so much about different styles of non-fiction writing. You read many cultural texts and you are exposed to the life stories of famous authors. you use the skills you learn and ideas you retrieve from these readings to write your own pieces. It's amazing how much you learn. At times, we were forced to go beyond our comfort zone which was great (especially with the essay we have to write after interviewing someone).",
    "I'm not sure if I enjoyed English 120 as much as I thought I would, but perhaps this is because I got behind on the readings towards the end of the semester. It's a class that requires a lot of time to enjoy for sure, but the essay prompts are very fun and rewarding. I'm not sure exactly what I learned, but I think I became a better writer after this class. Professor Hopper was very nice and helpful in her feedback. I'd recommend it because of the essay prompts.",
    "Good introductory to writing course, definitely worthwhile.",
    "I thought the course was FANTASTIC. One of my favorite classes at Yale so far. I learned a lot, and Professor Hopper was considerate, thoughtful, and dedicated. I would definitely recommend it to almost anyone.",
    "I treated English 120 as a substantial way to fulfill a writing credit, and that's exactly what I got. My discussion section was uninspiring but still occasionally interesting, and I think I at least learned to be a little more confident in my ability to produce a decent piece of writing within time constraints. Not my favorite course, but still pretty fun."
