    "I learned valuable skills about how to write a college level essay. I learned how to introduce a quote, how to write an introduction, and the importance of a clear thesis along with subclaims for each paragraph. However, I found in silly how much the opinions of different english or writing resources differed. The writing center would tell me something different from my residential college writing tutor which would tell me something different from my professor. Ultimately, my professor would mark the work wrong if it was not something that he believed in for the style of writing which is not fair.",
    "I learned how to write a college level paper and I also learned a lot about the feminist side to sports and American culture.",
    "I learned the basic aspects of writing an essay which I improved upon as the semester went on."

   "comments": [
    "The course focused too much on femininity in sports and not enough on the media and society associated with sports.",
    "It has a very strict template for writing papers that limits a student's creativity and liberty with writing. It would be difficult to apply it to other kinds of papers. However, the subject was very interesting.",
    "The grading was very hard at the beginning and not what I expected. However I did learn a lot. The amount of work could have been turned down a bit because it was just a lot to do."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course but I would inform them of the workload. Also the poor feedback from the instructor and the inflexibility in style of writing on grading.",
    "I would recommend freshmen take this course. The class will improve your writing and prepare you to write at the level required by Yale. I feel much better about writing future academic papers at Yale because of this course.",
    "Overall, the course did end up helping me even though it was a lot of work. Most of the time, the first draft that I turned in looked nothing like my final draft and I ultimately became a better writer because of all the revisions. Even though the class can be tedious at times because of all the rewriting, I'd still recommend it as a way to improve as a writer.",
    "Yes, the course was very hard and time consuming but also taught me a lot."
