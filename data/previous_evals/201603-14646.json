    "I developed a good understanding of how psychology research is conducted and leaned the basic skills necessary to craft my own research project and analyze the data.",
    "I learned how to properly analyze and interpret data, how to write a literature review, how to write a research report, and I learned a lot about research methods as a whole.",
    "I learned how to design research projects and analyze data with SPSS.",
    "This class was challenging. Not because the course material was hard, per se. But I enrolled in this class with the hope of learning a bit about how to conduct psychology research, and was particularly curious about research being conducted on emotions. I did not learn how to conduct psychology research. Although I've 'written' two reports, I feel far from confident about my abilities to write a full APA-style research paper. And that concerns me--this class neglected to prepare me for my thesis.",
    "Learned pretty well how to conduct research through a survey and how to write research reports."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course does not have very many graded assignments; the majority are in-class quizzes about the textbook chapters, and many of the questions are confusingly worded or related to unemphasized topics in the textbook, such that students do not know what to focus on when studying.",
    "I can't think of anything that needs to be done to improve this course. I loved it!",
    "This course has a lot of potential. It would have been much better if we were in a more engaged seminar setting and more discussion took place (which is partially the students' fault for not being engaged enough).",
    "Strengths: individual meetings with Professor Siemer helped students organize their thoughts and get more of a sense of where they stood in the class. Weaknesses: The course syllabus should be set from the first few weeks of the semester--it should not be adjusted and readjusted until the last week of classes. Students would also appreciate if deadlines for each portion of each project (group and individual) were made clear, and if feedback were given promptly. Within each class time, students would benefit from a little more structure. Many days we worked on our own, but on the few days that Professor Siemer taught, I did not feel as though I learned much.",
    "It was good for learning how to write a report and analyze data, but many of the classes were somewhat unproductive and there wasn't that much instruction.",
    "This was not a good course, as it should have been considering it is required for the psychology major. It is not intellectually challenging and the professor puts no time or effort into his work, which made students less motivated and made the class feel like a waste of time when I could have taken a class in which I could have actually learned something and progressed in my academic career.",
    "Get rid of the quizzes More structured grading and assignment feedback would be helpful The group project was fun Meetings were helpful"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to psychology majors seeking to fulfill the research methods requirement.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student because Professor Siemer is great, and I learned a lot!",
    "If you want to take a research methods class, your safest bet is to take the class taught by the DUS.",
    "No, the class is not well organized and not at all stimulating. Professor Siemer changed the syllabus (including deadlines) about ten times throughout the semester, and there were classes in which he would not announce classroom location changes, or he would simply cancel the class without informing all the students. He gave no feedback on any work done throughout the course, and we were not even able to complete all the assignments because some papers required his feedback followed by our revisions, but he failed to ever give us any feedback so we were not able to submit final copies of our papers.",
    "Probably the easiest option to get rid of the research methods requirement for the psych major"
