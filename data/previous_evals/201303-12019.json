   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, it will get anyone to start writing, and that is not an easy thing to do.",
    "If you are the least bit interested in creative writing, this is a good class in which to explore that interest. There are a lot of small writing assignments, but they are engaging. Overall, fun course.",
    "Yes...and no. Depends on what you want from your writing experience",
    "I really liked being able to explore creative writing more through a class and have access to established writers.",
    "This is an amazing class. You write 3 1.5 pages of fiction, focusing on some sort of exercise (once we focused on Hemingway style writing). Then about 5 poems. Then 5 scenes and a monologue for the drama unit. The course says that no experience is needed, which is true. People of all backgrounds apply for the class andget in. But be warned we are at Yale and everyone is creative and talented, so you do have to work to get a decent grade. But it is amazing when we workshop each other's works. Also, there is at most 2 short stories to read for each class, but we barely discussed outside reading so no one really did it. I think they should incorporate workshopping real authors more because let's be honest: that's how we'll all get better. It's not a writing credit, which is ridiculous.",
    "I mean... I guess. There was very little work, so that might appeal to someone. But I don't really think you should take it with high hopes to come out an amazing creative writer.",
    "A class like this will get you started writing, and introduce you very briefly to fiction, poetry, and drama. The guest speakers will be wonderful and your peers will be enthusiastic. I would not recommend Professor Hammer's section, though I cannot comment on the relative quality of the others.",
    "Great exposure to creative writing at a beginners level, and easily accessible for all majors. Workload is bearable, but it is certainly helpful to start working on assignments early. The hardest assignment is the final portfolio at the end of the semester",
    "This is a cool class if you're considering creative writing. It has a section for prose, poetry, and theater, so you get a taste of everything. I don't know about the other sections, but Langdon Hammer's workshops kept me wanting. He seems to withhold from any concrete criticisms, and he's not very good at getting the class to open up. It's hard to know how to improve your work with him. Otherwise the group lectures are consistently interesting with one or two outstanding classes. The assignments are weekly and not overly arduous. Take it if daily themes frightens you. They say it's introductory but lots of juniors and seniors were in my class.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who has never taken a creative writing class, especially if they do not think of pursuing it more seriously.",
    "As someone who's always loved writing, this class was an absolute dream. It was just wonderful to have a chance to explore different forms of creative writing, particularly poetry and drama, which I had never really worked with before. And to listen to It was very enjoyable, and I think I can say that I've learned a lot about myself as a writer. If you have any interest in writing, regardless of how much experience you may or may not have...if you as willing to (as I think the syllabus put it, and I paraphrase) embark on the journey of writing will take you on, then I highly recommend this course.",
    "This class is great for trying out your hand at see real different types of creative writing. Professor Hammer was great at communicating with students and the mix of lecture and seminar classes kept things interesting."
