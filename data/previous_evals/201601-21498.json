   "comments": [
    "A really great course for any HSHM major. I felt like this course in many ways contextualized science, and allowed us to break down basic conceptions of how science should be practiced in order to better understand its value.",
    "A fantastic seminar. The workload is much heavier than other HSHM seminars that I have taken - 150-200 pages of reading\/week, 3 discussion questions\/week, 3 discussion responses, 1 midterm, and 1 fianl. The readings were fascinating and encompassed a wide range of topics. We also had 2 field (to the Prum Laboratory and to Yale's Glassblowing Laboratory) which were a lot of fun. Professor Ramalingam is very knowledgeable and kind. She led some very interesting class discussions, and gave excellent feedback on my writing. I would highly recommend this course, especially to STEM majors, as it provided me with a whole new perspective on scientific research.",
    "This class is extremely interesting, especially as a HSHM major or someone majoring in the sciences. There is A LOT of reading, and it can get dry at times, but Chitra is a wonderful discussion leader. You will learn a lot about the study of science, though it may take a lot to get there.",
    "Would recommend! A good look at the intersection of science and the humanities; central themes are pedagogy, knowledge and ownership, social roles in laboratories, the question of race and gender"
