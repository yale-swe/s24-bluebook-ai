    "It gave general helpful information for being a graduate student, specifically at Yale. Some of the information was helpful to me immediately, but other information may prove more useful later in my career, including the information about the article preparation and review process. This course somewhat contributed to my advancement short-term (though research time for my lab rotations was reduced), but I believe it will also aid me long-term.",
    "Really important course for a career in science.",
    "In particular, I thought the lecture on grant writing and the lecture on giving good scientific talks were useful and timely."
