   "comments": [
    "a lot of dense material covered somewhat quickly, so going to class, paying attention, and staying on top of material were important; recommended if you are thinking about grad school\/research",
    "If you are into Econometrics, take it! Profesor Meghir is a bit of a dry lecturer, but the material is pulled together in a compelling way. The class is a bit deceiving: the exercise sheets are ungraded, so there seems to be very little work except the midterm, final, and 2 assessed projects. That being said, it can catch up to you very quickly around midterm and final times.",
    "Take it. It's easy and very interesting. and very helpful.",
    "if it's with Costas, take it right now - applicable for the rest of your econ adventures",
    "Material is pretty easy up until the first midterm, and gets a little harder (but still very manageable) in the second half of the course. Those majoring in economics really should take this class; don't just take econ 131. This class is much more practical than econ 136 (I shopped it and know some people taking that class). For those choosing between 132 and 136, I'd say only take 136 if you plan to do graduate economics, or, of course, if you're doing the Econ+Math major.",
    "This course provided a solid foundation in concepts required to do empirical econometrics. Will be very useful for the senior thesis. The course was extremely well taught. Papers and empirical examples from the econometrics literature were very nice to have alongside the theoretical examination of topics. The class size was small and the course was low stress overall. Professor Meghir is a very reasonable, kindman. Would highly recommend.",
    "Econ 132 includes some really interesting studies and statistical methods. You learn plenty about regressions and read some interesting studies, but it can get a bit dull. Take it for the econ credit and you won't regret it.",
    "Yes! Definitely. I really enjoyed this course! One of my favorites at Yale. I really liked the structure of the class and liked having the notes t refer to which made paying attention in class easy. I liked the projects and I felt I learned how to design an experiment, read papers, understand data and use STATA - all extremely important skills. I also really liked the fact that problem sets were not graded as that reduced the pressure of the course - but perhaps the teacher may want to reconsider that as it led us not workconsistently. All in all, i loved the class material and professor and the TA Alex was great!",
    "I recommend this course to any students who have taken some statistics classes before, and want to learn how to use statistics in Economics research project. It's not as hardcore as Econ 136, but I feel I learned a lot more applicable knowledge in this class than how much I would have learned in Econ 136.",
    "It's a good course! It's not too much work and is quite interesting!",
    "I would recommend this class to any economics major interested in learning more about data analysis. It is useful for the senior essay if you are doing your own research and is also useful to know if you'll be using data at all either in a future job or graduate school. If you're going to take this class, I'd recommend taking it with Professor Meghir.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course with Professor Meghir. He focuses on making sure that the class understands key concepts and their applications. Weekly exercise sheets were optional, and there were two projects with provided data that were very interesting. Exams were fair. If you felt fine with Econ 131, then take this course to get a better idea of some importantissues not covered in 131.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a good course, covering well both the mathematical and intuitive sides of regression, bias and efficiency. It is homework light, but not light on concepts."
