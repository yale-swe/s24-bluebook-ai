    "The course looks at how radiation affects everything--from everyday human life to the stars.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT, IT'S REALLY NOT AS INTERESTING AS IT SOUNDS. I know you're looking at it for a science credit that requires little science, but it's not worth it. The format of the class is simply not conducive to attention-paying.",
    "If you are a science buff you will like it, but expect to do a lot of writing for the mid term and final. Other than that, there's really no work and you get a lot out of it only if you are already interested in the material.",
    "I really would not take this course again. While very easy, it is very boring sometimes. The papers are not bad, and this is no reading. However, because there is so little work, you actually disengage and stop caring about the course.",
    "This class covers a lot of interesting material, although some of it is hard to understand. It's tough to discuss because we don't know a lot of background information, so Professor Parker ends up lecturing a bit. However, other than sometimes repeating himself, Professor Parker is really intelligent and funny. He tries to get you involved, even though sometimes it's difficult. Ifyou're interested in radiation and\/or the universe, this is a good class, but if you don't have any interest it'd be best to stay away. This class is a good way for humanities types to get a science credit, as the bulk of the classwork is in two papers, one is about fifteen pages and the other close to thirty.",
    "If you like physics or are considering majoring in a science, I would definitely recommend this class. The work the majority of the semester is very light, and if you are genuinely interested, this is your chance to learn what you like without being distracted by grades. The midterm and final essays are much longer than your usual essay (10 and 20 pages 1.5 spaced), however, you have plenty of time to do it, as there is very little work assigned aside from them.",
    "I would, because there is interesting material and you learn to budget time in writing two extensive papers for the class."
