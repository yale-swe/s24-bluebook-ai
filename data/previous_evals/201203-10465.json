    "Professor Spielman is awesome. This course was very hard, but it will improve your abilities to do math if you put in the effort. The material is also really cool. I would definitely shop it, although I would make sure there's room in your schedule to take it.",
    "Definitely recommended. Spielman is a master of this area and makes the class very interesting. Check out his lectures from previous years to see if the material interests you.",
    "Dan is one of the best instructors I've had in any course. He spends a lot of time and energy preparing for his lectures and it shows. The course is well-organized and thought out. The problem sets are also manageable.",
    "Literally the best course I've taken at Yale (as an undergrad). I was always excited to work on the thoughtfully crafted problem sets. Dan claims at the beginning that the necessary background is elementary. This was very hard to believe at first, but he really does manage to make it that accessible, as long as you're prepared to do as much thinking as it takes. Lecture notes, posted online, are even better than a textbook; references are gratuitously provided for further exploration. You'll come out with a great intuitive understanding of spectral theory, and he provides many springboards to access various applications, extensions, and open problems. This has enhanced my life.",
    "Take the class if you are willing to be into it and put in a lot of time and effort on problem sets. It a really cool subject and a great class. Dan is clearly excited about the material and he gets you excited as well. Great class. Hard class.",
    "would definitely recommend this class to anyone with a solid math background, because otherwise this class could be a struggle. being very solid in linear algebra is extremely useful in this class, though I am by no means great at linear algebra and still made it through fine.",
    "I would recommend this course to my fellow students.",
    "I would only recommend this class to those with prior knowledge and comfort with linear algebra. It's actually more of a(n applied) math course than a computer science one, but it covers information that is certainly useful for analyzing and classifying datasets."

   "comments": [
    "Very useful. I am working on some high-dimensional graphical models which are related to this course in some sense.",
    "I'm only an undergrad, but the course confirmed my desire to study theoretical computerscience in graduate school.",
    "As an undergrad, this has made me a lot more mathematically mature in a way that nothing else had done before. My research interests have been forcefully pulled towards CS theory.",
    "Showed me an area of math out there that I hope to learn more about and a way of thinking that I could never have imagined.",
    "It would be very important for my dissertation.",
    "This course allowed me to realize how much information I have yet to learn in order to be more effective at data processing."
