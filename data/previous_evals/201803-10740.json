    "I greatly improved my verbal and written Chinese through this course. Never before have I seen such an improvement in my Chinese over the course of one semester.",
    "I wasn't very sure I was placed correctly when I first started taking this course. Professor Sun told me to trust her, and she would place me accordingly. In taking this course, I realized how to spend time studying and also crucially analyze the differences in culture between what I grew up with and what narrative lies behind the language I was learning. I grew to realize that you only get as much out of Chinese as the effort you put in. For that, I put in ample amounts of effort and started seeing results immediately in listening and speaking fluency.",
    "I gained skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening to Chinese. I also learned about Chinese culture.",
    "A large amount of Chinese vocabulary, the ability to use it, more ease in speaking Chinese with others, knowledge of many creative grammar structures, growth in writing and character ability, and most of all a very strong (and transferable!) work ethic.",
    "This was my first Chinese course at Yale, so I have no real frame of reference. It seemed that the course focused a lot on building our conversational vocabulary and phrase knowledge with plenty of opportunities to practice fluent speaking. There was also a lot of emphasis on character writing, which was new for me, but the process of learning so many characters was a reward in itself.",
    "I learned a lot of new grammar skills, vocab, and some vernacular phrases",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was very challenging. There were quizzes and tests every day as well as homework and other assignments. At the time, it was somewhat difficult to manage, but in hindsight it was crucial to the massive improvement my Chinese has undergone. Every day we had to use our verbal skills to engage the class which I think was another aspect of the class that I found especially helpful to my Chinese. My only critique is the Quia homework which was sometimes confusing.",
    "I like how every aspect of this course is weighted about equally, and there is no need to worry if you do too badly on one aspect of the course, because effort and participation count just as much as results and scores. I think a weakness of this course is that it is only offered in the mornings (as with all or most language courses), and so sometimes I cannot bring myself to concentrate or fully engage myself in the content as much as I would like to. With Chinese, memorization is a huge part of progress. If I am up late the previous night trying to memorize these characters, I believe in having a good night's sleep to solidify what I've practiced into my long-term memory. That couldn't really have been accomplished with the time that these classes were going on. Another weakness is the discrepancies I have seen with placing Cantonese-speaking students. I speak Cantonese fluently, and yet I was placed on the non-heritage track, whereas other Cantonese-speaking students I know were placed on the heritage track. I don't really mind which track to be on (I rather enjoy the non-heritage track), I just wish there was a solid placement for Cantonese speakers so I have some people taking the same class (not necessarily the same section) that I can relate with.",
    "Strengths: the course is incredibly well taught by an excellent instructor. The pace is very good. I believe it's the only way for me to make progress.",
    "The daily quizzes and dictations are wonderful and do a great job of addressing different aspects of the dialogue from each week. Sun also uses each minute of class time to the utmost. The essays and oral presentations are also helpful to keep up writing ability. And the tests seem catered to what we are learning. This is an extremely difficult course, which is to be expected from a 1.5 credit language. That said, keeping up with the (very intensive) work of the class is possible, and if you do so, then you can do well and learn so much. The Quia quizzes, however, take an enormous amount of time with very little academic \/ learning reward, and feel very separate from the material in the rest of the course. Also, they are inexplicably worth 10% of the class. Especially at the beginning, it was difficult for me to integrate time & space for Quia with the rest of the class material and workload. Perhaps I felt this way because I struggled with two elements of Chinese learning: reading and listening. I would love to do more in-class listening work, and perhaps more reading assignments outside of the dialogues. Quia was one of the only places we really focused on reading and listening, and I think it did not make up for the gap in reading\/listening during class, and so the Quia reading\/listening became insurmountably difficult. I look forward to next semester, where I will be aware from the beginning of the Quia workload and can enlist more help, and perhaps will find them helpful for reading and listening.",
    "Quia doesnt help me learn Chinese.",
    "Strengths: Sun Laoshi is such a wonderful teacher! She's very patient and kind which is really encouraging when you're studying such a difficult language. Weaknesses: I wish we spent a little more time learning about Chinese culture.",
    "The teachers are fantastic but the textbook is not nearly as good as the previous semester"

    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to improve their language who is willing to put in the effort to do so.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. CHNS 130 was by far my favorite course of the semester. Once you got used to the workload, you find yourself totally immersed in the course and in the Chinese language as well. There is a good balance between reading\/writing and listening\/speaking, and a lot of the textbook content studied has to do with not only promoting student success but also promoting a healthy student lifestyle. These are lessons not only teaching a different language but also that you should take care of yourself during these times of college.",
    "Yes, this is probably the best course I have ever taken and it is a truly unique and fantastic opportunity. I would recommend it to everyone.",
    "I would recommend this course to a serious student of Chinese. The workload is extremely intense and not for someone who does not really enjoy studying Chinese. It also requires a lot of in-class participation; for an hour every morning, Chinese 130 students have to be prepared to really focus, pay attention, listen, and speak. This is not a casual class but it is a very rewarding one.",
    "Yes.",
    "Definitely take this course with Sun Laoshi!",
    "Yes",
    "Chinese is really hard. Like incredibly hard. If you don't have a really good reason for taking it, it will be difficult to see it through. The teachers are amazing and you will learn the language whether you like it or not."
