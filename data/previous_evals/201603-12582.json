    "A lot of very interesting material, and Professor Clark knows so much! Very interesting and engaging discussions.",
    "There was a lack of respect for the professor by some students in the class (ex: speaking over the professor, interrupting the professor, etc. etc). This was distracting and not conducive to productive discussion - the professor is absolutely amazing and her knowledge was often not available because of the lack of respect shown her and the other students. Perhaps in the future this behavior should be privately noted to the students so as not to take away from others' learning.",
    "Every class included an analytical evaluation and discussion of assigned reading and film, which was an excellent source of gaining deeper understanding of the events that transpired at a certain period of time and how they affected the world of cinematography, literature and art in Russia."

    "Absolutely! It's a unique opportunity to read and watch very recent cultural production form Russia, and professor Clark always knows so much relevant information, it is a huge pleasure and privilege to be in the class with her. I would highly recommend to anyone, Russian major or not!",
    "Yes. The period covered is absolutely necessary and the selection of texts is very useful as the professor does not choose commonly taught texts\/films. She exposes the students to relatively new material and this is integral to knowledge of the cannon.",
    "It is a great course, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Russian culture.",
    "I would recommend Dr. Clark's class to anyone who is interested in Russian film, art and history.",
    "Yes, it is truly and honor to be taught by Professor Clark."
