    "I learned an enormous amount about the inner workings, traditions, and problems of mainstream journalism, as well as the minute details of how political campaigns work. I also learned how the 2016 campaign fit into the broader context of political journalism and campaign convention. By the end of this class, I found myself equipped with the tools to understand and evaluate the current (but changing) landscape of political journalism, and the understanding I need to conduct further independence research in the areas.",
    "You'll learn so much about the various presidential campaigns, and how the media portrayed them! It's absolutely worth it to take this class if you're interested in the evolution of media and presidential campaigns. Professor Shapiro is an absolute gem!"

    "Professor Shapiro made this seminar engaging and interesting! Most of the time, the course was really him sharing stories from the campaign trail.",
    "Professor Shapiro is brilliant and kind, and full of funny anecdotes and in possession of a formidable treasure trove of knowledge about journalists and how they cover political campaigns. The reading list is absolutely incredible, filled with classics that are a privilege to read. One weakness, though, was class discussion, which oscillated between interesting but disjointed and fascinating and coherent. Professor Shapiro did a good job facilitating the discussion, but on some days things boiled down to a series of intriguing but not necessarily related comments. Also, on a more personal level, I wished the weighting of the class was a little more even, so that so much of the final course grade hinged on the final paper.",
    "The strength of this class is definitely Professor Shapiro! His breadth of knowledge, humor, and genuine concern for students is awesome. I found the reading interesting and the work was totally manageable. Only complaint is that the paper topics were vague and sometimes I did not know what to write.",
    "Strengths- Professor Shapiro, the material we learned, guest speakers weaknesses- None- if you love presidential campaigns and media, then you'll love this class!"

    "Absolutely. Professor Shapiro is an experienced practitioner with years of experience covering presidential candidates. He organized the course with a clear theme and all of the readings were well-picked and relevant. Highly recommend the course!",
    "This was a great class. My favorite of the entire year and one of my top classes of my Yale career. Prof. Shapiro is the man. He has been in the business for decades and sometimes the best days are when he shares his stories and experiences from working as a political reporter for decades. He has met many presidents and knows top politicians and journalists personally. The readings are interesting. I'm actually keeping the books that we didn't finish and read more than was required some weeks. Class is very chill yet engaging (never felt bored and tired even though its in the late afternoon). Prof. Shapiro has standards and he'll let you know how to meet them. I would say this is the ideal senior seminar but of course you can take it other years if you're lucky enough to get in.",
    "A fascinating analysis of the media's evolving role in presidential campaigns over the last 60 years. The readings were always interesting, the discussions were engaging, and the papers let you explore the questions you find most pressing. A phenomenal poly sci seminar.",
    "Going into this class, I was hoping to learn some stuff about political journalism, how the news media works and how the landscape is changing, and how presidential candidates conduct their campaigns. I learned about all of that and more, coming away with a depth of understanding about the minutia of the norms of political journalism and the people it purports to cover. What is taught in this course is essential to understanding so much of what is happening in the US political realm today, and to understanding what the big questions in political journalism are and why. Professor Shapiro is an incredibly kind and wise professor. He makes the classroom feel like a homely environment. He tells these wonderful anecdotes drawn from his storied 40-year+ career as a political journalist that both elicit laughter while elucidating and crystallizing some essential point he wants to make. It's really a privilege you won't get elsewhere to learn from a professor with as much experience in the field, and the accumulated wisdom derived from that experience, as Professor Shapiro. The reading list is absolutely incredible; in fact, I'd say that the class is almost worth taking solely on the basis of getting a chance to read these texts and discuss them with a knowledgable professor. What It Takes and Making of the President 1960 were my favorites, but all of the books, with maybe an exception or two, were utterly absorbing reads, so enjoyable that doing the (hefty) reading assignments barely felt like work. One weakness, though, was class discussion, which oscillated between interesting but disjointed and fascinating and coherent. Professor Shapiro did a good job facilitating the discussion, but on some days things boiled down to a series of intriguing but not necessarily related comments. Also, on a more personal level, I wished the weighting of the class was a little more even, so that so much of the final course grade hinged on the final paper. But those are minor points in what was otherwise a wonderful seminar. If you get in, take it!",
    "Yes! Professor Shapiro is great. He has covered the last 10 or so presidential campaigns, so there is no one more qualified to teach this course. Plus, he makes \"bad jokes\" that will keep you entertained all semester. If you're interested in journalism and\/or the past and future of media norms then this is a great class for you. If you like presidential campaigns and history, then you'll also enjoy the reading and discussions, but just know that the papers are focused on journalism.",
    "YES! Take this class! Professor Shapiro is a gem, and if you're interested in the content then you'll love it! Reading can be a bit heavy at times, but it's well worth it."
