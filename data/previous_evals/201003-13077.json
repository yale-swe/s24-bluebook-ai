   "comments": [
    "Prof. Kocher is very invested in the class, and it's worthwhile if you're a) interested in the topic and b) get a strong group to discuss it with. I think that my class was not putting a lot of work into the readings every week, in part because the class was so early and no one was meeting to discuss beforehand, which made the class harder to run.",
    "I would highly recommend Professor Kocher's seminar, though beware that you will not find many (or any) answers to the questions posed in the syllabus regarding Nationalism and Ethnicity. You may leave the course feeling like you understand very little about ethnic and Nationalist politics, but you will for sure have acquired an extensive intellectual baggage with which to explore the themes in a very educated, enlightened manner.",
    "This class sets up the foundations of nationalism and ethnicity, and a lot of the theories behind it. Thus, you up reading a lot of the seminal works done on nationalism and ethnicity. However, as the course progresses, there is a lot of detailed, and case specific readings which, if you're not into this particular subject, could very well bore you from really doing well in this class. The students who were the most engaged and were loving the course were the ones who seemed to care passionately about this subject and or had done prior research.Keep that in mind as you shop this class.",
    "Yes, take it if you're interested in taking a theory based class. Interesting material and Prof Kocher was great at leading discussion and picking out readings. He kept the class lively despite the fact that it was at 9.20.",
    "It is exactly what the title and the syllabus say. If you are interested, Professor Kocher is a great guy, very smart, wonderful discussion-leader and totally friendly. The subject is super interesting, the reading is pretty intriguing, but can get a little dense in the middle of the semester. Just try to stay on top of it.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in the theories behind ethnicity and nationalism. Professor Kocher is very knowledgeable, and a great discussion leader. The readings he has prepared are tough and sometimes long, but very worthwhile. The discussions you have (so long as enough people have read the book and are willing to contribute to discussion) are rewarding. I recommend this book for anyone interested in thinking about nationalism and ethnicity critically.",
    "Great course, if you're interested in the material. Not too much work, but what you do you need to do well. Discussions are high-quality and prof is great in summarizing important theories and makes you ask and answer the right questions. Maybe first class will throw you off, but this class is very much worth it and the prof nicer than he might seem."
