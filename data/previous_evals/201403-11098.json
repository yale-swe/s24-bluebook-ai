    "I would recommend the class, but caution about the heavy workload involved.",
    "The material is interesting, but the teaching isn't great",
    "If you read the textbook and listen in class you can learn useful information about how neurons function and basic circuitry of the nervous system. I would only recommend the course to another student in the context of providing the means to learn some neuroscience basics if the student didn't already have that background. I would not recommend the course on the basis of engaging or useful teaching.",
    "At graduate level, this course might not be appropriate as it barely touches many topics and rarely goes in depth.",
    "It is a fundamental course for any student who is interested in neuroscience. It can make student know what is neuroscience together with the important technologies for neurobiology research. I will surly recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "Again, much of the information covered does not appear to be applicable to the average neuroscience grad student. I, for one, found the class much more distracting than useful. My own research is at the systems level.",
    "The course provides me with a broad overview of neuroscience, which is helpful especially at the beginning of grad school.",
    "I had very little background in cellular physiology, so the course provided useful information and understanding about membrane potentials and how neurons function.",
    "I do not think it will significantly contribute to my research.",
    "Really helpful. It made me clear that is neuroscience.",
    "This course provided an enormous amount of in-depth knowledge that helped prepare me for future research in my discipline."
