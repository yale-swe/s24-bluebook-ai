   "comments": [
    "Arabic is much harder this term. Hasmik does a better job teaching but there is way more vocab and way more work assigned.",
    "Arabic 120 is challenging, but no more so than 110. It focuses more on speaking than 110, but still remains mostly focused on grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are very invested in Arabic. You have to put A LOT of time into this language, and if you aren't totally okay with that, then it'll be a long semester.",
    "Yes because it is Arabic and it is cool. No because we spent a lot of time doing things that didn't really teach us anything.",
    "Spare yourself if it's not too late.",
    "The Arabic language is beautiful, intricate, and complex, and anyone who is willing to spend extra time reviewing the material and battling an apathetic classroom environment should definitely take this course. A lack of intrinsic motivation would make this course very challenging, however.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of frustrating and time-consuming work, with little apparent payoff. You will learn grammar extensively, and the vocabulary that you do learn will seem either too arcane or too specific to use in any discourse whatsoever. That being said, depending on your language goals, this class may be necessary to take, and if that is the case I do recommend it.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have a deep rooted desire to take arabic that will not be killed by endless hours of frustration.If you're just looking to fulfill a language requirement, save yourself and take french. Or chinese even.",
    "I'm really glad I took it; I now have a solid grasp of basic grammar and vocabulary, and I can read quickly. You'll hear a lot of bad things about it, but this was actually one of my favorite classes until the last month. Then I got frustrated, because we weren't learning anything new. It seems as if the department is putting a really serious effort into improving the class, so it will probably be a lot better next year.",
    "If you're really passionate about learning Arabic then take it. If not, the class can get overwhelming and frustrating often times. It meets every day and you either have a homework assignment, a conversation to memorize, a quiz, or a test each of those days. So it is a major time commitment. Coming out of it, I feel like I did get a strong foundation in grammar and I can formulate basic sentences. But don't expect to be speaking fluently (or even close) just after taking this class.",
    "If you're in L1 and debating to go on to L2, just do it. It does get better, even though its still a terrible experience. Don't wimp out and lose the 1.5 credit. Just take it and get it over with.",
    "Hard. A lot of work. Don't really learn Arabic coming out of it. Don't take it unless you REALLY REALLY want to take Arabic.",
    "Not recommended. Poorly run course, does little to teach effective language use, widely recognized as a sub-par department in my conversations with students past and current, advisors, professors and deans.",
    "Don't take Arabic at Yale. I don't know anyone who's been happy about the experience, myself very much included.",
    "You need to take 120 to get credit for 110, so this is more directed towards Arabic at Yale in general: if they have not changed the syllabus (specifically the emphasis on the stories and their vocabulary) and the teaching (amount of Arabic spoken, the rotation system), I would seriously reconsider whether taking Arabic here is a good idea.",
    "There are definitely room for improvements in the course.",
    "Take Arabic at Yale only if you REALLY want to study Arabic. several attempts at reforming the department have been made, but to no avail.the teachers are nice, but the department head, shady, is disorganized and uncommunicative, and it reflects on the entire arabic program at Yale.",
    "AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE. I had some background in Arabic before I came and I still found this course\/curriculum\/Arabic department to be impossible to deal with.",
    "Only take if you can't do a better program in the summer. Look into Middlebury Summer Arabic.",
    "I would say to a fellow student to take a pass on this class if he or she is not dead serious about learning Arabic. The course is challenging and very time-consuming, and there can be long periods where you don't feel like you are learning anything (although in the end you are usually surprised by what you know). I personally intend to stick with the sequence all the way through and I think that, with more listening\/speaking drills, I will actually be able to use Arabic by the time I'm done.",
    "Yeah, I guess. If you have good reasons to take the language, take it. Pretty good class, if you work you'll learn a lot of arabic. A lot of grammar will be taught and you shall have the option of receiving it within your mind. If you seize the chance, you can grab a lot of knowledge in your first year. Much can be learned. The stated goal the course: learning Modern Standard will also be met by the instructors. Of course, there's the obvious problem with that, the proliferation of dialects in the Arab World that range in far more drastic measures than the English language. So...yeah.",
    "I recommend Arabic as a language but not this particular program. Grammar is thrown at the students without much active use of the material. Teachers unreasonably expect students to know\/memorize concepts without adequate resources or effective activities. Class is often a waste of time as instructors need to learn how to effectively use the time. They are also not open to criticism so it is difficult to propose improvements. The structure of the course is modeled after the Japanese\/Chinese language program at Yale and the department is bewildered as to why the outcomes are not the same. That is because those programs are very well-run and very structured. The teachers switch everyday but everyone is on the same page so this method works well. But in the Arabic department, there is often little communication between teachers so switching is not as effective. Classes throughout the semester often fell short. Only a few times, did I walk out of the class feeling as though it was worth the time and effort. The department needs to develop effective teaching strategies\/activities using student feedback to develop a better program."
