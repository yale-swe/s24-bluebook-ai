    "130 is definitely a lot more chill than 120. You spend most of your classtime going over things you're supposed to read from the course packet and learning very little new grammar. I would definitely recommend taking 130 with Oscar if you can. He wants you to learn, but he doesn't expect your whole life to be espa\u00f1ol, so if you miss a homework assignment every now and then or can't form a question in Spanish and have to use English, it's not a huge deal.",
    "Take it with Oscar. He's fun, nice, and a great teacher."
