   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Not overly large workload, gives a nice overview to the seminal works of political theory. Lectures are generally relatively engaging. Would recommend more for people interested in the applications of philosophy to politics than to those interested in abstract, higher level philosophy.",
    "Great class -- it is what you make of it. Take it if you're interested in political philosophy or EP&E. If reading old white men talking about the nature of western society angers you then probably not a good course for you, though the main focus is in modern implications of these theories. Not too much work but very gratifying.",
    "MoFoPo is a very interesting, basic, and comprehensive introduction to political philosophy.",
    "good look into political theorists of the modern era. i would recommend it because it looks into theorists of all ideologies and eras",
    "MoFoPo is an introductory political philosophy course. Start here if you want to (or feel like you need to) know more about major theorists like Locke, Hobbes, Bentham, Mill, Marx, Engels, Kant, Rawls, Nozick, Burke, MacIntyre, Rousseau, Habermas, and Madison (among a few others). I cannot speak to Intro to Political Philosophy. **Disclaimer** I took the course Credit\/D. Ian Shapiro is charming; you may find some of your classmates annoying, but MoFoPo really has a low barrier of entry with regards to understanding what you read. Speaking of reading, you can get away with not doing it, but you can't get away with not understanding it. If you do the reading, which I did (most of), don't dwell on what you understand. Either Shapiro or your TF or friends in the class will explain what you don't know. I took this course NON-writing intensive. Non-WR students took a midterm (30%), a final (50%), and were graded on section participation (20%). The midterm is an hour-long, in class, open note exam. Questions are of the identify, compare\/contrast, and\/or analyze type. There is also a short essay. Succinct regurgitation of all relevant material, in addition to making **unique**, refutable arguments, while acknowledging counter-claims should get you at least an A-. The final this year was a long essay (only one prompt, but very all-encompassing). I reiterate that I am glad to have taken it Credit\/D, but the prompt, itself wasn't too difficult if you outline and follow my above advice for the midterm. This exam is also open-note. Section participation is part attendance, part submitting discussion question\/reading response, and the rest talking. You don't have to be the know-it-all, but people appreciate those who don't act like they know everything. [Writing intensive are two papers of 25% each that are 2500-3000 words, the same final worth only 30%, and section participation of 20%.] The midterm is easy for the 30% it's worth, but I understand not wanting half your grade to be the final. I do not regret this course. The longer it goes on, the more you appreciate it. Take it if you feel compelled to know more about political philosophy. I doubt it gets much easier than this at Yale on this subject? But I don't know for sure.",
    "Lectures are good. The readings are not the ~most~ essential thing if you go to class every day, but the course is made better if you do them. Check out your discussion section once before committing, if you can. My section was dead silent and it was excruciating. Alicia is a good TF, though!",
    "You definitely need to be interested in politics and philosophy for this class. If you are, the material is interesting and helpful for providing insight to a lot of things. If you aren't, it will surely be one of your most boring classes. Definitely shop it, figure out if it's your thing.",
    "Yes, this is a great introduction to philosophy",
    "I really enjoyed the class! Shapiro is great, obviously super knowledgeable. It's been around for a really long time, so most of the kinks are worked out. Light, but interesting readings (Shapiro is very conscious about the lengths, which was helpful). Also not too demanding writing credit, as you have a very long time between drafts. TAKE THIS OVER THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OFFERED BY THE POLISCI DEPARTMENT TO FULFILL THE EPE REQUIREMENT.",
    "It is an introductory political philosophy course that starts at the Enlightenment and ends with modern democracy theory. Some of the readings are the typical political philosophy classics while some are more contemporary takes on those classics. There is a really clear arc to the course and you end up with some solid philosophical 'nuggets' that you can use in later political philosophy.",
    "I would describe it as a great introduction to political philosophy. You really get out what you put in. The readings are interesting and you should do them because they are famous and will continue to come up for the rest of your life and other classes as well. If you don't do the readings, you can still do well but you will regret it at the end. Not too heavy of a workload and I enjoyed the material.",
    "Definitely take this course, if you can.",
    "Comprehensive overview of major ideas in political philosophy. Recommended for students who want to learn more about what these ideas mean by allowing them to go into meaningful analysis, while at the same time leaving space to go over many theoretical concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It isn't a lot of work and Shapiro makes it interesting. Political philosophy is practical so I strongly recommend!",
    "If you're a political science major I think this is a great foundational course to have. There's obviously some dense reading since there are elements of philosophy, but Shapiro does a good job of helping to clear things up and the material isn't that difficult to understand. It really changed how I approach looking at governments.",
    "PLSC 118 is a very broad spread of philosopher spanning from ancient to present philosophers. The course is designed to give you a first hand experience in reading and learning from these figures. I struggled to read these complex readings. I would recommend this class to those who are interested in political philosophy. That being said, if you're not ready to put in about 3 hours of readings before every class, this class is not for you. It also comes down to who you have as your TA. If he\/she is committed and well informed, sections could be very enjoyable and helpful in understanding the course.(Personally, I never really understand the readings until sections time).",
    "Take the class if you want a survey course of major political philosophers and their work.",
    "A through introduction to political thought.",
    "The course is great even if you've not done political philosophy before. A must-take to get a sound grounding in the roots of contemporary political philosophical debate. Definitely recommend; a course that has attained classical status.",
    "MoFoPo is a terrific introductory political philosophy course. Professor Shapiro makes each lecture thought provoking and informative as he explains and refutes every thinker we study. The grading is fair and the reading is manageable. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course. Almost all of the lectures are online so if you miss one it's not the biggest deal as you are able to catch up. I learnt a lot without having to put in a lot of work (I did the non-writing intensive option). It's a nice overview of the literature and ideas related to this topic. Good 5th class."
