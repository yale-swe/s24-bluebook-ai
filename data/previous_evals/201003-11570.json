    "I wish that Professor Lee would have lectured more. While I understand the value of student presentations, there should be a better balance. Professor Lee has so much valuable experience to share and I would have preferred to hear that rather than presentations by classmates during EVERY class.",
    "This is a great course, but it needs more structure. The internship opportunity that it provides at the UN is invaluable. The trip to the UNFCCC conference was great, but didn't seem to be well planned.Professor Lee has an excellent knowledge of the subject matter, but the class should have more structure. It also seemed as though he had favorites in class, and he would assign more work to some students than he did to others. More structure and a syllabus would help to alleviate this type of problem.The TA sometimes didn't seem to know what was going on with the assignments, but I think that was because Professor Lee didn't tell him, and would sometimes send assignments out two days, or the night before class. This type of thing does help you get used to the UN process, but doesn't help you manage your work load.",
    "Prof and TA could have done a better job providing students with a better understanding of the procedural aspects of the UN and UNFCCC.",
    "The internships at the UN that are part of this course are a very valuable experience for students interested in learning how the UN works as well as in climate change negotiations."

    "Working with a delegation at the UNFCCC, and the internship at the UN.",
    "The opportunity to do an internship with a permanent mission to the UN, as well as go for the UNFCCC Conference of Parties with a country delegation. These are invaluable opportunities that allow an insight into the international processes and mechanisms that facilitate cooperation or communications between countries.",
    "Conference attendance.",
    "The chance to work in UN and the chance to go to Cancun for the COP 16.",
    "The opportunity to work as part of a delegation in the climate change negotiations as well as working as an intern for a mission at the UN.",
    "The best thing about this course is the ability to engage on international environmental diplomacy on the issues that you care about most. Ad hoc projects and assignments that built on one another drove us to research and deliver presentations and reports to the class, which forced us to really understand the material.Of course, the experience to intern at a country mission to the United Nations was incredible, and an amazing experience to see how the international process works up close.",

   "comments": [
    "More structure, and an equal distribution of work. There also seemed to be a lot of back room deals regarding the classes trip to Grenada that is happening at the end of the semester.",
    "I suppose the class will benefit from further clarity regarding the work and assignments entailed by enrolling in the class. It seemed like many developed a siege mentality as the class went on, and while keeping us always ready is good, it disrupts long-term planning with other commitments.",
    "Some students didn't have thematic topics to follow until late in the course or at all. Perhaps this can be better incorporated into the application process, since it is more beneficial for the student as well as others in class who can learn more from someone who is genuinely interested in a given topic than one who has a more general level of interest.",
    "To organize the course more logically and follow a clear syllabus. Let the students know what will be included in the course. To distribute the courseload, like the presentation more evenly among all the students.",
    "The instructor could improve the organization and structure of the course, lectures and be more clear about what is expected from the assignments.",
    "Although the ad hoc assignments kept us on our toes, I think that a better sense of direction for where the class is leading, and a more graceful flow between meetings would be a great improvement."
