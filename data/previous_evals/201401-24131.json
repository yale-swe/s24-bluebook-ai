   "comments": [
    "A very informative and applied course, but a considerable amount of work. The teacher also really needed a TA, because most of the labs were not graded until right before the final was released, which relied on lab feedback.",
    "An interesting dichotomy of suggestions: slightly more indepth theory for the lectures and more examples of SAS code and interpretation of results (potenially posted) would have strenghtened the course.",
    "This is a really important course for people who are primarily interested in analytical methods used in public health. It is rigorous in that there is a huge spectrum of methods taught. The only weakness of this course is that it is purely application and not theory, which makes varying contexts of problems difficult to cater to. I think that there should be a textbook or just a bit of theory included in lectures so that there is at least some sort of background information to understand where the methods are coming from and how to manipulate them if necessary.",
    "One of the best courses I ever took at Yale.The content she reviewed are not taught in any other biostats courses. She explained everything clearly......For the first time, all biostats concepts much clear. Now, I am confident that I can do all the complex biostat methods that she taught. Her annotated sas codes and macros are very comprehensive. She has a good heart and always answered any question with absolute clarity.Will keep her as an instructor and will recommend this course to any student.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive class notes; practical assignments, excellent instructorWeaknesses: none",
    "This courses covers a number of cutting-edge analytic methods often used in epidemiologic research but are not covered in any other courses in YSPH. It is well structured with lectures and labs, focused on both theory and applications. The lecture notes and SAS programs are clearly written and so well explained that makes them great references for future research and work. I learned so much from this course!",
    "Strengths: course offers great topics that aren't covered in other classes. Lots of useful techniques for individuals in public health.Dr. Shebl is an excellent resourceWeaknesses:Did not always get labs returned quicklyThe labs were occasionally confusing. This is OK when it reflects real world uncertainty about how best to handle data, but in other cases, the confusion was a result of a poorly chosen example, I think.",
    "Very helpful course in learning how to apply statistical methods not covered in traditional biostatistic courses in epidemiological research. The professor was outstanding and labs were very helpful. Truly a class where afterwards I not only felt like I understood the material, but will be able to apply my knowledge in future research.",
    "Very useful and in depth examination of select advanced statistical methods. I think a little bit too much time may have been spent on structural equation modeling though.",
    "Fantastic course!From an applied statistical and higher level epi point of view, this is as good as it gets! I was challenged from day one and learned tons about new study designs, statistical analyses, and coding issues."

    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0A very good instructor that conveyed the information effectively. However, without a TA, she was just not able to complete grading the labs in a timely fashion to provide feedback.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Very good.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0She is very knowledgeable and has great lecture slides.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0The content she reviewed are not taught in any other biostats courses. She explained everything clearly......For the first time, all biostats concepts makes sense. Now, I am confident that I can do many complex biostat methods that she taught. Her annotated sas codes and macros are very comprehensive. She has a good heart and always answered any question with absolute clarity. Her response to emails were excellent. She graded fairly and communicated with students regularly. She was concerned about students who were not able to lab sections by emailing or covering all important concepts in the theory class.Will keep her as an instructor and will recommend this course to any student.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl was an excellent instructor, and clearly very committed to her students.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable regarding the course content. Very sensitive to students' needs and responsive to questions by email and through office hours. Overall one of the best instructors I have had for any course.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0The instructor put in extraordinary effort in this course to prepare the lecture notes and help students understand the difficult concepts and gain hands-on experience with a wide array of analytic methods. I think it was a very well taught class!",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl was great. She is a great resource and quickly answered any questions I had.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is an excellent teacher; her lectures are clear, her labs were tremendously helpful and dr. Shebl goes above and beyond in helping students understand and apply the concepts covered in class.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Extremely friendly and intelligent. Responds quickly to the needs of students. Lecture skills are great.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is truly extraordinary! She is incredibly patient and thorough, providing extensive feedback on every homework and exam. I met with her many times outside of class to discuss topics related to the course and she was always willing to make time to discuss with me. She cares deeply about her students and is very passionate about the material."

   "comments": [
    "A very useful class and I would recommend taking if the teacher is able to find a TA.",
    "If the techniques you are interested in learning are on the syllabus it will be a useful course. The covered techniques are well taught though more examples would have been helpful see #6.",
    "This is a really good course but it is fast-paced and lacking in theory, which makes a complete understanding of the material impossible. But overall, I learned a lot and will definitely be using the methods learned in my future work.",
    "O yes.... this is a must take course for any YSPH PhD student (including biostat students), and for masters students who is interested in advanced stats.It is good to find instructors who can teach biostats without too much \"technical\" terms.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Excellent introduction to statistical techniques increasingly being utilized in public health. Very practical assignments that are comprehensive and offer a useful template and resource for future analyses. Excellent instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about advanced analytic methods often used in epi research",
    "You learn advanced data analysis methods, including propensity scores, path analysis, structural equation modeling, factor analysis and principal componentsanalysis.",
    "Dr. Shebl is a wonderful professor and the course is a very helpful epidemiology-oriented biostatistics course. I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "This course is an excellent look at some advanced statistical methods that may prove useful in your research. I would recommend this course to all epidemiology students."
