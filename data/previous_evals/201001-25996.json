    "Yes, Directed Studies not only takes you through the greatest works in the Western canon, but equips you with the skills necessary to succeed in subsequent classes at Yale.",
    "DEFINITELY. Listen, if you feel like you want to read all of these works at some point in your life, there is no better time to do it than freshmen year. I find now that everything I do (everything!) is related to DS in some way. By the end, you will be able to bang out with minimal stress and good results a five page paper, which is essential for many future classes, and you will be a much better reader.",
    "Take it. Everything that we do is political, and you might as well get some grounding as to what that means.",
    "Directed Studies History is an awesome course! I learned so much about Machiavelli, social contract theory, Marx, Nietzsche, Burke, Smith, and Arendt. The entire year really comes together by the end, and I highly recommend this course. In addition, I highly recommend Justin Zaremby. He may be the best professor I had this ENTIRE YEAR. Unfortunately, however, he will not be teaching next year. So, I will suggest having Steven Smith, his mentor, or Stuart Semmel. Stay away from Pincus. I hear that he is super intense and an extremely tough grader. Justin Zaremby is the best thing that has happened to DS in a long time. Too bad he is going on to bigger and better things.",
    "Of course. I enjoyed the second semester of H\/P even more than the first, if that is possible.",
    "Take DS! You read outstanding books... From the social contract theorists to Hannah Arendt... its pretty awesome when your homework is to read these great works of the western canon. It can be a lot of work, but its rewarding. The papers are graded fairly. Zaremby was great, get him if he is still teaching.",
    "Great course. I liked the second half of H and P much better than the first half. I don't think Zaremby is teaching any more, but if he is, do your absolute best to switch into that section.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "Take it. Get Professor Zaremby. Only you cannot because I heard he is leaving next semester. Well take it anyways the books are awesome.",
    "DS H\/P with Professor Zaremby is absolutely excellent; I would definitely recommend it. Yes, it is a substantial amount of work, but the readings are excellent. Dr. Zaremby does a very good job leading seminar, H\/P lectures are usually very worthwhile, and the papers are helpful in increasing one's understandings of the texts.",
    "It's an excellent course - it exposed me to the foundations of so many ideas that are present in my life and whose origins I never knew. Now I have read them. Those include social contracts, division of labor, morality!, democracy, and progress. It is a fast-paced course, and sometimes we don't get to read as much of the texts as would be preferable, but the exposure to themes of the western canon is invaluable and irreplaceable.",
    "Don't do DS if you don't want to commit to a lot of reading and writing. If that doesn't scare you, you'll be exposed to a lot and learn a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it highly. Of course it is a good deal of work, etc. but worth it.",
    "4. Directed Studies will re-teach you how to read, write, analyze, discuss, and \u0096 above all else \u0096 think better than any other freshman course or program at Yale. I know it sounds cocky, but I\u0092m finding myself better prepared as a rising sophomore than my peers who didn\u0092t take the course \u0096 even those who came from far more rigorous high school backgrounds. It\u0092s intense, though, and you have to want the immersion in the Western canon to enjoy the course. It\u0092s not worth it if you just want the kudos. I\u0092d take it again, though, without a second thought."
