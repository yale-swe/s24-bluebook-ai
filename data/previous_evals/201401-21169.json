    "Yes, having philosophy with Greco is a pretty good thing.",
    "Take second semester DS. It's so worth it. Everything starts to come together, and you feel like you have a grasp of what this world is about. Be careful of taking it with Professor Greco. He does not go through the arguments; rather, he sort of expects you know them, then you talk about them. He's such a kind and wonderful man, though. So if you communicate with him, he'll help. But he's also a tough grader. I went into his office hours for paper help, and I did the things he suggested and still got a B.",
    "DS spring philosophy feels a lot more continuous than does the fall, and it makes it much easier to understand what is going on throughout the semester. Philosophy was never my strongest forte, and I struggled a bit with the essays under Professor Greco, but I thought he was a great and kind instructor who was always available to talk and always helpful in giving questions about what to focus on for each text before class.",
    "Second semester of DS Philosophy picks up on many of the questions raised by the philosophers of the first semester; I was delighted to see Leibniz, for instance, take on Plato's Euthyphro problem and to witness Hume challenge the classical skepticism of Sextus Empiricus. This semester, in particular, you see the philosophers engage in a much more focused and direct dialogue with one another, such that it is easier to trace the evolution of a particular idea over the centuries. Of course, it is also much more difficult because while the readings get shorter, the writing gets much more dense, and the likes of Kant and Hegel left many of us scratching our heads. Being in Daniel's section made deciphering such works much, much easier. Daniel did a wonderful job framing philosophical issues in a way that felt relevant and comprehensible, and I really appreciated how he never came to class with a set take on what the philosopher was saying. His comments on papers are always thorough, constructive, and helpful. He was really committed to our understanding of the material, and we often got into discussions that felt fresh and exciting. Overall, I felt lucky to be in his section.",
    "The reading is more difficult in second semester DS philosophy than first, but it's also more interesting. I would recommend this course because I would recommend DS.",
    "Spring DS Philosophy is a challenging and rewarding course. Starting with Descartes' skepticism, the semester traces a conversation about the nature of reality, the limits of human knowledge, and ethical frameworks that can inform our behavior. I definitely recommend this course, especially if you enjoyed Fall DS Philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The works and discussions cover a few very compelling areas of philosophy, including ethics, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics. Both the exercise of philosophy and the conclusions that the philosophers on the syllabus come to are very interesting. Both the material and the methodology you are introduced to in this course are important, both in school and in their broader intellectual implications."
