    "Each week you will learn about a new technique for dating archaeological finds. Doesn't require math\/science background, but its sufficiently complicated to be a bit overwhelming at times if you don't pay attention. I enjoyed it very much. Would definitely recommend if you're interested in archaeology.",
    "An engaging introduction to the range of scientific methods necessary for an archaeologist, at the level of detail appropriate for a field archaeologist's understanding and consumption on of data.",
    "ANTH 316L 01 is an undergrad course but I recommend it not only to undergrads but also to any Grad student who wishes to have firm background in lab science methods and techniques in Archaeology and related disciplines",
    "I will recommend the course to others, since it is really a basic course for us to study archaeology and learn more about the trends of the scientific methods applied in the study.",
    "It is an interesting course for students who are interested in archaeological science but know little about it. I will definitely recommend it to another students."
