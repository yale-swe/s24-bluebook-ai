   "comments": [
    "I got to experience anthropology as a completely new discipline. It helped me to see how anthropologists think about culture, history, and power. Some of the readings took interesting angles on phenomenon.",
    "I suspect Anthro 515 has laid some important methodological groundwork for how I approach research. This was the course which brought together various inchoate and vague ideas about anthropology and pinned them down. In that sense, I will be much more confident in future about asking anthropology-type questions in my research."
