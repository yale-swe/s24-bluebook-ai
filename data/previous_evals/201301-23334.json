   "comments": [
    "Epic: The Odyssey, The Aeneid, Inferno, Don Quixote, (Heart of Darkness - different for each section\/year,) Ulysses; 4 papers; 1 final. Professor Walsh is a great seminar leader, and really kind and cool! If you want to read a ton of good literature, go for it.",
    "This is a terrific class. Take it if you want a great books experience outside of DS. The reading load is huge though, so if you want to finish all the reading, it is a good idea to plan ahead (or take it with other classes that have lighter reading loads). Professor Walsh is great.",
    "Epic is a solid class and all Yale students should be familiar with the works on its syllabus.",
    "Yes. Great class if you don't mind doing a lot of reading.",
    "Lots of boring-ish reading, but Prof. Walsh is great- requirements not too onerous, grading not too harsh. Shop sections of it! Mostly freshmen\/sophomores- I took this as a junior and wished I'd taken it earlier because class discussion level was frosh\/soph.",
    "Epic was my favorite class of the semester. Yes, it's a lot of work but the reading is definitely manageable. The essays are great because you only have to write 4 out of 6 and they are only 5 or so pages long. Professor Walsh was amazing so if you can take it with him, I would definitely recommend it!",
    "A solid course with a fairly low writing workload, but a fairly high reading workload. I recommend it to anybody with an interest in the history of literature, or a general love for the English language",
    "I really enjoyed this course mainly due to the reading list. I would highly recommend this class to any student who wishes to read the books and who is willing to do a large amount of reading over the course of the semester."
