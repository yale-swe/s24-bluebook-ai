The two things I wish, though, were instead of class wide workshops, I wish we had one on one peer editing sessions instead. I also wish the timeline was structured differently. I wish we had less buildup and more check-ins with actual words on paper.",

Do not, I repeat, do not (!!!) try to write an overly complex or experimental or creative paper. This, young grasshopper, is a recipe for disaster. Please benefit from my mistakes!",
