    "If you want a workshop forum for writing plays with a great playwright, take it, but don't expect the moon.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's not the only playwriting class at Yale though, and there might be others that are equally worth taking.",
    "You're taking Playwriting from Donald Margulies. If that alone doesn't convince you to take this class, don't take it.",
    "A discussion-based seminar centered on reading works by famous American and international playwrights and then crafting original one-act pieces incorporating the techniques explored and discussed.",
    "The course is great, the reading is great--but Donald Margulies doesn't give a damn about the class, the reading or his students. It comes off all too often as 'The Donald Margulies' show. I'm astounded at how many positive reviews there are on ybb: because he just doesn't care about what's going on.",
    "Good class. The selection of plays that you read is fantastic and Professor Margulies knows playwriting. I'm not satisfied with the play I wrote in this course and I've found in general that workshopping a piece before I have a complete draft tends to stunt and confuse my progress. I made the mistake of writing the play I thought Professor Margulies would fine most interesting, and of changing things quickly and drastically based on his suggestions. For a first draft, I think it's better to define and then follow your own vision for the piece. This might be particular to me, but I think workshops are more helpful when you already have a working draft.",
