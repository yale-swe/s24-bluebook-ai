    "The class was an overall assessment of how evil is viewed in Modern America based on current opinions from conservative\/controversial movements.",
    "A great seminar with a really great reading list and a fun and interesting professor. Take it to read the books you've always wanted to read and to learn a lot about different ideas of sin and evil. If you have any interest in American studies or Religious studies you'll find this class super interesting.",
    "\"Sin and Evil\" is a cultural history course which follows the concepts of sin and evil as they evolved in twentieth-century America. It is \/not\/ a classin American religious history (although if you like that you would probably also enjoy this course). I have ALREADY recommended the class to several friends, religious studies \/ American studies majors and otherwise, and would recommend it to anyone with even the slightest interest in either field. If this class is offered again, take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was a wonderful analysis of a term people throw around without necessarily understanding its implications or interpretations - \"evil.\" The course benefited from a holistic approach in evaluating the different dimensions of evil, such as its use in politics, religion, and culture. Ironically, I left the seminar with a much looser (yet more accurate) conception of the notion of evil or wrongdoing, one that relies on the context and the arguments in which it is presented.Another plus was that the course covered an extremely broad array of reading materials. No two books were similar - let alone very related outside of the course's objectives - which made for interesting, fresh reads every week. Students learned a lot about movements and theologies that many had never clearly understood before, such as eugenics and Christian Science.Overall, the course attempts to dive into the deep range of issues and practices that people across the world consider to be wrong and to analyze their rational and methods behind branding said issues as evil or sinful or immoral. While no religious background is required, a good understanding of various religious theologies, particularly Christianity, would helpthroughout the course, but more particularly towards the beginning when religious views of evil are discussed.",
    "It was definitely an interesting realm of questioning. And I think, ultimately, it instilled its ideas in our minds, illustrating the nature of knowledge and the impact of social forces on what we are willing to believe.",
