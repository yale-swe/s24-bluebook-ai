   "comments": [
    "The workload is definitely the biggest challenge of this course, but I think it's manageable (and a great lesson in time management). The biggest strength of this course is how you learn to apply concepts from other courses. This is something that doesn't seem to happen in too many classes at YSPH, so it's really nice to see.",
    "Important course that helps you design your own intervention with a team - hands on learning",
    "Strengths: A learning opportunity that allows the chance to pursue a topic of interest. Weakness: Rubrics\/guidelines provided to students are not always clear - more transparency should be provided in how the assignments are graded. More working time should be provided in class so that students can ask the class\/professor questions - perhaps attempting to apply the skills being learned to the intervention project itself might be a good way to incorporate some more working time.",
    "I feel like I have a very thorough understanding of how to design an intervention. The project was incredibly useful in aiding this understanding, more so than in class discussion.",
    "Trace is a fantastic teacher and highly attentive to student needs. The class project, although work intensive, is what really teaches you the material. However, I found lectures to be hard to follow. A lot of class time is spent in circular discussion about topics that don't require discussion (i.e., what are some examples of brainstorming). The powerpoints themselves teach some very interesting material, but I think the course would benefit from a bit more lecture-style teaching to get into the details of intervention development, rather than students teaching themselves during the class project.",
    "Less discussion",
    "This class has definitely been one of the most time-consuming but educationally fulfilling and useful classes I've taken at Yale School of Public Health. I felt like this was a great class to end with because it was the culmination of all theory-based and practice-based skills we learned at Yale. Being able to create your own intervention from beginning to end through the development, implementation, and evaluation stages has been an amazing experience. I was lucky to be in a group with two other equally passionate and like-minded individuals, which made this class very enjoyable. It is by no means an easy class with lots of research, problem solving, and creativity involved to create a good intervention.",
    "Strengths: learned about how to develop an intervention, which is actually much more involved than I previously thought. Feel that I can now design an intervention with guidance. Weaknesses: Lectures could be more clear and cohesive. Improvements: Lecture slides could be clearer",
    "Very practical skills gained before launching into real world setting where I hope to complete these types of interventions",
    "Very useful. Really gave me a better understanding of what it means to create an evidence-based intervention. Also provided skills on how to properly conduct an evaluation.",
    "It was good. A lot more detailed than expected but we learned a lot about intervention development. I wasn't a fan of the scenarios for teaching approach as I felt they were way too many and not a good use of time."

    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is always willing to answer questions, and it really helps that he shares a lot of his own experiences developing and implementing interventions. The requirements for assignments could have been a little clearer, though. I would suggest sharing the grading rubric for each assignment with students ahead of time.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Prof. Kershaw is really thoughtful and listens to what students want. We had a class outside, we turned one of the classes into a work day. He provides tailored input to each intervention.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Strengths: Very knowledgeable in the development of interventions. Has a keen eye to spot weaknesses in proposed interventions. Weakness: Hard to develop a relationship with.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is simultaneously very easy going and an incredible perfectionist. I feel like this was a good combination for a learning environment. I think sometimes we could have less discussion in class and more small breakout\/work sessions that apply what we were going over that day.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is accessible, attentive, and accommodating of student needs. He is one of the best professors at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is awesome!!",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is great! His lecture slides are pretty organized and he's very receptive to student feedback and ideas for how to make the class better. I liked that one of my classmates asked him if we could have an in-class work session instead of a normal lecture and he willingly agreed. I think it would be good to have 2 work sessions thrown into the class time so that students can touch base with each other and then have Trace there if they have any questions. One of the best professors here and I'm so happy we can call him one of our SBS faculty members.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Sometimes seemed too lax, but he's not at all. Approach with questions, and he'll answer them completely. With that said, class lectures could be a bit more organized.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0The content of the course and the lectures were very clear and easy to follow. Sometimes it seemed like we did not receive very detailed feedback on our assignments. However, it was helpful that we had a few other students reviewing each assignment as well.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Quite knowledgeable about the material."

   "comments": [
    "Although this course is required for SBS students, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to work at the intersection of public health research and practice. This course pulls together a lot of the concepts learned in core YSPH classes, but it expands upon them and puts them into more of a \"real world\" setting - you really learn how to apply the concepts you've learned in other courses. This course is a lot of work, and it comes with the typical challenges and advantages of working in groups, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "This course is great if you want to create and know how interventions are made and evaluated. It was a lot of work creating an intervention from scratch but rewarding at the end. Be ready to spend a lot of hours in groups.",
    "Must take!",
    "Recommended for students who are very interested in developing interventions or students who will be going on to obtain a PhD.",
    "Choose your group carefully and spend time each week working on your project so you don't have to stress too much before each due date.",
    "This course is required for SBS students. You will learn how complex developing a public health intervention is, which is an important skill for any public health student.",
    "Recommend for students interested in public health practice. The course teaches you how to design and develop an intervention from start to finish. Very practical, useful course.",
    "A ton of work but absolutely necessary for SBS students or other students who would like practice-based experience in creating a public health program from start to end. One of the best classes I've taken here. Be aware that it is not easy.",
    "It's a ton of work to develop an intervention, but it does feel good to turn it in. You learn every aspect of intervention design, so if that's in your future, take it.",
    "Get a lot out of it, depending on how much you put into it. Very important to work consistently as you go so that you don't have a lot to do all at the end.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's very helpful to go through the process of creating an intervention to designing the evaluation plan.",
    "Good. We put a lot of work into our intervention but it was sad to realize that they will not be implemented."
