   "comments": [
    "I recommend Spanish L3, especially with Profesora Reymundi. Classes were very fun and she explains things in an extremely clear way that makes all the elements very easy to comprehend. It felt like adding depth to what we learned in L1 and L2.",
    "I would recommend this to a student that loves Spanish or one who wants to further develop their skills.",
    "SPAN 130 was a good basic spanish course. I definitely reinforced all of my grammar and I feel more confident speaking, reading, and writing. It was taught methodically and logically, sticking to the textbook but also providing many helpful supplements and activities. It could be boring sometimes due to the nature of an intermediate spanish course, but it was taught very well and it was certainly miles better than any spanish class I took in high school.",
    "A grammatical review of Spanish I and II. Not particularly exciting, but my speaking and writing skills definitely improved.",
    "This class was more of an overview of already learned concepts; you don't learn much new material, but instead hone the skills you do have. I would recommend it.",
    "This class is a good way to fulfill your language requirement. Be prepared to work hard if you take this course.",
    "Yes! it was awesome!",
    "A class the reinforces all of the grammer learned in L2, just with a faster pace and more emphasis put on reading literature and making arguments in class.",
    "Take this course with Professor Reymndi - you will not regret it!",
    "This is an excellent course for developing reading comprehension and speaking fluency. It is taught well and the material is good. I would recommend it."
