    "A perfectly reasonable class #bucketz.",
    "Mechatronics is different from a lot of other engineering in that you actually get to play with the things you are learning about in lab. I definitely understood the material much more fully because of this. This class has nothing to do with Megatron.",
    "You probably have to take it, but I actually really enjoyed this class. Only 5 p sets (although they were pretty hard), 2 midterms, no final, and 8 labs. The labs are the real focus of the class so they could get challenging, especially at the end when we were programming microcontrollers, but once you figured it out it was really cool The first part is sort of a review of EE200 and then you get into feedback control and the different kinds of controllers. Definitely learned a lot this semester",
    "Take some t even if you're not abet. It's challenging but cool as well.",
    "Meng 390 is a significant amount of work and the material is difficult. However, Englot is amazing at explaining the material so the students could understand easily. The prerequisites are absolutely necessary as the first couple weeks are a recap of EENG 200 and the rest of the course is built off of this. The labs are not that bad we only had to stay the full 3 hours once. The labs and course material are really practical so lots of the time you see your calculations in the homework turn into parameters in lab. At the end we were able to control a motor which was really cool. If you are ABET you have to take this class, but if not I would recommend considering this class as an elective.",
    "Brendan Englot is a tremendous lecturer. I'd absolutely recommend the course, but I'd suggest taking EE 200 beforehand, as I've heard the course is difficult without that prereq."
