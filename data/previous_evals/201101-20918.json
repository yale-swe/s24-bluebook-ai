   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course if you are truly interested in Beowulf. It is a lot of work if you aren't sure you're interested in it.",
    "The course is primarily comprised of translating the full text of Beowulf in Old English, with some relevant secondary reading of both related Old English texts and criticism. I would recommend this to students attempting a greater proficiency in Old English.",
    "It's a lot of work early on and sometimes feels like slogging through an endless marsh, but it does get better by the second half of the semester. The time in class is always enjoyable, though. Roberta Frank is wonderful. Beowulf is epic. If you enjoy epic things, take the course.",
    "Summary: time consuming and at times difficult, but rewarding and, thus, ultimately worth it.",
    "English 501 is primarily an exercise in translating the full Old English text of Beowulf with occasional discussions of the poem's contents and problems relating to it's place in literary history.",
    "Slightly insane (3000 lines! One semester! Good luck!) but absolutely worth it."

    "Provided another chance to read Beowulf in the original language, in a classroom setting for the first time. Additional translation requirements improved my background knowledge for the text."
