    "If you have to take it, take it. Oscar is a good, solid choice.",
    "The best language course I've taken thus far at yale, but still a language course.",
    "Take it with Oscar if you can. He is literally the man, and he will help you improve your Spanish a lot. Plus, L4 isn't difficult.. probably easier than L3",
    "NOT AT ALL ONLY TAKE IF YOU ARE FORCED TO WHICH IS WHY I DID AND IT WAS AWFUL",
    "Yes - it is a great course.",
    "I would say to take it if you want to advance your spanish and get very familiar with the different grammar tenses and sentence structures.",
    "Grammatically, you will be able to use all the tenses by the end of the course. This means you will know all basic grammar, and that is powerful.You get there through doing a bunch of interesting readings that spawn a bunch of interesting discussions that have some real significance in life, so that is cool. It does not feel canned, but very organic.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class it helps improve proficiency in the Spanish language.",
    "Oscar is the man - definitely take L4 with him. He's not a softie, but he's hilarious. You'll learn a lot and also have fun."
