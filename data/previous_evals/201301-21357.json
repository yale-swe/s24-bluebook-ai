    "Not the most interesting content, but possible to learn it with the help of good lectures. I think that a different logic course should count towards the logic requirement for grad students - some of the logics that we often see in journal articles, for example. I will probably never use this logic again, but if the course had been about modal logic instead, I probably would have been able to use it my other classes.",

    "The course contributed almost not at all to my research interests.I would very, very, very much have preferred to take a course in \"logic for philosophy\" (such as the one outlined in Ted Sider's books) rather than a course in mathematical logic in order to fulfill my logic requirement. I'd like to be able to understand the modal logic that gets thrown around in journal articles!",
