    "Take this course to gain an overview of some of the fields within cogsci. Take this course to get to know your fellow majors and read some pretty important papers. Take this course for Kate, who is a brilliant professor and a fabulous mentor. You won't get to talk about everything that interests you (I was sad we didn't discuss more experimental research) but you write your final paper on whatever you want, so you can just talk about your own interests at that point. It's a lot of reading, and you won't do all of it (sad reality) but the class is definitely still worth it. A solid \"very-good.\"",
    "Each week consists of one topic in Cognitive Science, a few readings on that topic that you write a response to, and a discussion (led by someone in the class) of that topic to try to understand it better. Other than that, the only big piece of work is your final paper, which can be on any topic you want that relates to cognitive science, with the encouragement that it could potentially help you figure out what you want to focus on for your senior research.",
    "I think Junior Seminar in Cognitive Science was an enjoyable, enriching course. The cognitive science major, by design, lacks much cohesion, and I think it was a valuable experience to learn more about the issues in the field beyond my area of focus. I wish that Dr. Zaremba had been more involved in the discussions, since they could often wander with the student leaders, and I wasn't always sure that I took away the most important points in this format. Each week, we read some primary literature in a field (Consciousness& AI, or decisions& morality, eg) and wrote a reading response and discussed in class. We also all had a 12-15 page final paper on a topic of our choosing. Overall, I would recommend the experience.",
    "Great discussion class. Tough readings, but not too much work overall.",
    "Yes! If you are a Cognitive Science major, whatever your focus within the department, take this course! You'll learn a ton about the field, meet all the other cool students in your year, and have a blast doing it!",
    "Good experience for any cog sci major. Familiarizes you with reading primary literature. Not too much work. Can use final paper as starting point for senior project.",
    "This was a fantastic course and one that every cognitive science major should take. I came into the course with a vague idea of the goals and questions in the field of cognitive science and I left with a much stronger understanding of these issues. We focused on both the large themes in cognitive science (modularity of mind, etc.) and how those themes apply to the different disciplines that cognitive science examines (language and number acquisition, artificial intelligence, etc.). While everyone in the major has a different theme, this class exposes everyone to other disciplines that they might not otherwise know about. The coursework was interesting and reasonable, and it gave me great practice in reading journal articles. Professor Davidson is an incredible teacher and is clearly excited about the course material. The final assignment was also fun because it allowed students to apply what we had learned in the course to another area of interest. The class is designed to help students in the cognitive science major understand the field better, and it definitely accomplishes these goals!",
    "The Junior Cognitive Science Seminar is a solid course for cognitive science majors. It is a chance to revisit a number of topics briefly introduced in Introduction to Cognitive Science, this time going much more in depth. Most importantly, it allows cognitive science majors the chance to meet and interact with fellow cognitive science majors. Kate is a fantastic professor, and is a real boon to the cognitive science program. She cares deeply about helping students engage with the field, exploring the various viewpoints on significant topics.",
    "YES, I highly recommend it. Really gives a good sense of what makes cognitive science unique from all the disciplines that it examines."
