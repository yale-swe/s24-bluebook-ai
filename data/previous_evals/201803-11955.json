    "Super good class, no real weaknesses and very well structured to help beginners learn Spanish",
    "Maripaz was great and the syllabus was thoroughly laid out. Definitely not a lot of weaknesses and was particularly engaging.",
    "Great and understanding teacher, broad range of ways to practice spanish",
    "The course is very thorough and I genuinely feel as if I am learning the language, however the homework feels like busy work at times.",
    "I think the course could be a bit more interactive. The professor was great about engaging people in class, but the work could become a bit monotonous. Also, this is more general about language courses here, but I firmly do not believe they need to meet every day. It interferes with my ability to take classes for my major, and having homework every night feels a lot like high school, which is not conducive to learning new material (it is too easy to stop caring about the assignments that way). Overall the class wasn't bad, but the larger language structure at Yale could be vastly improved.",
    "It was pretty much perfect!",
    "It's a good class and Maripaz is an excellent teacher, it's just that the class is hard if you've never been exposed to spanish. A lot of the people in L1 have taken spanish in middle school or highschool but just placed into L1, if you're completely new to spanish it can feel like you're drowing with all the new things that are thrown at you. The only thing I would recommend would be to slow down the pace of the class which I realize in unrealistic. In short the class was as good as it could be for what it is."

    "Yes, if you truly want to learn spanish.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn spanish take this course. If you want an easy language and have never taken Spanish before I would recommend a different course because most of the people in L1 aren't really L1 if that makes sense."
