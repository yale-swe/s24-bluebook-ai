    "Not enough can be said about the Experimental Techniques \/ Experimental Strategies in Cellular Biology laboratory sequence with Professor Wolenski. If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to enroll in these courses, do not hesitate. Professor Wolenski is by far the best professor that I have had at Yale -- his ability to instruct students is exceptional, but more importantly, he truly cares about each and every one of his students. Overall an amazing experience.",
    "MCDB 344L is a great lab to take if you are looking to fulfill a bio lab requirement, esp. if you are a premed\/non-bio major like me (BME). There are no lab reports and barely any outside lab work. Your entire grade is based on two quizes, two journal clubs, and how well you participate in lab. In all actuality, as long as you are enthusiastic about lab and working, you should get a good grade. Going to lab twice a week from 1:30-6:30pm can be a pain, but it is definitely worth it and usually you can get out early.",
    "Take this course! There are no official lab reports or write-ups; just 2 quizzes. Make sure you get in by emailing Professor Wolenski at least a semester ahead of time.",
    "One of the best bio labs I've taken at Yale. You're in lab for long periods of time (until 6 or 7 pm a few times), and it's twice a week, but there is virtually no work outside of the lab. Prof Wolenski is awesome, really nice and encouraging, and definitely tries to foster bonds among the students in the class. While the experiments may seem ambitious, the pace of the class is actually very manageable - you can only go so fast when 18 people are doing the same thing and you have to wait for others to finish a step before continuing onwards. There are a few presentations and paper discussions.",
    "TAKE THIS, if you can get in! Email a year in advance if you want to be in this class!! It will be your favorite class all semester! :)",
    "It was a good class. Definitely take it if you can. you learn a lot of things useful for all kinds of lab work.",
    "This is a class that teaches basic lab techniques probably a bit better than some of the \"intro\" labs do. If you have already worked in a biology lab for an appreciable length of time, you should not take this class as you will be bored. If you understand how to run PAGE gels, do Western Blots, do tissue culture (of which you barely do any in this class, so even if you don't know how to do that one yet, wanting to learn tissue culture alone doesn't make this class worth taking), then you should take the electron microscopy lab or something like that instead of this one. Based on past reviews, I expected this lab (and the other one that goes with it) to give me a lot of opportunities to plan and set up my own experiments and to play around with different methods, but it turned out to be really straight forward, \"here's what we're doing today guys,\" type of stuff where you come in, you listen, you ask some questions, and then you do what they tell you to do, and it's not really up to do you to do any trouble shooting on your own. I think the problem is that there are too many people, and it's just impossible to let everybody experiment, and totally screw things up and learn stuff independently when there are 18 kids.",
    "YES. I would definitely recommend this class and any other that professor Wolenski teaches.",
    "This lab was the best lab I have ever taken at Yale. It taught important lab techniques - such as gel filtration and microscopes, but most importantly it did everything in a fun way. The hours went by so fast, when I usually dread the time spent in lab. I probably learned more in this lab than any other but was focused on having fun, not obsessing about grades. I really loved the way it was set up, with most of the time spent learning in lab rather than writing tedious lab reports outside of lab that do not really help with understanding. I wouldn't change a thing about this course. Professor Wolenski is one of the best professors I have ever had. He certainly cares more about his students than any other. From joking around to feeding us and making us t-shirts, Professor Wolenski was everyone's favorite professor and friend. He was always available and really cared about what we learned, and yet he managed to teach us and allow us to have fun at the same time. Usually a professor is either fun or good, but Professor Wolenski manages to handle both sides perfectly and the class was a real learning experience while being entertaining.",
    "This is a good lab to cover the bio lab requirement. If you don't have much experience in a bio lab, you will learn a lot fo the basic techniques, and even if you have experience but don't know exactly why this buffer is used or a gel is loaded that way or whetever, you will learn; Professor Wolenski will make sure of that. He talks a lot; you can either be impatient and dying to get out of class, or much better, be patient and understanding and try to absorb as much of the useful information he is giving you as you can. You work together with you classmates and have fun.",
    "Yes! Professor Wolenski is wonderful and this class is a great way to fulfill a biology lab requirement. A large time commitment, but little work outside of class.",
    "Good lab course - fills up 1-2 years in advance so email Prof. Wolenski quick. I was slightly disappointed with not being able to totally work out how experiments were planned, but everyone had to start at a certain level since we all had different lab backgrounds and experiences. I enjoyed doing journal club and presenting a paper instead of tedious lab reports."
