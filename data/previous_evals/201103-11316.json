    "Harvey Weiss is the best thing about this course. He's passionate, he's quirky, he's charismatic. He brings a particular archaeological lens to the study of global climate change and presents information in an unforgettable way. I really appreciated the pedagogical approach of focusing on a few important ideas and investigating them from many perspectives. So many professors sacrifice quantity for quality but Professor Weiss took a path I wish more would take: quality over quantity.My focus is on urban environmental issues. I took this class purely out of intellectual curiosity but it's really deepened my thinking on the issues on which I focus. Who knew that the human settlements and acute climate change events of ancient Mesopotamia could be so relevant to my thinking about the present day?!?!",
