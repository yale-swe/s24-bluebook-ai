   "comments": [
    "I found that the course accomplished its purpose. History of theory is something of a strange subfield, being a historical area within music theory, and it doesn't always take advantage of the various changes in thinking about historiography that other historical fields have taken on; in other words, it's fairly traditional. This is less a critique of the course than of the reading material available, but as it stands, it's more of a course for theorists than historians. It does provide a lot of resources for future reference, or potentially for teaching purposes.",
    "This class is required, but even if it were not it would be essential to theorists. I would recommend it strongly to any music historians who are interested in music after 1700."

   "comments": [
    "This course (and the other semester in the HoT sequence) provides a lot of extremely important context for the practice of music theory today, along with being an interesting field of study itself. I will definitely have this course's content in mind to some degree throughout my academic career, whether it is directly present in my work or not.",
    "This is an essential course for music theorists. Although the course was nominally a history course, I began to recognize the language of modern music theory in our historical readings almost immediately. Apart from the knowledge of historical figures and ideas, this course has greatly helped me in my understanding of what I think the field of music theory is\/ought to be."
