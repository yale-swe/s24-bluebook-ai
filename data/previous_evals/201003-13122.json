   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it, regardless of the level of familiarity with modern and contemporary poetry.",
    "If you like the material, go for it. It's not too much work, and it's an absolute joy to read some of these poets as if it were homework.",
    "This is a fantastic course. The syllabus is varied and cohesive, the lectures engaging, and the TAs well-prepared and helpful. One of the rare classes that I didn't want to endat the end of the semester. I am an English major with a strong interest in poetry, but I imagine this course would be interesting and worthwhile for students of other disciplines with an interest in the subject. Basically, you get to read poems by some of the best poets of the last 60 years, listen to Professor Hammer explain the poets' lives and work, and talk about the poems in section. The reading is not too heavy and doesn't feel like work at all if you enjoy poetry. There is a midterm, a final, and two papers, all graded very fairly.This is one of my two favorite classes I've taken at Yale. It will teach you to read poetry actively and sensitively, and less \"academically\" or \"canonically\" than one might read poets long dead (i.e. Milton, Shakespeare). I found this challenging and rewarding as an English major, but a non-major could enjoy this equally, I think. This goes without saying, but if you don't enjoy reading and writing about poetry, this is not for you.Professor Hammer is wonderful, interesting, and very kind. The TAs this term were well-prepared and helpful for papers.",
    "I definitely recommend Poetry since 1950! If you like analyzing poetry, take this class!! Prof. Hammer is great, and the TAs are so sweet and very helpful! You get to read poets from all around the world and the points Prof. Hammer brings up in class are very interesting (also, he's very knowledgeable on the area and has written several books\/articles about these poets and even knows many of them personally, so he's a great resource!). Section was really enjoyable; everyone had a chance to talk and present their arguments and my T.A. (Edgar) was great at facilitating the conversation without monopolizing it. Also, we took a trip to the Beinecke for our last section to look at some of the poets' belongings, which was a lot of fun! It was definitely one of my favorite classes and the workload was totally manageable. You get to read quite a number of poems each week, write two papers (one 5-7 and one 8-10), and take a midterm and final. Not stressful whatsoever, and so enjoyable! TAKE IT :D Best way to get a writing credit ever!",
    "This may seem kind of obvious, but anyone who's at all curious about modern poetry should take this course. The sampling of poems was pretty great, exploring both the work of the individual poets and providing a sense of the modern conflicts which connect them. Professor Hammer always delivers interesting and informative lectures, which provide historical\/cultural context and a sense of the poet's work as a whole. Section was where you really engaged with the text, so your experience of the class will be pretty dependent on that. I found that the workload wasn't very heavy because most poems were fairly short, but I also wanted to re-read to feel like I had a grasp of them -- so that's pretty self-regulated..",
    "The readings are really swell and the work is manageable. Take it, why don't you.",
    "Take this. Bishop, Lowell, Ginsberg, O'Hara, Plath, Rich, Ashbery, Larkin, Hill, Heaney, etc. If you're reading this right now, then you are interested enough in the material that it is actually indispensable. The reading is quick and satisfying, and the lectures are just profound enough to make you feel like you're getting somewhere with this life.",
    "Yes, take it. Fun.",
    "Everyone should take this class. Not only is it just enjoyable, learning to read poetry is so helpful in learning to look closely at form in other subjects as well. I love that I can now have an informed discussion about contemporary poetry, but almost more exciting is the discovery that I can read more closely in any circumstance, thinking about how things are expressed in addition to what they actually say.",
    "As stated, rather poorly organized. Otherwise quite relaxed. I enjoyed this course.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy reading poetry that you can relate to. Many of the authors on the syllabus write, if not confessional, then what at least qualify as introspective poems. Their work reflects a zeitgeist we're all still very familiar with.",
    "The course is a great introduction to many of the major poets after 1950! It relates them well to each other and has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. It's pretty low-key, and the reading definitely isn't onerous; plus, it's such great reading.",
    "Yes, take this course if you like poetry at all!",
    "Yes. This is a good survey of modern poetry, with an eye toward helping you make connections among different poets. I enjoyed it. Also, Prof. Hammer is a great resource, very willing to help his students.",
    "Great poetry class. Went into it because I was required to take a poetry class for the Lit major. Knew almost nothing about poetry in the beginning and often felt stupid in section but came out having learned a ton. Professor Hammer provides the right amount of historical context, literary interpretation and uber-chillness--his lectures really helped me understand the poems. The TAs are also extremely approachable and knowledgeable. I left the class with a much deeper appreciation for and understanding of poetry.",
    "Great class. Great subject matter. Take. It."
