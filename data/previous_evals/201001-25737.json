    "Take it if you need the math credit, but otherwise take something more interesting. If you do have to take it, Professor Casson is probably the best 115 teacher - very clear in speaking and in teaching and always covered the material required for the problem sets before they were do. From what I've heard not all of the math 115 teachers do that.",
    "I would only recommend it if you have to take it for a required major. But really, why else would you take it?",
    "Take it if you need to. It wasn't as bad as everyone says it is. If you go to class consistently (with Casson or Previdi), do your homework, and practice on your own, you'll be fine.",
    "If you have already taken BC, then this class will be a review. If you haven't it will be a challenge keeping up with everyone who did. If you have to take it for your major, you have no choice. If you don't, take a different class not worth the time or energy you put into it.",
    "I really disliked Math 115. I would not recommend it at all. I took it because it is a prereq for my possible major. If you're looking for a QR to get out of the way, do not enroll in this class. I don't think the information I learned is practical in any way. If you do have to take this class, take advantage of the grad students, who are there in the evenings, Monday-Wednesday. They will help you do your problem sets.",
    "Try that drinking game.",
    "The course goes quickly. That's not bad if you're already familiar with calc, though it may be hard if you didn't take it in HS.The last month or so is spent entirely on infinite series, so be prepared. It also takes up the majority of the final, which is worth 50%.Don't be afraid though. The class is straightforward, and if you try you should get an A or A-.",
    "Yes, its challenging, yet manageable.",
    "The class can get long and boring. I would not recommend it unless you're willing to do practice problems all the time.",
    "Math 115 covers BC Calc material. I recommend it if you need it for your major, or really love math. If you are just looking for an easy QR, this is not for you.",
    "Math 115 is a continuation of topics in AP Calc AB or Math 112. It draws students from a variety of majors because of its status as one of the basic pieces of calculus. Weekly problem sets were not a big time drain, and were usually graded easily and returned promptly. I had a good experience with Prof. Casson, who fully wrote out the reasoning behind the steps of his examples, and unlike many other professors is a native English speaker. The class can get a bad rep but I found it to be a satisfying continuation of my Calc AB expereience, and really not a terribly difficult class either.",
    "This is an impersonal intro course. The TA's grade the tests, and if you feel they made a mistake on a grade, etc, you won't be able to change much. If you need this course for your major, however, get up early on math preregistration day (7 AM at least) and take it with Casson; other teachers won't speak English well, and will make your experience terrible. The curve's pretty good, though somewhat thrown off by the fact that a lot of people have already covered the stuff in high school.",
    "It's the best Math 115 section of all, but at best, it's still Math 115. Just sayin.",
    "Math 115 is essentially CalcB\/C. It's math. It's pretty dry. At the beginning, you do integrals, and then go into applications of integrals, and finish the semester with sequences\/series. I wouldn't suggest taking math115 for fun, as it's not much of a fun course, but you do learn a lot, though to what extent you can apply it to future things is debatable, especially depending on what you're planning on going into. Chances are you're taking it as a prereq--if that's the case, suffer through it. It's doable.",
    "Yes, but mainly if you need it as a prerequisite",
    "Do it if you like integrals and series. Goes deeper than Calc BC.",
    "Definitely take this class for premed or major requirements. It is straightforward and isn't too bad",
    "Only take this class if you need it for your major. If you're just looking for a QR, then keep looking. Yale has better, more interesting QR classes. However, if you need to take it, then it's really just your standard calc class. I had calc BC prior to taking it, and the advisor tried to get me to take math 120, but I'm glad I took 115. Professor Casson isn't bad. At the very least, he's intelligible (he has a very understandable english accent). Make sure you get a section where you can understand the professor."
