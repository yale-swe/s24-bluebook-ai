    "I'd highly recommend taking this course with Professor Crumlish. It might be a bit more about political theory than you might be interested in, but overall the course presents you with a lot of really cool ideas that you can use in whichever way you want for the assignments. Plus, Professor Crumlish is generally awesome - I'd highly recommend talking to him outside the course."
