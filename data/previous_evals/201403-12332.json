    "This is a fantastic lecture course, addressing bioethics issues through the lens of philosophical arguments. You should definitely take a class with Professor Latham if you have the chance. If you have any interest in philosophy or bioethics, you should take this course.",
    "Don't take this class if you just want an easy A. Yes, there is literally no work for this class, but it's very hard to get an A. Only one person in both of my TA' sections got an A on the midterm. I'm very confused about the grading for this course - then again, I'm very confused about the grading for all humanities courses here at Yale. On the other hand, though, it's a great class and I did enjoy it. You learn a lot of interesting things.",
    "Yes. Not a gut, but take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "Yes, especially for those interested in learning the fundamental philosophical arguments that give rise to viewpoints about controversial topics (stem cell research, abortion, end of life care, etc.). not an overloading workload and enjoyable lectures!",
    "It's an interesting course that I would recommend taking.",
    "Awesome! it was an easy way to form an opinion about many hot-button issues of the current age. The teacher was dope and the section was helpful! Good work issues in bioethics!",
    "Phil 334 is a great 5th class to take if you are looking to get an overview about how philosophers and lawmakers begin to think about problems related to biology and medicine from an ethics standpoint. The course raises a lot of questions and how to think about them, but does not provide any answers (which may be frustrating to some). Professor Latham is one of Yale's best professors, and presents material in a very coherent way. Overall, this class has taught me how to think about some of the distinctions that we make in philosophy and how to think about bioethics in such a manner.",
    "Yes! Not a lot of work and interesting topics. Not as interesting as his spring law course though.",
    "Absolutely!!!! 100% recommend this great class! Very interesting and Latham is a great professor.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this class to other students. I think everyone should take Stephen Latham's course in the spring Bioethics and Law instead.",
    "Interesting class. I would recommend it, not a gut tho.",
    "Not a gut, but still take it because it is not that hard anyway.",
    "The lectures do not seem prepared at all. Prof. Latham seems to stall for time every lecture and I feel like I am wasting my time when I come to class. There is very little material to learn in this course (5 arguments or so that could take less than a day to learn). Section dynamic is extremely uncomfortable because people are more interested in talking than making cogent arguments. But hey, it's an easy class.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to everyone. Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer who lectures very fluidly without any notes. The topics we covered were all very interesting and the exams were very straightforward and exactly what you would expect.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you are interested in law and the logic of arguments. It's a great fifth course.",
    "I would recommend Bioethics to someone who's interested in thinking through certain issues and philosophical arguments, but not necessarily answering them - the class clues you in to big debates happening in the bioethics world, and while it gives you some tools to tackle them, a lot of the class is looking at the tradition of different arguments\/how to apply different arguments rather than giving \"answers\" to the big questions, per se. Can be both fun and frustrating at times. If you're looking for a not-stressful class that's interesting though, this is it!",
    "No.",
    "Yes. Take this class.",
    "Philosophical distinctions that are loosely tied to bioethical issues.",
    "Very interesting, not a lot of work, and makes you think about important bioethical issues so you can gain some clarity in your own mind. lectures get a little slow\/boring because we spend a while on each issue",
    "Issues in bioethics is an amazing course and I highly recommend it! Each week, we covered a different philosophical argument that related to bioethics cases. Professor Latham is an incredibly captivating lecturer; he works without notes or slides and just talks about the material. The work load is also relatively light -- a midterm, a short paper and a final. This was the course that I most looked forward to every week! It's a really excellent introduction to philosophical issues and how they apply in real-world scenarios.",
    "Great class, but please don't spend your time in lecture transcribing everything Prof. Latham says word for word. You will learn so much more and have a much more fun time if you listen, think while he talks, and maybe jot something down, both his ideas and your thoughts every once in a while. Every lecture I saw so many people just typing mindlessly and it was really annoying.",
    "Issues in Bioethics is a great class with a very low workload. You get immersed in philosophy without it being overwhelming and Professor Latham is very engaging. I enjoyed coming to lecture, and I thought the readings were manageable. Take it!",
    "Issues in Bioethics is an incredible course, and I would recommend it to anyone at Yale. The topics are so interesting and relevant, and Latham is one of the most incredible lecturers I've had at Yale. He discusses the readings in lecture, so it's not necessary to read everything assigned, but I still found myself doing most of the readings because the material is so interesting. This class is amazing and anyone would benefit from taking it.",
    "YES! It really taught you to think about issues that affect our day-to-day life in new ways. We learned about ebola, abortion, euthanasia, ect. Really really cool stuff. Not too hard, but you want to do the reading and go to class because it's actually genuinely interesting.",
    "Favorite class this semester. I loved Latham's teaching style, and the new philosophy-focused rather than issue-focused approach worked for me. Discussion sections were engaging and thought-provoking. Latham was obviously very very knowledgeable, and gave well thought out responses to all questions. Great sense of humor. I especially loved his use of all sorts of interesting case studies to illustrate certain ethical principles. 10\/10",
    "Do not expect to get answers to questions, but this class does make you think about your logic, which is a good thing! Also remember that the final is 50% of your grade, so the exam matters!",
    "Issues in Bioethics is a great class to take. It is very interesting course material that can be applicable to every day life. It allows you to form opinions and understand and acknowledge other people's opinions. I highly recommend this class to any student",
    "Great class. Professor Latham is a world-class lecturer. He makes the material clear and interesting. Bioethics affects everybody's life in so many ways that you might not think about on a day-to-day basis. The workload is extremely manageable, but if you go to lecture you will still get a lot out of the class and find yourself perplexed by ethical problems that you had never thought about before. This was the first philosophy class I've taken here and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn totally new ways to think about ethical problems.",
    "this was an awesome 5th class. There was almost no work, and grading was super easy. The material was fairly interesting (we looked at bioethics issues from a philosophical perspective) but definitely focused more on the philosophy and less on bioethical issues. If you took bioethics and law: the material doesn't overlap as much as I thought it would. I found this class to be both easier and a bit less interesting than bioethics and law.",
    "Good class. Lectures can be hit or miss depending on how much you like philosophy. The workload is only a short paper, midterm and final, and grading doesn't seem to harsh. Take it if the topics covered interest you.",
    "Interesting material, not much work, midterms\/final can bite you gradewise if you're not careful though.",
    "I took this course because I really enjoyed Latham's Bioethics and Law course. This class was nothing like it, though. Latham's still an excellent lecturer but the class is really confusing and there is no real structure. The TFs are extremely hard graders so be careful.",
    "An overview of the philosophical arguments underlying a lot of issues in applied ethics, morality, and biomedical ethics.",
    "Great class. Take if you need a PLSC credit and like to write. Its all about opinion and how you present your argument around your opinion.",
    "Class is not that well organized or well defined in what is covered or how it is grade but the material covered is very interesting nonetheless.",
    "Very good class, interesting and great professor.",
    "Take this course! It has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. In some classes, one sometimes succumbs to memorizing facts a few days before the final, but in this class, you actually learn. Professor Latham is great and his lectures have never been boring.",
    "Amazing class! A great compliment to Professor Latham's spring course, Bioethics and Law. If you don't feel like going to lecture, then this class is not for you. You'll get a lot out of lecture, as professor Latham is very engaging, funny, and interesting. The material isn't difficult per se, but the course will challenges you to think and approach problems in new ways -- something which I think other classes at Yale fail to do. Issues in Bioethics is definitely worth your time!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was really interesting, and a great way to learn more about bioethics issues in the world.",
    "Not much work, material can be repetitive.",
    "I would absolutely recommend PLSC 281 to a fellow student, especially if that student were a political science major.",
    "A great choice if you want to take a philosophy class but are wary of the abstract. Down-to-earth examples and applications, and some very interesting questions.",
    "You learn about general applied ethics frameworks that apply to many bioethics examples.",
    "Good. Interesting lecture and decent amount of engagement time with the professor. The course could use more reading.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the class to other students. It's a good survey of different philosophical approaches to practical issues in bioethics, and especially medical ethics.",
    "An interesting course that focused on several philosophical arguments, applied to some key bio issues. Bit heavy on the philosophy side more so than the bio aspect, but a good course and Latham is an easy lecturer to listen to.",
    "Yes if you can get Ben as your section leader",
    "Yes if you like bioethics but be ready to cut through a lot of useless information.",
    "good class.",
    "Sometimes we make good choices, sometimes we make bad choices. Some of the bad choices you make in life will leave you with regrets. If there is one bad decision you cannot make in your life, it will be taking this class. Do not take this class. I repeat, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It ruined my semester and those of my fellow classmates. That being said, the lectures themselves given by Professor Latham were interesting and the topic of the class was stimulating. The class could have had so much potential. But the way the class was run, and everything else about the class was dismal, and thats being optimistic. The grading is extremely subjective and the TAs can be brutally harsh. If you choose to take this class, have fun digging your own grave, and destroying any dreams you ever had. They call it a gut not because its easy, but because youre going to get gutted.",
    "Great overview of issues in bioethics, make sure you come to class and you'll perform well",
    "The class is great no matter what your interested in.",
    "If you have any interest in philosophy, medicine, or ethics, I would definitely recommend this course. I came in with a rudimentary understanding of some ethical principles and found myself challenged and entertained. Raises important questions about what is right and wrong in debates that seem to have no answer (surrogacy, abortion, end of life care, etc.).",
    "Take this course! I took it Cr\/D but it isn't hard to do well in the class, not to mention, Prof. Latham is one of the best professors at Yale. This class will teach you to talk intelligently about some of the pressing issues of our day - abortion, end-of-life care, organ donation, etc.",
    "Yes- Latham is an absolutely fantastic lecturer and the classes are really awesome. A midterm, a 5-7 page paper, and a final. Latham is super interesting, knows a lot, awesome that he always takes questions and really engages with you and wants you to understand the material, super smart guy. The only slight downfall was the TAs, who were law students and could sometimes be pretty pretentious- it would have been really nice if they could tell you before the midterm what they were looking for and how to write an essay that THEY thought was good. Latham seems like a super reasonable guy who wants you to do well, but unfortunately, your TAs grade the tests so you have to talk to them and make sure you understand what they want, even if you think you know what the professor wants. All in all, super interesting and not much weekly work at all. You don't even have to do the readings to do well, Latham talks about all the important ones in class",
    "Meh.",
    "Take this! It will make you think about morality (beyond just bioethics) in a structured and digestible way. Lecture was great and thought-provoking. One of those classes that makes you come out as a more informed and better person.",
    "It was a really interesting class and Professor Latham is amazing! A good Credit\/D or fifth class for a grade depending on your major and your course schedule.",
    "YES. TAKE IT. One of my favorite courses at Yale. Such an interesting class that changed the way I thought about things, and challenged many strongly held beliefs I once held. The course looks at many current bioethical issues (abortion, cloning, end of life care, etc) through the lens of various philosophical arguments\/distinctions.",
    "Fine class. Not a lot of work, and you learn some stuff about philosophy.",
    "The subject matter was a little different and very interesting, glad I took the class.",
    "Yes. I think it was an interesting class with not that much work. The essay was interesting to write and not too difficult since it required no outside research.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, mostly because of how interesting the subject is.",
    "Overall, this was a great course. I was skeptical at first going in because I'm not a huge fan of biology and didn't have any exposure to bioethics, so I was unclear about how bio-oriented the class would be. Professor Latham explained on day 1 the types of topics that bioethics covers - abortion, end of life care, etc. - and also told the class that the organization was based on philosophical arguments rather than the topics. All in all, it was a great class and I would certainly recommend it to other students.",
    "It is a cool course which provides interesting perspectives. Problem is that there was some vagueness in the material, so if you aren't a fan of actually finding conclusions and coming to concrete details, then this won't be the course for you. Latham was a great lecturer though and made the course very engaging.",
    "Good 5th credit! Not too much work but good food for thought",
    "take this course!!!",
    "It's a class about common debateable issues in society. I would definitely recommend this class. It helps you form your own opinions and thought on important topics. It also helps you realize what people deal with everyday when making decisions."
