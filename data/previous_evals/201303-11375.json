    "Swensen is a legend! He's brilliant, and taking a class with the man who has pioneered the Yale Endowment's strategy to achieve returns like his is an honor. Both Swensen and Takahashi are very kind and knowledgeable. The material can get a bit dry, especially if you don't plan on institutional investing (which this class would be more aptly named). But it does teach you some very valuable lessons on portfolio management. The workload is pretty light. Reading is easy; papers are short and somewhat mindless. The guest lecturers are phenomenal. They're rock stars across their respective fields. Having these hedge fund and PE managers and the like as weekly speakers makes this a truly one-of-a-kind seminar. If you can get in, definitely take it.",
    "Yes. It's easily one of the best classes at Yale, and is the gem of the econ department. The work is definitely manageable, and the material is very relevant and interesting, so take it if you can.",
    "Must take",
    "The managers make this class. It would have been nice to hear Takahashi and Swensen talk more, esp when the managers were around. Class content became obvious and sometimes boring when managers weren't there. Good class, but probably better seminars out there. Almost everyone in class had worked for Goldman over the summer, which turned me off. Points deducted for late papers.",
    "If you can get into the class, you would be a fool not to take this class. By far one of the best classes at Yale and here's why - not only do you get to hear from the two leading endowment managers in the business (David Swensen and Dean Takahashi) and how they grew the fund from $1 billion to $20 billion, but you also get to here from leading investment managers out there - people in venture capital, hedge fund, short sellers, real estate. You definitely won't get this opportunity again in the near future, so definitely TAKE THIS CLASS.Workload-wise, it's 5 2-page single spaced critical reviews of the guest speakers graded by the TA (who works in the Investments Office), a few low-key class presentations, and a 15-page final paper. Work definitely is more heavy in the second half of the semester, but don't let that deter you.",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale by far. Will change the way you understand finance and investing for the better.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Dave and Dean keep the class fresh and interesting while bringing some humor as well. They are two of the most impressive people at Yale University, and their success in their field is unmatched. While Dave may get most the headlines and attention from students, Dean is equally interesting and very nice and funny. And all of that comes before the best part of the class - the guest speakers. They will change your understanding of finance, and you will see the qualities that made them so successful. The TA, Danny, was also superb. Definitely ask him questions - he's incredibly well-informed, and this was only his first year doing it. He should be even better next year. Workload is very mild as well.",
    "Yes. It is daunting, yes, but looking back probably one of the best courses I have taken as a student. Not only does it let you be creative (which you might not expect), but it also opens your eyes to things happening all around you--two criteria of an excellent class. Even the extra long class hours didn't kill me like I thought they would...I was too interested in what was being said by Swensen, Takahashi, and their peers.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can. An incredible, not-to-be-missed opportunity.",
    "Yes for the speakers. It is really a once in a lifetime opportunity to get to listen to the top investment managers in the world describe their strategies."
