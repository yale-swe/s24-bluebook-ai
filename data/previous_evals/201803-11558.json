   "comments": [
    "None",
    "Learned how to quantize fields.",
    "I got the general idea about filed theory and also developed techniques to conduct some calculations.",
    "Taking this course, I have learned how Quantum Field Theories are constructed. Bringing together special relativity and quantum mechanics, the course taught me interesting perspectives from both and the understanding of perturbation theory through Feynman diagrams is a valuable concept to know for a physicist.",
    "I learned the basics of quantum field theory; this includes an understanding of why quantum field theory is necessary and how to quantize simple fields. There was a focus on both a theoretical understanding and a working knowledge of performing various calculations to quantize fields and at the end to start calculating results in interacting theories.",
    "Feynman diagrams, relativistic QM, Dirac equation",
    "Basic techniques of Quantization of Fields and basics of free and interaction fields",
    "I found that having a diagrammatic view of the theory simplifies the physics considerably. In this class, Feynman diagrams were extremely useful to approximate scattering amplitudes.",
    "I learned intro level QFT",
    "I had a course on quantum field theory before in my home country, so in this course I revised and structured for myself many of the basic notions of relativistic field theory, such as Fock space, scattering theory, S-matrix, Feynman diagrams, and many others. I learned about the role of representation theory in constructing the field theories. I reviewed how the Klein-Gordon field, electromagnetic (U(1)) field, and Dirac field are quantized.",
    "I learned (actually, revised) the introductory concepts of quantum field theory in general and of quantum electrodynamics in particular."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weakness.",
    "The course is very well explained and very well organized.",
    "A strength of this course is that it gave homework assignments that required students to understand the material well. The course could be improved by going through Feynman diagrams and scattering amplitudes a bit slower so that we can focus on providing more intuition about the role of each term in the resultant formalisms.",
    "The final exam should reflect the material covered in the course. In this course, the final exam was largely on unpracticed material not presented in a lecture.",
    "The professor explains the course material very clearly.",
    "The course is very detailed and well-structured. Perhaps it could be improved by providing the digital notes in the future. Another thing that would benefit is the increase in the number of qualitative explanations - some proofs (in the part about scattering and interactions) seemed a bit too formal",
    "Strengths: good pacing, in-depth coverage of material. I liked the focus on group-theoretical questions in the first half of the course. Weaknesses: I would greatly appreciate if the course materials were typed on a computer (in LaTeX or any other media)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, of course.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course another student because it is very well explained and very available to students.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in gaining a good introduction to modern particle physics. The course brings together special relativity and quantum mechanics in the context of a field theory. It is very interesting to see the process of building modern theories and I any student who would like to better understand challenges facing theoretical physics today will benefit from taking the course. To get the most out of the course, the student should be prepared to spend a significant amount of time each week.",
    "Quantum field theory is an extremely important part of modern theoretical physics. It is useful for high energy physics, condensed matter, and statistical physics. Anybody who wants to understand these at a deep level should take this course. The focus here is on relativistic fields, hence the name, and will focus on the standard model for the second semester, but it is nevertheless good to see where QFT was originally developed and to understand the relativistic theories in my opinion. I would recommend this course to anybody who wants to study theoretical physics at any meaningful level.",
    "One should clearly know whether he\/she should take this course at this stage, based on personal interest; speaking of this version, however, it is a very good one.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, QFT is the basis to many physical theories and having a good foundation in this course will be very useful.",
    "Yes, I would. This course is a must for anyone who is interested in theoretical physics (not only high-energy).",
    "Yes, the course was a comprehensive introduction to Relativistic Field Theory."
