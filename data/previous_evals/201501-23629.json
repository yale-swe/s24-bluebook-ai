I'm not sure if this was because the group was somewhat inattentive or that as a group we weren't the best at reading the assignments. On another note, I think that putting some of the critical writings on the A Syllabus might actually help the discussion. Sometimes I thought the discussion could be kicked into gear if we had something to read alongside the play, such as an essay, letter, etc."

It is much easier to spot a tragedy and a comedy with a happy ending; however, farces already have the darkness\/macabre\/grotesque of the tragicomic in it. Should we dismiss the slippage? Or maybe the genres are not mutually exclusive?"
