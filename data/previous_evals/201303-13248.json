    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the Middle East and political science, but probably not to those who had little background in the region or interests in engaging with region-specific debates. This is not a weakness of the course, and speaks to its high level of specialization. The class was intense (high reading load) but extremely rewarding for those who put in the work."

    "This course was instrumental in prospectus\/dissertation development, giving me an opportunity to familiarize myself with current debates in the area-studies\/political science intersection and view my options. It also deepened by understanding of the issues present in the field of political science for those trying to study the Middle East."
