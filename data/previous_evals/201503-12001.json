    "An absolutely stellar course, by design and by virtue of Dr. Simon's panoptic case knowledge. If you can get in and can bear the burden of being accountable for (daring to stab at) solving a real country's peace, do so. Every student is accountable for a country, which becomes the lens through which s\/he assesses the reasonable reading workload of IR theory. Quantitative and qualitative papers are fairly represented, and Dr. Simon will take the indigenous perspective over the peacekeepers' any day of the week. The true test of a professor is often not his\/her monologue, but how s\/he takes and responds to challenge. Dr. Simon did so brilliantly. He fairly and curiously engaged with student ideas while calling on a wealth of case studies in his memory. His agenda was not rigorously-set; he appeared to come to class with an open mind, and that liberated each of us to do the same. Dr. Simon is as engaging and fair as can be. If you're careful with your country choice and paper topic, this can be a life-changing course.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course. It's a nice overview of many different conflicts and you learn a lot from listening to other students. There is probably a different course out there that is a better use of your time and that you will learn more from by focusing on a specific country, region, or post-conflict topic."
