    "I learned how sound effects and music are made by adjusting different elements through programming.",
    "I gained a lot more programming skills---though sadly in a language specific to the program we were using (supercollider) so in reality only transferable on a more abstract problem-solving level to more popular programs. I also learnt a lot about computer music---how sound is converted from audio to digital and back again, what a bus is, and a refresher on how sound works as a wave. It definitely lives up to its interdisciplinary name---I found myself coding a lot and furthering my skills there as well as again broadening my understanding of music (on a technical level)."

    "Class time could have been used more efficiently.",
    "I think that this course really picked up for me as soon as we started making sound. I know the weeks prior were necessary to gain some proficiency in the language, but I still valued the later ones so much more, and found them much more engaging. I sometimes felt that too much was expected from us during the first weeks---the class is sold as an introductory programming class and I noticed quite a few students struggling with the fast pace, and lack of thorough explanation. However, I think everyone figured out a way to make it work for them as soon as we started making sound, because it then became less about organizing lists of numbers and more about editing the direct feedback on your work that you hear (or many times can't hear) through your speakers. I also personally really enjoyed my final project, and found myself excited to spend numerous hours working on it to produce something I ended up pretty psyched about. I did wonder however, about the efficacy of the midterm. While I understand the goal of it was to make everyone study the program and familiarize themselves with its working, it felt a little useless to write set definitions of things as that's not something we ever need to do again. It seemed like a working definition of things was really what one needed to be proficient in supercollider, but I understand that it is difficult to test that."

    "I learned a lot about programming with SuperCollider which was cool. Scott is pretty open to helping out if you don't show up at the last minute. I think this course is better if you already are familiar with coding and music. Your attendance is a big part of your grade, so you have to show up. Some days were a little boring or confusing because we would go over general concepts\/ideas, but their actual application was the difficult part. We have the book and online resources, but they only give you so much if you don't have the background. Plus the book doesn't have an index, so you're kind of stuck using CTRL+F to find key words in the PDF if you don't know something. The book is cool, but it's not very friendly to beginners in the way that it's written and organized.",
    "This is a really cool class, especially if you want to learn about the intersection of music and computer programs. You learn a lot about how musical information can be represented for computers. You also get to learn about how arduinos can generate musical information, and you get to do stuff with live coding. Scott, the professor, is really cool. He is very knowledgeable and and personable. Sometimes I felt like he was talking about these concepts at a higher level than what I could understand, but he was really good at sitting down later and explaining it to me in a way I could understand. Take it!",
    "yes, I would recommend this course to students who have no programming background and are interested in making some sound effects and music. He teaches students depending on what we want to learn.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, making sure to warn them about the flow of the class, and its progression from a little tedious to really engaging (depending on how much you put into it). While class time can sometimes cover topics that feel like they go slightly over your head or are too expansive\/confusing to incorporate into your own projects\/assignments, you get what you put in and can choose what seems valuable to you. Its a great class to gain a medium level proficiency in something totally new and some solid background in how audio and computer programming work, and have the potential to create something you are really proud of."
