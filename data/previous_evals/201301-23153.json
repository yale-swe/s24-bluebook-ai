   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. We progressed through the history of Rome through a close study of its literature, focusing on cultural themes\/values and connections between authors and their contexts.",
    "I would not have taken this course if it had not been required for my major, mainly because I'm not terribly interested in reading literature in translation. However, I now have a much fuller sense of what Latin authors I want to read. Some of the lectures are interesting; at times I found it hard to follow what was going on historically, however, because the material is presented thematically, not chronologically.",
    "I would not recommend this class. There are other classes offered at Yale that offer you almost the same material with better lectures.",
    "Wouldn't recommend taking this class unless required for the Classical Civ. major. Interesting enough, but there is a ton of reading and the grading is tougher than you would expect. Take-home midterm, in-class final and mandatory graded section.",
    "A very fun and interesting course. I took a lot of Latin in High School but wasn't nearly up to par to take it at Yale and by the time I got to be a Junior I was very anxious to return to it and this course gave me an excellent opportunity to review a lot of things that I missed (longing) and missed (because translating is hard) very quickly and very enjoyably. I'm a science major and I still really enjoyed the class."
