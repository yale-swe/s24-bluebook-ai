    "It was a really great class the covered the subject matter thoroughly",
    "Yes. I think fluorescence is going to remain an important technique in both biochemistry and biophysics for a while. It's good to know the practical and theoretical aspects.",
    "Yes I would. I was taking another class at the time, a Cell Biology Seminar. And the imaging techniques that we went over in this class, directly helped me to understand some of the data in the Cell Biology Seminar.",
    "Great overview of a lot of biophysical and optical techniques, many of which, all biological scientists will come across. Highly recommended.",
    "Nice course. Helpful. Highly recommended.",
    "MB&B 722 is an in-depth introduction to various biophysical techniques for analyzing whole protein and single molecule experiments. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course, and I had done so to several people in MCDB and Cell Bio. Liz is top-notch and I've heard that she is a far better instructor for this course than the professor who teaches a similar course in Cell Bio.",
    "Wonderful class! Very useful, not too much work, and Professor Rhoades is AMAZING and makes difficult concepts understandable."

   "comments": [
    "I feel much more competent to actually use these techniques in the future.",
    "Helped a lot in understanding the experimental protocols around a lot of the assays that I will need to either use or understand in the future. Not only experimental but also thephysical understanding of the assays. Overall very very helpful and a wonderful class what made everything very clear.",
    "I learnt a lot about various optical techniques.",
    "I now have a much better idea of how to incorporate biophysical techniques into my research. the course also encouraged me to explore ideas for my research. I know I will be more prepared to integrate these techniques into my research now. I know that Liz's teaching style and enthusiasm for the topic greatly enhanced my excitement for these topics. I'm really grateful for her energy and expertise!"
