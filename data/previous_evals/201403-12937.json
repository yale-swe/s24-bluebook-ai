   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're really interested in these thinkers, but it's not as riveting as it sounds. You could get by (because it's easy enough) without doing the readings, but it really only works if everyone is with it. Seminar is a long 1.8 hours...",
    "The material of this course is crucial to much of modern philosophy, psychology, literary theory, history, ethics, political theory...you get the picture. The structure of the course provides a good introduction to each thinker - significantly more than an SEP acquaintance, if not exactly a provisional understanding of their overarching projects. You would be hard pressed to find a professor more qualified than Professor Campe to teach the course. My only advice would be that, as with every seminar, you have to read the room. Classmates can make or break a seminar such as this.",
    "This is a good seminar that would be better as a lecture. This class is worth taking for Professor Campe's insights, which will help you firm up a good understanding of Marx and especially Nietzsche (we spent most of the semester on these two thinkers). Campe is remarkably generous with his time, and is genuinely interested in helping you follow an idea. All this said, I was disappointed by the quality of discussion in seminar. I think this is largely a function of who's in the class, but I did think Professor Campe could have been firmer in forcing us to pursue a specific, sustained line of inquiry.",
    "If you have an interest in reading some of the key works, or excerpts of these, and discussing them, take this class. The workload is not bad, the professor is great, and the time you spend on it feels productive in one way or another.",
    "I loved the readings for the course, and both Prof. Campe and Tavi provided invaluable insight into the philosophy. I always followed discussions with great interest, and felt welcome to ask questions or discuss papers after class. Prof. Campe's mini-lectures at the beginning of most meetings illuminated some aspect of the text and suggested questions for discussion. Especially at the beginning of the semester, when we were getting used to the ideas and rhetoric of the authors, Tavi's elucidations of central arguments were very helpful. I feel like I understand the ideas and movements of the twentieth century so much better now that I've gotten this thorough introduction to Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud--I highly recommend this course!",
    "Analyzing the texts from Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. Four to five short papers (3 pages long), one reading response per week, and a term paper, so a very manageable work load! Take the class, my outlook on life has definitely changed (for the better!) because of what I read and listened to and discussed in class.",
    "This is the secret history of the 'other' European intellectual tradition. You cannot understand the modern world without looking at these philosophers; any person who wishes to the horrors and the heights of the last century should look to this course for an introduction. I only regret that I will not be able to take the continuation next semester."
