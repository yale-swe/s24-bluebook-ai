The fundaments of communications and networking provided in class are applicable to production work at YSD \/ YRT."

The lab projects are incredibly fun and relevant to the types of things I hope to be doing in the future. The final project of the class is an excellent challenge and requires us to exercise all of the skills acquired throughout the class."
