    "I would recommend this class if you're trying to fulfill your language requirement, but otherwise a class that meets every day is a lot of work.",
    "A good course with a good amount of work and will help you grow in spanish",
    "I would summarize it as a typical Yale intermediate-advanced level grammar course in Spanish, with a bit more emphasis on literature and culture than SPAN 130. I would not recommend this corse unless you need it for a language requirement or the Spanish major, as you will VERY quickly tire of it, possibly regardless of your interest in the Spanish language (I really like Spanish but did not really enjoy this class on a day to day basis). However, if you must take it, take with Sonia Valle. She is a fair but gentle grader, so the class will have little to no effect on your GPA if you put in a fair amount of work."
