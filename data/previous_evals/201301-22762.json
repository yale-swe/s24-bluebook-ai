    "I think students in ChemE should definitely take this course. It's not only a way to get you hands on some real science, but it's great if you're considering grad school. From what I understand, grad schools love research, so they should eat this up. Also meet the other grad students who work in your lab, mine were very chill. You probably won't interact a whole lot with the actual professor whose lab you work in, but he\/she can be a good source of recommendations too.",
    "This is a great opportunity.",
    "Great.",
    "You should give research a try if you are at all interested in doing science and math as a part of your career. Everyone I encountered was welcoming, helpful, and very pleasant to work with!",
    "Very good experience, highly recommended if you can do it in a lab you are interested in. Excellent way to fulfill elective. However, the 10 hour time commitment can be significant, so plan accordingly. No homework is definitely a plus.",
    "Getting your hands wet in the lab is always a valuable experience. That said, getting them really wet is the best experience, i.e. spending a lot of time in the lab and really getting into your research. I worked in Prof. Elimelech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lab, and overall it was a really great experience. I loved going to the lab, the problem was that I felt guilty because I felt like I should have been working on coursework more. I had a research internship the summer before, where I spent the entire day in the lab and concentrated on my project. I wanted to be able to do that in Elimelech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lab as well, but you just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that kind of time when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a student, and the post-doc who I worked with acknowledged that too. Research for credit during the semester is really fun and a good break from coursework, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to get a ton of stuff done because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll either kill yourself or be disappointed. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to spend a summer doing research, this is definitely a great option, because I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really important to experience what lab work is like. It also makes sense if you want to shop a lab and see if you want to stay involved, but during the semester you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to get a whole lot done in terms of getting results. Overall learned a lot and enjoyed it. It would be helpful if more guidance for the course were provided, such as hours, work agenda, and the final paper. On one hand it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freedom, but if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take initiative you can get lost."
