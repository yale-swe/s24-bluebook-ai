    "I learned a lot about estimators, loss functions, admissibility, and statistical inference. The class was a lot of fun, and Harry is really good at explaining difficult concepts in a really easy to understand way. Additionally, Harry intersperses lectures with the history of statistics and current research in the field, which is cool.",
    "In this course, I learned the mathematical formalisms underlying statistical decision theory and choice of estimators. We covered a ton of topics from False Discovery Rate to Minimax estimation, from exponential families to James Stein estimation. I definitely got a strong grasp of the tools used in mathematical statistics, as well as an amazing introduction to the field. Harry is amazing at contextualizing all the results from class in terms of the history of statistics and where the field is going. Through this class, I learned that I love statistics to the point where I want to attend graduate school in statistics.",
    "I learned *a lot* about essentially everything we covered in class: Bayesian inference, minimaxity, exponential families, equivariance, and so on. Also learned a lot of statistics history and strengthened my basic probability theory knowledge."

    "Harry is an excellent lecturer and really cares about the students.",
    "This was an incredible course and there is little I would do to improve it. Harry is an incredible teacher, explaining the material so well in such an engaging manner. The lecture notes are easy to follow, the exams are fun and challenging. The homework, for the most part, was enjoyable. My one bit of feedback is that some of the homework problems in the textbook were a bit boring. They were more about doing out difficult integrals by hand or plugging one complicated formula into another complicated, and such problems didnt teach the material that much. Not all problems were like this but there were quite a few that were. Another area for improvement is solution sets. This may take more effort than it is worth, but it would be nice to have access to solution sets for the homeworks or exams after they are due in order to fill in holes in understanding certain problems without having to go to office hours.",
    "Great course. Covered and learned a lot of material, got a good feel for statistical inference in general, difficult but interesting homework, and same with exams. My only critique is that sometimes lectures were a little slow. Too much time was sometimes spent rather basic steps in a proof that I think students could figure out on their own time. I think that dwelling on these mechanical aspects sometimes prevented the discussion of more interesting material."

    "This was a great class that I would recommend to any statistics major looking to really explore the theory. Harry does a great job teaching it.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in theoretical statistics. There's some really interesting math, and Harry is a really great professor. He takes the time to explain things if you need, but the majority of the time you won't, because Harry is really good at explaining complicated topics in a really understandable way.",
    "This class is not for everyone, but if you are pretty good at math and mathematical proofs, and you like statistics this class could easily become one of your favorite classes at Yale. This is the one class at Yale that I found really did a nice job of combining statistics with mathematical rigor, and therefore, this was one of my favorite classes at Yale. You will either like the material or you will not like it and that is up for you to decide. One thing I can say for sure is that you will definitely like Harry! Harry is an absolutely incredible teacher and brings so much energy into his teaching. His lectures are easy to follow for three reasons: 1) Harry always teaches directly from his memory and never looks at any notes (though he gives students lecture notes before class so that they can follow the material during lecture without having to worry about writing things down) 2) He includes students in the content of the lecture. For example, he will ask a question, and then put the students name and suggestion on the board, and refer back to that student and his\/her suggestion throughout the lecture 3) He brings so much energy and enthusiasm about the material, sometimes sharing bits of statistical history to make you realize how exciting the topic he is teaching really is. Besides his amazing lectures, he is also just a kind, fun, and approachable guy. He really looks out for his students and wants them to succeed.",
    "Awesome course. Very difficult and requires a very strong foundation in probability theory. Psets and exams are also very difficult. But you learn an incredible amount of material and really get a good sense for various important topics in statistical inference. Harry is also a phenomenal, passionate, brilliant, very helpful professor. It was a pleasure to have taken his course."
