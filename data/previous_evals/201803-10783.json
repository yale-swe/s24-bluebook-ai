    "You get to learn not only about the genre of crime fiction, but also learn about East Asia through the lens of crime fiction.",
    "In addition to getting an overview of East Asian Crime and Detective Fiction, I also got a crash course in 19th-20th century East Asian history, a great deal of genre and film theory, the occasional reading discussing pornography in conjunction with horror and melodrama, and an understanding of the permeability of genre.",
    "Analyzing East Asian crime detective fiction stories through larger lenses of genre, theory, history, socio-economic implications, empire, etc.",
    "Genre. How to understand it, how to challenge it, how to study it and write it.",

   "comments": [
    "This course excelled not only in easing students into unfamiliar subjects -- East Asian literature and film\/genre theory -- but also keeping things relevant. We walked into class one day and had an emergency discussion on -- you'll never guess -- the new Detective Pikachu trailer, and how it intersects with the dynamics of genre, internationality, and narrative tropism we'd been discussing all semester.",
    "The readings are excellent. Enjoyed almost every single one. It is a very discussion-based class. It only works if everyone is willing to talk and throw out ideas. I always thought the discussions were really good, but occasionally felt they were not structured enough. The Powerpoints were usually quite helpful but sometimes I couldn't see how exactly the larger historical context tied into the novel (maybe choose specific sections from the text as examples). I also would have liked to do at a few close analyses of the text itself (displayed on the board).",
    "Amazing course: interesting readings, exceptional teaching, fun assignments",
    "Professor Poland is amazing and extremely willing to help his students. He makes himself available and facilitates conversation and discussion during class, prompting students to go further in their analysis than they normally would."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely adored this course, not just because the material was a ton of fun (down to earth, \"\"lowbrow,\"\" intelligent and thoughtful, theoretical and practical), but also because Professor Poland is an excellent instructor who easily balances the lecture-based side of class (historical crash courses, understanding of theory) with the discussion-based side of class, where we work through applications of the theory we learned from readings on the texts we've read\/watched. He's one of the best professors I've had who knows how and when to give gentle nudges to guide the discussion to deeper insights.",
    "Yep! It's an awesome class! Prof. Poland is great at leading discussion and really knows how to ask deeper and deeper questions. If you love the classic Western Detective novel and are interested East Asian history you should definitely take this class - it really broadens one's notions of the genre!",
    "Definitely, no question. It's an amazing class, fascinating, and the professor is by far one of the best I've ever had.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The course was well thought out and included very interesting readings that gave a great overview of East Asia."
