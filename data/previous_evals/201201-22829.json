   "comments": [
    "This course is an in depth primary literature exploration of genetic studies and their technology since the sequencing of the human genome, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in genetics or biology in general since it is likely that your own research may likely involve some of these studies or perhaps attempting to understand biological function based on some of the genes identified in these studies. Thus this is probably one of the most relevant classes you will take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Even if you have never read primary literature before, you will learn, and its really cool material you won't get anywhere else at Yale. Also, class itself is more laid back, so its not super stressful.",
    "You discuss 2 papers per week. There is no written work-- just discussion. This is good in that it isn't that much work and you learn a lot, but i think it would have helped if there were some other requirements.",
    "This is a once-a-week 2 hour seminar class that will give you a background in next gen DNA sequencing technologies and how they are used in modern genetics\/genomics. Dellaporta obviously has a love of the material and his enthusiasm is infectious. The work load is fairly light, and the papers that are assigned are interesting (though definitely read the reviews first!). At times the material was somewhat tedious with the technical aspects and all those figures. This was the first year the course was fun, so there were some technical issues to work out, but it is somewhat unclear how it will transform in coming years. I'm not sure whether or not I can recommend it. Take a look at the new syllabus and talk to Dellaporta - he'll be honest with what you're in for.",
    "Yes! Great low-pressure, high-impact class.",
    "It's a seminar that goes over genetics papers. If you took Molecular Bio, it's somewhat like the discussion sections for that class. I'd definitely recommend it if you're interested in genetics.",
    "Yes! It was a really great experience, being able to take a discussion-based MCDB course. You learn all about the state of the field of genetics, which is honestly one of the most relevant subfields of biology right now. You also get really good at reading science papers efficiently and truly understanding them, which would is really useful for all other science classes. In terms of workload, the only work is reading for class and participating (no tests or papers)",
    "It is worth taking but be prepared to really sift through a lot of technical information and be patient for applications of the material.",
    "This was definitely an interesting class though, because it was the first year it was being taught, it was a little poorly organized. You do read some really interesting papers and the class helped me to learn how to read complicated papers on the human genome in more depth and to be able to understand them. I think with the improvements that I know the professors want to make this will be a great class in years to come.",
    "Very interesting class, although there is so much material to get through that it is quite rushed and we never ended up discussing many of the papers. The only real work is to read a few papers each week and be prepared to discuss them, although this may change slightly. I found it to be very useful, although it did get a little technical or boring at times, which made the seminar a difficult way to have the class. But overall, I would recommend it, especially if you don't want to do too much work but want to talk about\/learn something interesting.",
    "This class is super interesting and on topic for science today. You do read tons of technical primary scientific literature so be prepared for that. Explaining figures can be a little intimidating but gets easier as the class goes on.",
    "For being in its first year this was a decent class, and I think many of the kinks will be worked out by next year. It was about 2 to 3 papers a week which was definitely manageable and covered a wide range of topics related to genomics and genome research. Other than presenting one of the papers at some point in the semester there was no other work. Dellaporta is also super nice so I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they can get in to it."
