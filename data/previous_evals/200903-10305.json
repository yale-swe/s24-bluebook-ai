    "Yes, Astronomy majors should definitely consider taking this course. It's a very good introduction to the topic, and because it doesn't assume GR, it can be taken before or after GR.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone with any type of interest in cosmology should take this course, assuming they're prepared with the appropriate background in math and physics.",
    "This course surveyed the important topics in modern cosmology.Yes. It was interesting and provided me with a solid background in the field.",
    "I would recommend the class as a good introduction to the field.",
    "I recommend to audit this class instead of actually taking if students are interested in cosmology and if Prof. Natarajan teaches this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it."

    "This course gave me a foundation in Cosmology which will be useful throughout my career. At the end of the course the instructor gave us an assignment to write a paper on a recent cosmology journal article. This exercise (as intended) showed me that I can read and understand the frontiers of research in this area.The course also helped me to put my research in a larger context.Thank you!",
