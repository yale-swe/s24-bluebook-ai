    "DS Philosophy is just amazing. Take it!",

    "Stick with March. He's awesome. This is a great class. You will not be lectured at. This is an intense Socratic dialogue with the professor. You will probably leave more confused than anything else, but it's a great experience. Be proactive and talk to him.",
    "I would highly recommend DS Philosophy to another student; although the material is challenging, the lectures and discussions were so intellectually stimulating that I found myself pondering over their topics out of class on several occasions. This course made me appreciate and become interested in philosophy, and is a great introduction to Western Philosophy.",
    "Everyone should take DS!",
    "A solid introduction, invaluable for anyone interested in ancient or modern philosophy. Rather enjoyable.",
    "Good introduction to western philosophy."
