    "As the legend goes, Evariste Galois died at the ripe age of 20 in a lust-fueled duel. What a legend. Coincidentally, I almost died in a duel with Miki except her weapon of choice was the second midterm exam. Shots rang out as I read problems like \"Let f be a function. Show that f is irreducible and separable with Galois group D_{88}.\" (SPOILER ALERT: f is the Frobenius map then everything just falls out). Even though Miki can be triki sometimes, Galois Theory was pretty great. You learn about fields and field extensions, and you review a lot of the stuff from abstract algebra and see how it's used in practice. Miki did a great job teaching this course, and it's a nice amount of work compared to the Asher Auel's method of Dummit-and-Footer-boarding. Don't forget to scrawl down your life's work the night before the second midterm, just so it doesn't get lost forever when you pass.",
    "Take this class if you are really good at math or dont care about your gap. Either way, DEFINITELY take this class at the beginning cr\/d.",
    "I'd certainly recommend it. Galois Theory is one the most beautiful sides of mathematics, as far as I can tell. Roughly speaking, it is about analyzing the group of automorphisms of a field extension, which sounds dull. But it lets you do incredible things, like prove the insolubility of the quintic, that you cannot square the circle, can only construct certain n-gons, etc. Ostensibly, it seems crazy that looking at \"the group of automorphisms of a field extension\" would let you do that, but it does. As far as the class itself, Miki is a great professor, if somewhat enigmatic. Definitely super available and helpful, though she can come off a little terse. She lectures quite fast though, so definitely pay attention, or else you'll be left behind. Homeworks were fairly interesting and took at most like 8 hours a week, maybe, so not bad. Tests were fairly straightforward, though she did not provide practice ones so the averages were pretty low, around a 70 on both. If you took 350, you should definitely not stop there, and take this course.",
    "Lot of work",
    "A great, challenging class. Make sure you keep the various extension theorems clear in your head early on, and try reading the Galois section of Dummit and Foote for a second perspective as you go.",
    "A rigorous introduction to Galois theory: treatment of extensions in C, as well as arbitrary field extensions, separability and normality (which often isn't addressed in an introductory field theory course), solubility by radicals, and loads of other cool things. A challenging course but worth it if you're willing to work.",
    "This is a great class. Highly recommended as a continuation of MATH 350.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. The material is really interesting and Miki is a great professor. If you're at all interested in algebra this will be a great class.",
    "Material- Great fun extension of group theory. Must take after 350. Lots of fun applications and problems that beautifully abstract algebra and polynomial theory together. Grades- Miki is a tough grader. I found her exam grading exceptionally difficult and ended up taking the course CR\/D\/Fail even though I am a math major, because I did not need any more algebra. I think the main problem is that she did not give enough practice material for exams (which she will hopefully improve upon). Professor- Amazing, number one lecturer at Yale. He name next to a class is an automatic take for me. Clear lecturing, great examples, great motivation, great office hours. All around the best.",
    "Pros: - Develop good intuition about Galois theory and related materials; - Challenging but fun class if you like Algebra - Class is well-organized - It's a hard class. Cons: - Harsh grading (e.g. partial credit is very low, either you get the whole thing or you're deducted heavily for small mistakes, so pay attention to details) - Again, it's a hard class.",
    "Standard course in Galois theory after abstract algebra. Starts with talking a field extensions, normality, separability. Then moves into the Galois correspondence, finite fields, radical extensions, normal closures, algebraic closures, and other cool stuff you can do with Galois theory.",
    "Fascinating and beautiful area of mathematics. If you liked Abstract you'll love this, but if you didn't you'll probably love it too. Miki is wonderful and super clear.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing - great job, Miki! Lectures were very clear, problem sets fit in very well with the material, and Miki's jokes were amazing. I feel I have a very solid understanding of the material right now. Not only is the class very well taught, but the material is also exceptionally beautiful (finite fields and cyclotomic extensions are soooo nice, you will not know the true beauty of life if you don't learn about them). Finally, the class helps solidify the knowledge acquired in Math 350.",
    "This is a cool course. Relative to 350 for example, it is less abstract and far-reaching, instead examines fields in significant detail. It has a high but reasonable workload. As long as you start ahead of time, you should be good. The tests can be quite hard, often harder than the pset problems, so bear that in mind when preparing for them. Miki is clearly a good teacher, but I don't find that she lives up to her hype.",
    "This is an amazing class, especially if Miki is teaching it. Galois theory is super helpful if you are a math major, and if you like Abstract Algebra, you will probably find it very interesting. Most of the proofs on our homework required clever thinking, rather than being long and tedious. I loved this class and Miki is one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. I would definitely recommend taking it.",
    "This class was a challenging, but very interesting exploration of Galois theory. I would recommend this class to anyone pursuing higher degree mathematics who is looking for a more difficult, but engaging class."
