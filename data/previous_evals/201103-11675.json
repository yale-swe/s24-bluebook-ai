    "I wouldnt say that you learn anything in this class. There is no real readings and no real technical training (a few sessions at the start) but a good brainstorming workshop for your documentary. Make sure you are motivated enough to make this happen. If you are someone who needs deadlines this course will not be good.",
    "I would recommend this class, not only because it is such a great creative outlet for people with unique ideas, but it also is a great opportunity to learn about other people's great ideas."
