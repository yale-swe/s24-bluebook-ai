    "You will cover the liar's paradox (and similar issues) in depth for a very long time. If you think that will be uninteresting, this is not for you. If you think it could be of interest, you will probably be engaged most of the way through the course. If you continue to be engaged, it'll be because the resolutions provided are even more interesting than the underlying problems. The readings are quite technical, but they are broken down well in the class meetings.",
    "The course is a careful and rigorous survey of responses to the Liar's Paradox: 'this sentence is false.' Know that the class is run as a lecture and that the emphasis is on understanding the formal apparatus that each philosopher has to offer; one may explore in the papers the broader implications of each theory for metaphysics or the philosophy of language, but we did not do that much during class. More comparison among the various response would have been nice, but Bruno's clear and incisive commentary on each reading gave us more than enough to chew on each week. Take this class only if you think you would be satisfied with its narrow focus on formalism and its modest approach to the philosophical implications of each philosopher's work. (Also, though the class is called Propositions, Truth, and Paradox, the discussion of propositions is scant)",
    "Beware that most of the readings are very technical, and the seminars are mostly Bruno lecturing, also with a heavy emphasis on the technical side. You can scan through the readings from the syllabus to get a sense of what the class would be like. Requires less work than your average philosophy class."
