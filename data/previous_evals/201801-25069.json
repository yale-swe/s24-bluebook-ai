   "comments": [
    "Professor Lockhart is a pioneer in what she does and an inspiration to everyone who wants to work in the context of conflict and reconstruction. I gained a lot from her as a person and studying how she interacts with others.",
    "I learned a lot about conducting social science research. I enjoyed hearing the speakers' perspectives, but I learned the most through our group project. As an undergrad, this was a great opportunity to learn from and work with graduate students, developing my own research skills.",
    "How to work with a client on a real issue, learned lots about different topics from experts who came to speak from our class",
    "We learned about a mumber of case studies from experts in the field who were present at the time and in the place of an importsnt reform or reconstruction process, including rebuilding bureaucracy in Afghanistan, community directed developmentt in Haiti, security force assistance in Georgia, and disaster response in Nepal and New Orleans.",
    "I learned so much about the challenges and potential solutions and approaches to international development. I think the course was especially effective at driving home the message that it's important to engage and prioritize local priorities and to learn to cooperate and navigate partnerships with different stakeholders who may be of help, even if not necessarily on the same ideological page.",
    "The course was a great opportunity to hear from practitioners and test our assumptions about reform and reconstruction challenges against their experience. Working on a client project was also very helpful - not only in terms of understanding and addressing their needs, but also in terms of managing progress under significant ambiguity.",
    "I learned a lot about working on consulting projects and with other people."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material is fantastic- I wish we would have engaged the book more! This would have made the course feel more structured, especially as we had much chaos in the student clients.",
    "The greatest strength to me was being able to create a research product for an outside client. I learned a lot about methods from the other members of my group, as well as from Clare's recommendations throughout the semester. Personally, the biggest weakness was that some of the speakers worked in highly specialized areas, which meant that most of their presentation was over my head. It probably would have been helpful to take GLBL 771 beforehand to build my overall knowledge.",
    "Connect with clients sooner",
    "The projects should be confirmed and concrete before class begins. While this gives students less control, it ensures they can hit the ground running. More theory and readings could be integrated. And more assingments could be assigned, such as a literature review that ensures all group are reading the important sources in their field.",
    "This course offered several unique and valuable perspectives from practitioners in various fields related to rebuilding\/reforming weak states. The practical consulting engagement was also a useful exercise. However, the practicum component could benefit from more advance planning (e.g., lining up clients and solidifying expected deliverables prior to the beginning of the course). Perhaps fewer options and larger groups (2 or 3 projects) could allow for more in-depth experiences.",
    "The course in theory is an excellent idea, however, additional planning during the fall semester is necessary for all projects to be carried out according to plan with an engaged counterpart. There was very poor time management during class sessions, which didn't allow groups to discuss projects in class often or consult with Clare.",
    "Perhaps narrowing the projects a bit more, having a smaller class. Or choosing one project for the whole class to debate and continuously advance on throughout the semester. The lectures and topics were very interesting. And I think the messages would be further clarified and translated into practice if the topics could be applied to the single class project at hand during class as well.",
    "The course had a great roster of guest lecturers, a manageable reading load, and very practical hands-on projects. These were its core strengths. The only thing I would improve is to create more of a through-line among the cases in order to reinforce the arc of learning in a slightly more structured way.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, though I do think there are some changes that would bring it to the next level. Primarily, I think that there should only be one project for the entire class. Despite the fact that everyones projects were extremely interesting, I know that some of them did not get off the ground until late in the game and some had clients who were MIA. It would be much easier to find one enthusiastic client than it is to find four or five. In addition to that, whether there is one client or more than one, there is always the worry that he or she will go MIA. I think the solution to this is to confirm the client well in advance, obtain several points of contact, and perhaps even write up a contract obligating the client to certain duties (e.g. attending three classes, a bi-weekly call, etc.) As this is a consulting class, the client is the most important aspect, and he or she should be locked in prior to the start of the class. On this same theme, I think the readings and guest lecturers were extremely interesting, but they often had little or nothing to do with my project. I would much prefer to have readings and lectures on my topic, which I could put to use in my work. A single, class-wide project would solve this issue. If an on-topic guest lecturer cannot be found I would prefer to be given time for group work in class."

    "Yes! The course is designed to let you work on a real problem with a high-level client and receive great feedback from the instructor.",
    "Absolutely! Every student interested in solving the challenges governments are faced with should take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student; however, I would provide the caveat that actual progress in the practicum component may be slow in coming, as a lot of time may be needed to solidify client connections and expectations.",
    "No. Overall an excellent idea, but it will require additional resources, perhaps additional TAs, and additional planning to be a worthy investment of students' time.",
    "ABSOLUTELY, especially if you want hands-on\/practical experience or knowledge.",
    "Yes - it's a great opportunity to apply theories in practice.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as long as the client was locked in and there was little to no chance that he or she would be MIA."
