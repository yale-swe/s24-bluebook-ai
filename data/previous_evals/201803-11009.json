    "ENGL 992 gave me a vocabulary and resources with which to teach my first writing course. The insights from more experienced instructors were crucial. I had not considered how to check for understanding and use small-group exercises in the context of teaching writing. I am now much more equipped to do so."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the pace of the small-group faculty meetings and the occasional full-faculty meeting. I appreciate how the course is responding to feedback. I think there should be a 114-wide textbook for the undergrad students. Problem\/claim\/evidence\/motive\/warrant is fine for the first couple weeks, but a unifying resource for teaching style and grace would be helpful. I hopped around between a few texts, and I wish I had made the students buy one book so that they could get the benefits of sustained engagement."
