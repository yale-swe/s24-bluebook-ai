    "This class is pretty effective in giving students a good understanding of basic grammar and vocab. I'd say that I can speak enough Spanish to be understood on the topics I've learned.",
    "How to read, write and speak in spanish.",
    "I had virtually no Spanish experience before taking this course. Now, I have a generally good understanding of the basics of how the language works and can read, write, listen, and speak at beginner levels.",
    "A good way to learn the basics of Spanish.",
    "You will cover a lot of material in this course, learning a large amount of vocabulary and grammar. However, so much was covered so quickly that it might be hard to retain it all, especially if you have never taken Spanish before.",
    "I learned the basics to speaking, writing, and reading in Spanish",
    "I learned who to speak, read, and write basic Spanish.",
    "I increased my understanding for vernacular of the language as well as ways to speak more fluently."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very frustrating for those who have not taken any Spanish previous to enrolling. A good amount (probably majority) of the students in the class have taken multiple years of Spanish, which makes it very difficult for a professor to gage how much students are learning and makes the course a lot harder for those who don't have previous experience. If I had known how difficult this class would be I would not have taken it. Prepare to put in a lot of work for generally little reward.",
    "Some strengths are the way the material is taught and the exercise we have for homework.",
    "The course is very immersive. Almost from the beginning, the professor was speaking pretty much exclusively in Spanish. This is definitely a strength of the class, as it gets you thinking on your feet in Spanish from day one. There's really nothing I was expecting from an introductory level course that this class did not provide. I'm very satisfied, and can't think of any major points of improvement.",
    "A problem with this course is that many students come in knowing varying levels of Spanish. Without knowing any Spanish prior, it was hard to keep up in class as students who had taken years of classes before were answering questions quickly and were involved.",
    "The instructors for this course know what they are doing, and the textbook is pretty well organized, but you can't rely on the teachers to take a special interest in you if you are struggling, and if you want to do well in this course without having taken Spanish before, you can't rely on just studying the textbook. The in class participation was a major weakness in this course as it was here that you saw the greatest difference between those who already took Spanish and those just learning for the first time. Having sections broken up even more based off of experience would greatly improve this course.",
    "Strengths were excellent teaching. Weakness was the class could have developed more basic grammar and prepositions before assigning writing assignments.",
    "There was a lot of methods of practicing the language from written, reading to spoken."

   "comments": [
    "If you have taken Spanish before, yes. If you are very skilled at languages already or have taken one similar to Spanish, yes. If you are averagely good with languages with no prior experience with Spanish prepare to spend a lot of time on this class for a less than mediocre grade.",
    "I would recommend. It's a fun way to learn Spanish and make new friends.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you're looking for a basic introduction to the Spanish language. It covers all the basics in reading, writing, speaking, listening, grammar, and vocabulary.",
    "No. Helpful to learn Spanish, but hard to keep up with kids who have already learned some amount of Spanish prior.",
    "If you have taken Spanish in high school, this course should be just right for you. If you have never taken Spanish, I would not recommend this course. Even though it is technically an introductory course, it is not taught at an introductory pace.",
    "I would recommend this course if students are interested in a language class that is a good deal of work, but not overwhelmingly difficult conceptually.",
    "For someone looking to begin their education of the language I would recommend this course."
