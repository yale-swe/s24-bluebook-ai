    "I would recommend it. It is a fairly easy, fun course. Take it with Yovanna if you have the chance, because she makes class enjoyable and entertaining. Though 5 days\/week is not anyone's favorite thing, she makes it as bearable as it can be.",
    "I recommend Spanish 120. The workload is definitely manageable. Students should be aware that class is often used solely for discussions and that important concepts will need to be learned outside of class. This class requires a couple of group projects outside of class and lots of group assignments inside of class. If this is your first time taking a language at Yale, shop the level you are placed into and 1 level below because the placement tests are not always the best indicators of proficiency.",
    "I recommend it because it teaches you a lot and the work is kept bearable by the fun activities.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 120 highly.",
    "Good Spanish teacher for L2",
    "Professor Cifuentes cooks up a mean section. She provided apt explanations without making it too f\u00e1cil.",
    "Good course; if you haven't done Spanish in a while and are placed, brush up on a few things (vocab, verbs) before going in."
