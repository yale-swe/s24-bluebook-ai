    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Matthew put so much effort into the discussions. His enthusiasm was infectious. He found creative ways for us to discuss the topics for the week. Matthew was a pleasure to have as a Teaching Fellow.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0I thought Matt kept sections engaging with unique discussion prompts. I found his style helpful and thought provoking. Great job!",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Fr Matthew is terrific! There were a couple of moments (particularly around written assignments) where he and Dean McGowan did not appear to be on the same page. Generally, though, he was excellent at facilitating group discussion in section, was well-prepared and asked stimulating and provocative questions. His expectations for outside work and participation were high but reasonable.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Knowledgeable, approachable, engaging, a good teacher.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0It is a privilege to have had Matthew Larsen as a Teaching Fellow. Not only did he deliver an outstanding lecture to the larger class on an occasion when Prof. McGowan needed to be out of town, but he created, week by week, a rich and lively environment for section discussion. Matt also prepared for section every week, so that the time functioned as an additional source of learning as well as an opportunity to review and consolidate the material presented in the readings and lecture.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Good at facilitating conversation in section. His lecture was excellent.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Matthew Larsen is one of the best teaching fellows I have had. He is interesting and very knowledgeable, and it was great to have that forum for discussion.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Matthew is a very bright and engaging instructor. My personal feeling towards section is that in an attempt to engage the students in discussion, his own voice was lost. I would have appreciated hearing his take on things more, and fewer exercises.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0He did a good job of presenting a variety of things in section, but sometimes it was difficult to foster discussion. I found the interactive things we did - such as the lectionary debate - to be the best sections.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Each section meeting involved a new way to approach the material. Matthew was a creative teacher, always well prepared, engaging and a good facilitator of class discussion.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Matt is terrific, and he really engaged with specific and titillating questions in which he clearly had great personal investment\/interest. The small sections did seem to substantively have to be invented or discovered every week by him, and bore little clear connection to the substance of the weekly lectures, but I looked forward to them because he engaged us in really thinking about our own beliefs.",
    "Instructor: Matthew David Larsen \u00a0Mr. Larsen was an excellent lecturer. He consistently spoke with relevance, interest, and knowledge that reflected a deep scholarly engagement. His presentation of the material situated the historical subject in an integrative and intersectional context. I learned a lot from Mr.Larsen and would take any class he taught."
