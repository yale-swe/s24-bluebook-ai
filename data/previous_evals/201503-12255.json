   "comments": [
    "Yes, but I think it's helpful for everyone if you have a pretty good idea of what you already know and can contribute confidently from your base of knowledge.",
    "You should take this class because whatever other classes you're shopping, this one is better. The readings are engaging and you might find yourselves prioritizing them over other assignments, or reading them much more thoroughly than is actually needed for the class. The discussions are even better. You should take this class regardless of what you're majoring in, but especially if you're not majoring in history.",
    "This class moves very fast through the entire stretch of human history and then some, every week, through the eyes of different \"grand narratives\". Some of them are easy to make fun of and very well known, some of them will be by writers you've never heard of expounding theories that are completely new to you. Either way it's great fun. Very few classes make you think about the craft of history quite so much - the skill in putting together and telling a story as well as just the facts. It's really interesting to see a lot of bestsellers and a lot of good history books side by side (and sometimes overlapping) and see the patterns not just in the history itself, but in how the writing works. Great discussions, and the assignments are short and very approachable. I think some of the class was confused what was expected in the final paper because it's quite a broad assignment but Professor Drixler is always more than happy to provide guidance and help. Great class taught by a very smart guy. Long readings but they go very quickly in most cases, especially the popular writing.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to students interested in thinking about history from a much broader perspective than most courses here allow. The class provides an enjoyable, thought-provoking framework for reading those popular histories you have probably been meaning to get to for a while.",
    "I would recommend narratives for those interested in human topics that sweep all of history. We read a different book each week, most of which were bestsellers and fun to read. The level of the class largely depends on the other students in the seminar.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. If you're looking to read some of the great works of contemporary historians or are interested in topics like the origins of wealth divides between nations, the development of political systems, and geographic determinism, this is the class to take.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. At times, the discussions were a little bit slow moving, but Professor Drixler is brilliant and his insights alone make the class worthwhile.",
    "Absolutely recommend. The course takes a unique approach to examining history and how it is written, and is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Just be careful about the composition of the class -- we had an imbalance of people who talked a lot and who were basically silent. Professor Drixler did a great job of pushing everyone -- but the conversation can sometimes lag or be awkward when the talkative ones are silenced and the others aren't quite stepping up. Also because of the nature of the topics -- which are often very abstract and theoretical -- it's easy for the conversation to go in loops, or to be a bit aimless at times. Just be aware of your peers and try to make the most of it.",
    "Grand Narratives is a fun course taught by a great professor. The course helps students think on much larger scales than most history courses and encourages students of many different academic backgrounds to consider overarching themes. The course also provides great context for many students' views on history. The course encourages criticism and critical thinking about how different authors' views intersect, agree, and clash with one another.",
    "Be prepared the have a lot of reading to do and to think very deeply during discussions. You'll learn a lot about reading and critiquing in this class, and it will leave you with an interesting new perspective with which to observe history."
