    "The class is really all about the internships at the UN. The weekly seminars are a blur - there is virtually no reading material and sometimes the professor randomly asks you to prepare a presentation on up and coming international diplomacy topics, however, it seems like there is very little rhyme or reason to this process. There is no set syllabus that is actually followed and it is sort of a fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants process. Definitely a course for those that can tolerate disorganization, or at least close their eyes to it from time to time.",
    "This class exposed me to issues related to climate change; it made me dig deeper to learn about them; it exposed me to international negotiations on similar matters as well as matters pertaining to development that are very crucial to me given my background and interests."

    "meeting with ambassadors at the UN. giving presentations at the UN. what a great opportunity!",
    "The UN internship is an invaluable experience. Presenting to UN ambassadors and conducting other tasks for UN missions throughout the semester were also great experiences."

    "The weekly seminars. The three hours of class time were an extreme MISSED OPPORTUNITY - there could be much more structure given to the class to lend it a more credible atmosphere. Lessons should be planned out in advance and the course should be given a natural progression. The TA was incredibly capable and this was something even she could have done to make the 3 hour seminars seem less like a damper on everyone's time.",
    "Plan earlier on what we plan to influence and prepare early on for the presentation to the UN Ambassadors;",
    "Foundational readings or lectures on typical diplomatic procedures or tricks.",
    "better time.",
    "Many readings and assignments were assigned very casually and then were never completed or followed up on. Many assignments were also given at the last minute. Better enforcement of this could be done by the TA or Professor."

This course enabled me to participate in such discussions (water, law of the sea) at the UN.The course made me dig for information in areas I would otherwise not have looked at e.g. climate change induced migration, where it is likely to occur or is occurring, and the consequences etc."
