   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is more of a theology class than a history class, if that floats your boat - I quite enjoyed it.",
    "if youre interesting in theology then yes. just interested in history then probably not.",
    "This is a course in the intellectual history of Europe in the Reformation era. It's amazing and you should take it. All of you.",
    "Absolutely take this class. I am a science major, and it was my favorite class this term. Going to lectures is like a combination of watching a great documentary, and hearing gossip from a friend. Prof. Eire knows the most interesting, entertaining, and comprehensible ways to explain a rather complex period of history. You get to read some of the great texts that inspired Protestantism, and understand influences in modern culture. There isn't a ton of work - a lot of reading, but just one small paper. Highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Definitely take this course. The material is fascinating, and the professor is great!",
    "Absolutely. The Reformation has been so incredibly influential in the history of western civilization and Professor Eire is a great lecturer.",
    "Very good history lecture!!! It offers you a new perspective in understanding history in general - since understanding the reformation is crucial to understanding anything after that. Lecture is amazing and fun, and the requirements are easy to fulfill!! Take it especially if you're looking for a relaxing history lecture.",
    "Yes! Take the course if you're looking for a good history class. The material was really interesting and presented a side of history that I had otherwise never studied.",
    "Yes. It is a really solid and not terribly difficult history lecture.",
    "It's okay. Not great. I'd recommend it because it is an interesting and important time period in history and because I love Carlos Eire, but the class in general was not particularly enlightening, and the exams sucked, because it was so much writing in so little time that there was no way to go into the detail that they seemed to require in order to do well. Overall, not great.",
    "Pretty easy workload for a history class (1 5-page paper, 1 midterm, and a final). A lot of reading though. This class is very theological, so if you're looking for just a sociopolitical viewpoint on the Reformation maybe take Early Modern instead. A lot of primary sources that would probably be really boring if you aren't into religion at all. Basically, it's a really fantastic class if you're at all interested in the theology behind the Reformation, but if you aren't I think you might get bored (and you kinda do have to do all the reading, so that would suck).",
    "This class was great. If you have any interest in any sort of history, you should take this course. It gives you a great overview of the Reformation and the underlying theological concepts behind it. Professor Eire is the best.",
    "The primary texts in this course are wonderful. No other time at Yale can you read these! Take it!",
    "One of the best classes I took at Yale, and I took it Credit\/D too. Very manageable; I never did the reading from the textbook, only the primary sources, and I did pretty well without having to do an insane amount of work.It really helps if you're a confirmed Catholic\/Lutheran\/etc. with a bunch of background knowledge to fall back on if you don't want to do 100% of the reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student at Yale University, particularly one with at least some interested in religion and the history of ideas. Carlos Eire is an incredible lecturer who takes you through roughly two hundred years of European religious thought. The readings are absolutely fantastic -- very primary-source heavy. Make no mistake: Eire approaches this subject matter from the history-of-ideas perspective rather than focusing on, say, social or economic history. But as a history of religious thought course, this is a wonderful, wonderful class.",
    "Take it. really important time period to know, and a great professor to teach it. Go meet prof. Eire at office hours, and talk with him about the theology -- that's when he really comes alive, and you begin to understand why he does what he does.",
    "A chronological journey through the history of Reformation Europe with a focus on the magisterial, radical and catholic reformations. The magisterial takes precedence in terms of focus.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student - one of the best and most interesting history classes I've taken so far. As a History major, I knew absolutely nothing about Christian theology going into the class - don't let that stop you from taking it. Professor Eire is truly amazing and the readings are really interesting. Eire does a great job of putting the theology into a larger socio-political framework that makes theology a lot more accessible to those of us who aren't as inclined towards it.",
    "I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in history, not simply religious studies.",
    "Painless pre-Industrial. Would definitely recommend to someone who at the least bit interested in theology.",
    "It is a fantastic class that I would recommend to both history and no history majors. Professor Eire is engaging during lectures and understanding to the needs of the students.",
    "Take this class if you care at all about understanding Western society. Seriously. Having a solid understanding of the way that religious conflict influenced the West's development is CRUCIAL.There's a bit of reading, but most of it is interesting. Eire's lectures are AMAZING and really bring the material to life. Seriously, just take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student.",
    "It is what it says it is. A lot of people have raved about Eire's lecture style--it's slow, deliberate, and more or less extemporaneous--but I wasn't thrilled by it. The sections were useless, but I did learn a decent amount about the reformation. I worry, however, that I learned it in a way that makes it easy to forget.",
    "I would recommend Ref Europe to anyone interested in history of religions\/history of doctrine, intellectual history, or history of the early modern period. This is a great class in itself and even better background for more work in any of these fields. I'm a RLST major and am glad to have taken this course early on - both for the history of religions content and for the theology. On that note, I would warn people without an interest or background in RLST that this class may occasionally be hard going: there's a lot of reading and a lot of it is theological. History majors, you may want to look elsewhere for a pre-industrial credit. Current DSers, this class is a great complement to second semester DS (which basically skips the Reformation).",
    "Interesting course about wide ranging aspects of the Reformation. Lots of reading, but it is, for the most part, very interesting. Test questions can be very specific do be careful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking it to get a sense of European history and religious history."
