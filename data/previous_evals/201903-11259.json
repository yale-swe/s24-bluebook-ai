    "I learned a lot about linear algebra and multivariable calculus.",

    "Learned about differential equations and linear algebra.",
    "I learned important concepts in linear algebra and multivariable calculus.",

    "Good crash course in linear algebra and multivariable calculus, very explicitly geared towards people intending to major in economics.",
    "Applicational knowledge of linear algebra and multi variable calculus. Nothing too in depth, but sufficient and useful for an economics education.",

   "comments": [
    "This course was great in that it provided me with a good understanding of key linear algebra and multivariable calculus concepts in one semester. I ended the semester feeling that I learned a lot and am very happy this course exists.",
    "This class has a limited scope - most topics are covered at a surface level. The instruction is good though.",
    "Taught very well!",
    "Course provides information that is very valuable for students taking intermediate microeconomics. Additionally helps create sting foundation for learning more multi variable calc and linear algebra.",
    "Awesome professor. If you have the opportunity to take this class with Pam, do yourself a favor and take the class.",
    "The strength was that Pam is a super knowledgeable teacher that explains concepts extremely clearly.",
    "Pam was a good instructor, providing very helpful worksheets and explanations in class. Her office hours were very helpful and that class was structured logically. The subject matter itself could not be as riveting, however.",
    "The strength of the course is that it does exactly what it claims to do - provide an education in linear algebra and multi variable calculus geared towards social sciences majors. In class teaching was straightforward and easy to understand, and the homework psets were very useful in further teaching the material. I do feel that the course could benefit from including some integral multivariable calculus, but I understand that would require changing the prerequisites.",
    "Strengths: Pam is the best lecturer! Very helpful, office hours every day to help her students learn the material. Information taught is not too challenging."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student looking to gain an understanding of linear algebra and multivariable calculus without taking the Math 120 + 222\/225 route. This class was super organized and the PSETs were very effective.",
    "yea",
    "I would not recommend this course - any relevant mathematical content for economics or stats classes can easily be learned on one's own outside of this class. Most material in this class is neither useful nor interesting. However, the class is well-taught (compared to other Yale math classes), so it's a relatively painless, easy experience despite its being a waste of time. Honestly, this class reminded me a of high school math class more than anything else.",
    "I would recommend only if you have a strong math background or already know some multivariable calc or linear algebra from before.",
    "Yes! All Econ majors without a background in math beyond calc 1 should take this class before intermediate micro.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning both linear algebra and multivariable calculus.",
    "Yes",
    "Only if you are intending to pursue quantitative social sciences; this class is two broad of a survey for those intending to pursue actual math-intensive fields.",
    "Depends on their intended field of study and post-graduate career.",
    "Definitely! Pam is an amazing instructor, and I would take this class again if I had the chance. Take this class if you're planning on majoring in Economics."
