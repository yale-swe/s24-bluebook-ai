   "comments": [
    "The course was great for developing critical discussion and debate skills, and also attaining a general idea of the concepts of global development.",
    "I gained knowledge and insights into the history and theories of global development, particularly in the West. This course gave me the opportunity to read a little of authors I have heard about before but have not read directly - Alexander Hamilton, Adam Smith, Gandhi, Marx - and put those authors and many others into context.",
    "This course provided a strong foundation in some of the main thinkers and development theories from a Western perspective. It provided a good starting place for becoming conversant in the current discourse on development and some current trends (neoliberalism, populism, etc.).",
    "I improved my ability to lead discussions and learned how to examine the history of ideas. I believe this also provided me with a framework with which I can connect many political or development theories"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The syllabus for this course is excellent - particularly with the addition of a week on sustainability. I enjoyed the readings, the lectures and the class discussions. Greater clarity about the format of the class discussions would have been helpful but they were still useful.",
    "The readings were really interesting, reasonable amounts, and provided a good mix of ideas to spark class discussion. I liked that we went chronologically and thematically, though our class discussions were strongest when the instructor highlighted\/repeated a framework and some key themes\/points to take away from the class (e.g., our class on development in the 1970's and NIEO). When this didn't happen, sometimes the takeaways were not entirely clear from our discussions alone. Sometimes class participation could be facilitated better in order to ensure that students are responding to the questions posed, to each other, or holding a more cohesive discussion that included all the students. As was raised during the course, the readings should be revised to include more texts by women. The in class presentation was a great idea and helpful in pushing us to synthesize what we read. One consideration for the future may be to have a mid-term assignment (e.g,. shorter paper or reading response) to encourage this level of engagement at more points throughout the term.",
    "I enjoyed the class, particularly Professor Steinmetz Jenkins' intros at the beginning of class. Sometimes I wish we spent longer on the deeper, more complex parts of the readings rather than staying on the big picture. I was a big fan of the Professor's flexibility, particularly with letting students alter the readings for the discussions they're leading."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in global development. It serves as a good survey of the ideas that have influence development thinking throughout history.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student - it is very useful to have an understanding of how ideas about development have changed over time. While development is usually now associated with developing countries, the same ideas apply and have applied to countries that are now \"developed\". This course therefore also traces the history of how the West conceptualises itself.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The emphasis of the class is on the history of ideas. The class is sometimes connected to current thinking and events, but it is not taught from a practical or applied perspective, so would not be appropriate for someone looking to approach development thinking from a practitioner's lens.",
    "I would if they were interested in understanding intellectual history- but it's also contingent on the other students in the class and whether you want to spend much of class grappling with these ideas with them."
