   "comments": [
    "I loved how informal this course was. Many of my courses at Yale so far have involved a lot of \"busy work\", with assignments due constantly and inflexible deadlines. Brian made the course very casual and this allowed me a great chance to dive into material that most interested me. Although I loved this course, it might be improved by adding a bit more linearity to the lecture topics. I felt a little like each week's lecture was disjointed from the previous ones.",
    "I think this is an invaluable course to YSPH since it is the only vector biology course offered. I think the strengths are that we had a lot of experts in the field come talk about a diverse range of vectors, that the course challenges you (through discussion and assignments) to think like a researcher, and that it's a small group with really great discussion. I thought the weaknesses were that the summaries of the papers every week felt like busy work - we never received feedback on them. I think just providing the papers to read is enough (but I do think it's important to provide the primary lit papers). I think it would have been helpful to have a few lectures before the guest lectures on some more foundational material before we jumped into very technical lectures. For example, a lecture on the physiology of different insect systems. Or a very broad lecture looking at the breath of insect borne diseases, their epidemiology, and their global impact, and various control methods. I also thought it would make more sense for Doug's lecture on hematophagy and digestion to be at the beginning.",
    "I took this class because it was only offered every other year. Really great guest lecturers on really interesting topics, I feel like I know much more about vector-borne diseases and vector biology than my other EMD peers. I liked the format of the class and how it forced me to read scientific literature. I did not like how the due date of the take home midterm was not on the syllabus. I thought that the midterm was pretty difficult \/ graded pretty rigorously for a seminar-structured class. I liked the idea of the hypothetical grant proposal. Perhaps some in-class working sessions for more guidance would have been helpful. ALSO - I almost forgot - I LOVED the tsetse fly dissections and museum visit. Keep that up!",
    "EMD682 was my favorite class that I've ever taken. I distinctly remember seeing it on a mock syllabus before coming to Yale, and it was one of the things that drew me here. It turned out to be the highlight of my week; stepping into the classroom helped ease all my external concerns. It was a fun, exciting, and comfortable learning environment. The invited faculty were engaging, their material verged on fascinating, and the small class size helped promote easy discussion and valuable one-on-one interactions. The seminar series format, albeit a strength in many ways, did not promote continuity between course sessions or topics. In writing the April \"midterm\", I found that everything came together in surprising ways, and the questions on the exam helped me realize that. At the risk of asking for more work, I think a few short assignments throughout the course would help promote this kind of thought continuity. The course self-selected \"bug people\" that shared common interests, which fostered a nice sense of community and solidarity. Some people might be grossed out by passing around engorged ticks during class, but this class thought it was awesome. Because of both the students and (invited) faculty, this course inspired awe and excitement in its participants, and I felt it was an amazing experience."

    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Dr. Weiss was a fantastic instructor! I enjoyed the casual tone he set for the class, and how much he encouraged us to explore topics that interested us. He was very open to questions both in and out of the classroom, and he seemed to really enjoy teaching. Every time I had a question for him he took it very seriously, and his email responses would include several attached articles to back up his answers or to provoke further investigation.",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Brian is great! He goes above and beyond for this course. He offers himself available outside of class, and even is willing to provide extra insectary training to those of us interested in gaining more experience. He was always contacting us about the following week and what to expect, and he provided constant feedback about our research ideas. He's a really great professor - his lecture, Geoff's, and Dr. Valenzuela from the NIH were my favorite talks! They were superb!",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0SUPER nice professor, VERY helpful , always open to suggestions. Brian is very relaxed and approachable. He is overall just great.",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Almost literally, Brian brought sunshine into that basement classroom. He was helpful and welcoming, and a great source of mentorship throughout the course. He also made every effort to make class fun, incorporating insect dissections and museum field trips into the syllabus. Logistically speaking, Brian would very timely answer questions and respond to our assignments with constructive feedback. He also went above and beyond this call of duty, reaching out to us with ideas about our class projects when he was away at conferences, and emailing us relevant papers. Like Serap, he also valued regular feedback from the students about the course and the faculty he had invited, and would alter things accordingly. Finally, Brian was flexible (with deadlines) and available (with questions) and supportive, and made an effort to get to know students' lives and interests.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Dr. Aksoy was rarely in the classroom with us, so it's difficult to say what her strengths and weaknesses were.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Dr. Aksoy was not very present in the course, except for a few lectures, and she was absent from almost all of the discussion sections. I did not feel she was particularly engaged with the course, and I was not sure of her role (?) since Dr. Weiss appeared to be the primary instructor. The only time I received feedback from her was when she graded half of the exam, and I did not understand her expectations since she was never around.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Great professor! Very busy but very nice and intelligent and supportive",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Dr. Aksoy was a thoughtful and caring professor. She helped encourage class discussion by engaging\/helping us engage with the speakers, and she would regularly ask class members how we were doing\/how our projects were coming along\/if we had any suggestions for areas of improvement for the class. However, she was not the primary instructor, so we didn't interact much outside of the weekly speaker sessions."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "This is a great course for someone interested in disease biology and\/or vectors! I learned more about vector biology, laboratory techniques, issues in vector-borne diseases and upcoming solutions. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, even if it is outside of your area of interest a little bit. I think the course teaches you to ask experimental questions and think like a PI. It is also useful in teaching you how to read and present on challenging literature. I just wished it were offer every year since the MPH program is only a two year program! Anyone in infectious disease epidemiology should be somewhat familiar with insect vectors and their respective pathogens, especially at an institution that has been instrumental in this research area, but I also think this course has a lot of overlap with other departments or schools such as the school of forestry. Could it be cross registered? Plus having students from other schools really makes the discussion more rich and diverse.",
    "Great course if you are interested in the vector biology aspect of infectious diseases. Professors are both really chill and its usually a small group. I would recommend it.",
    "This is a course that covers the biology of insect disease vectors and its epidemiological implications. It is formatted like a seminar series combined with a journal club, so students have an opportunity to learn from distinguished experts each week and then discuss relevant research in a smaller setting. Each week covers a new topic, from blood feeding\/digestion to climate change, insect immunity to the microbiome. The course also provides some hands-on research experience. In terms of workload, it's on the lesser side, with reading summaries each week, a presentation, and a midterm\/final project. It's a great introduction to public health entomology and the breadth of its research areas. I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Some of us have heard that YSPH is considering cancelling the course due to limited enrollment, but I implore the school to keep it around, as nothing else like it exists within YSPH. Vectors are a critical piece of infectious disease epidemiology, and for students who have any interest in it, this course is a source of knowledge and wonder."
