   "comments": [
    "This is a difficult, but worthwhile course. It does a good job introducing topics that are difficult, but essential to the field. Highly recommended.",
    "This is an extremely time intensive and difficult class on the basics of molecular biophysics and biochemistry as well as a few techniques such as mass spec, NMR and x-ray crystallography.I would ONLY recommend to students in this program or will use for their research that are extremely motivated or are willing to take the class as an audit.",
    "The course covers macromolecular structure, and experimental methods for determining structure. The first part is absolutely indispensable for anyone working with macromolecules; the second is less relevant for those not planning to do structure determination experiments.Perhaps someone interested only in molecular biology would be best served by auditing the first part of the course and skipping the 2nd half.",
    "It provide a broad topic in structure biology, you can always find an interesting field for your future research. It is required.",
    "Good introduction to numerous topics in structural biology, including both current knowledge and methods. Difficult course but well worth it. Definitely recommend to anyone seriously interested in structural biology.",
    "I would recommend the course only if one is wanting to going into biophysical research.",
    "yes i would recommend this course, it was a lot of work but if the subject matter is interesting to the student they will learn a lot",
    "A rigorous course in the structure of macromolecules that includes an in depth discussion of NMR and x-ray crystallography.",
    "Highly recommend to anyone potentially doing research in biophysics or biochemistry.",
    "yes, some reason as in question one"

   "comments": [
    "this course taught be about crystallography and NMR for the first time, allowing me to truly grasp the importance and many applications of both techniques. It also reviewed my knowledge of macromolecular structure and incorporated the latest in tertiary structure that is not typically covered in lower level courses.",
    "I learned ALOT about the subject, but it won't be very helpful for the research I want to do. It will be very helpful in understanding others research at seminars and when reading papers though!!",
    "It broaden my view in my discipline.",
    "It emphasized key concepts which will be tested in our orals. Also, the approached taught in the class will prove to be very helpful in our research endeavors.",
    "it taught me a great deal about macromolecular structures and the tools that are used to study them. I believe it will be very helpful",
    "The class will no doubt apply to my research at some point (already). Very current and applicable material.",
    "this course discuss many useful and practical biophysical techniques that are used widely, hence it is very helpful to my research"
