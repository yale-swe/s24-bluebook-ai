   "comments": [
    "120 essentially reviewed all the topics in single-variable calculus and converted them to multiple variables.",
    "Thorough survey in vector and multivariable calculus. Will definitely build one's ability to think critically and use analytical geometry to solve problems.",
    "Multivariable analog of single variable calculus. Unlike MATH 230 this is a strictly problem solving course and it achieves that purpose pretty well. Learnt to think algorithmically. The visualizations in 3D space were a little tricky initially but you get used to them and it becomes as natural as single variable calc.",
    "Math 120 does a good job of teaching multivariable calc.",
    "I learned how to look at a problem and really try to understand what was going on by drawing a picture out first. I became a better artist.",
    "I learned a lot about problem solving and advanced calculus.",
    "Advanced calculus.",
    "Obviously I learned multivariable calculus skills. I had never taken it before so they were all knew. Also as someone who plans to take many more STEM classes, I felt this class was very helpful for me learning how to study and use the textbook and practice problems effectively. I would have thought going into the course I already knew those skills but realized after the first midterm I did not; however, I was much more comfortable by the end of the course.",
    "Learned about Multicalc and 3D reasoning.",
    "Learned how to evaluate triple integrals in many ways, as well as how to calculate flux and test for conservative vector fields.",
    "I got a very thorough of multivariable calculus",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for calculus.",
    "3D graphing, -advanced integration, lots of imaginative math.",
    "how to do more derivatives and integrals"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course material was somewhat dry and the tests were difficult. At points, it seemed as though the instruction contradicted what was tested. Even so, the course was helpful and not too difficult.",
    "The course is well taught but sometimes exams were very difficult. It would be great if there were more practice available.",
    "Course is extremely difficult and unfair to individuals who haven't taken multivariable calculus before. Graders are very harsh (5 points off for a missing negative sign, etc.), curve is nonexistent, and exams are tough. Take the class in the spring if your maximum experience of math is AP Calculus BC. Otherwise, you'll have an awful semester trying to keep up with the students who have learned the material before.",
    "Strengths: 1. good problem solving course 2. a lot of support in the form of office hours, peer tutors, review sessions Weaknesses: 1. the psets depended a little bit too much on the textbook (whose answers are easy to look up). The textbook is organized in a manner that the concepts are quite isolated from one another so it became difficult for me to synthezise all techniques and approaches when time came for finals. I appreciated some of the extra questions (very challenging ones) that were added to some psets but these were few and far in between. I think the course woul benefit from more of such mixed approach questions that help students understand concepts better.",
    "The class accomplishes its goal of teaching multivariable calculus. It's not highly engaging, but that's okay. The only major weakness was that problem set graders seemed a bit too stingy.",
    "There needs to be a set way the teachers all teach so that it's not terrible if you get one teacher but not the \"best\" teacher.",
    "The textbook was not very useful. It did not show how to do problems similar to the majority of the problems that we were tested on.",
    "It's very very hard.",
    "This course would be more engaging if it were slightly less of a lecture and more class participation was involved, but the lecture format also enabled it to cover material quickly",
    "Good calc course, but moves fast and can easily cause people to fall behind if they start slacking.",
    "Strengths: it focuses a lot in one area; most of the material is closely related to each other. Weaknesses: class moves fairly quickly; could focus a little more on the theorems. If one thing isn't completely understood, the whole term could be messed up.",
    "This class was a very standard multivariable calculus course. I thought that it was good to have a small classroom setting rather than a large lecture. The material was at times not very engaging, but I think that is the nature of the course.",
    "The magnitude of the entire course is very very high. However it is fun and has lots of great concepts to learn",
    "Honestly my grad student was a poor teacher and the class was incredibly boring. More engaging professors\/ material presented in a more engaging\/clear way",
    "Strengths: My TA specifically was very good at teaching. He taught everything in the most simplest of ways and taught us techniques to avoid doing harder calculations."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to a person who needs fulfill a major requirement. Besides that, there isn't much reason to take it. The material can be hard and the psets are long. The class does what it's supposed to: prepare you for higher-level math and physics classes.",
    "I would recommend this course only to students who require mathematics for their major. If possible, take ENAS 151 for a more applicable and interesting survey in multivariable calculus. Additionally, TAKE THE CLASS IN THE SPRING FOR A CURVE. Otherwise, you'll be left behind with the extremely fast paced material and often incohesive TA's. If possible, take the course with Miki or Li, since they do a good job explaining the material for all students. Overall, if you must take this class, GET A TUTOR, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, and STUDY!!!",
    "If you are going into Econ, Math (as I am) or Sciences, Engineering, DEFINTELY take either 120 or 230 depending on if you are more comfortable\/Interested in proof based math (I was not.) 120 is a natural completion from my Calc BC background (not to mention it was a prereq for many of my courses.) the skills I learnt will definitely help me a lot in Econ.",
    "Only if you need to take it or if you've taken multi in high school or are a good math student",
    "Yes. I find math and calculus very interesting.",
    "Not unless you need it for your major.",
    "This course is not one I would recommend to a student to take just for fun because it was both challenging and tedious at times, but if they will need multivariable calculus I would recommend this one",
    "Sure, would recommend it to another student, but you really need a strong foundation in calculus to do well in the course and not fall behind the rest of the class.",
    "Good, solid math course that gives an overview of topics in Multivariable calculus.",
    "Would recommend if you enjoy math or if it's required for your major.",
    "Yes, this was an excellent course.",
    "If you need to take multivariable calc for your major, I would recommend this over the ENAS version based on what I have heard from other people. I would not recommend this to someone looking to just get QR credits since I think there are many other more interesting QR classes.",
    "Yes I would",
    "I think you have to take it if you want to take other math classes but I would never recommend for fun.",
    "yes",
    "I would only recommend it to those who have to take it for their major or those who have to take it as a prerequisite for another class."
