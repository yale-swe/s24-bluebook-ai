   "comments": [
    "Fun class well worth taking. Get the problem sets done early and carefully and the workload stays pretty low. The projects are enlightening and entertaining.",
    "If you are fine working in groups then I would definitely recommend it!",
    "A great introductory course to sustainable design concepts, unfortunately most FES students are already well above this level of course work. Less lectures and more time working on projects would make this class worthwhile, but if you've already studied any form of sustainability then avoiding this class is probably for the best. You basically get an introduction to a number of sustainability and design concepts (one hour dedicated to each one, when many topics are given an entire semester course at FES - e.g. LCA, Industrial Ecology, Environmental Chemistry). Then, you spend innumerable hours outside of class working on a design project to solve a \"major\" world problem (these were pretty substandard challenges this year, and yielded some pretty lousy innovations, my own included).",
    "A course to be wary of. How well you do and how you enjoy the course depends solely on your group so it's a gamble.",
    "This was a class unlike any other (well, it was somewhat similar to ENAS 118, just a lot better). There are only 3 problem sets (which happen early in the semester), a midterm, and NO final exam. The final project really kicks into high gear about 1\/3 into the class and continues for the rest of the semester. Start early and the workload won't be too difficult to handle. Just make sure you stay VERY organized.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. There's only a few other classes where you can have this sort of team project, which is a very valuable experience for yourself and for interviews and such. The course was very front-loaded, but may change since the professors are always looking for ways to improve the course. I had a wonderful team, so the overall experience was great. It's great that they don't set a heavy focus on exams and tests, but really try to inspire you to design and create. There's a lot of fun mini-challenges. Only thing is that there are several lectures about the details about the environmental sciences, which went a bit into more detail than what I would have needed to know for the design project, but was probably helpful for those that were of more relevant majors.",
    "While this course can be fun, it is very dependent on the group mates you get.",
    "This class is understandably very popular, so it may be difficult to get in. But, if you do get in, definitely take it!",
    "ENVE 360 is a CEID project-based class. You get a strange mix of written assignments in the first half of the semester and then you focus on your project in the second half. The second half of the semester was by far more fun because we could pursue our own projects. Take this class if you're good at working in teams and if you feel like you can get things done. It seemed like projects suffered from general lack of motivation; don't be one of those people! Be more excited about advancing green engineering and technology!",
    "I feel like some parts of what was presented in the lectures was unnecessary, and felt more like appreciation of corporate aesthetics rather than actual engineering. More workshop time would have been appreciated. Also, the engineering project topics were a little vague, more direction as to what the instructors wanted would have saved our group time as we wasted too much time trying to fill unstated constraints.",
    "It's a great experience to have. I recommend it to anyone interested in the process of green design.",
    "Definitely not what I expected. Your group has such a HUGE! effect on the overall class experience, as well as your grade, so it's pretty hit or miss. And unfortunately, you have no control over your group. So cross your fingers and wish for the best. Also, there is much less class time dedicated to the project than I expected going in. Additionally, the project takes WAY more time and energy than you could ever imagine.",
    "Yes, I would recommend ENVE 360 to another student: it is interesting, well taught, well TFed, and a wonderful introduction to an interesting subject. My only advice is to spend a lot of time making sure your group meshes and making sure you are all on the same page.",
    "This semester's ENVE 360 was a significant time commitment. The professors tried to cover a lot of ground with a lot of assignments. In addition, much of the work is done in assigned groups. If you are willing to invest the time and effort to complete the work and cooperate with your group, this class can be really rewarding. However, it does rely significantly on self-motivation and work outside of classroom time. This time must also be coordinated with three other group members, all of whom are likely busy as well. Be honest about your capacity and interest in the topic before committing to the class.",
    "Professor Anastas is the single best lecturer I had at Yale. His style made me smile every Monday and Wednesday knowing I'd get to go to his class. I'm just sad I'm graduating now and can't take another of his classes next year. Professor Zimmerman is also truly amazing, and their energy and excitement makes this class worth taking no matter what your major is!"
