   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to gain knowledge and insights into complex emergencies using South Sudan as a case study. Future students interested in the course need to do the coursework required which includes readings and presentations. Dr. Unni has an open door policy and so you can reach out to him anytime and he will revert.",
    "If you are interested in complex emergencies, Africa, development and\/or foreign policy, I highly recommend taking this course. The course allows students to consider the real consequences of policy on human beings. It also challenges the hubris often implied among Western governments. In other words, the course is a reality check for many well-meaning professionals.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Introduction to humanitarian emergencies from a human securities lens. Highly recommended to all those with an interest in humanitarian and\/or development work, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "This is an interesting class to take a deep dive on the crisis in South Sudan. The lessons learned seem applicable across different humanitarian aid contexts. Prof. Karunakara is an excellent facilitator of learning and share extensively from his background in different crisis contexts. I would recommend this class."

   "comments": [
    "The course deepened my knowledge of the profession. I have never taken any course in Global Affairs and this was one course i wanted to know more about especially with regards to what is happening in South Sudan; the world's newest countries. I wanted to hear it from someone who has been on the field and can speak to specific incidents and draw from his learnings. If i don't get to work in a humanitarian setting, the knowledge gained will not depart from me. Knowledge they say is power.",
    "This course 100% relates to my continuing career in the US Army as I oversee contingency responses to complex emergencies.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of complex emergencies and humanitarian aid."
