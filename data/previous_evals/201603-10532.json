   "comments": [
    "I developed a broad understanding of the classical literary works in the Western Canon while delving into the details in interesting and developed discussions. I started to learn how to read critically for the key elements of a work, how to contribute to seminar discussions with text-based insights and how to do close readings and develop nuanced arguments about a work.",
    "I learned to write, I learned to read (quickly), and I learned how to valuably participate in section (i.e. learned when it was necessary for me to stop talking and listen to others).",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about ancient literature and how to properly analyze a literary work. Some of the skills we developed in this class, like synthesizing works, was extremely interesting and fun. I also leaned much about how to properly write a college literature essay.",
    "How to read sensitively; how to listen to classmates, and appreciate the richness of the texts",
    "The DS Literature course helped me develop critical reading and writing skills. I learned how to do close readings of passages as well as see patterns and draw comparisons across the works we read during the semester.",
    "this course helped me critically think about a great selection of texts. It also helped me analyze them in writing that was tough and new for me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Yeazell led class discussions really effectively. I felt like I was gaining a lot from every class and that I improved throughout the semester. I would have loved slightly more written feedback on how I could improve and what factors contributed to my grade, but I understand that it is time-consuming to grade papers and that Professor Yeazell has other things she could be doing.",
    "This course, like all of DS, is a wonderful, comprehensive foundation of literary texts. However, like all of DS, you almost always run out of time to say the things you want to.",
    "The strengths of this course were the seminar classes with other amazing students with the professor guiding us through the texts. Unlike the other DS courses, the amount of material we read in DS literature is justified by the discussions we have, so the workload was appropriate, albeit very high.",
    "It's very engaging and Professor Yeazell has a clear love of English which shines through. However, greater context of the texts discussed could improve discussion. She is very nitpicky about grammar in essays though, which sometimes means content discussed in the essays is undervalued.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it exposes freshmen to both lectures and smaller discussion sections, and the workload, while heavy, is well-distributed. I think it could be improved by extending the time for discussion of some works like the Greek tragedies or Ovid's 'Metamorphoses,' for which I did not think the time we had was sufficient."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Yeazell is really perceptive. Class is directed and I feel like I got a really good understanding of the works we read.",
    "DS as a whole is your own decision--it's not worth it to do it for one single course (like I did for lit), but it is a wonderful program. Do it if you love it. If you don't, it's not worth it. If you do do it, try and get Yeazell for lit if you can. She quickly became my new celebrity crush, and every Monday and Wednesday I couldn't wait for her incredible insight, quiet command of a room, and, of course, killer leather pants.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The works we read are truly remarkable, and this class was my favorite of the three courses. Professor Yeazell is a fantastic professor that is very knowledgable, yet openminded, about these works. She is one of the tougher essay graders of the DS literature program in my opinion, however.",
    "Yes, one of the single best courses I have ever taken!",
    "Yes; it is an excellent introduction to some of the works of the western canon, and for someone who is aware of and does not mind the fact that none of the works can be studied in much depth, this course can be very valuable in learning how to read and appreciate literature.",
    "Yes."
