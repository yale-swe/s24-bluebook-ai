    "A survey of 20th century Russian literature- you'll read a lot of stuff that you probably haven't heard of, but there's definitely something for everyone on this syllabus. The reading was lighter than some of the other Russian literature classes that I've taken. Would definitely recommend, especially if it looks like it will be a small class!",
    "Masterpieces of Russian Lit II is a whirlwind tour of Russian literature from the 1890s to the 1990s, which also necessarily means acquiring a better understanding of the history of that tumultuous century. Though the 19th century is better known as \"Russia's literary century,\" the (mostly) 20th century works we read were incredible: well known writers like Chekhov, Nabokov, and Bulgakov were predictably amazing, but I was also exposed to vibrant Soviet-Jewish tradition through Isaac Babel, and completely unknown gems of a tradition of Soviet satire and humor (!!!). Trust me, it's actually hilarious. I highly recommend the course, and if your year was anything like ours, the \"lecture\" will have a small class size and become a \"leminar\" of 5-10 students where you effectively get a free seminar without having to apply."
