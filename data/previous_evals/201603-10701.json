    "The primary skill that I developed during this course was my ability to analyze an argument for its claim, evidence, etc. and my ability to focus on making those elements of my own essays clearer.",
    "I learned how to be more specific in my writing, write a thesis that is debatable, and better organize my ideas. The readings in this course were very interesting and I obtained insight into the many ways truth could be manipulated and how dangerous that could be.",
    "I learned how to be very critical of my writing. I also learned how to better approach choosing a topic for a paper, and how to use feedback to improve my writing. I definitely feel that I am a stronger writer.",

    "My strength is in the ideas that I create and the way I am able to think about and understand a topic. My weakness is in the way that I express those ideas, more specifically my inability sometimes to convey my ideas to the reader clear enough. I believe that I improved on my weakness during this course.",
    "The course is meant to improve the structural facets of student writing, however I think the course is slightly ambitious with the material it tries to cover, which ends up not benefitting the students that are trying to improve their writing.",
    "I think the material is very interesting and Yahel gave us time to talk about important topics. I think she could be better at handing back work on time.",
    "there were a lot of very interesting topics and readings covered in the class. However, the class seemed very disorganized and there were many changes made to the syllabus at the last minute."

    "I would recommend this course to another student. That said, I do think the course is not for everyone. I have a particular interest in the subject matter of this course, so I loved it, but I can imagine it would not be as enjoyable for someone who does not share my interest, as many of the readings that we did were very dense and theoretical.",
    "I would recommend. I think Yahel could be a little more organized but she is a passionate teacher and loves the material she gives to us. This class definitely challenged my writing. Take if you truly are interested in getting better.",
    "This class is relatively easy but interesting. the disorganization was frustrating."
