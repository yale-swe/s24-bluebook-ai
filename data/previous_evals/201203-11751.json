   "comments": [
    "This course is a more time committed version of research for credit, but if contemplating this versus 485 I would encourage the choice of this version to get more out of your research.",
    "I'd recommend it if you like doing research. 20 hrs a week is definitely a lot of time to be in the lab.",
    "This course is a good alternative to the traditional senior requirement because getting involved in research will realistically entail more than one credit's worth of time. However, it is significantly more time and needs to be planned out carefully with the rest of your schedule, so keep that in mind.",
    "pretty straightforward class. if you're doing research in a lab anyway you present your research and write a mock grant proposal. most of the time and work is spent in the lab.",
    "It's a large time commitment but if you ultimately really enjoy your time in lab and need more time to dedicate to your project, then intensive research is a good choice. I imagine the experience varies significantly between labs. It's important to understand what your mentor and PI will expect from you, to start your end of semester assignments early, and to communicate well with your PI\/mentor and the MCDB department. Be sure to take note of all assignments at the beginning of the class, since you will typically not be reminded of due dates until at most a few days before assignments are due.",
    "Alright. Wish more feedback was given."
