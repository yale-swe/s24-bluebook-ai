    "This class provided a really valuable perspective on how African societies responded to the slave trade, which deviates from the conventional focus on the Middle Passage and the Atlantic trade. Through this class I've also honed skills needed to analyse both primary and secondary historical sources.",
    "good knowledge about Atlantic Slave Trade and slave system in Africa",

   "comments": [
    "The class was very well-organized and the syllabus gave a comprehensive coverage of the subject matter as a whole. I also like how we started from generalizations and theories in the first few sessions to examining possible rebuttals, exceptions and nuances, finally ending the class with oral narratives.",
    "This is an incredible course that provides the foundation and context necessary to understand the slave trade and its place in our world's history. The syllabus is very smartly scheduled to expose students to a new component of Africa and the Trade each week. I would say the greatest strengths of the course are the fascinating reading list and Proffesor Harms' unique and interesting perspective.",
    "Great class overall with no real major weaknesses"

    "I really recommend this class if you want to deviate from the conventional focus on the Atlantic slave trade, and learn more about how African societies were actually shaped by and responded to the trade.",
    "Yes! Professor Harms is fantastic and the course is loaded with important and unique ideas often skipped over in high school and in other history courses. Being a US history major, I was hoping to get out of this course a better idea of slavery outside of the North American context. Now, when I study in the future I will constantly benefit from what I have learned in this course. Great class!!",
    "Yes! I learned a lot! If you take it, please do all the reading and take advantage of Professor Harms' knowledge!",
    "I most definitely would. As a STEM major I was looking for a non-intense writing credit with interesting subject matter and this is exactly what I got",
    "Yes, great engaging seminar with manageable workload."
