   "comments": [
    "I found this to be a very interesting seminar and it was amazing to have the authors of the articles we read come in on 4 separate occasions to discuss first-hand what we had read! I felt very pampered. However, there were only 7 of us in the class and I don't think the vibe would have been the same in a larger class.",
    "Not hard and certainly not a lot of work (weekly reading can be too long but you can get away with skimming; present the reading once in the semester; 5-page midterm paper; 10-15 page final paper). Some of the material was pretty interesting, but a lot of it was dense cultural theory and sociology. Class would have been more engaging if the professor had asked better questions-- instead of \"what did you think about xyz reading,\" it would have been helpful to have questions more conducive to discussion. Some of the material was dense, and we could have used a little more help getting into it.",
    "Like four other students in the class, I\u0092d never taken an anthropology course before; however, the material was still really accessible and the professor helped frame the questions of the class. If you are passionate about the class material and will be motivated to do the reading, you should consider taking the class.The workload is manageable -- about 75 pages of antro. articles or a book a week and your grade is comprised of a 5 page reading response, a class presentation, and a 10-15 page final paper. You could get by without doing the reading, but class would be a whole lot less interesting. Kamari Clarke definitely lets discussions flow based on the students contribution -- so if you shop the class and like the material\/classmates, I would recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in looking at religion outside of the issue of faith, take it. there are some interesting readings",
    "A fantastic review of current, politically, anthropologically and socially important religious movements and why it is necessary to be faith literate in a modern, globalizing world. I would absolutely recommend this class, I think it manages to be both a great introductory course while offering students a hance to dig deeper into the material."
