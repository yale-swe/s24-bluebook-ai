    "Yes, any chance to spend time with Prof. Kastan is worth it, he is fabulous! We read ten plays total and wrote one paper, surprisingly little work.",
    "This class is one I will talk about when people ask about \"my Yale experience.\" Getting to handle actual printed quartos in the Beinecke (Class met in the Beinecke, meaning we got to touch old books everyday) from the 17th Century (AND touch the First Folio... multiple times... and read from it) would have made it worth taking the class if it were a terrible experience. BUT the class was far from that. The material was absolutely fascinating, blowing every conception I had of Shakespeare the author out of the water (except maybe for the fact that he wrote stuff in English), and centering the class around the Pavier Quartos was helpful in giving the class direction (otherwise it could have turned into meet twice a week to talk about random things regarding Shakespeare... which personally I would have found quite a blast but would have unnerved others who would want... more focus). The reading was manageable (even on the lighter side than other classes), and the professor (David Scott Kastan) was fantastic, brilliant, witty, and genuinely sympathetic (hard to find all four in one person, let alone one professor). The discussions were interesting, and the one writing assignment (yes there is only one - an introduction to a Pavier Quarto - and it's about 15-25 pages) was something that I've never done before and made me write about Shakespeare in a completely different manner. The course material (both getting to touch the books and the subject matter itself) is enough reason to take this course. David Scott Kastan is enough reason to take this course. The two together make it absolutely incredible.",
    "Definitely. It's not your typical English course - there's not really a syllabus, there's only one final paper - but it will really change your perspective on literature. While it is a seminar, it often seems more like a mini-lecture; but since Kastan knows an incredible amount, I never minded just sitting and listening.",
    "Old books, Thomas Pavier, and the book as a technology. With some visits from guests and a couple of celebrity appearances by the First Folio.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the materiality of texts and the history of the book\/construction of authorship.",
    "An interesting, quirky course that ended up being about the Pavier quartos, an attempt by the publisher Thomas Pavier to issue a collected works of Shakespeare before the First Folio. I learned a lot about the way books were printed and how plays made their way into print, which was in fact a lot more interesting and relevant than it might seem. Professor Kastan is also just a great professor. Definitely take a class with him at some point.",
    "I would recommend this class to any English student who wants to know more about Shakespeare's historical context or about the history of the book, or who wants Professor Kastan as a teacher regardless of the subject. I would not recommend this class to students who want to focus on literary analysis to the exclusion of historical context -- at times it was more a history class than an English class. (Also: pre-1800!)",
    "A fun, kind of off-the-wall class in which you will have the opportunity to approach the plays of Shakespeare from a remarkable and new perspective. Meets in the Beineke library. The curriculum revolves around whatever Prof Kastan wants it to revolve around -- some aspect of the early-modern playwrighting process. Less abstract, more material.",
    "Take it. This class is worth fighting for. If you have any interest in Shakespeare or early modern England, you will love it. Professor Kastan is brilliant.",
    "This class was not actually as described in the Blue Book; instead, it was an examination of the publication practices of one printer of Shakespeare, Thomas Pavier. I had come into the class eager to learn about early modern printing practices in general - the description of the course talked about Donne and the Bible in addition to Shakespeare - and so I was disappointed by how specialized the class became. Moreover, Professor Kastan does not stick to a syllabus, so at times I felt as though I wasn't doing anything for the class, which was frustrating. Overall, I don't think I would recommend this class, although Professor Kastan is a fun seminar leader and if you are really, really interested in the material, you couldn't ask for a better person to teach it.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is a class for people to like to think really hard about esoteric things. Seeing as how this is most Yale students, I would highly recommend this class, but it is not conventional. The material is deceptively simple and one must find the complexities for him\/herself. Being able to look at the quartos and folios is really breathtaking and something that you won't be able to do again maybe in your life. Bottom line, this class is really cool if you like Shakespeare, theater, and Elizabethan England. If you don't really like those things, you may not be so wild about the course.",
    "YES YES YES. You learn so much about books. Amazing for those who have read every Shakespeare play there is, great nonetheless for those who haven't. I could gush about how great this course is."
