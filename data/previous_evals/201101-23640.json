   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's interesting.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class.",
    "The major drawback of this course is that it only focuses on one specific artist.",
    "DEFINITELY. Love Picasso.",
    "An in-depth yet not comprehensive look at Picasso's oeuvre. I felt Professor Zeidler was hindered by his desire to propagate certain themes throughout the course, which in turn limited the variety of works he chose to show.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course!",
    "HSAR 322 is primarily focused on reading Picasso's paintings for their formal innovations; there's very little emphasis on Picasso's life. I would recommend the course to any student interested in thinking deeply about modern art; it's a very intellectually engaging class if you put your mind to it.",
    "This class had some kinks in it, probably due to the fact that Professor Zeidler has never taught it before. And Picasso produced such a diverse body of work that some of his stuff will undoubtedly appeal to you more than others. But in general this class was really invaluable in providing me with a better (though not even close to comprehensive) appreciation of an artist about whom many people know but few actually understand.",
    "HSAR 322 is a fantastic class, mostly because you will not find a better art history professor than Zeidler. Whether you love Picasso or not, you'll be exposed to great art and really fascinating and challenging theory. Zeidler doesn't teach to the bottom, so you should be prepared to work and engage with the material. That said, Zeidler will walk you through the material from his incredibly brilliant perspective, and that makes it worth it. Typical workload, with just a midterm, final 7-page paper, and final. I'm not sure if he's planning on teaching Picasso again specifically, but whatever he's teaching, TAKE. IT.",
    "YES. Take this if you like Picasso a lot because that's all you cover.This course was great overall. It was so nice to go in depth with one artist. Professor Zeidler focuses mainly on formal analysis, so you're not bogged down with historical facts and just look at works of art in general. The lectures are fantastic, and the readings are totally manageable. Professor Zeidler was a bit disorganized, and the class was cut from 1 hr, 15 minutes to 50 minutes after the first week. I felt like we didn't cover as much material as I would have liked as a result. You have a midterm, exam, and 7 page paper. I had weekly reading responses in my section, but that depends on the TA.",
    "This class is a very interesting overview of Picasso's work. You should definitely shop the class to see what you think of Zeidler's lecture style; I really enjoyed it, but I imagine it's not for everyone. Make sure to sit close to the front of the room, because he has a quiet speaking voice. A warning-- we only covered through 1937, but I imagine if the class is taught again, it would be paced to cover more of Picasso's life.",
    "I would recommend it, especially after Zeidler has a semester of practice teaching it.",
    "A very interesting course. I took this because I had never understood 20th century art and came out with a good understanding at what Picasso was about. I wish I had taken it Credit\/D, though, since I'm not a history of art major and sometimes felt lost with the abstract readings. I was also extremely disappointed by the mandatory paper topic: \"Was Picasso's realism inevitably misogynist\" (what???) and wish we could have been given different prompts to choose from.",
    "Picasso's career was long and varied enough to make a class devoted entirely to his work worthwhile for anyone interested in modern art. Prof. Zeidler is eccentric but brilliant.",
    "If you're into Modern Art, take it. Picasso lived long enough that the course doesn't feel too narrow.",
    "Picasso's work is incredibly interesting, diverse, and combines a lot of interesting theory, but the professor is a little dull and hard to listen to.",
    "Sure, great class, but be prepared for difficult theoretical material."
