    "Interesting course that informs how POWs have been treated\/dealt with over time. Also will challenge you to find a true definition for the word \"slavery.\" Only two 10 page papers, but they do require quite a bit of research.",
    "Take this class if you can",
    "Take it if you would like to learn more about POWs and captivity! It's a small class with a great professor.",
    "Two 10 page papers, 40% each, and 20% participation. That's it. It could seem like a lot to some, but it's absolutely worth it. Will is a wonderful instructor and this is an amazing course with great insight into the world of captivity and what captivity means.",
    "Yes. It was an enjoyable course with not tons of work!",
    "CSTC is a survey seminar in different forms of captivity and ransom and the evolution of these two practices across space and time. If the course were less readings only and if the class was one that was lively and had a good dynamic, then yes, I would recommend it. These topics are so interesting to talk about, but if your class is not very dynamic, then the appeal of taking this course drops exponentially.",
    "I would recommend this class, even if you have no prior experience in the topic. You get a different perspective on history and law across cultures and countries and is a very eye opening class."
