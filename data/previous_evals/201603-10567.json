    "Leaving the course, I can't but help that the knowledge prioritized in this coursewriting characterswill have evaporated from my mind within a matter of weeks. Undoubtedly, this makes me sad. The practice of listening to Chinese and speaking is undoubtedly helped my level, but the improvement seems rather minor, at least from what I can sense at this point. I felt that some of the lessons were truly fascinatingincluding the ones on Chinese food, music, Tiananmen, etc.but others seemed, frankly, like a waste of time. Several different lessons on chengyu, suyu, shunkouliu, etc. really isn't important. Talking with my tutorial teacher, who said that she had never used any of these sayings in her entire life, also made me feel like I was learning something that really wouldn't benefit me.",
    "This course builds on a intermediate background in Chinese. It develops a stronger communicative ability in much more complex and serious topics. You develop a solid understanding of these components of Chinese culture as well, a definite plus.",
    "I feel I have gained better listening skills in Chinese as well as more proficient speaking.",
    "Vocabulary and grammar. There were attempts at teaching Chinese culture, but the content covered was largely outdated."

   "comments": [
    "Unfortunately, I feel that this course has many more weaknesses than strengths. I'll outline them here for the hopes that they are, someday, improved. Talking with my fellow classmates, I know that these feelings are shared and not those of an individual dissenter. Of all the weaknesses, the one that appears most stark to me is the focus on writing characters. Approximately 80-90% of my time out of class studying was simply memorizing how to write characters for the small quizzes. Because the sheer volume of the characters was so largeabout 45 per day, 2 days a weekI knew that I would forget almost every character a few days after learning it, and certainly after leaving the course. Whats frustrating about this is that writing characters by hand is objectively the least important aspect of learning Chinese for the vast majority of students. I can not foresee a single moment in my future life when I will need to write a character by hand, as almost all of my communication will be through speaking or digital typing. Generously, some key characters may be useful to know, but learning 900 throughout the semesterincluding utterly useless words and specific words that are better left to be looked up when needed, like stock market, economic depression, and Rock n' Rollis not going to benefit my Chinese. Instead, we should be focusing on speaking, listening, and reading comprehension. These are the parts of Chinese that are most important, yet they comprised somewhere between 10-20% of my time outside of class. A new textbook needs to be used that is more modernized in its academic approach and doesn't stress rote memorization that won't benefit us after leaving the class. In the defense of the teachers, I'm not sure if they realize the extent that we are all forced to practice writing characters instead of speaking. Yet while the character writing portion of the test is only about 15%, in actuality preparing for that portion takes more time than all the other parts of the tests combined, leading to it dominating our study. Furthermore, learning 45 characters for one day is purely ridiculous and counterproductive. Finally, the size of the class should be dramatically reduced. 10-14 students in a language seminar is just too much. For my L1 Chinese class, I had 6-8. The large size limits each student to only speaking about 2-3 times in a class, which is really our only time to practice oral Chinese for those of us who don't have close friends who are fluent. When I started learning Chinese at Yale, I truly loved it. This past summer in China was one of my favorite experiences of my life. Coming back to L5, unfortunately, was a disappointment, and it really dampened my curiosity for the language. Talking with my friends among all L5 Chinese levelsheritage and traditionalI hear that this is a ubiquitous feeling. I would love for Yale to revamp its Chinese program and modernize its teaching methodologies and prioritize teaching us the language for use in the real world. Unfortunately, I don't see this happening. Speaking, interacting, listening, and practicing my Chinese is what I learned to love, but simply writing characters for 1-2 hours a day has taken that appreciation away.",
    "There should be an option for this course for those of us who want to continue to have some kind of engagement with Chinese but at a less strenuous level. I'm all for packing my brain with new vocabulary, but I'm done with my language requirements and only decided to continue to be able to practice my speaking which is difficult in a class of 15-17 people. However, the professors are incredible.",
    "This course is good for strengthening written and reading abilities but because of a class size larger than that of the lower levels, I did find it harder to improve on my spoken ability. If there were more professors or more sections, I feel that speaking ability would have a greater focus. It's hard to get attention in a class with 12 students.",
    "There tends to be a lot of homework on certain days and hardly any on other days. I feel it would be better if the workload were spread out more evenly.",
    "The course is very intense and attempts to cover a lot of material. The book used is quite outdated and not as exciting as one would hope."

    "No, I wouldn't recommend this course. If you are dead set on mastering Chinese as you want to use it in your life, then maybe I wouldalthough you'd be better off studying the parts you find most important on your own. For the class itself, you'll spend the vast majority of your time out of class rote memorizing how to write characters that you will never actually need to know in your lifea futile mission. Since the size of the class is also larger than it should be, your speaking won't improve as much as one would hope. Unless you have some outsized interest or purpose for Chinese in your life, you're better left taking another course; certainly don't just take this course to take it as you've already put so much time into Chinese.",
    "Take this class if you're interested pursuing a more advanced Chinese education. It is work and requires dedication and concentration.",
    "If you would like to continue learning Chinese after second year, this is about what you'd expect. Can be pretty fun at times.",
    "I personally did not enjoy this class as much as I thought I would, having taken L1 and L2 last year then spent summer in Beijing. This may partially be because I have a relatively heavy semester with other classes so I couldn't dedicate as much time to this class as I hope. Another major factor may also be the super outdated textbook that is quite dry and cover topics that are not entirely exciting. The workload is heavy but bearable and constant."
