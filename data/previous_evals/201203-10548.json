   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to class to a student who wants a very challenging course to improve their Greek literacy. The work is worth it.",
    "This class is required for a reason. You need to take it (a) to give you a professional's knowledge of the Greek language and (b) to understand the rest of Greek and Latin literature. Be warned that you will spend a very long time on Homer.",
    "This course demands that students read about a thousand lines of Greek poetry (and occasional bits of prose) per week, ranging from Homer to Imperial literature. Class time is spent primarily on discussion (often with an emphasis on several secondary articles related to the text) with some translation and presentation. It is a rigorous course but emphasizes reading over most other skills (no term paper) and is not therefore overly demanding.",
    "The best way to deepen and widen your knowledge about Greek literature. Surely I will, if he is interested in Greek literature.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student, but say that it will be a very time-intensive and stressful survey of Greek poetry.",
    "This course was a lot of work and quite challenging, but in the end I read a lot of Greek and my ability to do so benefited enormously. It thus fulfilled its purpose.I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to read a broad swath of Greek poetry (and a little prose) and is willing to put in the time and effort needed to succeed, and certainly to anyone who is taking the qualifying translation exams."

   "comments": [
    "I pushed myself to read a lot more than I thought possible in the course of one semester. This gives me more confidence to tackle future academic challenges, like my future dissertation.",
    "As I stated above, this course vastly improved my ability to read Greek and gave me a much more thorough knowledge of the Greek canon than I had previously. I view this course not as an end in itself but as a foundation for future work, and I do feel that it has prepared me for further, more focused study of these and other texts.I am now capable both of reading and of contextualizing Greek poetry and understand where there exist opportunities for more detailed exploration.",
    "This course is a essential preparation for my qualification exams.",
    "I ended up reading a lot of material from the reading list, so it certainly helped prepare for my qualifying exams. Moreover, my research benefited from reading and rereading a number of texts and authors that I would have otherwise given less attention to, and whom now, I suspect, will play a fundamental role in my dissertation."
