    "Italian 110 is a fantastic course that I would highly recommend to anyone considering the L1 language choices. The course if fast-paced but definitely manageable. The professor is excellent, and the class is highly engaging. I look forward to L2!",
    "Italian 110 is a great introductory class for someone who has had no prior exposure to Italian. Although the class is fast-paced, if you keep up with the workbook exercises, compositions and vocabulary learning, it is very rewarding. I found that I learnt more Italian in one semester than I have in the past with other languages in a year! I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are hoping to fulfil their language requirement. Italian is a beautiful language and I am so glad that I chose it. At first, I only chose Italian because of the language distributional requirement however I am currently considering whether I want to take the language further than just L3!",
    "Absolutely! It was a fun course to take.",
    "If you are thinking of starting a new language, I'd highly recommend this class!",
    "I would recommend Ital 110 to any student. It's a great class that quickly teaches you the fundamentals of Italian. Professor Buonocore is the best.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking Italian or just wanting to learn a new language. By the end of the course, they would be able to have a background in Italian grammar and understand conversations and form their own.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend Italian to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student that has interest in a vibrant and passionate culture. Learning the Italian language is the best way to embrace this culture. If a student has an interest in this, then that passion will help them through completing the weekly temas and workbook activities. I never felt that the workload was overwhelming, perhaps due to my interest in the subject."
