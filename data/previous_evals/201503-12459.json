During the fall semester, the only assignments you will have to turn in for the course itself are a short research proposal at the beginning of the term and a slightly longer grant proposal (5 pages) at the end of the term. Everything else is basically up to you and your PI, so take care to ensure that you enjoy your research project and the people with whom you are working."
