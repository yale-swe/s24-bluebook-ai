    "It is a lot of nightly busy work and weekly tests and compositions, but ultimately very rewarding.",
    "If you haven't taken French already, then don't take it at yale.",
    "I would only recommend this is you are serious about the language. Not that easy.",
    "For students who've never had French before its extremely difficult to be conversational because the lesson content was so all over the place. We learned a lot of complicated and obscure things but didn't spend enough time on basics. Something as small as a list idiomatic expressions and necessary words and phrases (i.e. classroom objects, household vocab, travel expressions, etc) would have been nice. The course also moves much to quickly for anyone to actually LEARN. The double lesson weeks rarely fit together and it was hard to tell which concepts or vocab were important. I assume that most people will take this class to fulfill the language requirement, so it really doesn't matter if I'd recommended. Just make sure you get a good TA."
