    "I absolutely loved this course. It was a fun way to learn a bit more about the environment from the business side, and it taught me about opportunities for employment that I hadn't considered before. Kris was funny, helpful, and engaging. Totally approachable. This class was such a nice break in my week, and it was definitely my favorite of the semester, because of its light, casual feel.",

I realized that this course was not for me since I have had experience in this area before. However, I did not realize my experience was valuable and valid until I took this course - for this reason, I think this course was beneficial in this way."
