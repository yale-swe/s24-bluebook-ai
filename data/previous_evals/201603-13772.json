    "I found that watching what other people brought to the tables was a great window into others artistic eye and also built conversations that were valuable regarding effective images and stories.",
    "I think it was a great starting point for the topic of projection design. I particularly enjoyed the assignment of \"the Heidi chronicles\" because it was very challenging. In addition, I liked the class that the students gave a presentation about diffrent artists. I learnt a lot about the history of projections and it was very inspiring"

    "I would say projection design has become extremely technically driven nowadays. Although it's valuable to have an overview of various artist in the past, it is also important to catch up with the latest development. This especially true for the assignment of artist research, there are more modern projection artist that should be included in the list. And putting the artist research at the beginning of the course might be a better idea which also serve as a overview of the scope of the field.",
    "I felt the instructions for assignments were often confusing and it was hard to know exactly what was expected. When we would try and clarify with the TA of the course, she would often contradict the original instructions from Wendall.",
    "I would suggest having a more formulated syllabus and outline for each project. I found that there were moments in the class where I was told one thing by the Instructor and something different by the Teaching assistant which lead to my confusion. I would have like to been given a bit more structure. That being said, I don't feel that my projects were ever pushed aside or ignored even if they did not fit the outline that was presented to others.",
    "I wish we could have seen more examples of projection design today, and have more conversations on how to implement projections in a skillful way"

    "TA and Professor more on the same page.",
    "I love talking through projects but I would love to see some type of structure put together to ensure that we get to see everyone's project on a set day. That way we get to hear from everyone and there is no wasted time on figuring out if anyone still has to present.",
    "I think Wendall is a great teacher! she has a lot of passion for the subject and is always interesting to hear her opinion on a subject."
