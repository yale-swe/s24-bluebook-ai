   "comments": [
    "This class is ideal for any student who seeks to practice using databases and do original resource with late Qing\/Republican era periodicals. Also perfect for those who want practice reading Chinese in the period of transition from classical\/literary to baihua.It would be a bad fit for a student who benefits from a highly structured syllabus, or who has no experience in either Chinese literature or history.",
    "Very mind-broadening for students who are interested in modern Chinese history.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student. This is the seminar where you can learn invaluable skills of researching with digital sources."

   "comments": [
    "Contributed to my discipline very much.",
    "This course helped me to develop my literary Chinese reading skills and and gave me an invaluable opportunity to design my own research project. I created my own website to publish my research, which I intend to continue using for future research.I truly hope this course will continue to be offered in future terms. It is uniquely unstructured, allowing each student to pursue their own research interests within a flexible syllabus. It serves to help graduate students to transition from \"assigned\" research and papers to self-directed research and writing.",
    "A very important initiation in digital humanities.",
    "The seminar introduced me to the use of digital sources."
