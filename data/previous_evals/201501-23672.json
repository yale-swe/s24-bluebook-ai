    "I highly recommend Postindustrial City to students interested in how changing cities are results of legal and social transformation, and how issues of inequality are manifest in the built environment.",
    "Postindustrial cities is a survey of cities mired by deindustrialization and globalization. The readings are interesting and Rebecca Jacobs is a boss. Just be aware that she can be a difficult grader.",
    "This was an amazing class, absolutely take it if you can.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in cities today. The readings span a range of disciplines, the assignments are reasonable and really fun, and Rebecca is great. Discussion did sometimes become exactly what you would expect from a group of liberal AmStud folks, but maybe you would enjoy being the vocal opposition to that. And regardless, I always walked out of class feeling like it had been a very valuable use of an hour and fifty minutes.",
    "This is a fascinating class that gives you a broad history of city planning, some social theory, and interesting readings (like ethnographies and other anthropological works). It spans environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural (among other) issues that are pertinent to deindustrialization. Take this class if the syllabus looks at all interesting. Rebecca's awesome, too!",
    "Absolutely. If they offer this again, take it. Regardless of whether you are interested in American Studies or think this class sounds relevant to your interests. It is relevant to anyone who is alive today in America.",
    "You read a different ethnography-ish piece each week, usually a case study of a particular issue\/demographic within a particular city or region. There are weekly reading responses, a midterm paper (analyzing a place in New Haven) and a final paper (you choose the topic!)."
