   "comments": [
    "The course was very well structured and we had access to a lot of practice materials that helped us prepare for the tests.",
    "fairly straightforward and engaging",
    "Two of the instructors seem to write the exams, giving their students an advantage. Perhaps the course could be taught as a lecture (with Miki as the professor) and the other teachers could lead independent sections to reinforce the material.",
    "Strengths: weekly assignments helped me stay on track. The material that we \"needed to know\" was clearly presented in class and reinforced in the homework. The class was straightforward, as a math class should be. The material included was challenging but not impossible. I also like the small class size. Weaknesses: Math 120 would benefit from a \"study hall\" like PHYS 180 has. Also, teaching across sections is uneven in pacing and quality.",
    "I hope to be able to visualize the different integrals better. The geometric explanation of math 120 doesnt really match with the algebraic ones.",
    "There is a lot of material in this course. I felt I was only learning how to solve problems, rather than gaining an appreciation of concepts that I could apply later in other contexts. I imagine I will soon forget most of the material I learned in this course. I think this is primarily because instructors did not have time to explain concepts to students, and instead focused on teaching us specific strategies for solving problems. If there were a way to reduce the amount of material covered in this course, this problem could be avoided.",
    "Strengths: good support Weaknesses: NA"

    "Yes. It is a very strong foundations course.",
    "yes necessary for understanding multi-variable calculus and beyond",
    "Yes. Well-organized class.",
    "Not really, unless you're passionate about math.",
    "If youre reading this review, youre probably choosing between MATH 120 and ENAS 151. I have enjoyed MATH 120 and I am an ENVE major. It is straightforward and presented clearly, though the lack of applications leaves some people (myself included) struggling to understand conceptually. However, I was overall satisfied with the class and I think I would have done better had I spent more time on weekly worksheets and homeworks. This class is completely manageable if you put in the time.",
    "I would recommend this course only to students who will use multivariable calculus in their later coursework or careers. The course is detailed and comprehensive. However, in my opinion, students who do not need the specific problem-solving skill set provided by this class are unlikely to find it useful in the future.",
    "Yes, as a requirement"
