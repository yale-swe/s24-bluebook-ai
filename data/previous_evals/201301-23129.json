    "mark schoofs is wonderful. he goes above and beyond in every way, and if you can get in and are interested in journalism at all, definitely take it.",
    "Absolutely. If you get into this class, it will be one of the best classes you take at Yale. There is no decision to make. TAKE IT.",
    "Take this course with Mark Schoofs. He is the nicest professor you will ever learn from, and the one most interested in your future prospering.",
    "This is an excellent class. Professor Schoofs is both rigorous and empathetic. He's super smart, knows the subject very well, and cares deeply about his students. He was always available for in-person or phone meetings, and he was always encouraging and on-point. You also learn an enormous amount about the history of journalism and the specific techniques of reporting and interviewing. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "ENGL 467 is a rigorous introduction to the craft of journalism, with an emphasis on feature writing. The course requires a 2500-word profile of another student in the class and a 3500-word investigative or explanatory article on a subject of your choosing. The former lets you become intimate with your classmates. Both teach you how to put colorful stories on paper. I have rarely encountered a teacher who cares more about his students than Professor Schoofs. He will call you after 10 PM to address concerns you have about your final paper, or to offer career advice, or to chat about life. He makes time to meet with you individually. He line edits and writes thoughtful comments on your work. Finally, the reading, guest speakers, and trips to New York make for a fantastic seminar. I could not recommend the class more.",
    "I would highly recommend taking English 467 with Mark Schoofs. Given Brill's curmudgeonly reputation, and my experience with Schoofs as a compassionate, thorough, and relatable professor, I would suggest taking this course\u00e2\u0080\u0094which serves as a detailed overview of all practical (and some theoretical) aspects of journalism\u00e2\u0080\u0094with Schoofs if at all possible. The lessons are valuable, especially given the relatively light workload (just two major assignments) as far as high-level English classes go."
