    "Terrible class. Professor is super smart, but everything he says sounds boring. He's nice and he cares, but this was one of the worst classes I've ever taken. Tons of memorization, the book was useless, and you end up learning random crap about the brain, but also a lot about other things, like muscles and how your ear works. I couldn't actually tell you much about the brain...I think we learned something about dopamine? Who knows...",
    "If Professor Brown is teaching this course again, DEFINITELY TAKE IT! The material is so fascinating, regardless of whether or not you're considering the Neuroscience track in Psych. The textbook is fun to read (although a little detailed at times, but Prof. Brown simplifies all of it in class and you're only responsible for whatever he covers in lecture) and he showed us a few documentaries throughout the semester which were really interesting! The exams are not hard (but I wouldn't say they're easy either) which is probably why the average was always pretty high (they tended to be 85+). I don't think he ends up curving it because of the high averages. That said, you have four midterms and no final, which I thought was great, and you don't have any homework! Take this class!! It's completely painless, and actually really enjoyable! Prof. Brown is super sweet and the TAs are as well! Their review sessions are helpful and all lecture slides and review slides are posted online. There's no reason as to why you shouldn't take this class :)",
    "Ok course. Could be a lot better but overall it's not that difficult. The nice thing is that there are 4 midterms spaced out evenly and no final. Lot of memorization though. You could feasibly never go to class (except for movie days) and still do fine on the exams if you cram since they're based off the lecture slides which are posted online. I returned my book because it was expensive and i soon realized that you can do well without it since the lectures are basically straight from the relevant chapters in the book.",
    "Perfect introductory to Neuroscience. While it can be intimidating as a science class, I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology and the brain.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the workings of the brain and how it influences our actions. The class does have a lot of readings, and the tests require a lot of memorization, but as long as you keep up with the assignments, it's not that bad.",
    "Due to the nature of the information, this class is based on lots of rote memorization of details and names. Be warned that Prof. Brown is not the most engaging lecturer, but his powerpoints are very clear and posted online for you to study off of. As long as considerable time and effort is put into studying, it is very easy to do well on the tests. There are, however, 4 exams, so be aware of how much studying needs to be done.",
    "It's a good class for an overview of how the human brain works. It's not the most exciting most of the time, but if you enjoy the material, as I do, it's pretty cool. Don't be fooled that it's a social science credit also--it's really a science class with a lot of memorization. The reading is long and slow going--it helps but it's not that worth it because the powerpoints have almost everything you'd ever need to know for tests. It's nice to only have four non-cummulative tests.",
    "As I was taking it, I didn't necessarily enjoy this class, its lectures, or the style of its exams, but by the end I realized that I really had learned a lot of information, and the material I was learning in this class was starting to be really helpful in my other Psych classes\/research lab\/etcetera. I ended up being glad that I took it and coming away with a positive view of my experience. The way the brain functions is often rather surprising and interesting and having a functional knowledge of it is important and useful. Also, Prof. Brown did appear to want to make the class a success and did improve as he went along, so I wouldn't be surprised if the class is better next time he teaches it. So, if you're interested in neuroscience or if you are studying a field in which neuroscience is relevant, it is a worthwhile class to take and I would recommend it.",
    "If you need a science credit or are extremely interested in neuroscience, this class is good. The exams aren't difficult, and you don't need to go to lecture. However, this class will not make you love the material.",
    "Absolutely do not take this class. It sounds interesting, but it's a terrible amount of work, and in the end, you don't really feel like the information that you've acquired (by hours and hours of rote memorization) is at all cohesive.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want a good, scientific knowledge base of the brain. However, there is a lot of memorization, though it's completely manageable. Memorization kind of goes along with the territory of an intro neuro course. There was one day where we had an optional extra credit (only a few points) homework assignment, where we had to use Ohm's law and apply our knowledge to predict when a neuron would figure, given certain conditions and explain why. That was cool. Other than that day, though, memorizing stuff was pretty dull. Though, you definitely do learn some really cool things about the brain, like the neural mechanisms behind affective blindsight.The workload's not super intense, just 4 exams (also - side note, all of his exams had at least one question that was not covered in the lectures, even though he said there would be no questions that were only from the book. this really didn't affect my grade, but it was annoying). Professor Brown is really nice and knowledgeable, but not a super exciting lecturer. Overall, this course was pretty good, but not superb.",
    "A fine science credit if you're into rote memorization.",
    "It's REALLY dry, but interesting. Just memorize the structures of the brain IMMEDIATELY.",
    "If you want to learn about the stuff, then yes.",
    "Straightforward and fair. Material was very interesting as well. Take it!",
    "I would take this course if you are an aspiring neuroscience major, otherwise, definitely not. You are expected to know the material in incredible detail which takes time. With that being said you are only repsonsible for knowing the material from lectures, not the book, and there are 4 non-cumulative tests; no homework assignments or anything of that nature.",
    "This course is fascinating. The information I learned over the course of the semester about how the brain and all its pieces work together is some of the most interesting subject matter I have encountered at Yale.However, it was also one of the worst-taught classes I have ever taken. Professor Brown may be brilliant in his field, and he's a nice guy, but the lectures were horrible. He just reads off the slides (which themselves are basically transcriptions of portions of the book), and often goes far too quickly. Also, the exams were not straightforward, often having trick questions or poorly worded questions. They also were not always graded all that fairly.All that said, I ended up enjoying it in the end, just because of the subject material we were learning. The book is very well-written as well. Just know that if you do enjoy this class, it will be in spite of how it is taught, not because of it.",
    "Course hard to make an A in but if you prepare several wks ahead, it is possible. TA's make up tests and decide scores for most part.",
    "Would I recommend Fundamentals of Neuroscience with Thomas Brown? That's a difficult question. The material, I think, is fascinating. The way it's delivered leaves a little bit to be desired. Professor Brown is fine but he's not particularly engaging. What makes it bad is that the lectures consist of PowerPoint slides taken straight from the book, and in class Prof Brown basically reads through them, providing VERY LITTLE if any embellishment or insight or commentary. Since the slides are posted online, I unfortunately discovered there was literally no reason to go to class.The course itself is pretty manageable and I imagine it wouldn't be much work at all if you don't read the textbook. Professor Brown claimed that on exams we were only responsible for material in the lecture, though I never trusted him and read all the textbook assignments (by the way, we go through the entire 600 page textbook). But really it was only through reading the book that I got to actually learn about the great field of neuroscience--unfortunately I felt that a lot of the more interesting and subtle parts of the readings were left out in the lectures, which were basically chapter summaries. I crammed for the four tests and did fine, but I did have to commit a lot of time the day or two before each exam.Overall, the professor is decent, the lectures are not very engaging, but the material itself is extremely fascinating. Before the semester I told myself I could just read the textbook and get as much out of it that I would get out of taking this course...then I realized there was no way I would ever find the time to read a textbook outside of class. I feel like I got credit for reading the textbook and cramming for a few tests every once in a while. A pretty enjoyable experience, but I think there's a lot more potential for this class.",
    "Don't take this class if you are looking for an easy science credit. It is a very interesting class but you'll only enjoy it if you are especially into the brain and the science of its functionality.",
    "good overview of neuroscience",
    "This class has a textbook with long chapters, but the power-points are the main focus for the exams, of which there are four. I suggest taking this course because no biology or chemistry background is needed and you will learn a lot of material and watch some fun movies.",
    "The material was presented clearly in lecture. If you read the book, you will do more than well on the exams. Be warned, if you do not read the book, and just memorize lecture notes, you will not do well.",
    "You will take this class because you're required too. If you can avoid Thomas Brown, you should. His lectures were never more than an hour and fifteen minutes of Professor Brown literally reading his lecture slides. He never said anything interesting that you couldn't find verbatim on his lecture slides.The exams were fair. Whatever. Just read the book.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise, wait for a class that gets good reviews, like Brain and Thought.",
    "Don't take the course unless it's offered by someone else. It's a great course and offers a lot of interesting content, but the professor really brought it down this year.",
    "The course was fine, but I wouldn't actually recommend it. Lectures are pretty dry, and the class is basically rote memorization. You will spend four long weekends cramming, and there's tons of reading that you will not finish. Grading is tough, so don't expect an A or A-.",
    "If your good at reading basic textbooks and memorizing random things, take it. Or if you find the material interesting. But lecture is terribly boring, and there is a lot of material to memorize.",
    "good class, very boring lectures. lots of memorization for exams",
    "Fundamentals of Neuroscience has outstanding course material for those interested in learning how the nervous system controls behavior, and the underlying neural pathways. The course, however, requires an immense amount of rote theoretical memorization, and is a very challenging class that is difficult to do well in. The course is best suited for psych\/neuroscience or bio\/neuroscience majors looking for a rigorous introduction to the nervous system's control of human behavior. Note: this class should be avoided at all costs if Thomas Brown is the professor. It is best to take PSYC 160 (Human Neuroscience) if he is teaching the lecture.",
    "If you're looking for an easy grade with no work, this is your class. Just know it's a boring.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Otherwise, you'll gouge your eyeballs out.",
    "This class covers fascinating material. Take it if it is with a good professor. Otherwise don't bother unless you have to. Instead just read the book.",
    "Take it if you want to understand how the nervous system works in a holistic sense. But it is really boring and a lot of memorization.",
    "This is a very interesting class and a must take for all neuroscience track majors. It gives a broad overview of all areas of neuroscience and if you take it at the same time as a bio course, there is a lot of overlapping so you remember the material better. Lectures can be boring so do your best to stay awake. A lot to study when test time comes but no final!",
    "I really loved this class, but that's because I was into the material to the extent that a non-psych major, non-science person could be. I wanted to find out about the brain, and this was one of the few classes that would let me do so this semester. It was a great science credit -- no section, no homework, no psets. Just a lot of cramming before exams! Lecture could be a little dull, just attend on principle so that you can get more in your head before the exam.",
    "Definitely recommend, but make sure you're interested in the material. Very challenging, but totally worth it, especially with this professor.",
    "Prepare to cram a lot of irrelevant neural pathways into your head right before the exam and not remember any of them afterwards. This is a memorization class. Don't be fooled by how cool the first lecture (on consciousness) may seem.",
    "Yea I think it's good for the Psych major.",
    "Great introductory course to neuroscience. A lot of memorization and some understanding, but the midterms were fair.",
    "4 exams total (one like every two weeks). No final. One extra credit homework opportunity. Exam questions pretty detailed, but memorize the slides and you should probably be fine (as long as you memorize them well and don\u0092t miss anything). Don\u0092t miss lectures that show movies; there are questions about them on the exam.",
    "Godo course if you want to know about the brain. Not a gut. Exams are tough, alot of material.",
    "Only take this class if you're really, really interested in Neuroscience. The professor will kill the material for you--just memorize every single power point slide and you'll be okay on the tests. Read the book so that you maintain your interest in the material, but do not expect to enjoy or be interested in lectures.",
    "he was a little dry and monotonous, but as long as you take a nap before class, you'll be able to stay alert! try your best to make it to lecture since that's the material he will put on the tests. other than that Prof Brown is a really nice guy and helpful!!! :)it was a lot of memorization, but none of it was too difficult. he goes over most of the material in lecture, so just pay attention!! i found it pretty hard to get A's on the tests but if you really study a lot it should be fine!LASTLY, make sure you understand what the TAs are saying- sometimes they send mixed messages, or dont pronounce things correctly."
