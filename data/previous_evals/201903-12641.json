    "Strengths: students learn about the key methods and questions developed in the field. The homework assignments are extremely helpful in guiding the student through the methods and implementation details. Both professors are effective communicators. weakness: I believe students would benefit if professors could provide more feedback on the homework assignments. For instance, the professors could briefly tell the students what was clearly wrong and what could have fixed it. Maybe the instructors could provide some sort of solution document, containing the main issues students were expected to confront while implementing the assignment.",
