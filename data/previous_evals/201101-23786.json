    "An amazing class which I would definitely recommend to anyone!!",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a fascinating class exploring how food and health topics are at play in everyday society. If you are interested in the intersection of food and health, and you are curious to view the issues from many backgrounds, take this class.",
    "Yes, very important issues revolving food that definitely needs to be heeded, which is usually taken for granted.",
    "This course studies the anthropology of food through interdisciplinary perspectives, including from public health, biological, physical, and cultural anthropology. I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in global and national food systems and the underlying cultural and biological significance of these systems. This was a truly phenomenal class.",
    "A good class if you want to think and learn more about what food means, especially for health.Much more focused on food than health as such."

    "I learned many things that I was unfamiliar with and took my research in this area to a whole new level!!",
    "As an MBA student, this class was more for my personal interest and relevant to the industry I want to work in after graduation. It was wonderful in preparing me on topics important in health\/sustainable food industry.",
    "Anthropology of food in relation to globalization, health, cultural change and agriculture development.",
    "This course has greatly informed my interest in public health as it provided a new lens through which to study nutritional patterns and individual behavior. It emphasized the importance of using anthropological research as the foundation of understanding global public health, which is often not practiced. I hope to not only use some of the articles we studied in class in the future as well as more broadly to apply these anthropological perspectives in my nutrition research."
