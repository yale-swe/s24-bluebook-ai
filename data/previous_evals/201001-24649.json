   "comments": [
    "Agnew is incomprehensible. Skip it and save yourself the headaches.",
    "It was more challenging for me because I have no background in the artistic, political and cultural movements of New York in the 20th Century but that is why I wanted to take it as a New Yorker.",
    "Extremely interesting overview of 20th century New York culture. It's a pretty diverse offering, so some weeks you will be fascinated and other weeks you will be lost, but overall it's very cool. You may feel left out if you do not have a good knowledge of New York to begin with. Not much work, except for a big final project, but it's on a topic of your choice, and you will feellike you have actually accomplished something you can be proud of.",
    "This seminar was neither history nor about New York; it was a survey of various cultural movements that arose in New York in the 20th century. In that sense, it did not meet my expectations and was simply not the course I thought it would be. The title is alluring, but pay close attention to the syllabus before decide whether you actually want to take this course.",
    "I think this class is a good class to take if you are at all interested in New York City race and gender during the 20th century.",
    "i liked the class, but it was pretty disjointed...reading for one night didnt apply to another class. i really learned some interesting stuff but i did not feel like there was a takeaway from the entire class, and i kind of wish there was",
    "Based simply on the strength of the syllabus and Professor Agnew's guidance through it, this is one of the strongest classes I've taken in my four years at Yale. Every essay, every book, every screening, fit perfectly into the arc of the syllabus--giving a great overview of culture in New York, be it through a week focusing on the rise of Rockefeller Center or early (pre-Harlem Renaissance) theater among African-Americans.I was interested in the history of New York City and I found the close examination of the art scene extremely interesting. This is certainly not a politically focused class so don't take it if you expect that. Expect to expand your knowledge of art history (from music and dance to architecture) as it interacts with the social history of New York City.Absolutely take it!",
    "I would recommend this class. The workload is made manageable because instead of a weekly reading response, students are assigned one week to write a short paper and lead the class discussion. This made it possible for students to focus on what was most interesting to them.",
    "This seminar provided a great look into the various movements, ideas and figures that helped constitute New York Modern. Professor Agnew pulled together a solid reading and multimedia list and was enthusiastic and helpful throughout the semester, especially when it came to final papers. Unfortunately, class discussions were lacking many weeks, which seemed to be largely due to the fact that students did not come prepared to class having done the readings\/seen the films and were free to use laptops in seminar (often for purposes not related to class). The student presentations at the start of seminar were also sometimes painful to sit through. I would still recommend the class, though hopefully it is composed of more committed students next time around."
