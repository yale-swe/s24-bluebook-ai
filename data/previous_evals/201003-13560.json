    "Tomlinson is fantastic; the readings and subject matter are interesting, and there's not a lot of work (especially if you keep up with the readings from week to week), but Tomlinson really makes it worthwhile.",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend this class if it were called the \"Origins of Music\" again because we never really got to the origins of music. We talked about the structure of music and language and about different theories of evolution that might give us a clue as to how music is what it is today. But I felt like we were left on a cliffhanger at the end. No one, including the Professor, really knows the answer to the question that the class claimed to be addressing, and our attempts to find an answer I felt were based much more in language than in music. However, there were a lot of interesting (yet a bit dry) archaeological readings that exposed many of us to subjects with which we were not familiar. If you want to learn about modern evolutionary theory as applied to cultural institutions, you might like this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It draws from a wide range of disciplines (linguistics, archaeology, anthropology, music theory, evolutionary biology, cognitive science, etc.) to form very complex and sophisticated models of how the human capacity for music developed. Professor Tomlinson is great. He tends to dominate seminar discussions, but provides a unique viewpoint on the subject matter. Some issues may become convoluted, and in the long run you may have a hard time summarizing what you learn to others, but the course demonstrates a rich variety of angles from which people cananalyze theories about the origins of music. My only critique is that this should really be a yearlong course, with the first semester dedicated to the evolution of language and symbolic cognition, and the second devoted to a closer analysis of the origins of music. Partway through the course, I felt that we were straying too far from music, but it all came together by the end."
