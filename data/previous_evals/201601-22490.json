   "comments": [
    "A difficult, theoretical, course that will set you up well for those frequent discussions we always have about statistical mechanics.",
    "This class teaches fundamental equations and derivations of classical and statistical thermodynamics. I would recommend this course to another student because the analyses and techniques taught in the class go beyond thermodynamics and are applicable to other research areas.",
    "To anyone wishing to fulfill the CEE requirement, yes. But sarcasm aside, the class was helpful in expanding beyond undergrad thermo and being introduced to statistical thermodynamics. However, I would not recommend this course to someone without basic thermo background.",
    "This course is very challenging and gives a thorough discussion of chemical engineering thermodynamics. I would hesitate to recommend it to another student because of the challenging problem sets and subject matter.",
    "It is a detailed course on Thermodynamics with appropriate work load but as many topics are covered, it is taught at a higher pace.",
    "I would only recommend this to a student with a fairly rigorous understanding of thermodynamics and\/or statistical mechanics. There is very little introduction to basic\/introductory topics in this course.",
    "I would say yes and no. Since I am a mechanical engineering major student, some of the materials covered are very new to me. Nevertheless I gained a lot from this course."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Classical thermodynamics covered the fundamental topics very well, and covered at a level that most students should be able to appreciate in their research. Statistical mechanics, I do no see the connection to research other than the topics discussed directly in lectures.",
    "My dissertation\/research is not focused on thermodynamics, so the applicability of this class to my work is limited.",
    "The course covered polymer physics models like the lattice gas model which was useful in understanding parts of my research. Thermodynamics is useful and present in most research, but I don't know whether I would be contributing to this specific theoretical field with my studies.",
    "This course gave a good perspective on thermodynamics as it relates to Chemical Engineers. I struggled to understand the course material at the pace it was presented and so it is hard for me to say how much it deepened my understanding or how well it will contribute to my future research. I think I will grow in my understanding of the material in the coming months as I have more time to process the subject matter and see it displayed in situations outside the classroom.",
    "I did not have much knowledge in statistical thermodynamics, so it was a good course covering both classical & statistical thermodynamics.",
    "I do feel like I have a better understanding of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics after taking this course, but I have to admit that I endured a lot of confusion throughout a large portion of the class. My research is very unrelated to thermodynamics, so it didn't really contribute to my understanding of my research.",
    "I am not experienced enough to answer this question. I haven't encountered situation where statistical thermo. becomes useful for my research yet."
