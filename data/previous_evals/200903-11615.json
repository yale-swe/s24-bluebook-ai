   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. It was really nice to have this class in my schedule because it's lots of fun and offered a break from lectures, which can get boring.",
    "This class was fun. We did something different every day and it was a nice surprise to find out what we were going to do each day. Tania is really nice and helpful. It's a little intimidating at first since you only speak in Portuguese from day 1. But after a week or so it gets much easier. The work load is very small and definitely manageable.",
    "Portuguese 110 was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Yale. It wasn't too much work, but we learned a LOT. Tania is phenomenal. She is enthusiastic, patient, energetic and creative, and uses many forms of media to teach us. We used a textbook but also watched movies and short clips, listened to Brazilian and Portuguese music, read news articles and Brazilian legends, and even got to travel to Danbury to interview Brazilian and Portuguese immigrants. Take this class if you want a positive, low-key but immensely educational language course. Note to people unsure whether they should take Portuguese for Romance Language Speakers or not: Out of my class of 7 people, 6 of us had taken or are majoring in a romance language, and Tania knew this. I can't imagine there is too much of a difference between this section and the more \"advanced\" section.",
    "I'm in love with Tania. You'll know what I mean if you take this class.",
    "Yes. If you're strong with another Romance language, however, you should definitely take PORT 112 as the pace of this class can be a little slow."
