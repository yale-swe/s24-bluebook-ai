   "comments": [
    "No I wouldn't recommend it",
    "Good course if interested in development and specifically application of econometrics to development topics.",
    "It was good, but better for taking after the completion of at least one econometrics course.",
    "The final paper is the main draw for this course. For anyone want to do research in development then I would say go for itBut for someone wanting to learn about the development literature I would hesitate in recommending it",
    "n\/a , for ide students only",
    "It's easier to read paper alone, the class is too slow - I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "The best thing was the development paper at the end which is a great assignment that teaches you a lot.",
    "Econ 732 allows one to delve into a research subject of interest. Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but I think for a student to make most of it, they should be self-motivated in topics and self-disciplined to stay on schedule.",
    "Econ 732 is a survey of the main topics in development. Topics are examined through readings of and discussions about some of the most cited papers in development economics. The course is highly recommended for those hoping to develop a critical eye for econometric analyses, and those looking for exposure to the primary development literature. Students in the class should be familiar with econometrics.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend economics 732 01 to any master level students who are interested in development economics issues. The course gives students a chance to actually write a paper of their own interest. This way, the student will have the chance to really understand a specific development issue very well and also start applying econometrics skills learned in other courses in real use. I personally found the paper experience very satisfying.",
    "Yes, I recommend this class to students who are interested in development, since it is a good one for them to start figuring out what they are going to research in the future",
    "This is a great class to take if you want the opportunity to get your feet wet with research. I would not recommend this class to students with no econometrics\/STATA background, as it\u0092s a prereq to understanding\/enjoying the readings."

   "comments": [
    "Gave me some ideas for areas I would like to study further.",
    "This course was good, but I prefered to take this course after the econometrics course is completed.",
    "See above answers",
    "yes, i did an interesting paper",
    "research for the Paper (course requirement) did, but the course was not necessary for this.",
    "The assignment at the end was good for enhancing understanding",
    "Econ 732 allows one to delve into a research subject of interest, related to development (economics).Along the way of writing up a research paper, it gives incentives to students to study other literatures in the field of interest and explore many techniques to study the topic. Writing a research paper was a very valuable experience, in the hindsight.",
    "Didn't contribute much.",
    "This course has deepened my knowledge of development economics because it allowed me the first chance to write an original academic paper. To accomplish this task, I read many papers relevant to my area of interest and horned my econometric modelling skills. These are very important to my future career endeavors in the field of economic development.",
    "I learned a lot from class, also I learned from writing my term paper, which is a good practise to understand the course.",
    "I feel that we couldve covered the material in greater depth",
    "It gave me a better understanding of academic research, which is important for future graduate work."
