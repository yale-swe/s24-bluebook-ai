   "comments": [
    "Dave is the best!!!!!! One of the most accomplished, yet humble, individuals I know.",
    "I would recommend this course to another classmate. Make sure to keep up with the work.",
    "Take it if he ever offers it again. Dave is that professor you always hope to find when walking into a seminar on the first day. He teaches the class for fun and holy waffle irons is it a romp in the meadow of neurosurgery.",
    "YES!!!! BEST CLASS EVER!!!! This class might not be offered in the future, but any student reading this should reach out to Dave Gimbel as a mentor. He goes above and beyond to help Yale students.",
    "Dave is such an extraordinary asset to the Yale community. If he ever offers this class again and you can get in, TAKE IT! He will make even the most dull material interesting, and his presentation of the cases was always engaging. There was only a midterm paper, a presentation, and a final paper - no exams!",
    "Everyone I know knows that I am in this class because I just can't stop talking about it. I would recommend this class to everyone. Even if they aren't at all interested in medicine, they should take the class just to get the chance to be taught by Dave.",
    "Absolutely. The class material is tough, but you're never tested on it, so you really learn what you want. The papers and projects are really rewarding, and the workload in between is essentially non-existent. I was kind of confused by the course at first, but really enjoyed it in the end.",
    "Definitely take the class if you're interested in going into medicine, regardless of whether or not you want to do neurology or surgery, because the best part of the class was discussing the consequences of procedures and really learning to take a patients wishes and quality of life into account when thinking about treatments, makes it a really interesting class.",
    "CSMC 310 is a very intriguing course that succeeds in presenting a very complex concept in a way that is easier to understand. The more you put into the course, the more you get out of it. Therefore, doing the readings and taking detailed notes will be very beneficial to anyone taking this course. Since lectures tend to build off of one another, it is essential to attend as many as possible.",
    "If this class is offered again, it's definitely worth taking. You learn quite a bit about neurosurgery (a topic I'm sure doesn't come up much) and it comes with the opportunity to get to know Dave (and other stuff, like learning about medical cases and watching a surgery).",
    "Learned so much about medicine and the brain and disorders, etc. It was so practical and useful for people who want to be a doctor but also interesting and fun for those who don't.",
    "Take the class. Especially if you're interested in neurosurgery or medicine.",
    "Yes, If you are interested in neurosurgery, medical procedures, or even just being a doctor, take this class.",
    "YES! I absolutely loved this course. EVERYONE should take this, best course I've taken at Yale.",
    "If this course is ever offered again by David Gimbel, do yourself a favor and take it. He is a great professor and an awesome person to know around campus. The class is also awesome, especially if you're even remotely interested in the brain. And if you're not, I promise by the end of this class you will be."
