    "Yes, highly recommended.",
    "Great class for diving into Chinese Painting. Enough students in the class were new to the topic, so the class wasn't at all intimidating. The pacing was very appropriate, and the reading was not too heavy. Sensabaugh is very knowledgeable and great at drawing themes together in a cohesive manner. My only complaint is that I sometimes wish there was more time for discussion."
