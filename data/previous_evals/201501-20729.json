   "comments": [
    "This is a fun class! The workload is very reasonable and as long as you read the papers and participate in class, you'll do great. You get out of it what you put in--take advantage of it!",
    "This class is definitely for someone interested in learning chemical biology in a discussion-based setting. The course will require reading primary literature in the field and being able to interpret and analyze the work. I would highly recommend this course because it allows the student to interact directly with the professor and the fellow classmates in a way that is not normally presented in a lecture style class. It will also prepare the student to read advanced and specialized subject matter, which is essential for advancement through research.",
    "It is a nice course for people interested in chemical synthesis and drug development.",
    "This is an absolutely outstanding course. This is how science should be taught - in seminar format with students of all different backgrounds and trainings.",
    "It is a great class were you can learn about recent advances in medicinal chemistry mainly.",
    "Decent class, learned a lot. Worth taking. Fairly easy",
    "Yes - supremely interesting and topical papers, with a course format that allows for a lot of discussion to fall to the discretion of the students."

    "With the intention to apply synthetic organic chemistry to cancer research, this class was very useful for my current and long-term research plans. In addition to teaching me about the biology and pathways underlying the disease, it familiarized me with general tips and tricks known in med chem and pharma, industries I plan to work with closely in my professional career. Finally, the experience reading biological, med chem, and other papers will enable me to do research on my own and know how to read figures, SI, and details specific to those fields.",
    "I felt that the course helped with being able to read primary literature effectively and being able to interpret experiments and results conducted by researchers, which is beneficial in many science disciplines and professions. It also exposed me to many chemical biology methods and experiments that I was not exposed to before.",
    "Coming from a non-chemistry background, this was a incredibly useful to learn chemistry in an applied biological and pharmacological sense. If nothing else, the course will be very useful in directing my research interests in the future."
