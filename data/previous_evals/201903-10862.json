    "Very solid fundamentals of private equity and finance in general.",
    "This course serves as a good overview to the PE industry and also corporate finance in general. I found it especially useful for picking up some of the jargon and metrics most commonly used in the industry.",
    "High-level overview of the structure, function and goals of PE firms and investors. The course is very demanding and requires a good bit of time and attention to understand the nitty gritty concepts that are discussed. All topics are interesting and engaging, spanning from corporate law to investment frameworks.",
    "Hidden amidst the classrooms of WLH is a boardroom of a grizzled and successful private equity firm. This class will develop insights and instinct for learning to evaluate investments, operate in a business environment and leading. Excellent course.",
    "Comprehensive review of late-stage private equity, covering investment strategies and company evaluation. Learned how debt and equity instruments work in tandem to make up companies.",
    "The class gives a good overview of the private equity industry and Michael offers insightful industry experience and comments. However, this is NOT a modeling course yet many of his case studies requires a model. If you have not done a finance internship that has taught you how to build a model, I would not recommend taking the course, even credit\/D. All in all, he doesnt really offer comments on your models so dont expect to get better at excel but you do conceptually understand cash flow and party roles better.",
    "A broad knowledge of corporate finance and private equity.",
    "learnt better private equity investing framework."

   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses. Fantastic professor, great textbook, and solid organization if you put in the work, everything comes together at the end.",
    "Prof. Schmertzler is very knowledgeable and clearly wants everyone to learn. The content and his knowledge are definitely the highlights. That being said, his style is not for everyone. Course assignments are a lot less structured than you are probably used to in other classes and it can be hard to tell what exactly he wants. I think that can be a useful learning experience in and of itself but is certainly something to keep in mind.",
    "This is not a hand-holding course. You are expected to read and learn the material from the book and to apply it in class. This is both a strength and a weakness, depending on your learning style, but is far closer to the real world work environment than anything else I have experienced in college.",
    "I enjoyed how taking the course felt similar to doing work in the real world. More feedback and actually turning in assignments could help motivate students better.",
    "Extremely high work load, very self-guided, highly biased towards people with some prior knowledge, a lot of rote memorizations of incredibly specialized language (which is less the fault of the class and more reflective of finance)",
    "Amazing prof with tremendous experience and knowledge. Teaches at a very high level that may be hard to comprehend at times."

   "comments": [
    "Don't believe the scary reviews. If you had a summer internship in i-banking or in PE, you'll do fine here. Highly recommend taking corporate finance at the SOM first. He's a very cool guy and you will learn a ton. Workload get pretty chill after the first half of the course after you understand what he wants to see.",
    "For people who intend to work in finance at some point in their lives: YES, absolutely! But put in the work, and take this class seriously, even when it gets tough.",
    "I would take it if you want to be thrown into the deep end on corporate finance and PE and learn by trying to stay afloat. I definitely learned a lot from this course and I liked Prof. Schmertzler's style but I understand that it is not for everyone. The workload is heavy primarily due to the long readings but the assignments themselves are manageable.",
    "Yes, especially if working in finance in the future or if at all interested in pursuing a career in finance. This course is incredibly hard but well worth the time and effort. The concepts are extremely important and are too often disregarded. Must be willing to put in the time to do well and understand some of the more difficult topics, otherwise it is far too easy to fall behind. Do not be afraid to ask questions or speak out in class.",
    "Yes. If you are curious or seriously considering a career in Private Equity, this will give you a very good idea of what it's like from an industry veteran.",
    "Yes, take this course if you're interested in seeing how to apply microeconomic and accounting principles to examples of firms in the real world.",
    "If you are looking for a really challenging intro to corporate finance then maybe.",
    "Yes. Useful for going into buyside in the future."
