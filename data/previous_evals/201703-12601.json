    "The course covered a number of important topics in the area of sociology of education. These include: social and cultural capital, status attainment, inequality, teachers, advisors, schools, race, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES).",
    "I learned so much about how to approach concepts of education with a sociological mindset! Which is so much more quantitative than anything education-related I've ever studied before.",
    "This course provided an overview of the field. It provided a good working understanding of the most important texts and authors, and general working themes. It was organized well and gave a great intro to each topic we discussed. The weekly summaries are helpful to reflect back on for future projects as well.",
    "I got a good overview of key sociological studies related to education. The course covered the educational process from early childhood to college and graduation and various topics that intersect with education such as race and class.",
    "I developed a my skills at reading and interpreting sociological studies and writing summaries for such studies."

   "comments": [
    "The instructor, Professor Grace Kao, is truly outstanding. She is one of the finest instructors I have encountered in my academic career, which has included three master's degree programs. The readings and class discussions in a seminar format were excellent. These is no room for improvement in my estimation.",
    "Great class structure!",
    "Much of the course was spent doing student presentations. The seminar might have been more engaging if there was less emphasis on the student presentations. I would have liked to see a little bit of lecturing to make sure the material was understood.",
    "I enjoyed the materials covered in the course. I wish we had more time for open discussion about the topics.",
    "I think that the strength of this course is the content and the way that Prof Kao has organized the classes thematically. I wish that we had spent more time on discussion -- pretty much every class was spent just hearing from those who had summarized the week's readings, so if you weren't a presenter in class there wasn't much to do or say and it was easy to check out. While I do appreciate having a record of those studies now that we have the summaries on file, I wish that Prof Kao had been more intentional about making presenters keep their summaries short, or asking us to include discussion questions in our write-ups, and reserving time during class for us to discuss the studies in context."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course highly to any Yale student interested in the social sciences.",
    "Yes, this class is unlike all of the other Education Studies courses (I know it isn't listed as an Education Studies course, but it should be!). It is much more quantitative, and in that sense, it's nice to have knowledge of data to back up the concepts that I'm already familiar with. You will come away feeling like you have all this knowledge, and no one can prove you wrong if they try to, because you'll have the numbers as support!",
    "Anyone interested in sociology and education should take this course. The small size this year was good because we got to all really discus the material, but I hope that more people in the future take this course! There is so much to cover that a little depth is sacrificed for breadth, but each week gives a great intro to a new area of focus.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are even slightly interested in education or who want to know more about how education effects class and live prospects.",
    "Prof. Kao is a clear leader in the field and if you are interested in education this course will provide you with a basic awareness of educational research. I hope that in future years she changes the course format so that more time is spent on discussion and not just on summarizing the readings."
