    "The Professor: Alden is one of my favorite, if not my favorite professor here at Yale. He drives a few hours to be with his students every week and the thought and dedication that he puts into the class is incredible. He is incredibly flexible with the students, incredibly funny and kind as a professor and is one of those rare professors that you see as less of an instructor, per se, and as more of a mentor (which is what I want out of a professor). He brings snacks to each class, makes sure to know about each students life and career aspirations outside of the class, sets up office hours to meet with his students to not only ask how the class can be taught better but also to get to know the person behind the student, and takes students out to dinner to discuss the course and other musings. Wonderful professor students would be lucky if he decided to come back to teach. The Course: What a wonderful course. I came into this class worried that Id need some QR background because of the space component of the course. I had taken some space courses before and they all required some QR or Sc background, which I dont have, and this course doesnt require you to have one either. Its pure history of space travel, and speculations of the future of space. The best thing about this course is that Alden, or Space Cowboy, as he calls himself, is extremely versed in space in pop culture, and you get to watch space movies, look at vintage space magazines like Science Fiction. You come to class and discuss readings every week he brings snacks every time and throws a pizza party at the end. Theres one short paper, I think 4-6 pages, and one long final paper, 20 pages. This year, he allowed everyone who was really busy with finals to do a presentation and write a 2-page bullet point write-up of the presentation in lieu of the long final paper, which is a great trade and many in the class took advantage of. The course is so great; you get to talk about all different kinds of space travel. Im heavily considering going into this field now because I took this class and I cant say that about any other class Ive taken here.",
    "Probably take this class, just make sure you double check syllabus before buying the books... Didn't use two of the \"required\" books all semester.",
    "Definitely, and regardless of previous interest in space. If you're not already a space enthusiast, this class will make you one.",
    "This class was awesome. If you are at all into space, take this class. It will leave you feeling a bit pessimistic, but I think that's a good thing, as the class will break down a lot of the mythic qualities of the space industry, and you get to learn about how it acutlaly works. A lot of emphasis is placed on the early days of space travel, beginning in WW2 and continuing through the Cold War, and getting that historical perspective on the area was really cool. Professor Richards is also really cool, and tells a lot of fun stories about his time selling satellite insurance.",
    "Do not take this course. It is an utter waste of time. So much of a gut that I'm not even sure it counts as a class. Only come if you want to hear someone yammer on about famous people he knows. This isn't a history class.",
    "This class can be for anyone who is interested in learning more about space and the industry which surrounds it. Whether you're a novice to space and don't know anything or a space enthusiast who knows everything this class welcomes all who are willing to learn.",
    "CSES 340 was a terrific course that effectively surveyed the culture, politics, science, and economics of space and space exploration. Through a combination of readings, films, guest lectures, class discussions, and group presentations, we left no area of our topic unexplored. The workload was manageable and the assignmentsa short paper, a long final paper, and a group presentationwere enjoyable. I started the course broadly interested in the subject and came away with a far more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities of exploring space. In addition, Professor Richards was an excellent teacher and discussion leader who brought his love of the subject, years of experience in the satellite industry, and a great sense of humor to class. His deep familiarity with the culture, history, politics, economics, and science of space helped make the course a truly interdisciplinary experience. I particularly appreciated how he selected students from a diversity of departments (science, humanities, and social sciences) in assembling the class. In addition to his effective stewardship of the course, Professor Richards was incredibly generous with his time and wisdom. He was always willing to meet with students outside of class and offer advice about our assignments, careers, etc. In sum, a highly recommend course!!"
