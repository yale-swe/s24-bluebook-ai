    "Would thoroughly recommend this section of English 114 to another student. It is fun to get to know a group of people through the semester and improve your writing skills along the way. You also get to learn about cool stuff too like gadgets of the future and even Disney World! Don't miss out on this great class!",
    "Take it if you want to improve your writing skills. As simple as that. If you're nervous about writing papers for college, this course -- especially the section with the research paper -- will make writing long papers for other classes much easier.",
    "An okay class, but if you really wont to work on your writing skills maybe look for a class with more frequent writing assignments.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in learning how progress is defined economically, socially and technologically in modern American society. The course does not have a set structure or textbook and many of the readings are reports from a wide variety of sources. If one is interested in reading such varying types of articles from various sources, then this course is a great one to take.",
    "In this class I learned how to write proper academic essays in English. If you have significant exposure to academic English, don't take this."
