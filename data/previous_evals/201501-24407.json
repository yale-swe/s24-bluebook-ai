   "comments": [
    "You cover a lot of science, health, and medical topics in Spanish. I learned science as well as Spanish vocabulary.",
    "Essentially this course talks about different illnesses and treatments -- in spanish. Take this if you want a fun elective and are interested in medicine. Pretty straight forward.",
    "SPAN 225 is very well taught, interesting, and relevant to anyone interested in medicine or health. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was fun, educational, and interesting. I was excited to go to this class, even though it was early in the morning. Especially if you are interested in medicine, the topics we covered are extremely interesting and practical.",
    "You have to take this class. It is a wonderful, wonderful, easy class. It meets twice a week for 1 hr and 15 minutes, and each class there is a homework assignment due. She just posts a prompt and you write about 15 lines double spaced regarding the prompt, so it's not too much work. There's a ten page final paper in Spanish, on any topic you want. The grading is very easy - they grade you just based on grammar and spelling, not on sophistication of argument or content. You also don't have to participate. Very easy Spanish class, obviously you have to go to every class during shopping period to get in. She'll only admit juniors, seniors, and sophomores if you are an alumnus of one of her other classes (i.e. Legal Spanish). The best way to get into this course is email her a few weeks in advance if you are a freshman or sophomore and ask to be let in. She'll probably say yes. This is a gem. Take it if you are lucky enough to get in.",
    "if you can get in take it. one of the few L5 language classes that actually teaches you the language",
    "Great course - great way to learn about medical terms in Spanish and conversing with patients. 9 AM isn't great, but it's worth it for this course. Mercedes is awesome!",
    "'Tis not a course if you aren't interested in hard-core medicine. This course seems unnecessarily focused on medical jargon. I think the course would have been more helpful if we went beyond medical vocabulary and instead discussed big ideas in medicine and health systems. Also, the course is focused on rich-world diseases. It would be more enjoyable and mind-expanding if it also focused on global and public health issues-- which may be more useful and relevant for students interested in working in Latin America. Overall, more opportunities for choice would be nice. The final essay and oral presentation were great because we were able to choose our topics and fit them around our interests. More of this would be even better.",
    "Spanish is a fun, relaxed way to learn Spanish. If you put the work in you will come out a better speaker and will understand Spanish and medicine better.",
    "A class that you absolutely must take if you have the chance. It won't tax you too much and Mercedes is quite possibly the nicest professor you will take a class with. It's a nice, low-stress way to continue learning Spanish.",
    "Definitely take this course! The professor, course material, and workload is amazing.",
    "This course is great for students interested in learning about medicine and can speak at least level 4 Spanish. Even if it's unnecessary for you major it is extremely informative and worth taking.",
    "Pretty low course-load though there are regular homework assignments. An essay and a presentation will make up the bulk of the grade along with participation in class. The topics discussed in class are actually quite relevant to today's world and will really be interesting to those interested in studying medicine from an Hispanic context."
